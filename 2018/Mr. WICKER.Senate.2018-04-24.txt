 Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the  admirable career of Ms. Cynthia ``Cindy'' Stevens, a native  Mississippian whose success in business is accompanied by a lifelong  devotion to mentorship and public service.   After graduating from Mississippi State University, Cindy came to  Washington as an aide to Mississippi Congressman Sonny Montgomery. She  would go on to serve as his legislative director, helping to develop  policies that made our State and country better.   Diligence and a devotion to good governance continued in her next  role as the director of public affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,  where she worked on issues related to campaign finance and the  administration of election laws by Federal agencies. She then joined  the Washington Board of Trade, serving as a tireless advocate for the  business community.   A reputation for hard work and results has characterized Cindy's work  at the global accounting firm Deloitte since she started in 1993 as a  member of the support staff for its east coast litigation support  services. She was quickly promoted to risk support management and rose  to become a principal in government relations, overseeing legislative  affairs at the State and local  [[Page S2386]]  levels. She led Deloitte's efforts to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act, and her collaboration with the strategy groups of other Big Four  firms helped meet key legislative and regulatory agency objectives.   Cindy has been a role model to other female professionals throughout  her career. She was a mentor to my current chief of staff when she was  first starting her congressional career. Later at Deloitte, she  highlighted the achievements and talents of younger female employees to  her peers in other firms. She has also been instrumental in efforts to  elect women to Congress.   Cindy's own story of success as one of the highest ranking female  principals at Deloitte continues to inspire young women. She remains  active in organizations she supports, serving on the Mississippi State  Foundation Board of Directors, National Capital Multiple Sclerosis  Society Board, and the U.S. Chamber Public Affairs Committee.   I wish Cindy well in her retirement. I know she will continue to use  her talents and experience to benefit her community.                            ____________________
