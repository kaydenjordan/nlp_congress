 Mr. Speaker, cops, police, law enforcement--they are the  men and women in uniform who display bravery and courage while  protecting our citizens each and every day, and it is not without risk.   It is National Police Week, when officers and their families from  around the country have traveled here to Washington to remember their  loved ones and those who have given the ultimate sacrifice. In  Minnesota alone, there are 440 law enforcement agencies made up of  10,000 Minnesotans who put on their uniform every day, working  diligently to protect our communities.   Every year, new names, unfortunately, are added to the National Law  Enforcement Officers Memorial here in Washington. 129 officers were  killed in 2017. Sadly, one of those whom we honor and remember is  Officer Bill Matthews from Wayzata, Minnesota.   I thank our police and law enforcement, Mr. Speaker, for their  service and providing that thin blue line for protecting and for  serving.                            ____________________
