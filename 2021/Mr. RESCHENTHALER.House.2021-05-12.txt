 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I want to thank the distinguished gentleman, my good friend  from Colorado, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   The rule before us today provides for consideration of two pieces of  legislation. The first bill, H.R. 1065, would create a stand-alone law  requiring employers to provide accommodations to known limitations  related to pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions.    Republicans have long supported antidiscrimination legislation,  including protections for pregnant workers. We agree pregnant workers  should be protected and accommodated in the workplace. However, it is  disappointing that the Education and Labor Democrats absolutely refuse  to work with committee Republicans to include a longstanding provision  protecting religious organizations from being forced to make employment  decisions that conflict with their faith. I really hope that moving  forward, my colleagues across the aisle will actually work with  Republicans and help protect religious liberty.   The rule also makes in order H.R. 2547, the Comprehensive Debt  Collection Improvement Act, a collection of eight Financial Services  bills that claim to address the debt collection practices and the  problems thereof in the U.S. economy. But in reality, this measure is  just the latest step in House Democrats' socialist takeover of our  country's financial system.   Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, consumers are already  protected from harmful debt collection practices. While Democrats claim  H.R. 2547 is necessary due to the economic effects of COVID-19, several  of these partisan bills were introduced last Congress prior to the  pandemic.   It is absolutely clear that my colleagues across the aisle are using  the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to dismantle our free market system  and force their radical, progressive agenda on the American people.   Instead of actually helping consumers, H.R. 2547 will increase  healthcare costs and make credit more expensive for borrowers. In fact,  under this legislation, the lowest income borrowers may be pushed out  of the system entirely.   Further, H.R. 2547 will make it harder for small businesses, many of  which have been devastated by this pandemic. It will make it harder for  those small businesses to receive payments for services rendered.   Finally, H.R. 2547 undermines the CFPB's October 2020 final rule,  intended to modernize debt collection practices. This rule was the  result of more than 7 years of research and set forth guidelines for  both consumers and debt collectors on acceptable communications.   During committee consideration of this bill, Ranking Member McHenry  offered a substitute amendment to address bipartisan concerns with the  current financial framework. This commonsense proposal included  provisions to prevent debt collection harassment of servicemembers,  provide protection for cosigners in cases of death or permanent  disability, and prohibited the use of Social Security numbers by  consumer reporting agencies.   The majority, however, refused to work with Republicans. This refusal  is just the latest in the Democrats' disturbing ``my way or the  highway'' approach on issues where there is actually room for  bipartisan solutions.   House Republicans will continue to support policies that provide  Americans with access to affordable credit, while ensuring that our  financial system remains safe and sound.   I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this rule. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. Greene).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, you wouldn't know it from the Democrats' floor schedule,  but Sunday marked the beginning of National Police Week.   In 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed a proclamation designating  May 15 as Peace Officers Memorial Day, and the week in which that date  falls as Police Week.   Throughout this week, our Nation honors and pays tribute to law  enforcement officers who made the ultimate sacrifice to keep our  country and our communities safe.   When Republicans controlled the House, we marked this week by moving  legislation to support our police officers and help them keep our  communities safe. In stark contrast, this liberal, progressive majority  is not moving a single bill to support law enforcement during this  year's Police Week.   Instead, Democrats are choosing to ignore Police Week, even though  2020 was the deadliest year on record for police officers in 50 years;  even though, barely 1 month ago, Capitol Police Officer Billy Evans, a  father of two, was killed defending this very building in which we  stand; and even though more police officers have been shot and killed  in the first 4\1/2\ months of 2021 than in all of 2020 and 2019.    I guess that is not surprising coming from the party that has openly  attacked our law enforcement officers and called for defunding,  dismantling, and abolishing the police.   Don't believe me? Just take their word for it.   Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib tweeted: ``Policing in our country is  inherently and intentionally racist.'' The Congresswoman then went on  and said: ``No more policing, incarceration, and militarization.''   Congresswoman Cori Bush called St. Louis' decision to eliminate $4  million from the city's police budget a ``historic'' move that ``marks  a new future for our city.''   Then there is Chairwoman Maxine Waters, chairwoman of the Financial  Services Committee, who tweeted, and I read the tweet verbatim:  ``Police reform is not enough. Getting rid of serial, racist, ignorant,  and stupid cops must be a top priority. Let's call them out.''   Not only is this disrespectful to the men and women who put their  lives on the line every day to protect our communities, but it is  actually dangerous. The stats speak for themselves. In Democrat-run  cities that defunded the police, they have seen increases in crime.  Let's look at some of the numbers.   Austin, Texas: They cut funding for police by $150 million. In  return, they saw a 50 percent spike in homicides.   Los Angeles: L.A. defunded the police by $175 million. They, too,  experienced an increase in crime, an 11.6 percent rise in homicides.   Then, there is New York City. New York City cut police funding by $1  billion, that is billion with a B. In return, New York City saw a 97  percent rise in shootings and a 45 percent increase in homicides. Let  me repeat that for you because the stats are so alarming: a 97 percent  increase in shootings and a 45 percent increase in homicides.   Mr. Speaker, House Republicans support law enforcement officers and  want to help them do their jobs safely, effectively, and  professionally. That is why if we defeat the previous question, I will  offer an amendment to the rule to consider Congressman   Don Bacon's  Back the Blue Act, Congressman   John Rutherford's Protect and Serve  Act, and Congressmen McCaul, Cuellar, and Chabot's Jaime Zapata and  Victor Avila Federal Law Enforcement Protection Act. Let's talk about  each one of those bills.   The Back the Blue Act would protect our police officers by making it  a Federal crime to kill or assault a Federal law enforcement officer.   The Protect and Serve Act would create enhanced penalties for anyone  who targets law enforcement officers and purposefully harms them.   The Jaime Zapata and Victor Avila Federal Law Enforcement Protection  Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation, would ensure individuals who  harm or attempt to harm U.S. Federal officers or employees serving  abroad can be brought to justice and prosecuted here in the United  States.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Nehls). He is here to explain this amendment. He is my  good friend and a former law enforcement officer.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, my good friend from Colorado was talking about money in  the American Rescue Plan and money going to States and how that is  being used. Let's be clear about something.   California was actually running a surplus in their budget, yet that  didn't stop them from taking the money from the American Rescue Plan  and giving that not to the police, but to illegal immigrants.   And there is this myth out there that Democrats really don't want to  defund the police. I would say that it is not a myth. They actually do  want to defund and dismantle the police. But don't take my words for  it. We can take the words of my liberal colleagues, the Democrats.   Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, when reacting to Mayor Bill  de Blasio's plan to cut one-sixth of New York City's Police Department  budget, she actually deemed that as insufficient. And I will quote my  colleague: ``Defunding the police means defunding police. It doesn't  mean budget tricks or funny math.''   Again, that was my colleague from New York, a Democrat. Her words,  not mine.   Representative Cori Bush, when celebrating St. Louis defunding their  police force, despite consistently ranking as one of the most dangerous  cities in the United States, to that my colleague said: ``Today's  decision to defund the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department is  historic. It marks a new future for our city.''   Well, my colleague might be half correct because it was historic. It  did usher in a new future for that city, and that is the fact that you  have crime rates rising to historic levels.   My colleague from Missouri continued and she also said: ``If we  remove that''--meaning the funding from the police, if we cut police  funding--``and take that money and put it into our education system,  put it into making sure our unhoused community members are sheltered,  putting it into mental health resources, that is what we are saying  because that is what is going to make our communities safer.''   So please stop the myth that Democrats actually don't want to defund  the police. They absolutely do. They have said it over and over again,  and their policies have proven it in many cities.   And what do the American people get?   Increased crime rates.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Rutherford), my good friend and a former sheriff.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Colorado is asking why we are talking  about the police. Well, the Democrats have been doing a lot of talking  about police themselves--lots of talking about police.   Representative Ilhan Omar, in talking about the Minneapolis Police  Department following the death of George Floyd, said: ``You can't  really reform a department that is rotten to the root.''   So, again, we are talking about police because police are heroes. We  have always stood with the police, as Republicans. I wish my Democrat  colleagues could say the same. But they have said repeatedly throughout  the summer, in the past, atrocious things about the police.  [[Page H2232]]    Chairwoman Maxine Waters, in response to the death of Rayshard  Brooks, who tried to shoot officers with their own tasers during an  attempted DUI arrest, said: ``Police reform is not enough. Getting rid  of serial racist, ignorant, and stupid cops must be a top priority.  Let's call them out. Police protective unions, you have got to go,  too.''   The attacks go on and on, on our law enforcement. After the death of  Daunte Wright, following a physical struggle where an officer fired  their service weapon instead of the intended taser, Representative  Rashida Tlaib said: ``Policing in our country is inherently and  intentionally racist.''                                time  1500    Representative Tlaib has also said: ``No more policing,  incarceration, and militarization. It can't be reformed.''   Again, this is what Democrats say about police.   And I know my colleague from Colorado said he supports police, but in  response to riots across the country surrounding the death of George  Floyd, my good friend from Colorado said: ``Supporting Representative  Pressley's resolution to condemn all acts of police brutality, racial  profiling, and excessive use of force is the first step, but an  important step, in affecting change and working to end these  injustices.''   That sounds very benign, and understandably so. But if you look at  the support for what the resolution actually said, let's read what the  resolution said.   ``The system of policing in America and its systemic targeting of and  use of deadly and brutal force against people of color, particularly  Black people, stems from the long legacy of slavery, lynching, Jim Crow  laws, and the war on drugs in the United States.''   So, in essence, supporting that resolution is really linking modern  police to the horrors of slavery and Jim Crow. It is absolutely  unacceptable.   Again, it was a Democrat, it was JFK in 1962, who declared this week  Police Week. I just wish the current Democratic Party could stand with  the Republicans and honor police, especially memorialize police who  have died defending our communities and our country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr.  Bacon), my good friend the former general.    Mr. Speaker, I would ask how much time each side  has remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, it is relevant, these three police bills, because, as I  said  [[Page H2233]]  when I opened, if we defeat this previous question, I will bring forth  the amendment personally to bring up these three bills that actually  honor our police officers.   Again, it is a historical norm in this body, in this Chamber, that  during Police Week we focus on bills to help police officers. That is  why this is relevant today. And the fact that my Democrat colleagues  refuse to talk about the police raises a lot of questions. We need to  help the police.   Let me just give you one example of the heroic acts of the police.  After a suicidal man drove off a bridge into an ocean, San Diego Police  Department K-9 officer, Jonathan Wiese, sprung into action, scaling  down the side of a cliff to rescue twin 2-year-old sisters who were  caught inside the vehicle.   When asked about this decision to throw himself over a cliff, Officer  Wiese explained: ``I didn't do this job to be liked every day. I didn't  do it to become rich. I did it because I wanted to be out there making  a difference and helping people.''   That is the mentality of the men and women who are in our law  enforcement. That is why this week they deserve our attention, and that  is why my colleagues should be afforded the right to bring up their  three bills through an amendment.   Mr. Speaker, while the rest of the Nation recognizes National Police  Week and shows gratitude for the men and women keeping our communities  safe, House Democrats are prioritizing two pieces of legislation that  do absolutely nothing, nothing to help law enforcement officers.   Instead, they are jamming through a socialist takeover of our  country's financial system that will actually hurt consumers and our  Nation's small businesses. That is why I urge my colleagues to vote  ``no'' on the previous question, and I urge ``no'' on the underlying  measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 212,  nays 206, not voting 12, as follows:                               [Roll No. 135]                                 YEAS--212       Adams      Aguilar      Allred      Axne      Barragan      Bass      Beatty      Bera      Beyer      Bishop (GA)      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bonamici      Bourdeaux      Bowman      Boyle, Brendan F.
