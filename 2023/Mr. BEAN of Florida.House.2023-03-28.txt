 Mr. Chair, the question is: Is America's economy  on the right track?   Eighty percent of Americans believe we are headed in the wrong  direction.   In just 2 years, we have gone from being the world's leading energy  exporter to a dependent energy importer. Since January 2021,  electricity is up 24 percent and gasoline is up 51 percent.   Mr. Chair, it doesn't have to be this way. The United States has the  resources, the know-how, and expertise to be, once again, an energy  independent nation and an exporter of energy. American energy is not  the enemy; it is the solution.   H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, is how we get America back on  track. For too long, Mr. Chair, we have handcuffed ourselves when it  comes to our oil and natural gas potential. I stand before you  committed to unleash America's energy independence but also to unleash  America's energy dominance.   Mr. Chair, a ``yes'' vote for H.R. 1 does just that.
