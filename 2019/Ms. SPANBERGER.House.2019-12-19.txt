 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Neal for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5430.   Last year, Virginia exported $4.3 billion worth of goods to Canada  and Mexico. One out of six Virginia manufacturers exports to these two  countries, and of these firms, 64 percent are small- or medium-sized  businesses.   These businesses are the backbone of our economy, and today they are  looking to Congress to take this vital step towards securing long-term  trade stability.    Earlier this month, I made that point clear at a meeting with the  vice president. During our discussion, I underscored the USMCA's  potential to stimulate growth across the Seventh District of Virginia.   For central Virginia businesses, today's vote is a welcome step  forward towards modernizing NAFTA and staying competitive in the 21st  century.   For Virginia's crop and livestock producers, today's vote means  protecting and expanding relationships with critical buyers in Canada  and Mexico.   And for central Virginia's workers, today's vote carries with it a  commitment from our trading partners to live up to their labor  commitments.   I know that central Virginia's economy and the hardworking men and  women who spur it forward have waited patiently for this day to arrive.   Madam Speaker, I thank everyone for their work on this: Mr. Chairman,  Mr. Ranking Member, Ambassador Lighthizer, and my colleagues on the  working group.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support USMCA.
