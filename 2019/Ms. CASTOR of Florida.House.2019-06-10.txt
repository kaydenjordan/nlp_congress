 Madam Speaker, after a number of years of  consecutive blue team victories, I am here to congratulate the red team  and my good friends Congressman LaHood and Congressman Bacon, the co- chairs of the Congressional Soccer Caucus.   Truly, the real winners are the kids across America, who we are able  to raise charity funds for, to help make sure that they can all  experience a beautiful game, the beautiful game of soccer.   The U.S. Soccer Foundation funds fields and equipment all across the  country, particularly in the underserved areas.   Madam Speaker, I invite everyone to join the soccer caucus and help  stand up for your kids back home.   I do have to say, on the eve of the Women's World Cup, with the  defending World Cup champions, the U.S. Women's National Team, there is  a little bit of girl power not only here in the House, but we intend to  repeat the win of the Women's World Cup.   Let's cheer them on and cheer on what they have done in standing up  for pay equity and equal treatment as role models for girls and young  women all across this country.                            ____________________
