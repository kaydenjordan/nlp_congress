 Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in honoring  those who have helped their communities to overcome challenges during  the COVID-19 pandemic.   There are many everyday heroes who deserve recognition. We have seen  the efforts of our first responders, law enforcement, teachers, postal  and delivery employees, and store workers, among others, who have  continued providing essential services in spite of the challenges  brought on by the coronavirus.   As the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations  Subcommittee, I have spoken many times about the critically important  work of our farmers and our ranchers.   I see I am joined here on the floor by our Agriculture Committee  chairman. I know he has been down here as well pointing out how our  farmers and ranchers are continuing to provide food, fuel, and fiber  for our Nation even during this pandemic. We are working to help and  support them during this challenging time. Every American benefits  every day from the work of those farmers and ranchers, who provide the  highest quality and lowest cost food supply in the world in tough times  and even in times when we face something like a pandemic.   Today, I would like to recognize the valiant efforts of the  healthcare professionals in my State and across this country and  highlight some of the work our North Dakotans are doing--doctors,  nurses, and many others working in hospitals and clinics across our  State.   North Dakota's healthcare professionals have been working around the  clock to prevent the spread of this virus and to treat those affected  by COVID-19.   One example is Dr. Chris Pribula, a graduate of the University of  North Dakota Medical School, who worked with a team to set up the COVID  Care Unit at Sanford Hospital in Fargo. He was on duty when the first  COVID patient arrived at the hospital and remained on duty for the next  18 days straight to make sure that staff and patients had everything  they needed.   Over the past several months, I have held a number of roundtables  with healthcare professionals in North Dakota. As we have discussed  issues and challenges, one thing is clear: Our healthcare providers are  diligent and dedicated in their efforts to prepare for and prevent the  spread of coronavirus and to provide patients with the best possible  care.   Another individual highlighted by his colleagues is Dr. Kremens, a  critical care physician at Essentia Health who intubated and managed  multiple critically ill patients at once. Dr. Kremens is a good example  of the many intensive care and emergency department physicians and  nurses who have fought on the frontlines of the pandemic and continue  to do so.   We are grateful for the dedicated service of the many healthcare  professionals in North Dakota and recognize that they and their loved  ones have made many sacrifices during this health emergency.   We worked to provide our health providers with much needed support in  the first three phases of the coronavirus relief legislation. For  example, under the CARES Act, North Dakota rural hospitals and  providers have received $135 million to help with their efforts to  combat COVID-19. As negotiations continue on the next phase of relief,  healthcare remains a top priority.   While our healthcare providers have been working diligently, I would  also like to recognize how members of our communities have stepped up  to help our medical professionals as well.   An example of the community stepping up to meet the challenge during  the pandemic is Proof Artisan Distillers, a small craft distillery in  Fargo, ND. Back in March, Proof Artisan Distillery responded to the  community need. Working with Tharaldson Ethanol in Casselton, ND, they  began producing sanitizer for healthcare, assisted living facilities,  first responders, Tribal and municipal entities, and highway patrols  from four neighboring States.   Proof Artisan Distillery's president, Joel Kath, relayed this story:         During our second day of production, I answered a frantic       call from a supply director of a large memory care group.       They were virtually out of sanitizer and would not be       resupplied through their normal channels for many weeks. The       caller broke down with emotion when I confirmed that we could       easily supply their needs. It's a response I will never       forget, and a constant reminder of the importance of our task       at hand.    Another example from my home State is Infinite Leap, a company  founded by Air Force veteran Mark Rheault that is using technology to  help healthcare providers offer virtual waiting rooms. Infinite Leap's  technology helps eliminate registration lines, reduce congestion in  waiting areas, and decrease patient waiting times. Not only is this  technology being utilized by healthcare providers to help maintain  social distancing, the technology is also helping other industries,  including restaurants and manufacturing plants, to safely reopen.   These are just a few examples of the individuals and organizations  that have stepped up and helped their communities to meet the  challenges during this health emergency.   Again, I thank our healthcare providers for their dedicated effort to  fight this virus. We recognize the challenges they face, and we are  truly grateful for their hard work. They are, in fact, truly everyday  heroes.   With that, I yield the floor.
