 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute as in morning business.    Mr. President, in honor of the Iowa Department of  Agriculture's Sweet Corn Days yesterday, I would like to highlight the  strong agricultural sector of my State of Iowa.   Many people don't know how you get from the seed to the corn on the  cob you are used to seeing on your dinner table. That is one reason,  particularly for city people, that I started the hashtag ``Corn Watch''  series on my Instagram.   Each week I post an update with the progress of how the crop is  growing on my farm in New Hartford, IA. It is a small way to show  nonfarmers how Iowa feeds and fuels the world.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
