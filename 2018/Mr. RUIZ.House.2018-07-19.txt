 Mr. Speaker, the United States Constitution defines Tribes  in our Nation as sovereign governments with a unique relationship with  the United States Federal Government. Many treaties and Supreme Court  cases show legal precedent that they are sovereign nations, and the  United States has a trust responsibility to ensure they have Social  Services like healthcare in exchange for taking their land.   The Trump administration is not recognizing the legal right Tribes  have. They are solely considering Tribes as a racial group as their  justification to impose Medicaid work requirements that we know will  disproportionately result in less healthcare for Native Americans. This  is wrong, illegal, and a dangerous precedent.   What happened to the treaties our government signed? What happened to  the Federal trust responsibility? And what other social and legal  responsibility will they negate next?   I will not stand by and watch the sovereignty of our Nation's first  people attacked, and neither should you, Mr. Speaker.                            ____________________
