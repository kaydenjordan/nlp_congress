 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the measure for  congressional disapproval of the Department of the Interior's stream  protection rule, which was created under the guise of protecting the  environment but, instead, has been very harmful to American jobs.   They have attempted to cripple an industry--energy--that has provided  vast amounts of energy to States across this country for decades. My  home State of California has had a long history of mining that has led  to incredible economic growth and job opportunities for many of my  local communities.   This one-size-fits-all approach fails to provide any regulatory  certainty to industry and denies important tax revenue from energy  extraction to the American taxpayer.   I appreciate my colleagues bringing this to the floor, and I hope we  can sort through the rhetoric on this against energy jobs of a very  important segment across the country that supplies so much of our  energy currently, and can do it with safety and a mind for redeveloping  our economy.    Madam Speaker, this week, House Republicans have  undertaken the effort to scale back some of the burdensome regulations  implemented by the previous administration.   The use of so-called midnight rules to slip in regulations at the  last minute and without congressional approval was a favorite tool of  the last President. Many of these regulations would negatively impact,  and have, American people by destroying their jobs, hamstringing our  economy, often for no good reason.   That is why, at the very start of the 115th Congress, we passed the  Midnight Rules Relief Act, which utilizes the Congressional Review Act,  to allow Congress to review multiple midnight rules en bloc.   Additionally, we now have the unique opportunity to utilize the CRA,  Congressional Review Act, and express our disapproval for some of these  harmful, burdensome regulations that hurt jobs and stunt the economy,  in order to protect the American people from these harmful effects.   The regulatory state has been rapidly expanding in recent years for  too long, and I am happy to see that Congress is taking action to  reverse this destructive behavior.                            ____________________
