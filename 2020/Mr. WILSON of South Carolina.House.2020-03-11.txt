 Madam Speaker, I am grateful to  President Donald Trump for focusing on the safety and health of  American families since the beginning of his administration. Not only  did President Trump immediately take action to address the coronavirus  with a travel ban, he has increased funding for important disease  research and preparedness efforts since he first took office.   President Trump has focused on a whole-of-government approach in  combating the coronavirus by ensuring State, local, public, and private  officials are prepared to keep families safe. He has made the swift  decision to appoint Vice President Mike Pence head of the Coronavirus  Task Force, who is skilled as a voice for this important service.   Since President Trump was elected, his administration has increased  funding to the National Institutes of Health by 39 percent, the Centers  for Disease Control by 24 percent, balanced biomedical research by 35  percent, Strategic National Stockpile by 32 percent, and infectious  disease response by 70 percent. This administration is committed to  keeping families safe while preparing our country for disease  outbreaks.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
