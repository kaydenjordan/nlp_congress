 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Walden for all of his  leadership and Ranking Member Pallone for the leadership, on a  bipartisan basis, for bringing all these bills to the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my legislation, H.R. 5685,  the Medicare Opioid Safety Education Act. When enacted, this bill will  help to combat the opioid crisis by improving efforts to educate  seniors on alternatives to traditional opioid pain medication as they  use it through the Medicare part D program.   Nearly one-third of seniors on Medicare part D were prescribed an  opioid in 2016--nearly one-third of seniors prescribed an opioid on  Medicare part D in 2016. That statistic underlines just how pervasive  opioid painkillers are among seniors who are often dealing with issues  stemming from chronic pain.   Seniors are given an informational booklet entitled ``Medicare &  You'' prior to becoming Medicare eligible that details the services  available to them upon enrollment. Currently, the word ``opioid''  actually only appears once in this booklet, and, given the national  crisis that we are facing of opioid addiction among all segments of our  society, that is really not enough. My bill would substantially improve  Medicare opioid education by adding available opioid alternatives and  additional education information to this handbook for every senior to  see.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Walden for all of his hard work on this  important issue and for working with us on bringing this legislation to  the floor today. I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  legislation.
