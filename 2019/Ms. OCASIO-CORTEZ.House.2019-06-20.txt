 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment  moving $5 million from the Drug Enforcement Administration into the  Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Program, which is part of the Department of  Justice funding of initiatives to combat the opioid epidemic.   I offer this amendment because ending the war on drugs has to mean  changing our priorities in order to keep all communities safe and  healthy. The best way we do that is by offering people the help and  support they need before arrest and criminalization should be  considered in the first place.   The amendment is a relatively commonsense one. As of now, the DEA  will be funded at $2.36 billion, which is nearly a $90 million 1-year  increase and $77.7 million above even the President's request.   The Bronx has an unprecedented opioid crisis with deadly overdoses  nearly doubling in just a few years. As families across our Nation  know, the opioid crisis is not limited just to the Bronx. Just  yesterday in the Oversight and Reform Committee, we heard testimony  from medical experts and providers, and the testimony from Nurse Gray  from West Virginia struck me. She said that we cannot arrest ourselves  out of this. We have to make sure that we are caring for people in  order to prevent this crisis from exploding.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Serrano).    Mr. Chair, I think in that common spirit and our  desire to make sure that we address the opioid epidemic, just as the  epidemic is exploding, so should our commitment to address this  problem.   This amendment is supported by the NAACP, the ACLU, the Drug Policy  Alliance, and dozens of other organizations. Again, this is a  relatively commonsense amendment. We have overfunded one agency, and we  should move that to make sure we are getting people the care that they  need.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
