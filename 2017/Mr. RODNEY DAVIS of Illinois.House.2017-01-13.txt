 Mr. Chairman, ObamaCare is not working.  We know this because the average increase for plans in Illinois was  between 45 and 55 percent this year. As a matter of fact, a good friend  of mine had an 87 percent increase.   We know this because millions of Americans who were told they could  keep their health insurance were kicked off their plans. We know it is  not working because 31 million people are underinsured, meaning they  can't afford to use the insurance they have. Deductibles are simply too  high.   It is not enough to judge this law simply by the number of people who  are insured, since it mandates people buy insurance anyway. We must  remember the people paying premiums that continue to double and then  have a deductible so high that it will never be reached.   That is not success. That is a problem for hardworking taxpayers,  many of whom don't qualify for subsidies but were forced off their  previous plans because they didn't meet the standards set by ObamaCare  and now can't afford the plan they are mandated to buy.   We know it is not working because people in a third of our counties  in the U.S. only have one insurance provider to choose from. ObamaCare  is collapsing on itself.   Some say: Why not work to fix it? I did. We did. We passed my Hire  More Heroes Act. It helps small businesses, helps our heroes. But we  have to begin today to fix the bill itself.   To know why this process is needed, let's remember how we got here.  This bill was rushed through Congress. It then had 20,000 pages of  regulations just for that one bill.   But taking this first step to repeal it should not be mistaken for  supporting the status quo before the ACA was put in place. We have a  plan. We are going to cover preexisting conditions. Because my wife is  a cancer survivor, we have to do that.
