 Madam Speaker, we are living through interesting times.  I understood that was also a curse, ``May you live in interesting  times.'' We certainly are enduring that.  [[Page H5825]]    An article from the New York Post, October 18, 2021, is titled  ``Biden secretly flying underage migrants into NY in dead of night.''   Now, what we have come to see at the border in Texas is that this  administration has learned that, gee, we have a record number of people  pouring into this country illegally, but if we can ship them away from  the border quickly enough, people don't see them amassed by the  thousands. So if they don't see them, no harm, no foul.                                time  1300    I guess they are thinking if no one is in the forest to hear a tree  fall, does it really fall? Well, the truth is, when you abandon the  rule of law, then a Nation based on the rule of law will not last much  beyond that.   This is devastating to the country, and some would say, well, you  know what, it is so compassionate to invite people. Well, when you hear  from doctors that probably 25 percent of the women they see have been  raped along the way, you see children separated from their parents in  order to come to this country to give them a better chance of staying  in the United States so the parents can someday follow, you see people  that become indentured servants of the drug cartels selling drugs, sex  trafficking, human trafficking, that is not very compassionate.   It seems the most compassionate thing that the United States  Government could do for our friends and neighbors to the south, would  be to secure our southern border so nobody comes in illegally. That  would keep out the drugs, the fentanyl, those things that are killing  70,000 people a year in the United States.   But the big thing for our neighbors would be that the tens of  billions of dollars pouring across our border to the drug cartels that  allows them to corrupt every level of Mexican Government would stop and  people wouldn't have to live in fear of the drug cartels controlling  Mexico, controlling countries to the south. That would be the  compassionate thing to do.   I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Good).    Madam Speaker, I couldn't agree more. And it is not  compassionate to lure people, lure children into this country away from  their parents with some hope down the road maybe they get back  together. That is not compassionate when you lure people to their  detriment.   In fact, if the U.S. Government were susceptible to being sued by  people that have been lured into the country to their detriment and by  the open border policy that ends up causing them to be basically,  totally under the control of the drug cartels, then there would be  attractive nuisance lawsuits against this President and against our  Federal Government for not securing our border and drawing people in  who are then harmed.   There are constantly people being found that are dead that tried to  make it in, and yet, the drug cartels being so heartless, they don't  care if they die or not. But they do want to continue to add employees  or indentured servants all over the country.   It is just rather dramatic how this President, this administration is  doing so much to aid and abet the drug cartels in getting their  servants all over the country in cities and, yet, it is true we have  Americans that are paying for the drugs, paying for sex trafficking,  and we should be doing so much more as a Federal Government to prevent  those things from happening.   There is an article here from Politico of all places: ``It's not just  Republicans. Everyone's mad at Biden over migration.''   You have got Daily Mail from October 20: ``Facebook admits users can  share information on illegal immigration and being smuggled: Arizona  Attorney General calls for investigation into tech giant for  `facilitating human and sex trafficking.'''   So, once again, just like with our elections, you have got the  Democrats in positions of power in the government working hand in hand  with the tech giants for something that is just terrible for human  beings, and that is facilitating human and sex trafficking.    I yield to the gentleman from Virginia.    Madam Speaker, as my friend has noted, there are so many  crises that are going on right now. We have the economy being harmed  even more by policies of this administration with the President and all  of those working with him and for him demanding that everyone be  vaccinated.   And the President himself has said we need to protect the vaccinated  from the unvaccinated, and he said the way to do that is to make sure  all the unvaccinated are vaccinated.   So this administration's solution is we have got to protect the  vaccinated from the unvaccinated by making the unvaccinated get the  vaccination. That does not protect you from the unvaccinated. It makes  no sense.                                time  1315    And some doctors have said, if somebody put out a vaccine that killed  200 people, they would immediately slam the brakes and say, Whoa, wait,  let's hold up. We have got to find out what the problem is here. But we  know from reports that have been made that there are people that have  died from having the vaccination.   We are thrilled that the vaccines were produced so quickly. President  Trump got a lot of the red tape out of the way. However, it ought to be  a choice after talking, between a doctor and a patient, and the doctor  understanding the risks inherent because of the biological makeup of  this person for taking the vaccination, and then let the individual  decide.   But if the vaccination works as good as we were told originally it  did, then there should be no vaccinated person really concerned about  those that are unvaccinated because they would be protected.   I am glad that the administration is starting to have cracks in their  adamant position that having had COVID and having antibodies is just  not nearly as good as having a vaccination. I am glad they are starting  to--some of them at least--observe the science, that it is probably a  little better if you had COVID, had the antibodies, as far as your  future and fighting it off. So I am encouraged by that.   But then, I see this article from October 19. As we talked about  before, the President, I believe, he is doing something illegal in  saying you have got to have the vaccination. And then he comes out and  says, we are going to have OSHA put together a rule requiring everybody  to have the vaccination. But the President, himself, does not sign an  executive order, which could be taken to court. It is just the general  policy of blackmailing companies, private firms, that we are coming  after you if you don't force your employees to have the vaccination. It  is really a bit insidious. You don't even really give people a chance  to file suit. You just state a policy you are going to follow and then  have everybody follow it, it makes it much more difficult to sue.   But this article says, ``OSHA will not enforce 29 CFR 1904's  recording requirements to require any employers to record worker side  effects from COVID-19 vaccination.'' The Biden administration is  forcing you to take the jab in order to work. And simultaneously, the  Biden administration does not want the employer to tell them about  workers who were injured by the jab. Simply more evidence that the  vaccine mandate is not about your health.   So that is a little disturbing. You would think if anyone cared about  science and really cared about people, you would want to know about  every abnormality, every adverse consequence of taking the vaccination,  because we are really concerned about individual health. But that is  not this administration. They are putting out that we don't want to  know things that are bad.   I was informed about a person that had the vaccination, and  immediately died after the vaccination; was full of blood clots--not  one, but many. And the physician noted the cause of death was blood  clots from a vaccination. And then the family was told the health  official will not certify a death certificate if it blames the  vaccination for the death.   So the widow is in a real bind because you have got to have a death  certificate in order to legally move forward and get things changed  after the person died. You got to show proof. And yet, the health  officer refusing to attribute the cause of death to what it really was,  according to the doctor, the vaccination.   So that is pretty remarkable that the government does not want to do  its job in protecting people. I would think that if someone in  government really cared about people instead of caring about being a  dictator, they would say, We want to know exactly what happened after a  vaccination that went wrong and which vaccine was it so we can document  which ones are safer than other vaccinations. But that is not,  apparently, what is going on in this country right now.   So we really need people stepping up and letting this administration  know, letting their Members of Congress, their Senators know that they  expect them to speak up. We want complete transparency. What works;  what doesn't work. We don't want the government hiding things from us  anymore.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    To some degree.    Will the gentleman yield?    I did read results of one study that indicated that if  you wear a mask, you are two-tenths of one percent less likely to get  COVID. So there is that. There is at least two-tenths of one percent  that it is apparently helpful but we don't know the results of long- term wearing a mask, the additional CO2 that may be taken  in, or germs that are kept in a mask that would have not been breathed  in repeatedly. We don't know the results of all that.   That is fine, but that is still very different from forcing someone  to have an injection, which we know can have very adverse effects. And  that is why it ought to be an individual decision to make.                                time  1330    But then again, it also contributes to a crisis in enough people  doing jobs that allow us to have a supply chain that is intact and  getting people the things that they need.   Little did I know--you may have anticipated it--but there were people  making jokes after the Vice President had said several weeks ago--it  may have been in August--that people needed to get their orders in now  so they would get things by Christmas. Wow. Apparently, they saw this  coming.   But the point that has been made by my friend about the various  opinions from the same people, when it comes to Dr. Fauci, when it  comes to the President, it is hard to find an issue that they haven't  been on more than one side of.   Fauci would say, no, don't use a mask. Yes, you should use a mask.  And then he says, use a mask. And then he is saying at a baseball game  you do not need to wear a mask, not social distance.   He has given different opinions, and it reminded me of Winston  Churchill's comment about Keynes, the economist. Of course, a lot of  people say that is Keynesian economics. But if you look back and do  some research on the guy, often when he got into debate and was  confronted that some theory he had wasn't true and didn't work, he  would immediately take the other position and say he was not for that,  he was for this.   So Winston Churchill had once said--I believe this is close to  verbatim. He said if you put two economists in a room, you would have  three different opinions unless one of them was Sir Keynes, in which  case you would have an unlimited number of opinions. I am getting that  impression from Dr. Fauci.   Apparently, even Dr. Fauci needs to come to grips with the fact that  when he says the U.S. never funded any gain-of-function research--okay,  the evidence is there. He had us going for a while, but the evidence is  in, and that is absolutely not true.   Hopefully, in all the myriad of opinions he has, he will come around  and find the truthful opinion when it comes to his group contributing  to gain-of-function research that helped weaponize the COVID virus.    My friend has such a great point. To have the Attorney  General of the United States jump into the issue of disagreements at  school board meetings is absolutely astounding. We have record crime,  especially in cities controlled totally by Democrats. Crime is going up  tremendously.   I know that Merrick Garland knows the Constitution, or at least he  has at one time. He knows that there is no mention in the Constitution  of a Federal role in education. Yet, he sends out a memo saying-- basically, it is pretty intimidating--that we are going to start  digging into these school board meetings and using the Justice  Department to go after people who have differences of agreement that  happen to agree with Dr. King that people should be judged by the  content of their character and not by the color of their skin.   Who would have believed that 40 to 50 years after it seemed we were  so close to Dr. King's dream being realized that you would have an  administration totally committed to undoing Dr. King's dream and going  back to judging people by the color of their skin instead of the  content of their character? It is just shocking.   Of course, the saying in Washington is and has been for many years,  no matter how cynical you are, it is never enough to catch up. Well, we  find out, after Attorney General Garland sends out the letter that he  is going to go after these people that are in disagreement, lo and  behold, it turns out his son-in-law and daughter make a tremendous  amount of money selling things in support of critical race theory,  judging people by the color of their skin and not by the content of  their character.   It is Panorama Education Company founded by Xan Tanner. They sell  surveys to school districts, according to this article from Callie  Patteson, that has a nationwide focus on ``social and emotion  climate,'' which is interesting. I guess they are wanting that climate  changed as well.   With contracts in more than 50 of the 100 largest school districts in  the U.S., Panorama Education claims to be supporting ``13 million  students in 23,000 schools and 1,500 districts across 50 States.''  Panorama Education Company's cofounder Xan Tanner is Attorney General  Merrick Garland's son-in-law.    It then goes on to talk about the 21 different States where they are  spreading this stuff. Their surveys reportedly give justification for  new curricula in schools, which parents have recently taken issue with,  such as critical race theory.   But since 2017, the company has raised $76 million from investors.  Just last month, Panorama Education struck a $60 million private  financing raise with General Atlantic.   It is rather amazing. Just when you think you can't get more cynical  about what this administration is doing, we find out, gee, there is  pecuniary gain afoot here on this issue of the Attorney General  weighing in on school board meetings. Of course, that is kind of flying  in the face of the idea that white supremacy and climate change are the  two biggest dangers to America.   For those of us that had incredibly good constitutional law  professors, we know those professors would say: Where is the Federal  nexus? There has to be some Federal reason, something that gives the  Federal Government the right to come in and control school board  meetings.   Of course, shortly after I got here, I had a law that I was working  on. Having family involved in schools--my mother was a schoolteacher--I  know back then the administrators had the teachers' backs. But now,  because of so many lawsuits so easily and quickly filed, administrators  would say things to teachers like: Look, I realize this student is a  total disruption to your class, but his mother or father, or both, will  file lawsuits, and we don't need a lawsuit, so just do the best you  can. And that would disrupt the education of other students.   My thought was, as a judge, I had what was called judicial immunity.  You might not like my rulings, but you can't just sue because you don't  like the rulings. It was judicial immunity. I thought, what if we  created an educational immunity? You may not like what a school does,  or a teacher or principal, but unless they have committed a crime, you  can't sue them. That would allow things to get to the place where they  used to be.   When I was growing up, if you had a problem with a teacher or some  issue in the school, you went to the school board meetings--like the  Attorney General is trying to stop now. If somebody on the school board  or too many on the school board didn't see it as a problem, then you  ran for the school board, got elected, and fixed it.   But because of lawsuits, that has totally changed the way schools  have had to approach things. So what if we gave them educational  immunity? I had asked the national education folks. They came and I  made the presentation, and I was totally shocked when they said: We are  not sure that we could support that. I said, but it would keep your  teachers from being sued at the drop of a hat. People could go complain  to the school board, but you couldn't just go after a teacher.   Well, it turns out, they eventually got back to me and said they  wouldn't be able to support that bill. I was just mortified--mystified,  too. Why would they not be behind that?                                time  1345    Then one of my friends who spent his life in education said, Louie,  do you not understand the biggest cash cow, the biggest moneymaker for  the teachers unions, is liability insurance?   If you take away their liability, then the teachers unions can't sell  and make money off of liability insurance. There goes that big cash  cow.   Yes, it would make life easier for teachers, but the unions, the  people who are making money from unionizing teachers, will not ever  support something like that.   So, just, again, going back to the old adage: No matter how cynical  you get around here, it is not enough to catch up. I am constantly  being reeducated on that issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Virginia.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend from Virginia more  than he can ever know, and I am glad he is here.   But along the lines of rights that we have had, and that the  Constitution has assured, we are finding civil liberties still are  being trampled.   I have an article here by Glenn Greenwald, and it is just an  excellent summary on what the title tells us: ``Civil Liberties Are  Being Trampled By Exploiting `Insurrection' Fears.''   We have people in this body who are constantly referring to the  insurrection on January 6. We have heard the President and others say  that it was the worst attack on democracy ever. Even a person whom I  don't often agree with, FBI Director Christopher Wray, even he pointed  out that, gee, it is kind of tough for those of us who recall 9/11 to  say January 6 was a worse attack on democracy.   If you were just judging by time, I heard from Attorney General  Garland and spinning the news, many, I think 2 to 300, were charged  with obstructing an official session of Congress for 4 to 6 hours. But,  Mr. Speaker, if you go back to June 22 of 2016, we had 26 hours of  obstruction of an official session of Congress. Congress twice tried to  go back into session and was prevented each time. It was about 26 hours  before the efforts of so many to obstruct Congress finally were  withdrawn so we could have Congress again.   I didn't realize back then that this offense was out there. I knew  there were many violations of House rules that went on, but then, Mr.  Speaker, when you see, oh, my gosh, just obstructing Congress carries  up to 20 years in prison. I would be interested to know if any of those  people who were obstructing an official session of Congress realized  that they were committing a Federal felony carrying up to 20 years in  prison and up to a $250,000 fine.   But fortunately for them, Paul Ryan was Speaker and chose not to  really do anything. Those are the kind of things that when the American  public sees that people are doing things wrong who are supposed to be  making the laws and following the laws and yet they are the worst  violators, it is not helpful nor healthy for the country.   I know one of my constituents--and I am not defending any crimes that  have been committed--but he is a guy, he was on Ellen after rescuing  dogs in a hurricane; he was arrested for his role in the Capitol. What  I have learned from him and his family, gee, these people are being so  mistreated. We have heard from other people. But we had a Federal judge  here who said: Enough is enough.   He finally held the warden in contempt. As I understand, the warden  has lost the job of being warden.   There is an article from Sarah Lynch saying that the jail violated  the civil rights of a U.S. Capitol riot defendant, but these folks not  being allowed to--at least some of them--not to shave, not to get a  haircut, and I thought we were decades past those days, because I know  all the county jails with which I am familiar, they would make sure  people were dressed out, had a haircut and shaved, if they wanted to,  before they came to court, that they were not going to have them forced  into an appearance like the Unabomber looking like some wild, crazy  person making it easier for a jury to convict them because they looked  like a Neanderthal. Yet, that is exactly what the D.C. Jail has been  doing.   It was reported that after the judge held the warden in contempt,  that there was a late-night effort by the people at the D.C. Jail that,  as I understand it, is partially under the control of the Bureau of  Prisons, but they sent people to start scrubbing the black mold that  was causing problems for some of the prisoners, painted areas that were  disgusting and that they let some of these folks who were arrested  because of the January 6 events, let them know that we hold you  accountable and you are going to pay for it. Then some noted the  terrible smell of cleaning fluid on their food that they couldn't eat.  Many are tired of eating bologna sandwiches for months and months in a  row.    I do know this: the reports we have been getting indicate that the  folks here who are being held in pretrial confinement and are being  punished--although that is unconstitutional to punish somebody while  they are awaiting trial and not having been convicted--that they are  not treated nearly as well as bloodthirsty murderers who are being held  in Guantanamo.   I have been down there more than once. I have seen how things go  there, and it is rather tragic that American citizens are being treated  so much worse than individuals who want to destroy America and who have  killed and participated in the killing of thousands of Americans.   Here is one from Gateway Pundit: ``Newly Released Video Shows January  6 Political Prisoner Jeremy Brown Saving a Female Trump Supporter Who  Was Trampled By Capitol Police.'' That is from October 20.   Here is an article that was this summer titled, ``Six Months Since  the January 6th Attack on the Capitol.'' It points out that it works  out to be an average of three defendants arrested every single day,  including weekends, since January 6. Nearly 235 defendants have been  charged with corruptly obstructing, influencing, or impeding an  official proceeding, or attempting to do so.   And this article from Sarah Lynch, October 13, ``Jail Violated Civil  Rights of Capitol Riot Defendant, U.S. Judge Says,'' and a copy of that  order.   But AG Garland tried to blame D.C. for conditions at the jail and  treatment at the jail when actually he is in charge of what happens to  pretrial prisoners that the Department of Justice is going after.   So nice try, but we need people here facing up to their  responsibility.   Mr. Speaker, I will just conclude with a comment that I never ever  thought I would hear myself say, but after seeing the partisanship, the  use of official position to help a daughter's and son-in-law's  finances, thank God Mitch McConnell didn't bring him to be confirmed as  a Supreme Court Justice.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
