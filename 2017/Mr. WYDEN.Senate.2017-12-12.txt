 Mr. President, I think that we are going to be joined here  in a few moments by our colleague, the senior Senator from Illinois,  Senator Durbin, who, for years and years, has been leading the fight  for the Dreamers--for the young people who are affected by DACA. He may  be tied up for a bit, but as we begin--because we are going to be in a  colloquy on some of these issues--I want to recognize his extraordinary  contributions.   Nobody has been more focused and more relentless in terms of standing  up for the rights of the Dreamers--the young people and the families  who are caught up in DACA--than Senator Durbin, the senior Senator from  Illinois, and I want to make sure that his role is recognized at the  outset.   I and Senator Merkley have spent a lot of time talking to these young  people at home in our State, and we have held special forums on it. I  am just stunned at what wonderful young people these folks are.  Inevitably, their grades are at the top of their classes. They seem to  be working two jobs, and they are sending money to relatives. They are  just doing everything that we associate with hard work and thrift and  ingenuity and with what has made our country so unique and so special  in the world.   I want to talk a little bit about what I have heard and also set the  record straight with respect to DACA, because there is an awful lot of  reckless talk about this legislation, and much of it just does not  resemble the truth. Misinformation is being spread to discredit DACA  recipients and their contributions to the country, and those innocent  lives are being damaged. Right now, Dreamers face the very real and  frightening threat that they may be ripped away from the only lives  that they know and the only country that they have ever known, and I  want to spell out why.   The Congress is now up against an artificial deadline that was  created by this President in his scrambling to come up with a solution  for the 11,000 DACA recipients in Oregon and the hundreds of thousands  all over the country. If nothing is done in the Congress this year, we  know that these young people are going to be fearful, and they are  going to go into the holidays while wondering what is ahead for them  and their families. I just feel so strongly that they deserve better.  They shouldn't be hanging in suspended animation--wondering what is  going to happen to them, living in fear. My hope is that there will be  action taken this year to help these young people. I feel so strongly  that the end-of-the-year wrapup legislation has to include legislation  to finally allow these young people to realize their hopes and dreams  in this country.   In his statement that announced the end of the DACA Program, the  Attorney General said that our country must enforce our immigration  laws, and he implied that the failure to enforce the laws somehow puts  our country at risk of crime, violence, and terrorism. I can just say  that, based on everything I have seen in Oregon, DACA recipients have  not put our country at an increased risk of crime and terrorism,  because, in fact, they are vital contributors to our Nation's success,  including many who serve in our military.   It is just wonderful, and it is so good to see our colleague from  Nevada here, who, along with Senator Durbin, has championed the rights  and interests of these young people. I know that she is going to speak  shortly because she has seen the real-life consequences--the dangers-- that are being inflicted on our young friends, our neighbors, and those  who are so fearful about what will happen if Congress does not act  before the end of the year.   This is not an abstraction for those like Mariana Medina, whose  family  [[Page S7966]]  brought her to the United States when she was 3. She went on to  graduate from Tigard High School, which is just outside my hometown of  Portland. This past June, Mariana graduated from Portland State  University with a bachelor's degree in political science. She speaks  eloquently and powerfully about how she really wants to give back to  the people of Oregon by helping the children and the families who are  most in need of help. What a wonderful role model Mariana is.   The debate is just as real for Ricardo Lujan, who graduated from  Southern Oregon University in the spring. Ricardo is now the  legislative director for the Oregon Student Association. There, he has  been a strong advocate for legislation to give Oregon Dreamers a chance  to get their own higher education degrees.   Ricardo worked full time while going to school full time in order to  pay for essentials. He said: I want to make sure that I am contributing  to affording an apartment and a car. He said that without DACA, he  would not have his bachelor of science degree today. He said that this  law is a beacon of hope to young people like himself.   In Oregon, there are now an estimated 11,000 Dreamers. All of these  young people have parents and brothers and sisters and friends and  people who know them in the community because they always want to help  and chip in. They have roots in these communities. They have well-laid  plans to work hard in school, make something of their lives, and start  families of their own here in our country.   It seems to me that with the groundswell of support for these  Dreamers, before the end of this year, this Congress ought to be able  to come up with a bipartisan, fair way to put an opportunity path  forward for these young Americans. The effort from the White House, I  have to say, and I regret it, to punish these young people and split  families seems to run contrary to the values we hold dear as Americans.   Our government, by the way, made a promise to these young people when  the government encouraged them to share their stories publicly, submit  to background checks, and pay taxes. That was something the government  urged these young people to do--come forward, pay taxes, submit to  background checks. We want to make sure that we are in a position--and  I was hopeful when I heard about that pledge--to take action based on  the fact that these young people were willing to come forward and say:  We want to be contributing members of our country. We want to make sure  that when the government asks us to come forward, we do. And they did  so.   I close with this, because I know my colleague wants to speak-- perhaps on the same subject--it would be wrong to turn our backs on  these exceptional young people. I know my colleague from Nevada is  going to keep fighting tooth and nail alongside so many of our  colleagues.   Senator Durbin was going to join me for a colloquy on some of these  issues, and with the end of the year legislation barrelling toward us,  I think he was detained, but I want to thank him for his leadership. In  fact, he has joined us now.   With the indulgence of my friend from Nevada, I would like to  recognize my colleague from Illinois because no one in this Senate has  put in the time or shown the tenacity and the years-long commitment to  make this fight for justice for the Dreamers and those who are trying  to work their way through the DACA Program to a better future for  themselves and their communities. So I am very grateful to the Senator  from Illinois.   I had mentioned in his absence that we thought at one time we would  have a full-scale colloquy, and I have pretty much used up my time in  terms of making some of the points about issues we have raised. With  the indulgence of our friend from Nevada, I want to again thank the  Senator from Illinois. We are on the cusp of being able to finally get  justice to these Dreamers and those in DACA, and I want this body and  people who are following this issue to know that we would not be in  this position without the help and the advocacy of the senior Senator  from Illinois.   I appreciate my friend from Nevada allowing us to have time for the  Senator from Illinois.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.
