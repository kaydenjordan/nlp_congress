 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  amendment.   International students and researchers provide enormous benefits for  American competitiveness and prosperity. As of 2018, immigrants founded  50 of the 91 privately held billion-dollar startup tech companies in  the United States. A quarter of those founders came to the U.S. as  international students. These companies created an average of 1,200  jobs each, and have a collective value of $250 billion. International  students and researchers bring fresh perspectives, diverse experiences,  expertise, energy, and creativity to the U.S. research enterprise.   The global competition to attract top science, technology,  engineering, mathematics, and medical talent is intensifying. And  attracting talent is just half the battle. Restrictive immigration  policies and xenophobic rhetoric, restrictions due to the pandemic, and  concerted efforts by other countries to attract talent, have given  talented international STEM students good reason to consider  opportunities outside of the U.S. We must take bold action now to  ensure the U.S. can continue to attract and retain global STEM talent.   This amendment creates a new pathway to permanent residency for a  small number of outstanding students and professionals engaged in  critical fields that are vital to achieving the goals of the National  Defense Strategy and National Defense Science and Technology Strategy.  While modest in scope, the amendment would help advance areas of  innovation that are critical to our national security and economic  competitiveness.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
