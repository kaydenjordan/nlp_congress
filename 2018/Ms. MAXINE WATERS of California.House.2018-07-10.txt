 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6139, the Improving Investment  Research for Small and Emerging Issuers Act.   I first would like to thank Mr. Huizenga for working with me to  develop a bipartisan approach to identifying and addressing gaps in  investment research coverage for small issuers.   Investment research helps to raise investor awareness, understanding,  and interest about a company, which can, in turn, promote liquidity and  overall trading in the company's securities. Unfortunately, research of  small public companies has been on the decline in recent years.   According to a report from Capital IQ, nearly two-thirds of companies  with less than $100 million in market capitalization have no research  coverage at all. At a recent Capital Markets, Securities, and  Investment Subcommittee hearing, Tyler Gellasch, executive director of  the Healthy Markets Association, testified about some of the factors  contributing to low research coverage of small issuers.   According to Mr. Gellasch, one such factor is the bundling of  research and execution services by investment banks, which ``increases  cost for investors and competitively disadvantages smaller independent  research providers versus their larger peers.''   H.R. 6139 directs the SEC to study competition in the research market  and other factors affecting the availability of research coverage for  small issuers, including emerging growth companies and companies  considering an initial public offering. It also directs SEC to consider  any unique challenges faced by minority women and veteran-owned  businesses in obtaining research coverage.   Finally, the bill directs the SEC to report its findings to Congress  within 6 months, along with recommendations to improve the quality and  availability of investment research for small issuers. This bipartisan  effort will help identify the barriers small businesses face when  attempting to get their story out to investors in our public capital  markets.   I would urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in support of H.R. 1861,  legislation to posthumously award the Congressional Gold Medal to Larry  Doby in recognition of his athletic and civil rights achievements.   But I must say that we would not be here today but for Mr. Pascrell,  who has been dedicated and committed to the proposition that Larry Doby  should be recognized for his tremendous talent and for his tremendous  contribution not only to athletics but to civil rights and other  efforts that he was involved in.   Larry Doby became the first African American professional baseball  player in the American League in July 1947, 3 months after Jackie  Robinson had become the first African American professional baseball  player in the National League. While the name, Jackie Robinson, is  known in almost every American household, Larry Doby did not receive  nearly as much media attention, though he is every bit as deserving.   Larry Doby played an integral role in breaking down the color barrier  and in integrating the American League. Larry Doby signed with the  Cleveland Indians in 1947, and at the time, was not even welcomed by  his own teammates, several of whom refused to shake his hand upon  meeting him for the first time. Outside of his own team, Doby faced  racism and prejudice from opposing players and fans, having to endure  racial slurs and death threats.    Despite the adversity he faced, Doby paved the way for countless  African American players with dignity and class. In 1948, Doby became  one of the first African American players to win a World Series  championship when the Indians beat the Boston Braves. In game four of  the series, he became the first African American player to hit a home  run in World Series history. He also helped the Indians win a franchise  record, 111 games, and the American League pennant in 1954, and was the  American League RBI leader and home run champion.   After playing with the Indians, Doby had a long and successful  baseball career playing with the Chicago White Sox, the Detroit Tigers,  and the Dragons before retiring in 1962.   Following his retirement, he served as a manager for various teams  and became the second African American manager in the majors with the  Chicago White Sox. He also served as a director with the New Jersey  Nets in the NBA. In 1998, he was elected to the National Baseball Hall  of Fame by the hall's Veterans Committee.   His athletic contributions to major league baseball are, without a  doubt, impressive and admirable, but Larry Doby's tenacity,  determination, and his role as a pioneer in the face of tremendous  hardship to integrate baseball are deserving of the utmost recognition  and respect.   I would urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing this  legislation to recognize Larry Doby with the Congressional Gold Medal.   And let me just say, more than anybody, I think that my colleague,  Mr. Pascrell, must again be commended and recognized for the fact that  he insisted that this should take place, that this gold medal should be  presented on behalf of Larry Doby, and so it is because of him that we  find ourselves here today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to  yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Pascrell), the lead Democratic sponsor of this bill, who has been  tireless in his efforts to bring this legislation to the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional  speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5749, which is a tailored,  bipartisan solution to the problems facing our Nation's options  markets.  [[Page H6002]]    Options are a type of derivative contract that provide investors with  the right to buy or sell stock or other securities at some point in the  future. According to the Chicago Board Options Exchange, which supports  the bill, bank affiliates that clear options on behalf of large traders  have been restricting their services because of the current bank  capital calculation and resulting costs.   As a consequence, they argue that large options traders, known as  market-makers, are not readily able to trade when investors need them  to and are having to charge more when they do trade. There are also  fewer market-makers overall and more trading activity concentrated  among the top five firms.   H.R. 5749 would direct the bank regulators to consider this problem  while still focusing on the benefits of bank capital to reduce systemic  risk.   Now, I am aware that the Federal Reserve just proposed to  significantly change banks' capital requirements, including through a  rollback of the supplementary leverage ratio. If the Fed's proposals  are finalized, FDIC-insured banks could shed as much as $121 billion in  capital, making it more likely that one of the Wall Street megabanks  will fail in a future downturn and cause untold damage to the economy.   On top of that, the President signed into law S. 2155, which will  recklessly reduce capital and other requirements on the Nation's  largest banks. I am very concerned with these developments and urge our  regulators to ensure the safety and soundness of megabanks and our  financial system.   H.R. 5749 would make sure that this is the case for bank capital  associated with cleared options. Specifically, the bill would require  the bank regulators to conduct a rulemaking after considering several  important factors, including the safety and soundness of the financial  system, financial stability, and the impact of the changes on the  broader capital regime.   Unlike the introduced version of the bill, which would only reduce  capital, the bill, as amended, would direct the regulators to increase  capital for riskier derivatives.   It also would create a retrospective rule review so that, 5 years  after implementation, the regulators would study the impact of their  rule.   So I want to thank Representative Foster and Representative Hultgren  for working together to promote trading in our options markets without  sacrificing bank safety and soundness.   I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 5749, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further  speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5877, the Main Street Growth  Act, a new and innovative idea that will help our Nation's small  businesses raise funds to grow by issuing stock that investors are able  to easily buy and sell in the secondary markets.   Specifically, H.R. 5877 would create a venture exchange for investors  to trade in the stock of emerging growth companies and early stage  growth companies.   Unlike a similar partisan bill last Congress, H.R. 5877, as amended,  would allow companies to create a venture exchange in a way that  balances the needs of small companies and the protection of their  investors in the secondary markets.   Most importantly, the bill would retain State regulatory oversight  over these small unregistered companies, which are more prone to fraud  and failure. For example, small companies that are not regularly traded  are frequent targets of scammers that use pump-and-dump schemes to dupe  investors into thinking the stock is worth more than it is by spreading  fake news and hot tips and then selling the stock at artificially high  prices.   So it makes sense for our State regulators, who are very familiar  with these scams, to regulate and oversee these companies.   I am also pleased that the bill ensures that companies trading on a  venture exchange have a minimum level of disclosure and ongoing  disclosure, including annual and semi-annual reports, that detail the  health of the company's finances, business, and management, as well as  the company's related party transactions and share ownership.   This is important to investors buying shares on a venture exchange  who may have little to no relationship to the company to otherwise have  access to such information.   In addition, the bill would allow the SEC to establish additional  restrictions on any over-the-counter trading that is not on a venture  exchange.   If our goal is to centralize trading on a single exchange to make it  easier for investors to buy and sell small company stock, then I think  it makes sense for the SEC to have the authority to limit over-the- counter trading.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 5877, and I thank Representative Emmer  for working with Democrats to support our Nation's small businesses and  their investors.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further  speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman), a senior  member of the Financial Services Committee and the lead Democratic  sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Sherman, for working  across the aisle to develop H.R. 5953, the Building Up Independent  Lives and Dreams Act, or the BUILD Act, which will assist nonprofits in  providing affordable housing to those in need.   Some nonprofit organizations, like Habitat for Humanity, help  borrowers who would otherwise not be able to afford a home by offering  zero percent interest mortgages with terms that ensure the borrowers  have the ability to repay the loans while also taking care of other  household expenses. Oftentimes, these nonprofits rely heavily on  limited staffs or volunteer labor to underwrite mortgages for families  in need.   Because of these unique dynamics, some smaller affiliates of these  types of organizations have had a bit of difficulty adapting to the  current updated disclosure forms that are used to inform mortgage  borrowers about the material terms and costs of their loans. This bill  would give those nonprofits the flexibility to choose whether to use  truth-in-lending, good-faith estimate, and HUD-1 mortgage disclosure  forms when originating a mortgage or the TILA-RESPA integrated  disclosure, or TRID, forms.   Even though this very narrow exemption already applies to  organizations that make five or fewer mortgages annually, I believe we  are all in agreement that extending this flexibility to charitable  nonprofits with a unique business model like Habitat is a positive  change.   Nonprofits like Habitat for Humanity operate with different business  models and traditional financing institutions. They are and they serve  a different clientele. It is clear that the BUILD Act does not provide  any opportunity for other types of lenders to take advantage of the  carve-out in a way that could potentially harm borrowers. With that in  mind, I support this bill, and I encourage my colleagues to do the  same.   Mr. Speaker, I have no more requests for time, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   H.R. 4537, as amended, would ensure that international insurance  standards or agreements are consistent with our domestic insurance  system. The bill also encourages greater transparency, accountability,  and congressional involvement in the development of international  insurance standards and covered agreements.                                time  1600    H.R. 4537, the International Insurance Standards Act of 2018, is a  product of months of bipartisan negotiations. I am pleased to be able  to support the final compromise bill that is before us today.   Today's bill is a reflection of the work of the bill's sponsors, Mr.  Duffy and Mr. Heck, and many others, including myself, to narrow and  streamline the bill so that we do not intentionally weaken the United  States' ability to negotiate strong rules internationally.   This is important. We cannot forget that, during 2007 and 2009, the  United States faced the most severe financial crisis since the Great  Depression. One of the most notable events during the crisis was the  near collapse of insurance giant AIG, which threatened the stability of  the entire U.S. financial system.   AIG's rapid demise and need for a Federal bailout underscored the  importance of consolidated supervision and appropriate prudential  standards for certain types of nonbank financial institutions,  including large, global insurance companies.   The Dodd-Frank Act helped us fill in these gaps. I would like to note  that the core Dodd-Frank reforms, in this respect, remain intact in  this bill.   Again, I would like to thank Mr. Duffy, Mr. Heck, and their staffs  for working with me and my staff to improve the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a special moment to thank Mr. Duffy  and Mr. Heck. They worked very hard to resolve the concerns and the  differences that arose in trying to put together this legislation.   As Mr. Duffy has said, the world has changed, and we cannot be  isolated in any way, just thinking about regulations that absolutely  are impacted by what is going on internationally. I think, with all the  hard work that was done by these two Members, we were able to figure  out how to protect the work of the States and the laws that we have,  but, at the same time, recognize that we are working in an  international atmosphere. We must understand that gaps must be closed;  I think we have done that sufficiently.    Again, I would like to thank them. Mr. Heck is just getting off the  plane. He wanted to be here, because he has worked so hard on this  legislation. He is not able to make it, but I want everybody to  recognize that he did a tremendous job in helping us work through the  difficulties of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is an unfortunate reality in our country that a  child's ZIP Code can determine her future and that families often have  limited options in choosing where to live.   Rigorous studies have demonstrated that giving a low-income family  the opportunity to move to a lower poverty neighborhood can have a  profound impact, particularly for young children.   For example, one study found that young boys and girls in families  that used a voucher to move to lower poverty neighborhoods were 32  percent more likely to attend college and earn 31 percent more annually  compared to their counterparts in families that did not receive a  voucher.   However, families with housing choice vouchers continue to face  significant challenges if they want to move to a better neighborhood.  In fact, data shows that only one in eight families with children with  a housing choice voucher used their vouchers to live in low-poverty  areas.   H.R. 5793 will help reduce barriers to mobility for families with  housing choice vouchers by establishing a demonstration program that  would enable and incentivize public housing agencies to form regional  collaborations that will enhance opportunities for mobility across  jurisdictions.   This is a bipartisan proposal that was included in previous HUD  budget requests under the Obama administration. The Center on Budget  and Policy Priorities estimates that this demonstration will allow more  than 7,000 families to move to areas of opportunity.   I am pleased to support this legislation, and, of course, I urge my  colleagues to do the same.   I would like to say that Mr. Cleaver and Mr. Duffy have worked very  hard to get this demonstration. I am very pleased about that because it  is well known that I have big concerns about HUD and HUD's ability to  give the kind of support to the least of these and families that need  it so desperately. But this may be an indication that we can get more  positive action from HUD.   So, again, I am very pleased to support this legislation, and I would  like all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Cleaver), the ranking  member of the Housing and Insurance Subcommittee on the Financial  Services Committee and the lead Democratic sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I certainly support this bill because we all must have  hope. We all must have hope that we can get rid of poverty, that we can  open up opportunities, that we can do something that would allow  families who are locked into very poor neighborhoods be able to escape  those neighborhoods and have better opportunities.   It is not always clear how that is going to happen, but given this  legislation by Mr. Duffy and Mr. Cleaver, they certainly are attempting  to put something together that may be able to move these families and  give them better opportunities.   We know that we support housing with Section 8 and public housing  projects, et cetera, and we know that we have people who have Section 8  certificates who have been desperately looking for a decent place to  live and would love to be able to move into higher opportunity  neighborhoods.   We have got to think in this collaboration that is going to be done  about  [[Page H6013]]  how we are going to convince landlords to be more open to accepting  voucher choice participants. We have got to think about what public  housing programs can do. Most, of course, public housing is in poor  neighborhoods. But certainly, if we have those who are in stronger  neighborhoods, better neighborhoods, perhaps there can be the kind of  collaboration that can see to it that people in some of the poorer  neighborhoods and public housing would have an opportunity for moving  into these better neighborhoods.   So, again, I think we must be hopeful. We don't always know how it is  going to be done, but to give it a try is certainly worthwhile.   Mr. Speaker, I would certainly ask my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, robust and regular disclosures by public companies, such  as the detailed quarterly financial information filed on a form 10Q,  make our markets more attractive to investors by enabling informed  investment decisions and ensuring shareholders can hold corporate  boards accountable for practices that may undermine the value of the  company.   Standardized quarterly financial reporting on form 10Q also provides  a means for regulators to conduct efficient and effective oversight of  public companies and protect investors from fraud and other corporate  misconduct.   When investors have faith in the integrity of our markets, they are  more likely to entrust their capital to public companies, thereby  providing opportunities for economic growth and job creation.   The benefits of quarterly reporting are well recognized by the  investor community. In a June 2016 letter to the SEC's Division of  Corporate Finance, the SEC's Investor Advisory Committee wrote, ``The  current degree, quality, and frequency of disclosure for U.S. issuers  overall is appropriate and a source of strength for the U.S. capital  markets. The current system greatly benefits retirees, pension funds,  endowments, and households that are directly and indirectly market  participants.''   Additionally, in May and June of this year, investors and investor  advocacy groups wrote to the Financial Services Committee expressing  their support for the SEC's current quarterly reporting regime,  including the form 10Q.   According to CalPERS, the largest public pension fund in the United  States with more than $350 billion in global assets, ``10Qs provide  substantial and important information and serve as a great historical  resource. Any modification of standard quarterly filings should be  preceded by significant study with ample opportunity for investor  input.''   While some business groups have called for the elimination of the 10Q  as a cost-saving measure for corporations, I agree that any attempt to  alter the existing quarterly reporting requirements first requires a  careful and balanced study that considers the impact of any changes on  investors and our markets.   H.R. 5970, as amended, requires the SEC to conduct such a study, to  include consideration of the benefits of form 10Q reporting to the SEC,  public companies, investors, market researchers, and other market  participants.   I support the bill as amended, and I thank Mr. Gottheimer and Mrs.  Wagner for working together to develop a bipartisan approach to the  study. I hope that the SEC takes this study as an opportunity to hear  from investors about the disclosures they find important and ensure  that our public markets and the companies which seek to access them  continue to enjoy the benefits of comprehensive and standardized  financial disclosure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
