 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 104, condemning the  CCP's use of a high-altitude surveillance balloon over the United  States territory as a brazen violation of U.S. sovereignty, that was  authored by my friend and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee,   Michael McCaul.   Last week, the entire world witnessed a clear and unacceptable breach  of U.S. sovereignty. I stand here today to strongly denounce the  presence of the PRC balloon in the United States airspace.   It is now up to Beijing to demonstrate, not just to the United States  but to the world, that it is serious about respecting international  rules and law, and that it is genuine about stabilizing relations with  the United States.   Secretary Blinken was on his way to Beijing to engage in diplomacy  but, and I believe, correctly, canceled his trip. It was the PRC's  irresponsible behavior that once again hindered U.S. efforts at  dialogue and de-escalation because once we crossed that line, it will  not be good for any nation; and that is why diplomacy is always  important.   The PRC also needs to come clean and stop pretending that this was a  civilian airship gathering weather information that accidentally veered  into the U.S. airspace. We all know, and now with the debris that we  are picking up after the responsible shooting down of the balloon in  the Atlantic Ocean, we all know that the PRC--it was a PRC surveillance  balloon, full stop, and Beijing needs to own up to it.   I thank the Biden administration for the transparency that we learned  that this was not the first time that the PRC balloon has transited  over U.S. airspace. In fact, this has happened at least three times  during the Trump administration and once before during this  administration.    We also learned that last week's incident was part of a larger PRC  global surveillance operation that has infringed on the sovereignty and  threatened the security of nations across five continents.   We read this morning, in various public forums, like The New York  Times and The Washington Post, that we have gained knowledge by  shooting this balloon down in the Atlantic Ocean. As we dig it up, we  will find more information and be able to share it with our allies so  that we can collectively make sure that the violation of sovereignty  does not continue by the PRC.   Over the weekend when this incident happened, I was talking to a  number of members of my staff and they were telling me they were in the  SCIF being informed by the administration of things that were going on.  It is that kind of transparency and information that must continue, and  I thank them for that.   Finally, let me just say that I thank the Biden administration for  bringing that balloon down. I don't believe that China thought we would  take it down. We did. We benefited from it. We have learned from it. We  are examining it. We are working with our allies to make sure that our  sovereignty is not invaded by the PRC.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman), a member of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1045     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me say that the Biden administration--we just had a  classified hearing so the questions could be asked. They have been  transparent. If there are any questions that need to be asked--as I  said earlier, my staff and other staff were informed and briefed.   The fact of the matter is the Biden administration has declassified a  lot of the information, and that is why we read it in The New York  Times today and in The Washington Post yesterday. The American people  know what is going on.   There is no secrecy in what took place. We know that there was a  decision, as indicated in the Times today, that we would get more  information by bringing it down in the Atlantic Ocean and obtaining the  balloon, looking at it, learning from it, having more of a benefit than  China did with what its civilian balloon was attempting to do. We know  that.   If there is any question that any Member of Congress has about what  took place or transpired, one, you can first just go to The New York  Times or The Washington Post; two, yesterday, Secretary of State  Blinken held a press conference; or you could have gone to the  classified hearing this morning where all the decisionmakers were  present to ask any question that you wanted to. There has been complete  transparency by the Biden administration.   Mr. Speaker, I conclude by saying there is one thing that we all  agree upon, that the United States' sovereignty was crossed by the PRC.  There is one thing that we can agree upon, that the PRC are the ones  that violated it and sent a civilian balloon not only here to the  United States but, as we have learned, over five continents.   We have to work collectively together to isolate the PRC and its  dictatorship for the harm and spying that it is doing across this  globe.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 104 is an opportunity for this body to denounce  the People's Republic of China's repeated infringement of U.S.  sovereignty. The events of the past week and our response to it,  including this resolution, reveal the PRC's irresponsible actions to  the world and demonstrate that the United States will always act to  defend our sovereignty and work with our allies.   Indeed, this balloon traveled over Canada and, as we said, over five  continents. There are conversations that our allies are having  collectively to make sure that sovereignty is preserved.   Through its measured and effective action that safeguarded civilian  life and prevented escalation, the Biden administration showcased to  the world once again that the United States is the responsible power.  By swiftly sharing information about the PRC's global surveillance  efforts, we have strengthened the confidence and trust that our allies  and partners have in us.   In short, the PRC came out on the bottom and America came out on top.   With the confidence that we will continue to do so in our competition  with the PRC, I hope that all of my colleagues join me in condemning  the PRC's violation of our sovereignty and support this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
