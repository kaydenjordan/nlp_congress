 Madam President, I rise today to emphasize the importance  of this year's National Defense Authorization Act--both why it is  important and what we must accomplish this week while we are still  here.   The primary obligation of Congress is to provide for the common  defense. For the past 57, 58-plus years, Congress has met this  obligation primarily through passage of the NDAA. With this bipartisan  legislation, we have provided our Armed Forces the resources and  authorities they need to defend our country. This bill keeps America on  track by confronting the readiness crisis in our military branches.   I am the first North Dakotan ever to serve on the Senate Armed  Services Committee, and I consider this a great honor. North Dakota is  home to two Air Force bases: Minot, which is home to two of the three  legs of the nuclear triad, the B-52 bombers and Minuteman ICBM  missiles; and one in Grand Forks, home to the RQ-4 Global Hawk mission  and, effective in just a few days, on Friday, the 319th Reconnaissance  Wing.   We are also home to multiple Army and Air National Guard units and  missions, ranging from construction and combat engineers to security  forces, to ISR and launch and recovery Reaper operations. Our Army  National Guard, in fact, has an air defense artillery regiment that  regularly protects us right here in the Capital region as part of  Operation Noble Eagle.   Our military community is a foundational element to our State as it  is to many States. To us, the NDAA is not just arbitrary funding  numbers for abstract aircraft and equipment. This legislation supports  those in my State and across the country who defend our Nation at home  and around the world.   We are honored by the outsized role our patriots play in defense of  our Nation and the cause of liberty. Our commitment to them and their  families must be clear. When they are called into action, they will  have every resource they need to carry out successful missions.   I want to address a fundamental aspect to this week's debate.  Apparently, there are some in this body who would rather bypass budget  negotiations and pass a continuing resolution. There are others who  want to delay passage of this important priority until later in the  year.   We cannot simply kick this can down the road. Passing a CR is handing  our military community months of uncertainty and anxiety and could  nullify much of the good work that we are doing here today and this  week, such as improving the livelihoods of our servicemembers. Delaying  passage to accommodate the political ambitions of a few of our  Democratic colleagues is simply unacceptable and should be dismissed as  quickly as it was suggested.   Those who offer their lives in service to our country represent the  best of what America has to offer. What they give us, we can never  repay, but we can do our best to help as they serve and transition back  to civilian life.   For example, this NDAA seeks to improve the livelihood of our  volunteer military force with benefits such as the largest pay increase  in over a decade.   It also provides personal assistance for military spouses looking for  work or hoping to retain their job after being relocated. We also  included language that encourages the Air National Guard to provide  tuition assistance.   To keep us safe from foreign adversaries, this year's NDAA bolsters  our nuclear triad with an enhanced commitment to modernization--a move  I firmly support. While recently visiting the Minot Air Force Base, I  witnessed the reality the base's airmen face every day. Our brave men  and women in uniform feel the weight of the world on their shoulders.  Yet they remain vigilant and alert--and most of the time quite  cheerful, I might add.   Deterrence works. It has always worked. Democratic and Republican  administrations over the last several decades have supported this.  Eliminating a leg of the deterrence does not eliminate the threat. The  world does not become a safe place when we remove that which keeps us  safe.   If we defied history and the military community by unilaterally  weakening our superior arsenal, as some in the House have proposed, we  would be placing the fate of the world in the hands of our adversaries.   That is not to say the bill shouldn't be amended. In fact, I want to  bring attention to a matter that wasn't included that I believe should  be. I submitted an amendment, along with a stand-alone bill, that  honors the Lost 74--the 74 Vietnam veterans who died in the sinking of  the USS Frank E. Evans, whose names are not included on the Vietnam  Memorial Wall. This year marks 50 years since they were killed off the  coast of Vietnam while serving our Nation.   Congress passed this legislation last year in the House NDAA, but it  failed to be added in conference. This year, I moved from the House to  the Senate, and so did this bill. It has received overwhelming,  bipartisan support from my colleagues here and from constituents across  the country; however, the bureaucrats in Washington remain firmly  opposed. It is inexplicable to me that bureaucrats could determine that  these sailors' ultimate sacrifice is unworthy of being memorialized  simply because they were on the wrong side of an arbitrary line. Their  disregard for these veterans has been a source of tremendous  frustration to me throughout this process. I have had my own motives  questioned. I have been told it would require too much ``work'' to  change the memorial. I have even heard fears expressed of precedent  being changed, as if finding more ways to honor the fallen and  forgotten would somehow set a bad precedent for the future. These  excuses are insufficient. The Lost 74 and the families they left behind  deserve better than this, and I have no plans to quit this fight for  them anytime soon.   But this and other possible inclusions aside, this NDAA contains  important national security efforts, including the establishment of the  U.S. Space Force. The Senate Armed Services Committee came up with a  bipartisan proposal that reduces redundancy in space programs, defines  clear leadership on space at the upper echelons of our military, and  guarantees dedicated servicemembers to the space domain. I thank my  colleagues for seeing the administration's vision and working in a  bipartisan fashion to improve it.   I led two important amendments to the Space Force proposal that were  adopted in the committee markup. The first requires that the commander  of the Space Force report directly to the Secretary of the Air Force  after the first year of establishment. The second is that the commander  of the Space Force become a permanent member of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, also after the first year of establishment. Both were supported  by the Department of Defense and should be maintained through  conference negotiations.   The first provision--reporting directly to the Secretary--ensures  that the Space Force commander has direct access to the top civilian  leadership of the Air Force, just like the Navy-Marine Corps model. The  Commandant of the Marine Corps does not report to the Chief of Naval  Operations, and neither should the Space Force commander be forced to  report to the Air Force Chief of Staff.   Reporting to the Secretary will give our space forces an equal voice  in the Air Force's budget development process. We all know that real  authority in the Pentagon is budget authority, and unless the Space  Force has a true voice in the budget process, they will never be  prioritized appropriately.   When testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Strategic  Command commander and vice chairman nominee General Hyten spoke to the  challenges of the Air Force Chief of Staff making space a priority,  stating:         We have to have somebody in the Pentagon that focuses their       total attention on space all the time. I have known every       chief of staff of the Air Force for the last 20 or 30 years,       and they've all carried space effectively into the tank.       They've all cared about space. But it is a secondary issue.    Rather than automatically relegating space to a secondary issue, the  Space Force commander should follow the Marine Corps model and report  directly to the Secretary of the Air Force.  [[Page S4491]]    In addition, the Space Force commander should be a statutory member  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Joint Chiefs, of course, are the  primary military advisers to the President. The President makes  strategic decisions on the composition and use of our national security  resources based on the counsel received from the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Without a separate, equal voice at the table, the Space Force commander  will inevitably be marginalized from critical decisionmaking and  resource allocation processes.   The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Dunford, reiterated this  point when he said that ``the key is to have individuals who are  singularly focused on space and make sure we incorporate that  perspective, that very healthy perspective, into the outcome, which is  a joint force that can fight.'' General Dunford is exactly right. The  Space Force commander should have a seat on the Joint Chiefs and bring  that singular focus of space to the table.   I understand the concerns surrounding these amendments, and I agree  with my colleagues that we should minimize overhead and unneeded  bureaucracy, which is why both of my amendments do not take effect for  a year, and the language specifically bars any new staff or additional  billets in the interim.   Last week, the ranking member of the committee cited CBO estimates on  the potential costs of these amendments. I would like to quote the same  CBO report for additional context and reference. The CBO report says  that ``the estimates in this report are for illustrative policy  options; they do not represent cost estimates for any particular piece  of legislation.''   With that in mind, I would ask the Department of Defense to take  these concerns seriously and use the 1 year to craft and present a plan  to appropriately implement these two provisions.   My colleagues' concerns are not unwarranted; however, it would be  poor policy to hamstring the Space Force from the beginning rather than  set it up for success.   It is worth noting that the House NDAA establishes a Space Corps and  takes two concrete steps directly in line with my amendments. The  leader of the Space Corps would report directly to the Secretary of the  Air Force and sit on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, without the 1-year  delay my amendment would require. The House, Senate, and Department of  Defense are largely in line with these two provisions.   The idea of the Space Force will become a reality with this year's  NDAA. The establishment process will be incremental and requires  oversight, but our first step must set the conditions to ensure its  success.   The importance of this NDAA is clear. Passing it is vital to my State  and to our Nation. It supports our troops, bolsters our nuclear  deterrence, and provides for the creation of a Space Force capable of  defending the next domain of military conflict. For these and dozens of  other reasons, I urge my colleagues to support it and pass it quickly  to demonstrate our commitment to our highest priority.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
