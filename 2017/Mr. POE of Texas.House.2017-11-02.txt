 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from  the Speaker's table the concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 28)  providing for a correction in the enrollment of S. 782, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Mr. Speaker, it is game seven of the World Series.  Best hitting team in baseball, the Houston Astros Orange, vs. the best  pitching team in baseball, the LA Dodgers Blue. The series is tied up  three games apiece.   Top of the second inning, Springer is at the plate. It is the third  pitch. Springer loads up and belts it. Home run. Springer smacks his  fifth round tripper of the World Series. The Astros are up 5-0.   Next inning--next several innings--all the bats are silent, except  LA, the best record team in baseball, gets a run.   It is the bottom of the ninth. The Astros take the field. Score: 5-1.  One out. Two outs. Houston pitcher Morton sends a sinker straight  across the plate. It is a ground ball. Three outs.   It is all over but the shouting. Astros win! Astros win! Astros win!  World Series Champions of 2017.   The championship predicted in 2014 by ``Sports Illustrated'' with  Springer on the cover finally happens after 55 years.   And the city of Houston goes ASTRO-nomical.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona  (Mr. Buck) for yielding and for doing this Special Order.   Most Members of Congress agree, I believe, that the Constitution  should be followed. There are certain rights in the Constitution that  are very, very important to all of us. One of those is the right of  privacy, enumerated specifically in the Fourth Amendment.   The Fourth Amendment is unique to America. Other countries don't have  the Fourth Amendment. We have it in the United States to protect the  privacy of Americans.  [[Page H8435]]    Let me give you a little history.   As Congressman Buck pointed out, back in 1986, which was an eternity  ago when you start talking about the digital age, Congress passed  legislation to protect the emails that people had on their server for 6  months. The idea was that people wouldn't keep their emails. They would  delete them, and 6 months was a good enough time to protect those  emails from the spies in our government--I will use that phrase, that  is my phrase--and that is the current law. But here is what has  happened over that 30 years.   Many Americans stored their emails after that 6-month period. They  store them in the cloud, for example. Americans store their schedules  in the cloud. They store photographs in the cloud.   When Americans store those items that are over 6 months old in the  cloud, they are not protected against the search by our government of  that email, of those photographs, of that schedule. In fact, searches  can take place without the knowledge of the person whose email is being  searched, without the approval of that individual, and the government  never notifies that individual that that email stored in the cloud was  searched because, under current law, the American citizen is only  protected for emails stored on their server up to 6 months.   So after about 4 years of working on this legislation with my friend  Zoe Lofgren from California, bipartisan, we presented to Congress H.R.  387, the Email Privacy Act. As Congressman Buck said, on February 7, to  be exact, of this year, that passed by voice vote on this floor, and we  sent it down the hallway to the siesta Senate to take a vote over  there, and they have yet to vote on it.   So what does that legislation do? It protects the right of privacy of  Americans. It requires government to follow the Constitution.   I was a former criminal court judge in Texas for 22 years. Like Mr.  Buck, I was also a prosecutor in the DA's office in Houston.   The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution--remembering that this is  unique to America--protects Americans, their persons, their houses,  their papers, and their personal effects from the intrusion of  government unless government has probable cause and government gets a  search warrant. That is the law. That is the Fourth Amendment.   If government has a probable cause, go get a warrant from a judge. I  signed hundreds of warrants from law enforcement as a judge.   A simple example: the government can't search our mail, snail mail as  it is now called. When you put a letter in the mailbox and the  postmaster picks it up and sends it across the fruited plain and it  lands in somebody else's mailbox, government cannot generally go into  that letter and seize it for any purpose unless they have a warrant to  do so.    There are some exceptions, but government can seize your emails after  6 months if they are stored in the cloud, as I already mentioned,  without a warrant. So this legislation basically requires government to  follow the Constitution.   We have heard about the widespread abuse--that is my opinion--of the  NSA over the last several years, the government agencies that felt like  they had a blank check to search and seize Americans' information  without their knowledge, without their approval, and without a warrant.  This legislation goes to prevent that and simply requires that  information stored in the cloud--emails, photographs, schedules, or  whatever--the government can go get it, but the government has got to  get a search warrant to seize that information.   That is what this legislation does. It protects the Fourth Amendment.  It protects Americans. It is simple legislation. It passed the House on  voice vote, yet the Senate refuses to protect Americans from unlawful  searches without the knowledge of Americans. We need to pass the  legislation that Zoe Lofgren and I have sponsored that has passed the  House to protect that basic right.   Mr. Speaker, I think our Senators would all vote ``yes'' for the  legislation. They believe in the Constitution like the rest of us. They  believe in the Fourth Amendment like the rest of us.   So let's get a vote. Another piece of legislation the House has  passed. We have done our job. We want the Senate to follow up and pass  this good legislation to make it the law of the land so Americans are  more secure in their papers and their effects and their homes.   And that is just the way it is.                                time  1915
