 Madam President, for the information of Members, I have  a brief statement.   I have some good news. We have reached an agreement to extend the  debt ceiling through early December. It is our hope that we can get  this done as soon as today.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.

I ask for the yeas and nays.    Thank you, Mr. President.   I ask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum call be  equally divided.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, as in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII, following the  disposition of the motion to discharge, the Senate resume legislative  session; that there be 3 hours for debate under the control of Senator  Lee or his designee and 1 hour under the control of the majority; that  upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the motion to  invoke cloture on the motion to concur with an amendment; that if  cloture is invoked, all postcloture time be considered expired,  amendment No. 3848 be withdrawn, and the Senate vote on the motion to  concur with the amendment; that if the motion to concur with the  amendment is agreed to, the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table without intervening action or debate; further, that  upon disposition of the House message with respect to S. 1301, the  Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No.  259; that if cloture is invoked on the nomination, all postcloture time  be considered expired and the Senate vote on the confirmation of the  nomination at 5:30 p.m., Monday, October 18.    Mr. President, in a few moments, the Senate will pass an  extension of the debt limit through early December, avoiding a first- ever, Republican-manufactured default on the national debt.   On Monday morning, I said we needed to pass a bill to address the  debt limit by the end of the week, and that is exactly what we did.   Republicans played a dangerous and risky partisan game, and I am glad  that their brinksmanship did not work. For the good of America's  families, for the good of our economy, Republicans must recognize in  the future that they should approach fixing the debt limit in a  bipartisan way.   What is needed now is a long-term solution so we don't go through  this risky drama every few months, and we hope Republicans will join in  enacting a long-term solution to the debt limit in December. We are  ready to work with them.   Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans insisted they wanted a  solution to the debt ceiling, but said Democrats must raise it alone by  going through a drawn-out, convoluted, and risky reconciliation  process. That was simply unacceptable to my caucus, and, yesterday,  Senate Republicans finally realized that their obstruction was not  going to work.   I thank very much my Democratic colleagues for our showing our unity  in solving this Republican-manufactured crisis. Despite immense  opposition from Leader McConnell and the Members of his conference, our  caucus held together and we pulled our country back from the cliff's  edge that Republicans tried to push us over.   This is a temporary but necessary and important fix. I appreciate  that, at the end of the day, we were able to raise the debt limit  without a convoluted and unnecessary reconciliation process that, until  today, the Republican leader claimed was the only way to address the  debt limit.   Let me say that again. Today's vote is proof positive that the debt  limit can be addressed without going through the reconciliation  process, just as Democrats have been saying for months.   The solution is for Republicans to either join us in raising the debt  limit or stay out of the way and let Democrats address the debt limit  ourselves. Those are the two choices, and it is very simple.   Senate Democrats want a long-term solution to the debt limit to make  sure financial markets remain stable and our economic recovery stays on  track. America's full faith and credit must never be used as a  political bargaining chip. I hope my Republican colleagues relent from  trying to make it one when we revisit this issue soon.   So now that Republican brinkmanship has relented, Senate Democrats  will focus on passing the Build Back Better agenda so we can finally  build up ladders of opportunity for people to climb up to the middle  class, to help people already in the middle class stay there, to fight  climate change, and create the good-paying jobs of tomorrow and  rekindle that sunny American optimism that has long been the course of  our national identity.   I yield the floor.    Now, Madam President, while most of the attention in  this Chamber falls on the elected Members, today I want to recognize  one of the many people who work behind the scenes, who quite literally  makes the Senate come to life, and someone we wish a fond, happy  farewell.   Megan Mercer, thank you for all you have done over the past few years  in your role as senior floor assistant. We see you scurrying around,  making sure everything works, and we so much appreciate it. Day after  day, you have made this body work, and we wish you well on the road  ahead.                            ____________________     Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 364.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum call for the cloture motion filed October 7 be waived and that  the cloture motion ripen at 11:30 a.m. on Thursday, October 19.
