 Madam Speaker, I rise today for the last time as a Member  of the 117th Congress. I do not seek to dwell on the circumstances of  my departure, although it does bring to mind a few lines from Yeats'  ``Second Coming'':         The best lack all conviction, while the worst        Are full of passionate intensity.    Perhaps it takes a cataclysm like World War I to capture the naked,  malevolent cynicism of our politics. Yeats also well captured the  harrowing consequence of elite ineptitude that precipitated the  slaughter of tens of millions:         Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;        Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.    I read and re-read those words while flying from Hamid Karzai  International Airport last August during the shameful end to 20 years  of America's war in Afghanistan.   What I saw on the ground during that waking nightmare exemplified  some of the best of the American men and women in uniform, but it also  reflected the haplessness and incompetency of American policymaking.   It is easy to question why we are here in this Chamber, what our  purpose is, and what it is we seek to achieve. I did not enter this  body as some wide-eyed innocent; three years in war zones had stripped  me of that.   But what I did not anticipate until I got here was how many of the  problems we are confronting are problems of Congress' own making.   Look at Afghanistan. Across the rotunda, we are fighting an uphill  battle to pass the Afghan Adjustment Act so that our allies who have  risked their lives to support our operations aren't deported back to  the same hell that 13 American servicemembers sacrificed their lives to  rescue them from.   This should not be a Herculean task. Yet, Senators have the privilege  of wrapping their hands around the neck of critical legislation and  strangling it in back rooms. If they want to slit the throat of the  Afghan Adjustment Act, then let them do it on the Senate floor in full  view of the allies and veterans they are betraying.   The reason in the first place why we have to pass the Afghan  Adjustment Act is due to the failure of our war in Afghanistan--a  failure abetted by decades of Congress' lax oversight of the President  and his Department of Defense.   To solve this, I pushed for Congress to take back its war powers, to  take back that constitutional responsibility. But even when it comes to  Congress asserting its own prerogative, this body has shown itself  unwilling to do its job.   The current budget negotiations taking place on the other side of the  rotunda also show a Congress unwilling to confront the very basic task  of passing a budget on time. The last time we had a budget passed  before the fiscal year started, I was in second grade. And here we sit,  72 hours before a government shutdown, while the Senate pats itself on  the back for dropping a 4,155-page omnibus bill at 2 a.m. yesterday  morning.   When Congress is incapable of solving problems of its own making, how  can the American people have any faith that we can tackle the problems  arising from the broader world?   What hope do we have of out-competing China and of winning this  coming century if we can't even get out of a mess of our own making?   We need the best to regain their convictions, to set an example of  what clear-eyed leadership looks like both at home and abroad. We need  to hold the worst to account and reprise the moral resolve that has led  us through dark times in this country many, many times before.   Too many have sacrificed too much for us to squander the opportunity  before us, the opportunity to rise to the challenge of this moment, to  set aside petty squabbles, the opportunity to build on the promise of  limited government, economic freedom, and individual liberty--the  promise that underpins the American Dream.   While I will not be in the 118th Congress to fight for the government  our great people deserve, I remain steadfast to my commitment to make  our Nation at last worthy of the sacrifices made in its name. And I  pray that the next Congress learns from the mistakes of the last 2  years, that we learn from the mistakes of decades before, and that we  have the courage necessary to fulfill the promise of a government of  the people, by the people, and for the people.                            ____________________
