 Madam Speaker, this week marks a heroic milestone for  millions of America's retirees as the House  [[Page H7225]]  finally considers the Butch Lewis Act. This bill moves America one step  closer to restoring its broken pension promises to 1,300,000 pensioners  across our Nation.   Today I met with another 50 retirees from trucking firms, candy  manufacturers, miners, and others in Ohio whose futures are at risk in  their golden years. Their top concern is economic security.   I heard the stresses they have endured since receiving letters  threatening pension cuts of up to 70 percent of their earned pensions.  Worry between family members, increased suicides amongst pensioner  friends, anxiety and growing health concerns. This isn't the retirement  hardworking Americans earned.   Valorie Shapler, a retired Roadway Express truck driver, is suffering  from brain cancer. She is fighting for her life daily, and why should  she have to worry about the pension cuts that she earned?   Vicki Bailey, a widow of a trucker, raised their family but already  struggles to survive on her spousal benefits that were cut in half with  her husband's passing, and she has her own health issues to worry  about.   Jim Baumgartner asked for a prayer.   How can Congress ignore the pleas of millions of hardworking  Americans?   Pensions have afforded millions of retired middle-class people some  economic security in their retirement years. Please let our colleagues  join us in broad bipartisan passage of the Butch Lewis Act tomorrow.                            ____________________
