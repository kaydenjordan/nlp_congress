 Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Wendy  DiVecchio on becoming the chief executive officer of the Greater Las  Vegas Association of Realtors, GLVAR. It gives me great pleasure to  recognize DiVecchio's recent success and her dedication to the great  State of Nevada.   Founded in 1947, GLVAR has always led our State in professionalism.  GLVAR, the Nevada representative for the National Association of  Realtors, is the largest professional organization within southern  Nevada, providing 13,000 of its members educational resources,  professional training, and political representation. GLVAR has truly  made an impact on our State, specifically in Las Vegas.   As a longtime resident of Las Vegas, DiVecchio has served in several  different departments within the GLVAR for over 17 years, holding many  of the company's crucial positions. Over the years, DiVecchio served as  educational director, national chairwoman for local and State Realtor  associations, and interim CEO. Recognizing her exceptional efforts,  DiVecchio also earned the Realtor Certified Executive designation from  the National Association of Realtors. While working full-time at GLVAR,  she also earned a bachelor's and master's degree in business management  from the University of Phoenix.   In her new role, DiVecchio will oversee more than 30 employees and  all other aspects of the GLVAR, including its move into a new  headquarters located in southern Las Vegas. Although she will be faced  with more responsibility, DiVecchio has proven she is up to the task  and will succeed to her fullest potential.   As Nevada's senior Senator, I applaud DiVecchio's impressive feats  and commend her for demonstrating such valuable commitment and loyalty  to GLVAR. I am both humbled and honored by her hard work, and I am  proud to call her a fellow Nevadan. Today I ask all of my colleagues to  join me in congratulating Wendy DiVecchio on her recent promotion to  GLVAR's CEO and wish her well in her future endeavors. I give my  deepest appreciation for all that she has done for the Silver  State.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Stacey  Escalante of Las Vegas. Stacey is a Nevada mother who battled cancer  and won. Ever since she defeated cancer, Stacey has taken herself to  new heights and translated her strength into action. Her story makes us  all proud to call Nevada home.   Stacey Escalante was diagnosed with stage 3 skin cancer over 10 years  ago when she was still a news reporter for KVBC, now KSNV-TV. Up until  this point, she was a model for health, but as we all know, cancer is a  disease of its own. After several medical procedures, constant trips to  the doctor, Stacey had to endure years of screenings and follow-up  medical procedures before the cancer finally went into remission.  During this time, she was forced to take a leave of absence from her  job in order to recover. Even worse, she had to spend an extended  period of time away from her family and friends.   During this recovery, Stacey wanted to come back home. She knew she  would recover if she got to be at home surrounded by her family and  coworkers who cared deeply about her. Fortunately, Stacey was able to  return home and be with her family and friends; there she continued to  fight cancer tooth and nail.   After she recovered, Stacey didn't just go back to work and pick up  where she left off. Instead, Stacey became a cancer survivor, willing  to stand up for cancer patients and those unware of the dangers that  tanning beds can cause to the human body. Stacey also remains  incredibly active, a hard-working single mom who is still dedicated to  living a healthy lifestyle. Despite time away from her career, Stacey  worked through the setbacks and is now a publicist at Orca  Communications and continues to have an exciting career in public  relations.   Stacey's battle with cancer and getting to where she is today is a  testament to her determination. She has a passionate story to tell, and  I believe that she will continue to inspire others to do the same. She  epitomizes what it means to fight back and go even further by spreading  the word about the dangers posed by tanning beds and advocate for other  women's health issues. I am truly inspired by her story.   I am both humbled and honored to acknowledge Stacey Escalante for her  perseverance and willingness to share her story and get involved to  make the great State of Nevada an even stronger, healthier State. I  wish her continued efforts the absolute best. I will continue to pray  for her as well as her wonderful family and friends who stood by her  side every step of the way.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate LTC  Matt Jonkey on completing his master of arts degree in security studies  at the Naval Postgraduate School Center for Homeland Defense and  Security, CHDS. It gives me great pleasure to recognize him for his  recent success and his continued dedication to serving the great State  of Nevada.   CHDS is our Nation's epicenter for homeland security education  located at the Naval Postgraduate School, NPS. Among the many programs  CHDS offers, its masters program is exceptionally prestigious and  provides its graduates with a vast array of useful skills.  Additionally, the program offers extensive analysis of the security  operation within the United States. To complete this intense 18-month  program, CHDS graduates must exercise unconventional critical thinking  skills, advanced leadership tactics, and develop a comprehensive  understanding of security policy and operations.   In addition to graduating from the University of Nevada at Reno with  a bachelor's degree in criminal justice, lieutenant colonel Jonkey also  managed to build an impressive career within the Nevada National Guard.  He has held several positions with many responsibilities, ranging from  aviation management to weapons of mass destruction response. Currently,  lieutenant colonel Jonkey serves as commander of the 92nd WMD-CST where  he oversees the Nevada National Guard's response to weapons of mass  destruction and other HAZMAT-related disasters in support of civil  authorities. Furthermore, lieutenant colonel Jonkey is also an  outstanding father to his two daughters and a loving husband to his  wife, Ashley.   During his time in the CHDS program, lieutenant colonel Jonkey  engaged in strategic and organizational debate with high-level,  national security operatives across the country. Additionally,  lietuenant colonel Jonkey  [[Page S1741]]  completed a thesis on government drones and the Department of Defense's  abilities to respond to homeland disasters. After a rigorous 18-month  online and in-residence program, lietuenant colonel Jonkey graduated  from the CHDS program on December 16, 2016.   I commend lieutenant colonel Jonkey for his unwavering dedication to  his career and his courageous contributions to Nevada. His character is  truly admirable and stands as a shining example for future generations.  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I applaud  lieutenant colonel Jonkey's steadfast allegiance to the Silver State  and his determination to complete this highly esteemed milestone.   I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me in congratulating  lieutenant colonel Matt Jonkey for his recent achievement and his  service to Nevada. I wish him the best of luck in all of his future  endeavors.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 100th  birthday of Robert K. Schratz, a WWII veteran and an incredible family  man. I am proud to honor him for reaching such an impressive milestone  in his life, and I want to acknowledge his unwavering courage and  service to our Nation.   Mr. Schratz, an avid outdoorsman and Eagle Scout, was born in  Pittsburgh, PA, on January 25, 1917. As a graduate from Carnegie Tech  with a degree in civil engineering, Schratz went on to work for the  Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad as a design engineer. However, after  the attack on Pearl Harbor, he enlisted into the U.S. Army Air Corps.   In 1944, Schratz graduated from the Air Corps as a multiengine pilot  and a second lieutenant. He flew over 168 missions, including the  Berlin Airlift, and served a 4-year Pentagon assignment. Over several  years, Schratz was stationed all over the world, including Texas,  Mississippi, Washington, DC, Alabama, England, Germany, and Japan.  Schratz was also stationed at Stead Air Force Base in Nevada, a place  he truly admired and would eventually call home. After retiring from  the Air Force as a lieutenant colonel, Schratz and his beloved wife,  Barbara, permanently moved to Reno, NV, where Schratz worked for the  City of Reno Engineer's office for over a decade.   As a World War II veteran, Schratz's commitment to his country and  his dedication to his family and community will be preserved for  generations to come. As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs  Committee, I recognize that Congress has a responsibility to honor  these brave individuals, and I remain committed to upholding this  promise for veterans and servicemembers in Nevada and throughout the  Nation.   Additionally, I am pleased to recognize Schratz for passing on his  legacy of serving our country through several generations. Lieutenant  Colonel Schratz's son, Robert K. Schratz II, served as a captain in the  U.S. Marine Corps while his son, Mark Schratz, also served in the U.S.  Air Force. His grandson, Wayne Cates, served in the U.S. Navy, and his  great-granddaughter, Hospital Corpsman Third Class Emily Cates,  currently serves in the U.S. Navy. I truly commend these members of the  Schratz family and am grateful for their devotion to protecting our  Nation's freedoms.   I applaud Robert K. Schratz for his courageous contributions to the  United States of America and to freedom-loving nations around the  world. His service to his country and his bravery and dedication to his  family and community earn him a place among the outstanding men and  women who have valiantly defended our Nation. Today I am honored to  commend Mr. Schratz and celebrate an inspiring milestone achieved by  such an upstanding Nevadan.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a great  small business and charitable organization that is leading by example,  serving the community, and making a difference in the great State of  Nevada. Chanthy Walsh and her husband own a nonprofit restaurant called  KIT's Kitchen, which is located in Henderson, NV. The name stems from  the nonprofit foundation they run called Kids in Transition. Both  organizations work side by side to help those in need.   Since November 2016, KIT's Kitchen has been training underprivileged  youth, while providing affordable meals to the local community. This  restaurant provides its volunteers with real work experience and  teaches them what it takes to succeed in the restaurant and hospitality  industry. To me, it is more than just learning about the restaurant;  these kids are being taught hard work, about giving back to their  community, and what it means to make a commitment and be held  accountable to it--values that go beyond the workplace.   In addition to their impressive restaurant, Mrs. Walsh and her  husband, Tim, direct a nonprofit called the Kids in Transition  Foundation, which is designed to help young people build a successful  career. This foundation provides meals, scholarships, financial aid,  and mentoring advice to Nevada's youth. Together, these efforts are  building a better future for Nevada.   As a father, I understand firsthand how much of an asset Chanthy  Walsh and her work is to the Silver State. Considering these young  Nevadans are the future, I am proud to see Ms. Walsh strive to make  Nevada brighter every single day. It is this dedication to community  and giving back that makes a difference in so many people's lives.   Today I ask my colleagues and all Nevadans to join me and recognizing  this organization, its employees, and its impressive leader. Chanthy  Walsh provides an outstanding service to the local community and to our  great State. As Nevada's senior Senator, I am humbled by her efforts  and a true commitment to making a difference in people's lives. I hope  others can look to her for inspiration on how to make their community a  better place for everyone.                            ____________________
