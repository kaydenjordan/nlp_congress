 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I thank  him for his extraordinary leadership, historic, really, for giving us  this opportunity today to do something very special for the American  people, for America's working families.   This is an historic day, yes, because we are raising the minimum wage  here in the House of Representatives, because we are channeling the  energy of so many people across the country for fairness in the  workplace, but it also happens to be the 171st anniversary of the  Seneca Falls Convention.   The Seneca Falls Convention shook the world, when they had that  convention, with the simple proclamation that all men and women are  created equal.   This bill achieves that equality, giving nearly 20 million working  women, that is nearly one-third of all working women, a raise. And it  helps narrow the gender wage gap that disproportionately targets women  of color, putting more money in the pockets of more than one-third of  working women of color.                                time  1015    Today, we wake up for a day of jubilation because of the sense of  fairness that this legislation engenders. We wake up every morning with  a smile on our face, showing the world all the love in our hearts, and  that love in our hearts is about fairness for the American people.   It is interesting to note, Mr. Speaker, as has been acknowledged--as  I just heard Congressman Levin mention, and others, as well--that it  has been 10 years since the Federal minimum wage was raised in the  previous Democratic majority. It had been 11 years before then, when we  passed it in 2007, and it was signed by President Bush.   It was bipartisan, and we were thrilled about that.   It is interesting to see what has happened in the time since then.  While families work hard to make ends meet, the cost of living has  surged to unsustainable highs. Inflation has eaten nearly 20 percent of  their wages, and the GOP special interest agenda has left them far  behind.   I mentioned that this is about equality for women. It is also about  30 million people in our country getting a raise--30 million people-- and so many people being lifted out of poverty.   I talked about 2007. That is when we first passed it in the House. It  took a little more time for it to be law, going through the Senate and  the rest.   When we passed it, we were so thrilled, knowing that the President  [[Page H7107]]  would sign it. We had a big rally outside the Capitol. As soon as the  rally was finished, Senator Ted Kennedy, who had been a really  important part of the Senate action on raising the minimum wage, said:  ``You know what we have to do now? We have to raise the minimum wage!''   We always have to be injecting fairness, all the time. We must never  stop fighting to honor the dignity of work and pushing forward for  working families and women, again, affected so drastically in all of  this.   American workers deserve a raise. No one can live with dignity on a  $7.25 per hour wage. Can you?   The Raise the Wage Act honors workers and supports families, giving  33 million Americans a long-overdue raise and lifting many out of  poverty.   The bill grows our economy, increasing families' purchasing power,  which drives economic growth that lifts up all communities. The  consumer confidence of America's working families is an important  element in growing our economy.   It brings our democracy closer to the founding ideals, upholding the  bedrock idea of fairness in our country, that hard work deserves a  decent wage.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong, bipartisan vote for this victory for  working families and for America because every Member of this  institution should be fighting to put more money in the pockets of  workers in their community.
