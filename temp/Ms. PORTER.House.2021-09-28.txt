 Madam Speaker, the climate crisis is a ticking time bomb.  The country that figures out how to defuse it will get huge returns on  their investments.   That is why our global competitor nations are investing in green  energy. They know that the economy that learns how to manufacture in  the cleanest way possible will secure thousands of jobs for its  workers. These are jobs in manufacturing and also in research,  engineering, and education.   In short, the country that best understands green energy today will  have the strongest economy tomorrow. That can and should be the United  States.   I am proud to represent the scientists at the University of  California Irvine who are doing cutting-edge research on fuel cell  energy storage, energy conversion, and more. We have to support the  work of their peers.   To have a strong, stable, and globally competitive economy, we need  green energy. For Orange County, for the United States, and for our  planet, we cannot continue to rely on the technology of yesterday.                            ____________________
