Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes on the  floor to answer the calls I am getting into my office, the texts and  the emails I am getting with people asking: What is going on? What is  happening in the U.S. Senate? They can't keep track of what it is we  have moved to.   We don't know either.   We are here probably all night waiting for the majority to finally  produce the bill that they will use to attempt to repeal and maybe  replace--or not--the Affordable Care Act.   All we know is, every single proposal that has been brought forward  in recent days has two features: It reduces coverage, and it raises  costs.   It may be that 16 million Americans will lose healthcare coverage. It  might be 20 million, might be 32 million. Those are different scores  for different proposed bills.   It may raise costs by 15 percent, 20 percent, or 30 percent. Sometime  later tonight, we will see the final bill presented on this floor, and  hopefully we will get some score so we know what we are voting on  before we finally get there, but what is so scary to families I am  hearing from, is that after 7 months of majority rule, where the  Republican Party controls the Senate, House, and White House, we don't  have a finished bill for us to debate tonight in detail, and we don't  know yet exactly what we will vote on later tonight. We just know a  simple theme--every proposal that has been brought forward when scored  by the CBO, the independent scorekeeper, offers less coverage and  higher costs.   Folks, I want to remind you about something because I just ran into a  family out on the steps of the Capitol, outside the building, not  inside the building--a family who is raising two typical children and  one child with Down syndrome, a family where the father of the family  is Active-Duty U.S. military. They asked me: ``Why can't we be heard?''   The process that brought us here tonight did not include committee  hearings, where doctors, nurses, patient advocates, folks who run  hospitals, or folks who are specialists on insurance were heard.   In a press conference earlier this evening, four of our colleagues  said they are going to vote for this bill later tonight so it can go to  conference and get fixed. They said the current expected skinny repeal  bill is a fraudulent disaster, to paraphrase a colleague.   Well, what I really think we should do is heed the advice that  Senator McCain laid out on the floor a few days ago and go back to  regular order.   Just earlier today, there was an inspiring moment when we took up and  passed by a vote of 97 to 2 the Russia  [[Page S4396]]  sanctions bill. We heard the chair and ranking Republican and Democrat  of the Foreign Relations Committee speak positively of each other and  positively of the process and they said the outcome is in the best  interest of our country.   As we have seen, we don't always follow regular order. Both parties  have responsibility for moving things over the years without fully  consulting each other and without going through the committee process.  I think this is the moment where we should look at what happened  earlier today on this very floor and follow that process, where the  committees are included and consulted, and where we find a bipartisan  resolution to what ails America. I am afraid that is not what is going  to happen, and later tonight we will be forced to vote for or against a  bill that raises healthcare costs for Americans and lowers the number  of Americans who get healthcare coverage. If that is the case, this  Senator will vote no.   Thank you.   With that, I yield the floor to my colleague from Connecticut.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.
