 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my appreciation to  this august body for unanimously passing H. Res. 1253. I also want to  thank Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy for their  support of the passage of this resolution.   This resolution honors the life and legacy of Joseph H. Rainey, a  fellow South Carolinian, who, on December 12, 1870, became the first  African American to serve in the United States House of  Representatives, blazing the trail that provided the path that I am  honored to be on today.   With the passage of this resolution, the House permanently recognizes  Congressman Rainey's remarkable achievement 150 years ago from  Saturday. They are honoring him by renaming H-150 on the first floor of  this building, which is the room in which he met at the time he was a  member of the Committee on Indian Affairs, on which he served from 1873  to 1875.                            ____________________
