 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my legislation, the  Forever GI Bill Housing Payment Fulfillment Act, which will hold the  Department of Veterans Affairs accountable for properly and  retroactively paying student veterans the educational housing benefits  they have earned.   This legislation, introduced in response to the VA's failure to  comply with the reimbursement rates set by the Forever GI Bill,  requires the VA to correct all delayed payments and underpayments no  later than January 1, 2020.   The Forever GI Bill provides housing benefits to thousands of  Kentucky's active military reservists and veterans as they pursue  higher education.   Our Nation's veterans deserve better than to face financial distress,  or even eviction, as a result of inaccurate or late payments. This  legislation will remedy this undue hardship placed on veteran students  and provide oversight and accountability to ensure these payments are  made in a timely manner in the future.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation  to provide relief and certainty to our Nation's veterans, and I look  forward to its swift passage.                            ____________________
