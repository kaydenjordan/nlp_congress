 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting Chair. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This is a dangerous amendment. The Trump administration withdrew from  the INF Treaty because Russia had been cheating on this treaty for  years. The only country that was in compliance with the INF Treaty was  the United States, and we were handcuffing ourselves by putting  limitations on our ability to respond to threats from Russia or China  since we were the only country in the world complying with it.   China was not a signatory to the INF Treaty. This was, like was said,  signed 32 years ago. China was not the military power that it is today.  It was not a party to this treaty.   Going forward, I would love to see some kind of treaty between the  U.S. and Russia and China, but that is not in the works if this  amendment is passed. This ignores China.   China has more missiles in the Pacific region than anyone else in the  world. They have more, certainly, than the United States. So that is  another flaw with this amendment.   Russia has been cheating on this, and to say we are going to comply  with the terms of the treaty regardless of what Russia does is to  reward them for their cheating.   One other key point that makes this a dangerous amendment is because  it would prevent the testing necessary for the growth of our missile  defense program. The INF Treaty that this would put us back into--in a  backdoor kind of way--prohibits testing or deployment of missiles with  the range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers. Those are the kinds of tests that  we need to be able to do to test our missile defense systems.   The Department of Defense stated, just a couple of days ago:         Land-based missiles required to support ballistic missile       defense system flight testing also have ranges between 500       and 5,500 kilometers. Loss of target missile capability would       likely prohibit upcoming missile defense flight tests       requiring such target missiles.    And they go on to say:         This will limit the warfighter. It will limit our missile       defense capabilities.    That is a dangerous thing.   There is some dispute over whether allies like Israel would be  included in this ban of test vehicles. I will leave that for another  discussion, but it is a serious issue.   It would certainly prohibit our testing of our missile defense  systems between the range of 500 to 5,500 kilometers. That would  cripple our growth of missile defense for the future. That doesn't make  the world a safer place. It certainly doesn't make the United States a  safer place.   So, for all of those reasons, Mr. Chairman, this is a bad amendment,  and I would urge that we reject it and vote ``no.''   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would like to inquire how much time both  sides have remaining.  [[Page H5622]]     Mr. Chair, I am going to make a brief statement and then  yield to the gentleman from Ohio.   First, let me say that this doesn't just put us back in the INF,  which would be bad enough. This puts us in a worse posture than the  INF. This amendment is more stringent on our ability to develop our  defensive capabilities than the INF would be.   Specifically, the INF has an exemption for interceptors; this does  not. So we can't do interceptor tests. We could have under INF, but we  can't under this amendment.   And, also, there is an exception for ballistic missiles without  warheads for testing our defenses. That is in INF; it is not in this  amendment. This is worse than the INF, which is bad enough.   I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Turner).    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We have had this discussion on emoluments, and I hope that my  colleague saw the newspaper today. Here is the newspaper, The  Washington Times, front page: ``Court rejects lawsuit over Trump  business. Maryland, D.C. slammed down.''   So, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has said one of the lawsuits  out there is baseless.   But there is actually more going on here. This is kind of an  embarrassing amendment. I am sorry that we are even debating this. This  is a blatantly political amendment.   We are supposed to be here talking about providing the equipment and  the training for our men and women in uniform, so they can preserve and  save and keep our country secure, and this is just an attempt to  embarrass the President.   It is a political amendment. It is really not worthy of discussion in  the National Defense Authorization Act, and I don't think we should be  wasting our time on this. It is really not worthy of the American  people either.   Let me give an example on how silly and how ridiculous this amendment  is. According to the language of this amendment, if the President goes  to one of these properties and stays, like Mar-a-Lago down in Florida,  I guess he could have Secret Service. They are not paid out of DOD  dollars. They are paid out of Homeland Security dollars. But he  couldn't take the people with him who carry the nuclear football or the  communications people who keep him in touch with the command and  control of our nuclear enterprise if, God forbid, there was some kind  of crisis or emergency.   This has not been thought out. It is totally ridiculous. Who would  want to put a President of the United States through that kind of  jumping through hoops and obstacles to fulfill his duties as Commander  in Chief?   I think it is ridiculous. It is not worthy of us.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining on each side?    Mr. Chair, I will make one brief comment and then yield  the remainder of my time to the gentleman from Ohio.   The President isn't in this to get rich. He has given up his salary.   Mr. Chair, with that, I would like to yield the balance of my time to  the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Just like the last amendment, this is not worthy of us as a body. We  should be here debating the National Defense Authorization Act; how to  equip and train our men and women in uniform so they can protect our  country.   This is a blatant, cheap shot against the President. It is just a  political potshot, and it is really not worthy of us as a body.   This is a very poorly-written amendment, on top of all that. I think  we would all agree, we shouldn't have political displays by a  Commander-in-Chief, or anyone in the government, for that matter, where  public dollars are involved.   But what about patriotic displays? Is there anything wrong with that?   Let me give you a couple of examples of things that would be  prohibited by this poorly-written amendment.   Every year, you have the Army, Navy, and Air Force playing football  against each other for the Commander's Cup. And especially when the Air  Force and Navy play each other, they have these flyovers. They each  have wonderful aviation capabilities, and they will do a flyover of the  stadium, whether it is in Annapolis, or in my district in Colorado  Springs.   This is written so broadly, you couldn't have any kind of  authorized--any kind of--where's the word--exhibition. You could have  no exhibition of military arms.   So if the President was attending that football game, you couldn't  have the flyover. How silly is that?   Or if a President goes to a change of command down at Fort Bragg,  something like that, you couldn't have the military vehicles present  there that would be present normally at a change of command.   Mr. Chairman, those are just a couple of examples of how poorly  written this amendment is.   So I would say, let's reject it. Let's get serious. Let's get back to  the business of talking about what our men and women in uniform need,  and not take these silly potshots against the President.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining on each side?    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert), who is a member of the Committee on Oversight and  Reform.  [[Page H5636]]         Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1700     Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, if you care about our warfighters who are  in theater tonight, this is the worst possible cut that we could give  the Department of Defense.   This says that overseas operations, where they are actually in places  like Afghanistan or Syria or Iraq, we are going to take the dollars  they are using to operate and stay safe and get the job done, and we  are whacking one-third off of that budget. We are taking a meat-cleaver  approach, not a scalpel. This is a meat-cleaver approach.   Besides the things that the chairman mentioned that would be cut  working with allies, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance  would be cut, ISR.                                time  1830    When our commanders have forces going out on a patrol, those patrols  want overhead observation before them, over them, behind them. That is  the kind of thing directly cut by this amendment.   When the troops come back, and the equipment has to be refurbished  and reset, that is cut by this amendment.   Mr. Chair, this is a very poorly thought out amendment, and I would  urge everyone to vote ``no.''    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his leadership on this important issue.   Just so everyone will know, HAATS stands for the High-Altitude Army  Aviation Training Site. There is only one such site in the United  States, and that is in the mountains of western Colorado, and it  happens to be in Representative Tipton's district.   A lot of the people who train there with rotary aircraft come from  Fort Carson, which is in my district. I know there is interest from  other members of the Colorado delegation. They have had legislation  that would designate nearby areas, or even that area, as a wilderness  site.   But I want to talk about the importance of this to the Army. This is  high-altitude training. So, for rotary wing pilots who are going to be  going to places like Afghanistan, this is a unique training  opportunity.   The high altitude, the change of weather, the mountainous conditions,  and the valleys and hills and mountain peaks really make for an amazing  training experience. And it has saved lives.   I know Representative Tipton is going to have one story. I will give  another.   Just in this last couple of months, a couple of skiers from Vail were  lost, and there was a search and rescue effort that was undertaken.  With the help of helicopter pilots who had been trained, who were in  the Army National Guard, I believe, they were able to find those skiers  and rescue them without loss of life or injury, even, and it was a  great success story.   That high-altitude training site has led to many lives being saved,  so it is an asset for our country. It is a gem; it is a jewel; and it  must be protected at all costs.   Madam Chair, I appreciate Representative Tipton's leadership on this  issue.
