 Mr. President, today, the Senate continues its steady  progress in improving highly qualified nominees to serve in the  executive branch. Last night, the Senate confirmed Dr. Miguel Cardona  as the Secretary of Education, fulfilling President Biden's promise to  elevate someone with public school experience. Gina Raimondo will soon  become the former Governor of Rhode Island as she prepares to take on  the top job at the Commerce Department. Pending the Senate's approval,  Dr. Cecilia Rouse will soon become the Chair of the Council of Economic  Advisers.   This morning, I want to pause for a moment to recognize the historic  nature of the nominees whom President Biden has nominated and the  Senate has confirmed in the first month of the Nation's administration.   So far, the Senate has promoted the first Black Secretary of Defense  and the first woman to serve as Deputy Secretary of Defense.   After an unbroken streak of 77 male Secretaries in a row, all the way  back to Alexander Hamilton, the Senate confirmed the first woman to  serve as Treasury Secretary.   By the end of the day, we will have confirmed the first Black woman  to lead the Council of Economic Advisers, the first Latino and first  immigrant to lead the Department of Homeland Security, the second Black  woman to serve as U.N. Ambassador, the third Latino to serve as  Education Secretary, and the first openly gay Secretary of any Cabinet  Agency.   Cabinet Agencies, we all know, have an immense influence over the  policy of the United States. It is critical for their leaders to have  lived experiences that represent the broad spectrum of Americans those  Agencies serve. Not only that, but the nominees I just mentioned are  some of the most qualified public servants in America and are already  hard at work at delivering results for the American people.   The Senate will continue to confirm more nominees as quickly as  possible. The process can certainly move more quickly with the  cooperation of our Republican colleagues, whose States and constituents  benefit equally from having these qualified nominees in place.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on COVID-19, as early as tomorrow, the  Senate will begin work on the American Rescue Plan. As the country  faces a series of historic challenges, we must meet the moment with a  historic response.  [[Page S966]]    Millions of jobs and trillions of dollars have been taken out of our  economy. Thousands of small businesses are holding on for dear life.  Tens of millions of Americans are struggling with the rent, groceries,  medicine, and utilities.   Only a week ago, the United States crossed the tragic milestone of  half a million deaths from COVID-19, a stark reminder that the pandemic  isn't done with us yet.   Over the past year, Congress has stepped up to the plate to pass  important relief measures, but the job is not complete. The American  Rescue Plan is designed to finish the job; to patch up the holes in our  economy and lay a foundation for recovery; to keep struggling  businesses, families, and workers afloat until brighter days appear on  the horizon; to send our children back to school as quickly and safely  as possible; and to defeat this evil disease once and for all.   That is what the American people sent us here to do. That is what our  government is for--not to sit back and wait for problems to fix  themselves, not to cross our fingers and hope the economy will recover  on its own. Our job is to end, through action, the current state of the  crisis and hasten the day when our country and all of our lives can  return to normal.   The bottom line, if you look at the trajectory, every time we put in  a relief bill--in March, the economy got better in June, and July. We  put a relief bill in December, and now the numbers look a little better  for January.   But the economy is not strong enough to sustain things on its own. We  need strong relief to get the economy going so it can continue on an  upward path on its own. That is what this bill is designed to do. I  fear--most economists, Secretary Yellen, Chairman Powell--if we do too  little or nothing, the economy could stay mired in recession for all  too long a time, just as it did when we didn't do enough in 2009, and  the economy stayed in recession for many years after the financial  crisis.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on voting rights, in our American system,  we talk a lot about ``perfecting our Union,'' a reference to the  preamble of the Constitution, a document which effectively gave only  White male landowners the right to vote in our fledgling democracy.  Suffice it to say, there is a lot of perfecting to do.   As I think about my Democratic caucus--incidentally, it is probably  so that less than half of them could actually vote in the elections of  1789 because I believe in many States you had to be White, male,  Protestant, a property owner--not so many of those around here.   Over the course of 230 years, we passed scores of laws and amended  the Constitution to reflect the flaws in our democracy and expand the  franchise to all our citizens, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964,  the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the 14th, 15th, 19th, 23rd, 24th, 26th  amendments--just to name a few.   Despite all this progress, there is now, in the 21st century, a  concerted effort to roll back voting rights in State legislatures  across the country, alarmingly making it harder--harder--for Americans  to vote and particularly aimed at Americans of color--African  Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans. And it is becoming a feature  of one of America's major political parties.   Yesterday, I detailed a number of laws pushed by Republicans in State  legislatures to limit the amount of time that Americans have to vote,  to frustrate election administration in urban areas and around college  campuses, to impose overly burdensome ID requirements, absurd witness  and signature requirements for absentee ballots. Maybe the most  pernicious of all, Republicans in Georgia have coalesced around a plan  to end all early voting on Sundays, a day when Black churches organize  voter drives, with no good reason--again, none.   The threat to voting rights in America is now very real. It must be  opposed in every State house and Governor's mansion in this country.   And the threat extends all the way to the Supreme Court of the United  States. Eight years ago, a conservative 5-to-4 majority on the Court  gutted the Voting Rights Act by essentially rendering meaningless  section 5 of the statute, a provision which prevented the  implementation of undue voting restrictions in a State with a history  of discrimination.   Chief Justice Roberts suggested that the era of widespread  discrimination, which led to the enactment of the Voting Rights Act,  was over, and there was no longer a need for the critical portions of  the statute. Well, within 24 hours after the ruling had been handed  down, Texas announced it would implement a strict voter ID law, and  soon thereafter, Mississippi and Alabama followed with laws that had  previously been barred by the Justice Department.   Republican leaders in the State of North Carolina passed a suite of  voter suppression laws that a Federal judge found targeted African- American voters ``with . . . surgical precision.'' Think about that.  This was not a ruling from the Reconstruction Era or Jim Crow. It was  only a few years ago.   At a time when an African-American man elected by the most diverse  coalition in the history of American politics occupied the White House,  Republicans in North Carolina passed voting laws so pernicious that  even the Roberts Court--among the most conservative we have seen on  this issue of voting rights--could not ignore the overwhelming stench  of discrimination. That is what it was--a stench rooted in America's  sordid history of voter suppression and discrimination against Black  voters.   Well, today the Supreme Court will hear another case concerning the  Voting Rights Act, this time about section 2, a section which Chief  Justice Roberts referred to in the Shelby County ruling as a necessary  failsafe to police discriminatory voting procedures nationwide   As one news outlet reported this morning, ``there is every  possibility that the high court could make it more difficult, or  practically impossible, to challenge voting restrictions in the  future,'' warning that another ruling against the law could render the  Voting Rights Act ``a dead letter.''   That is what is at stake in America right now. As State legislatures  move to restrict voting rights from one end of the country to the  other, the law we rely on to prevent outright discrimination at the  ballot box is at risk of being ``a dead letter.'' This is one of the  most appalling things I have seen in this country after 4 years of an  appalling administration. This is just incredible. It burns my blood  and should burn the blood of every fair-minded American--Republican,  Democrat, Independent, liberal, conservative.   After centuries of expanding the right to vote, of struggling to get  that right to vote, these pernicious, self-serving proposed laws cut  back on the right to vote. Will the Supreme Court let that happen? It  is so against what America is all about.   We cannot stand by and do nothing as these rights are diluted or  stripped away. Congress must pursue a restoration of the Voting Rights  Act, and by all accounts should be working in a bipartisan way to make  it easier, safer, and more convenient for all Americans to vote. The  judgment of history has never been kind to those who work against the  full participation of their fellow citizens in our democratic  experiment.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, and the  President be immediately notified of Senate's action.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.

I now ask for a second reading, and in order to place  the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to  my own request, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I move to adjourn until 7:09 p.m. today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and the Senate be in a period of morning business with Senators  permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand that there are two bills at  the desk due for a second reading en bloc.

Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:11 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, March 3, 2021, at 12 noon.                            ____________________
