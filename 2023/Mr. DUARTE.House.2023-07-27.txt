 Mr. Speaker, today, I stand before you to express my  support for S.J. Res. 9. My colleagues and I have deep concerns about  the harms of listing the lesser prairie-chicken under the Endangered  Species Act. While the intent of this act is to protect vulnerable  species, we must carefully consider the consequences of such a  decision.   Listing the lesser prairie-chicken as endangered will have far- reaching negative impacts on rural communities, working families, and  conservation efforts, all while ignoring the best available science.   First and foremost, this action will place more red tape on farmers,  ranchers, and small businesses, leading to more Federal control and  less personal freedom. Rural America already faces significant  challenges, and more Federal red tape will only limit job growth and  crush rural communities.   Furthermore, listing the lesser prairie-chicken might not guarantee  its recovery. The Endangered Species Act's track record has shown  limited success in saving species from extinction, often requiring  substantial amounts of taxpayer dollars and enormous economic impacts  with minimal positive outcomes.   Instead, we should prioritize cooperative conservation efforts that  involve collaboration between private landowners and government  agencies to ensure a more holistic, sustainable approach.   Listing the lesser prairie-chicken will divert attention and  resources away from other critical conservation priorities. We need a  comprehensive strategy that addresses broader ecological challenges and  the conservation of multiple species, not just focusing on a single  one.   Let us not rush into listing the lesser prairie-chicken without  carefully evaluating the potential harms and exploring alternative  conservation measures. Effective conservation requires a balanced  approach that protects both our natural heritage and the livelihoods of  working families throughout rural America.   Together, we can find innovative solutions to preserve the species  while promoting responsible economic growth and safeguarding our  environment for generations to come.
