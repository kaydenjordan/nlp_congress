 Madam President, I have up here a quote from the  Washington Post from January 20, 2019. The words say: ``to refuse even  to talk until the government reopens does no favors to sidelined  Federal workers and contractors''--to refuse even to talk. This is a  Washington Post editorial message to the Democrats.   The Post says that the Democrats should welcome the President's  weekend offer and return to the negotiating table to end this partial  government shutdown, which is now in its fifth week. I agree. It is  time to end this stalemate. It is time to talk, and it is time to vote.   The title of the editorial was ``Make a deal. Save the dreamers''-- make a deal.   Divided government is often messy business. It is also serious  business. It is what the American people have voted for and what we  have seen more often than not in this country. Politically, there  really are no winners and losers in this arena. What I worry about is  the American people. Nobody wins in terms of a shutdown.   The Senate will vote tomorrow on commonsense, compromise legislation  to secure the border, reopen the government, as well as to address what  I believe are key immigration issues for the country.   We do have a national security and a humanitarian crisis at our  southern border. President Trump has, again, requested $5.7 billion.  That is one one-thousandth of the Federal spending. He has requested  the money for a steel barrier system.   The southern border is almost 2,000 miles. The physical barrier  already protects about 650 miles. The President wants to build more  security barriers because we know they are a proven solution.   In addition, the President is proposing to grant provisional status-- a 3-year reprieve--for the 700,000 Deferred Action for Childhood  Arrivals illegal immigrants, known as DACA. This 3-year reprieve will  also help 300,000 temporary protected status immigrants. When people  say TPS, that is what it stands for--immigrants with temporary  protected status. Right now, they have protected status, but that is  expiring. These are individuals who have suffered devastation in their  lives due to the challenges previously faced in Haiti, as well as  individuals from Central America. So we are talking about over 1  million people for whom the President is proposing changes that would  impact them and their lives.   These DACA and TPS measures are an immigration policy bandaid. They  are not the solution to everything. They deal with an immediate problem  for a limited period of time. Once the government reopens, the  President then plans, as he said, to hold weekly, bipartisan meetings  aimed at broader immigration reform.   Border security policy has always been bipartisan. For decades,  Presidents and congressional leaders from both parties have supported  security barriers to protect the American people.   In 2006, Senate Democrats, including Senator Barack Obama at the time  and Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator Joe Biden and Senator Chuck  Schumer--all of them--voted to construct a physical barrier on the  southern barrier.   In 2005, then-Senator Obama said this: ``We simply cannot allow  people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, and  unchecked.'' Then, when Senator Obama became President Obama, he  actually described the border situation as a crisis, but he failed to  fix it.   President Trump resolved to fix the decades-old problem. That is when  Democratic leaders suddenly changed their tune. They withdrew support  for securing the border and dug in their heels, prolonging the partial  government shutdown.   Even President Obama's last Border Patrol Chief, Mark Morgan,  supports President Trump's efforts. President Trump did not keep him in  the job, but Mark Morgan has said--and he was on television the other  day--that building the wall is key to solving the security crisis and  that Trump--President Trump--should ``stay the course.''   Still, Democrats refuse to negotiate with this President, so we can't  reopen the affected Federal Agencies and pay the 800,000 furloughed  Federal workers.   President Trump has the truth on his side. Here is the Homeland  Security Department's assessment of the border situation: Each month,  60,000 illegal immigrants reach the border. Drug smuggling spiked in  2018, with a 38-percent increase in methamphetamine, a 22-percent  increase in heroin, and a 73-percent increase in fentanyl. We also saw  a surge in arrests of dangerous criminals, including 17,000 adults with  criminal records and 6,000 MS-13 and other gang members.   In 2018, 60,000 unaccompanied children and 161,000 families reached  the border--a dramatic increase from 2017. Many were victimized along  their journey.   The Border Patrol areas that do have enhanced or expanded physical  barriers have seen a dramatic decrease in illegal traffic. That is why  the President has requested additional funds to construct more  barriers. The areas he has pointed to are the 10 locations where the  Border Patrol has said: These are the spots where we really need the  help.   All Americans want a healthy immigration system that enforces the law  and keeps families together. The President has put a reasonable,  bipartisan compromise on the table to end this partial shutdown and to  pay furloughed Federal workers. President Trump is ready to sign this  legislation. The Senate will vote on it tomorrow.   The House Democrats hold the keys to reopening the government. I  believe Democrats should stop playing politics and meet President Trump  in the middle. That is what President has done with his good-faith  effort.   I say: Let's vote to secure the border and vote to reopen the  government.                        Tribute to Alfred Redman, Sr.    Madam President, now I would like to turn to a different topic that  would  [[Page S488]]  be at an appropriate location in the Record. It is something that I  think the Presiding Officer, as the former chairman of the Indian  Affairs Committee, would find interesting. That is because I rise today  to pay tribute to an incredible individual, a great man, the legendary  Indian High School boys' basketball coach, Alfred Redman.   Saturday night, in Ethete, WY, the long-time coach was surrounded by  school officials, by players, and by fans, who gathered for a ceremony  renaming the school's gymnasium in his honor. Redman's incredible  coaching record as he coached the Chiefs was 426 wins and 118 losses in  26 seasons.   Under his leadership, the Chiefs consistently made State tournament  appearances, winning six State championship titles, and finishing  second six additional times.   Coach Redman was tough. He conditioned his players through grueling  practices. This was his formula for success: Work the players hard and  make the games easier to win. His toughness paid off. He put Wyoming  Indian basketball on the map, both at the State and the national  levels.   Over the seasons, from 1983 to 1986, Redman's Chiefs set the State  bar with a recordbreaking 50 straight victories. That record still  stands today. It is no surprise that Redman is both a Wyoming and a  national coaches Hall of Fame inductee.   Wyoming owes a great debt of gratitude to Coach Redman--a giant in  State basketball history.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
