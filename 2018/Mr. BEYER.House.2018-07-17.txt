 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  [[Page H6459]]     Mr. Chairman, neither of the amendments that I offer  tonight have much to do with the appropriations we are addressing. They  are not about specific budget provisions, although I very much enjoyed  listening to the many amendments tonight and am impressed with how  often the discussion has been cordial. Instead, this amendment seeks to  preserve current Clean Water Act protections for our rivers, streams,  and wetlands.   Our Nation's river systems and wetlands provide irreplaceable  resources: natural water quality improvement, flood protection,  shoreline erosion control, recreation, general aesthetic appreciation,  and natural products for our use at no cost. Yet section 430 of this  bill seeks to undermine the critical balance between protecting these  waters and the day-to-day operations of our Nation's farmers, ranchers,  and foresters.   Under current law, you do not need a Clean Water Act permit if  discharges of dredged or fill material are associated with normal  farming, ranching, or silviculture activities. This exemption pertains  to normal farming and harvesting activities that are part of an  established, ongoing farming or forestry operation. Only when the  activities change or convert the use of a waterbody to a new purpose or  impair the historic flow or reach of a stream or wetland does the  exemption no longer apply.   What this means is that farmers can continue to plow their fields,  plant their seeds, and harvest their crops without ever having to  obtain approval under the Clean Water Act; but if a farmer wants to use  the current exemption to convert his farmland into a residential  development, he can't do that unless he gets a permit.   A rancher couldn't use this exemption to plow under a wetland to  expand the reach of her grazing lands, and forestry operations can't  use this exemption to change the course of a local stream to improve  drainage on their growing lands.   Section 430 of this bill seeks to provide an absolute exemption for  impacts to any streams or wetlands that happen to be on agricultural,  ranching, or forestry lands. This is a fundamental change to the Clean  Water Act and one where the impacts have never been explored.   This amendment would be a departure from almost 40 years of  implementation of the Clean Water Act by eliminating the existing  provision requiring that the exemptions are limited to established,  ongoing farming practices. It could result in the loss or impairment of  thousands of acres of valuable wetlands.   Mr. Chairman, we shouldn't be using an appropriations bill to change  Federal policy related to the protection of our Nation's rivers and  streams. To the best of my knowledge, no hearings or investigations on  the impacts of this provision have ever been held.   If Congress intended to overturn almost 40 years of Clean Water Act  precedent, regular order would require hearings before the House  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, which has sole  jurisdiction over the Clean Water Act, and approval by that committee  before consideration on the floor.   Mr. Chairman, this rider is bad policy for the protection of our  environment, for the protection of human health, and for the protection  of public safety.   Mr. Chair, I urge support for my amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I tried to listen very carefully to my  friend from northern California.   Number one, I would love to come visit and talk to his farmers and  his ranchers, with his permission and accompaniment.   Number two, I think if there is administrative misuse, if there is a  reinterpretation of a law that has been in place for 40 years, let's  address that. Let's do that through the Department of the Interior. We  have, I believe, from the gentleman's perspective, a very friendly  administration. Let's make sure that they are implementing the law  appropriately.   By the way, I agree with the gentleman, it was never intended to  punish farmers.   The gentleman's northern California experience is different from ours  here. My mom and dad both grew up on farms in northern Virginia, which  are completely residential developments right now.   We want to make sure that we don't, with this rider, make it possible  for a farmer to change from farming to suburbia without ever obtaining  a permit,  [[Page H6460]]  and that is essentially what we have done.   By the wholesale nature of this repeal, of the nonstop to the  exemptions, we essentially really shortcut the Clean Water Act.   I urge us to look for a middle ground solution that answers the needs  of farmers without opening wide this exemption for any farming,  ranching, or grazing activity, forestry activity that might result in  this full repeal.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would strike section 431, which  repeals the current Clean Water Rule.   Without this Clean Water Rule, the streams that supply public  drinking water systems to one in three Americans will remain at risk.   Mr. Chairman, everyone agreed that clarity was needed in light of the  Supreme Court decisions in 2001 and 2006 that created uncertainty about  the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act. Calls for EPA  to issue a rule even came from such organizations as the National  Cattlemen's Beef Association, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the  Western Business Roundtable, and the National Association of  Manufacturers.   The EPA and the Corps solicited comments to clarify the scope of  waters protected under the Clean Water Act, and that included a lengthy  and inclusive public rulemaking process that included over 200 days for  public comment. The comment period was even extended twice in response  to extension requests.   The final rule reflected over 1 million public comments in the  proposal, the overwhelming majority of which supported the Clean Water  Rule. They had 400 meetings across the Nation with various  stakeholders.   The final Clean Water Rule was robust and ensured that water sources  were protected by taking into account the connected systems of water,  from wetlands and seasonal bodies of water to large rivers and lakes.   The requirements of the rule were meticulously developed and  addressed longstanding uncertainty, improving our national commitment  to protect not only America's water, but the American people.   About 117 million Americans get drinking water from streams that were  vulnerable to pollution before this new Clean Water Rule. Our health  and our lives depend on clean water, our economy depends on clean  water.   Mr. Chairman, what is unusual is the Trump administration is already  working to replace, revise the 2015 rule, so I am baffled why this  rider is necessary. Does the rider mean the Republican Party can't  trust its own EPA to write the rule to their requirements?   So I stand here today to denounce this unnecessary rider and to  defend clean water for the American people.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2330     Mr. Chairman, I certainly respect the opinion of the  chair, but I do take issue with the notion that it is a misguided WOTUS  rule. There were 1 million comments, 400 meetings, and I served on the  Science, Space, and Technology Committee and National Resources  Committee in the last 2 years of the Obama administration when EPA  Administrator Gina McCarthy came to us and said that after the original  publication of the intended new clean water rule, there was so much  feedback that she went back to the drawing board for another year of  hearings and comments to address the many concerns that were raised by  farmers, cattlemen, and others, most of which were resolved at the  time.   Mr. Chair, I respect the notion that a new administration has the  right to go through the same process, the same hearings, and the same  public comment to modify the rule to evolve it as we move forward. But  to just throw out the old rule by a rider to an appropriations bill,  seems the wrong way to make law, the wrong way to govern.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my few colleagues here at a little bit before  midnight to vote ``yes'' on this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.  [[Page H6461]]
