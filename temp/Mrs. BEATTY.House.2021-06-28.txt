 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous materials on the subject of this Special Order hour.    Madam Speaker, I rise tonight for the Congressional  Black Caucus' Special Order hour on this critically important topic,  infrastructure. Tonight, we will share with you our positions, our  plans, and the state of what we think about infrastructure.   I am so honored to be here tonight as a coanchor and as chair of the  Congressional Black Caucus. Traditionally, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson  Lee would be here as our lead anchor. I thank her for allowing me, as  chair, to stand in for her.   I am so honored that her coanchor will now be my coanchor tonight. It  gives me great pleasure to talk about all of our members, Madam  Speaker, but we are joined by someone who is not only a freshman but a  freshman who is a leader, a freshman who is strong, a freshman from New  York's 15th District, someone who came to Congress with a plan, someone  who came to Congress saying that he wants to be here and be able to be  a part not only of the Congressional Black Caucus but to be able to  stand up and stand out and make a difference for his constituents.  Madam Speaker, he has done far more than that.   Congressman Ritchie Torres serves on the powerful Financial Services  Committee as a freshman. He is a leader when we talk about housing and  infrastructure. Tonight, I get to dialogue with him. I get to listen to  him, and we get to talk about other members of the Congressional Black  Caucus.   Tonight, we want to speak directly to the American people and reflect  on  [[Page H3233]]  the ideas and the critical interests of our constituents. Tonight, we  gather in the sacred Chamber on the floor of the people's House to  discuss America's infrastructure and to amplify Our Power, Our Message.  You will hear this throughout the evening because we realize that it is  about our power and our message, 57 members strong of the Congressional  Black Caucus.   Tonight, we will educate our constituents. We will educate Americans  about the importance of the investment in infrastructure in our  neighborhoods and our communities.   Tonight, we will stand strong in support of infrastructure because we  know roads and schools in our districts are crumbling and need urgent  repair.   We also tackle this with bold Federal investments in our country's  roads and bridges and access to broadband and transit and water systems  and housing and human care. The investment in infrastructure, Madam  Speaker, would support workers and create millions of good-paying jobs  in urban and rural populations, the types of jobs that support workers,  engineers, steelworkers, bus drivers, childcare workers, and rail  workers, and their families.   Isn't that what this is about? Isn't that why we stand up for the  people, to make them able to have good-paying jobs to take care of  their families?   The Congressional Black Caucus understands this because we have lived  this. I know this all too well when we talk about roads and bridges,  when we talk about waterways and broadband.   What good is it to say let's educate our children, let's give them  the technology that they need, and so we give them a laptop, a computer  and all the software, but in many of our rural and urban communities,  there is no broadband?   What good is it to have roads and bridges that people can travel, but  where are they traveling to? They are traveling home. But what happens  when there is no home, when there is no housing?   That is one of the reasons that we are here tonight, so that we can  talk about this investment in our Nation's future that includes  extending key tax credits, tax cuts that were included in the American  Rescue Plan, which the Congressional Black Caucus stood tall to help  pass, that will benefit lower- and middle-income workers and families.   We even created a domestic policy transportation team within the  Congressional Black Caucus to talk about infrastructure, and I will use  their language. In their recent meeting, they said that we need a  modern American infrastructure plan. That, too, is what tonight is  about.   You will hear facts. You will hear data. You will hear stories. You  will hear the strong testimony of why we are saying to all of our  colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, that we need an infrastructure  plan that works for the American people.   Madam Speaker, the majority whip, Congressman   James Clyburn, needs  no real introduction. Mr. Clyburn hails from South Carolina. He has  stood on this floor repeatedly and talked about the American way. He  has been a leader, a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus,  someone who has mentored most of us.   He has repeatedly said to us, which we must remember as members of  the Congressional Black Caucus: We must exercise our power and our  message. We must speak truth to power. And we must understand that on  days that are bad and days that are weak, we are the strength. We are  the Members that the American people who look like me look for. We are  leaders.   Often, people will say: What is it that the Congressional Black  Caucus stands for? What is it that the Congressional Black Caucus does?   Well, let me just tell you, the third most powerful man in the United  States Congress is a part of the Congressional Black Caucus. We have  six members of the Congressional Black Caucus that make up full chairs  of committees and more than 22 that represent subcommittee chairs.    Tonight, as we talk about infrastructure--roads, bridges, broadband,  waterways--we also talk about care, human care, human infrastructure.   Madam Speaker, it gives me great honor to yield to Congressman    James Clyburn.    Madam Speaker, I thank the majority whip for setting the  stage for us tonight to talk about traditional and nontraditional  infrastructure, especially broadband. I think we all learned a message  about the value of going beyond what the tradition is, and certainly  broadband does that for us.   Earlier, Madam Speaker, I had the distinct pleasure of saying how  honored I would be to be joined by our coanchor tonight, Congressman  Ritchie Torres from New York.    I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Torres) for him to make  an opening statement as we coanchor tonight.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those eye- opening remarks.   Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to yield the floor to  Congressman  Bobby Scott. Congressman Scott hails from Virginia's Third  Congressional District. A proud member of the Congressional Black  Caucus, he is also one of those six chairs who I referenced earlier. He  is chair of the Committee on Education and Labor. He is a scholar. He  is a lawyer. He also takes the lead role when we talk about the  Congressional Black Caucus and how we plan for the future not only for  education and childcare, but also how we plan for the Congressional  Black Caucus' budget.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), my  colleague and friend.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.  Congressman  Bobby Scott is right. Tonight is about building back  better. Tonight is about the Congressional Black Caucus demonstrating  our power, our message.   Madam Speaker, as I talk about our power and our message, it gives me  great pleasure to yield the floor to Congressman Andre Carson, who  hails from Indiana's Seventh Congressional District. He is the grandson  of a legend, someone who served in this House, someone who I had the  opportunity to know and to witness her work in Congresswoman Julia  Carson.   Tonight, my friend, my colleague, a leader when we talk about  intelligence or counterterrorism, when we talk about looking at the  future and how we stand up for infrastructure. He serves on the  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, so he comes to us this  evening to share his thoughts on how the Congressional Black Caucus can  help with this infrastructure plan.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson).    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Carson. I thank him  for reminding us that America's infrastructure is in desperate need of  investment. That is what this is about.   Talking about investment, Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence), the second vice chair of the  Congressional Black Caucus, the chair of the Women's Caucus, someone  who understands infrastructure probably more than most of us. You see,  when she started as a postal worker before she worked her way up, she  was in the community and on those roads. She was traveling across those  bridges, and she was listening to people. That is why her constituents  voted her to be mayor. As mayor, we certainly understand the things  that you are hit with the most, our infrastructure, our roads, our  bridges, our care for human infrastructure.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence.  She is absolutely right; this is a public issue. This is a racial  justice issue because we know our roads, our bridges, and our water  systems are crumbling. We know our electric grid is at risk of  catastrophic outages. We know many schools are crumbling from lack of  attention and neglect. Too many lack access to affordable housing, and  too many lack access to childcare and education.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Adams). We call her our HBCU czar. She is the chair of the  Congressional Black Caucus' HBCU caucus, historically Black colleges  and universities. She is also more than that. She has spent a lifetime  educating children and college students.   She serves on the powerful Financial Services Committee, and she has  a strong voice on the Education and Labor Committee and Agriculture  Committee.                                time  2130     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Alma Adams for her  comments.   It is always a pleasure when we have the opportunity to work  together. And I say to Congressman Torres that that is what we are  going to do tonight.   I could not think of a better segue than to pitch it to  Representative Torres. We have two members of the Congressional Black  Caucus from the great State of New York. I am so used to saying the  great State of Ohio, but tonight we have two freshman members of the  Congressional Black Caucus who have been great supporters to our  message, our power, who have been fearless leaders.   So at this time, I say to Congressman Torres, my coanchor, that I  think it would be best for him to yield the floor to and make some  remarks about Congressman Jamaal Bowman who will speak next.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Torres.)    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Bowman for reminding  us of our history, as well as the need.   I am sure if Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee was at this microphone  tonight, Congressman Torres, she would look to you and she would say,  let's get this done. She would look to you and she would remind us that  part of this bold action means we must use all of our available  resources.   She would remind us, in 2017, that the Republicans used the  reconciliation process twice. Oh, how I remember how they used it  against the Affordable Care Act. And how I remember that they used it  not only for taking away American's healthcare, but a second time to  pass the GOP tax scam of 2017, in giving more money to those in the top  1 percent.   But, tonight, we have heard from the top of our leadership. We have  heard from Members from across the United States.   Now it gives me great pleasure to bring our last speaker to the  podium. He is also our newest Member to Congress. He hails from the  great State of Louisiana. He is someone who is no stranger to being an  elected official. He is someone who has dedicated his life to serving  the people. He has been successful. He is here in his own right,  serving on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, as well as  the Small Business Committee.   Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to yield to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Carter), my colleague and friend.    Madam Speaker, how much time do we have left, please?    Then let me close by saying thank you to all of the  Members of the Congressional Black Caucus. It was clear tonight that  infrastructure is not only a big word, but it is a big deal, which  encompasses many concepts, which comprises modern American  infrastructure.   For some Members we have heard tonight, it is through traditional  roads and bridges and waterways. For others, it is broadband and it is  housing, it is human care.   Regardless of definition, the Congressional Black Caucus is ready to  stand in the gap to support legislation and policies that will help  infrastructure invest in America's future so we can build back better.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Torres) to  say thank you to our Members.    Strong. Congressional Black Caucus, our power, our  message.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
