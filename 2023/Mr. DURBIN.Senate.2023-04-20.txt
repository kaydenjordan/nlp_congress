Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for rollcall vote  No. 2, on adoption of the Van Hollen amendment to provide grants fire  station construction through the Administrator of the Federal Emergency  Management Agency, 85. Had I been present for the vote, I would have  voted yea.                            ____________________     Mr. President, 24 years ago today, tragedy struck  Littleton, CO. It was a day that began like any other but--in a matter  of hours--would scar our Nation forever.   Today, the word ``Columbine'' is synonymous with an act of terror  that every parent fears: school shootings. If you had told me 24 years  ago that the scenes we witnessed that morning--students and teachers  being shot down, traumatized children being escorted out of classrooms  by armed officers, if you told me this would become a common--almost  weekly--occurrence in America, I wouldn't have believed you.   But here we are. In the years since Columbine, hundreds of American  students have died--or been injured--in school shootings, and thousands  more have been traumatized. Gunfire has become the No. 1 cause of death  for our Nation's children. And one in five Americans now say they have  lost a loved one to gun violence. Some politicians have resigned  themselves to the idea that this is just part of American life we must  accept. Shame on them. This is a uniquely American crisis--and  lawmakers have the power to resolve it.   Yet Republicans in Congress actually want to take steps backwards. We  are seeing that in the House right now, where the MAGA majority is  trying to wipe off the books a gun law restricting braces that turn  pistols into short-barreled rifles. This is the kind of weapon that was  carried by the mass shooters in Dayton, OH; Boulder, CO; and just a few  weeks ago at a school shooting in Nashville, TN. Parents shouldn't have  to worry that, when they send their kids to school, they may not return  home. Children shouldn't be forced to live with the fear that their  classroom could be the next target.   People of all political stripes are calling on Congress to act. Let's  start by keeping assault weapons and short-barreled rifles off of our  streets and out of our classrooms.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.

A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to  require that direct-to-consumer advertisements for drugs and  biologicals include an appropriate disclosure of pricing information;  to the Committee on Finance.    Madam President, most Americans spent more time at home  watching television during the pandemic. I know I did. And what was one  of the most common commercials we saw? Direct-to-consumer drug ads. You  know, those fancy commercials with catchy music, celebrity actors, and  swinging golf clubs? Even before COVID, Americans saw an average of  nine ads per day. Every year, the pharmaceutical industry spends more  than $6 billion on ads--$6 billion. That is the same as the entire  budget of the Food and Drug Administration. In fact, we know that most  top Pharma companies spend more on their advertising budget than on  drug research and development.   It turns out, the United States is one of only two countries in the  world that even allows these commercials. Can you guess the other? New  Zealand.   Do you want to know why Pharma spends so much money promoting their  drugs? Because it increases their profit margins. Pharma pushes these  ads because they steer patients to specific, expensive medications-- whether a patient actually needs the drugs or not. And sometimes it is  easier in a 10-minute meeting for the doctor to just write the  prescription than to take the time to explain why the drug may not be  needed or a less expensive, generic version might be a better choice.  Pharma thinks if they pummel you with enough ads that you finally learn  how to spell Xarelto, you will insist to your doctor that this is the  blood thinner you need though a less expensive option would be just as  effective.   With billions in targeted spending, patients are bombarded with  information--don't take Xarelto if you are allergic to Xarelto--but  kept in the dark on one crucial factor--the price.   Take Rinvoq, which is manufactured by Illinois-based AbbVie for  eczema and arthritis. It is now the most-advertised drug on  television--replacing two other AbbVie medications, Humira and Skyrizi.  AbbVie spent $315 million last year on TV ads for Rinvoq alone. But  nowhere in the ad do they tell you it costs $6,100 per month.   Well, Senator Grassley and I think it is time for Big Pharma to end  the secrecy. If they are advertising a drug, they should disclose the  price right up front. It is a basic transparency measure for patients.  Consumer protection 101. So today, we are reintroducing bipartisan  legislation to require price disclosures in direct-to-consumer drugs  ads, or DTC ads. Our plan is simple, and it has actually passed the  Senate once before.   Here is why we think this transparency in drug ads is so important.  Earlier this year, a study found that more than two-thirds of drugs  advertised on television were considered, quote, ``low-value.'' Those  pricey drugs that show you whitewater rafting or rock climbing? They  are often no better than other, more affordable drugs.   One-in-five Americans do not take their medications as prescribed  because of the cost. They cut their pills in half or skip doses because  they can't afford to take their medications as prescribed. So don't you  think it is worth knowing right away that Rinvoq could run you $6,100  per month rather than waiting for that moment of truth at the pharmacy  counter?   Don't just take my word for it. These advertisements often urge you  to ``ask your doctor if it is right for you.'' Well, we asked those  doctors. The American Medical Association says: ``Direct-to-consumer  advertising inflates demand for new and expensive drugs, even when  these drugs may not be appropriate.''   As Democrats are working in Washington to avoid default and prevent  our economy from crashing and to preserve the solvency of Medicare, we  asked the Government Accountability Office, GAO, to look at the impact  of these DTC ads on Medicare's budget. The GAO found that between 2016  and 2018, drugs advertised on television accounted for 58 percent of  Medicare's spending. These DTC ads ballooned Medicare spending on a  small handful of drugs, costing the Medicare Program $320 billion over  3 years. Humira topped the list with $500 million in advertising in  2018, which contributed to $2.4 billion in Medicare costs.   I used this chart in 2017 when I first introduced this legislation,  and when the monthly cost of Humira was $3,700 per month. But as you  can see, the cost of Humira is now $6,900 per month. Shouldn't AbbVie-- makers of Humira--disclose that price to you so you can use this  information when making treatment decisions? If they did, AbbVie may  think twice before raising the price.   Our DTC bill is supported by Democrats and Republicans, the AARP,  American Medical Association, American Hospital Association, and 88  percent of Americans. President Trump supported our bill. This bill has  passed the Senate before. And several Republicans have included this  provision in larger packages they have supported. The only opposition  comes from one place: Pharma. They hate the idea of being honest with  patients about the price of their drugs and they are looking for  Senators to help keep their secret.   So when the Senate considers drug pricing legislation in the coming  weeks, I will ask for a vote on this bipartisan policy. Senator  Grassley has been a great partner in this effort; and we will work to  bring this dose of sunshine to the airwaves. It is about time Americans  catch a break when it comes to the cost of drugs.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1250         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Drug-Price Transparency for       Consumers Act of 2023'' or the ``DTC Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF THE SENATE.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription       pharmaceuticals is legally permitted in only 2 developed       countries, the United States and New Zealand.        (2) In 2018, pharmaceutical ad spending exceeded       $6,046,000,000, a 4.8 percent increase over 2017, resulting       in the average American seeing 9 drug advertisements per day.        (3) The most commonly advertised medication in the United       States in 2020 had a list price of more than $6,000 for a       one-month's supply.        (4) A 2021 Government Accountability Office report found       that two-thirds of all direct-to-consumer drug advertising       between 2016 and 2018 was concentrated among 39 brand-name       drugs or biologicals, about half of which were recently       approved by the Food and Drug Administration.        (5) According to a 2011 Congressional Budget Office report,       pharmaceutical manufacturers advertise their products       directly to consumers in an attempt to boost demand for their       products and thereby raise the price that consumers are       willing to pay, increase the quantity of drugs sold, or       achieve some combination of the two.        (6) Studies, including a 2012 systematic review published       in the Annual Review of Public Health, a 2005 randomized       trial published  [[Page S1298]]       in the Journal of the American Medical Association, and a       2004 survey published in Health Affairs, show that patients       are more likely to ask their doctor for a specific medication       and for the doctor to write a prescription for it, if a       patient has seen an advertisement for such medication, even       if such medication is not the most clinically appropriate for       the patient or if a lower-cost generic medication may be       available.        (7) According to a 2011 Congressional Budget Office report,       the average number of prescriptions written for newly       approved brand-name drugs with direct-to-consumer advertising       was 9 times greater than the average number of prescriptions       written for newly approved brand-name drugs without direct-      to-consumer advertising.        (8) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is the       single largest drug payer in the United States. Between 2016       and 2018, 58 percent of the $560,000,000,000 in Medicare drug       spending was for advertised drugs, and in 2018 alone, the 20       most advertised drugs on television cost Medicare and       Medicaid a combined $34,000,000,000.        (9) A 2021 Government Accountability Office report found       that direct-to-consumer advertising may have contributed to       increases in Medicare beneficiary use and spending among       certain drugs.        (10) The American Medical Association has passed       resolutions supporting the requirement for price transparency       in any direct-to-consumer advertising, stating that such       advertisements on their own ``inflate demand for new and more       expensive drugs, even when these drugs may not be       appropriate''.        (11) A 2019 study published in the Journal of the American       Medical Association found that health care consumers       dramatically underestimate their out-of-pocket costs for       certain expensive medications, but once they learn the       wholesale acquisition cost (in this section referred to as       the ``WAC'') of the product, they are far better able to       approximate their out-of-pocket costs.        (12) Approximately half of Americans have high-deductible       health plans, under which they often pay the list price of a       drug until their insurance deductible is met. All of the top       Medicare prescription drug plans use coinsurance rather than       fixed-dollar copayments for medications on nonpreferred drug       tiers, exposing beneficiaries to WAC prices.        (13) Section 119 of division CC of the Consolidated       Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public Law 116-260) requires the       Secretary of Health and Human Services to increase the use of       real-time benefit tools to lower beneficiary costs. However,       there still remains a lack of available pricing tools so       patients may not learn of their medication's cost until after       being given a prescription for the medication. A 2013 study       published in The Oncologist found that one-quarter of all       cancer patients chose not to fill a prescription due to cost.        (14) The Federal Government already exercises its authority       to oversee certain aspects of direct-to-consumer drug       advertising, including required disclosures of information       related to side effects, contraindications, and       effectiveness.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) a lack of transparency in pricing for pharmaceuticals       has led to a lack of competition for such pharmaceuticals, as       evidenced by a finding by the Department of Health and Human       Services that ``Consumers of pharmaceuticals are currently       missing information that consumers of other products can more       readily access, namely the list price of the product, which       acts as a point of comparison when judging the reasonableness       of prices offered for potential substitute products'' (84       Fed. Reg. 20735);        (2) in an age where price information is ubiquitous, the       prices of pharmaceuticals remain shrouded in secrecy and       limited to those who subscribe to expensive drug price       reporting services, which typically include pharmaceutical       manufacturers or other health care industry entities and not       the general public;        (3) greater insight and transparency into drug prices will       help consumers know if they can afford to complete a course       of therapy before deciding to initiate that course of       therapy;        (4) price shopping is the mark of rational economic       behavior, and markets operate more efficiently when consumers       have relevant information about a product, including its       price, before making an informed decision about whether to       buy that product;        (5) providing consumers with basic price information may       result in the selection of lesser cost alternatives, all else       being equal relative to the patient's care, and is integral       to providing adequate competition in the market;        (6) the WAC is a factual, objective, and uncontroversial       definition for the list price of a medication, in that it is       defined in statute, reflects an understood place in the       supply chain, and is at the sole discretion of the       manufacturer to set;        (7) there is a governmental interest in ensuring that       consumers who seek to purchase pharmaceuticals for purposes       of promoting their health and safety understand the objective       list price of any pharmaceutical that they are encouraged       through advertisements to purchase, which allows consumers to       make informed purchasing decisions; and        (8) there is a governmental interest in mitigating wasteful       expenditures and promoting the efficient administration of       the Medicare program by slowing the growth of Federal       spending on prescription drugs.       SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT THAT DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISEMENTS                     FOR DRUGS AND BIOLOGICALS INCLUDE AN                     APPROPRIATE DISCLOSURE OF PRICING INFORMATION.

I know I did. And what was one  of the most common commercials we saw? Direct-to-consumer drug ads. You  know, those fancy commercials with catchy music, celebrity actors, and  swinging golf clubs? Even before COVID, Americans saw an average of  nine ads per day. Every year, the pharmaceutical industry spends more  than $6 billion on ads--$6 billion. That is the same as the entire  budget of the Food and Drug Administration. In fact, we know that most  top Pharma companies spend more on their advertising budget than on  drug research and development.   It turns out, the United States is one of only two countries in the  world that even allows these commercials. Can you guess the other? New  Zealand.   Do you want to know why Pharma spends so much money promoting their  drugs? Because it increases their profit margins. Pharma pushes these  ads because they steer patients to specific, expensive medications-- whether a patient actually needs the drugs or not. And sometimes it is  easier in a 10-minute meeting for the doctor to just write the  prescription than to take the time to explain why the drug may not be  needed or a less expensive, generic version might be a better choice.  Pharma thinks if they pummel you with enough ads that you finally learn  how to spell Xarelto, you will insist to your doctor that this is the  blood thinner you need though a less expensive option would be just as  effective.   With billions in targeted spending, patients are bombarded with  information--don't take Xarelto if you are allergic to Xarelto--but  kept in the dark on one crucial factor--the price.   Take Rinvoq, which is manufactured by Illinois-based AbbVie for  eczema and arthritis. It is now the most-advertised drug on  television--replacing two other AbbVie medications, Humira and Skyrizi.  AbbVie spent $315 million last year on TV ads for Rinvoq alone. But  nowhere in the ad do they tell you it costs $6,100 per month.   Well, Senator Grassley and I think it is time for Big Pharma to end  the secrecy. If they are advertising a drug, they should disclose the  price right up front. It is a basic transparency measure for patients.  Consumer protection 101. So today, we are reintroducing bipartisan  legislation to require price disclosures in direct-to-consumer drugs  ads, or DTC ads. Our plan is simple, and it has actually passed the  Senate once before.   Here is why we think this transparency in drug ads is so important.  Earlier this year, a study found that more than two-thirds of drugs  advertised on television were considered, quote, ``low-value.'' Those  pricey drugs that show you whitewater rafting or rock climbing? They  are often no better than other, more affordable drugs.   One-in-five Americans do not take their medications as prescribed  because of the cost. They cut their pills in half or skip doses because  they can't afford to take their medications as prescribed. So don't you  think it is worth knowing right away that Rinvoq could run you $6,100  per month rather than waiting for that moment of truth at the pharmacy  counter?   Don't just take my word for it. These advertisements often urge you  to ``ask your doctor if it is right for you.'' Well, we asked those  doctors. The American Medical Association says: ``Direct-to-consumer  advertising inflates demand for new and expensive drugs, even when  these drugs may not be appropriate.''   As Democrats are working in Washington to avoid default and prevent  our economy from crashing and to preserve the solvency of Medicare, we  asked the Government Accountability Office, GAO, to look at the impact  of these DTC ads on Medicare's budget. The GAO found that between 2016  and 2018, drugs advertised on television accounted for 58 percent of  Medicare's spending. These DTC ads ballooned Medicare spending on a  small handful of drugs, costing the Medicare Program $320 billion over  3 years. Humira topped the list with $500 million in advertising in  2018, which contributed to $2.4 billion in Medicare costs.   I used this chart in 2017 when I first introduced this legislation,  and when the monthly cost of Humira was $3,700 per month. But as you  can see, the cost of Humira is now $6,900 per month. Shouldn't AbbVie-- makers of Humira--disclose that price to you so you can use this  information when making treatment decisions? If they did, AbbVie may  think twice before raising the price.   Our DTC bill is supported by Democrats and Republicans, the AARP,  American Medical Association, American Hospital Association, and 88  percent of Americans. President Trump supported our bill. This bill has  passed the Senate before. And several Republicans have included this  provision in larger packages they have supported. The only opposition  comes from one place: Pharma. They hate the idea of being honest with  patients about the price of their drugs and they are looking for  Senators to help keep their secret.   So when the Senate considers drug pricing legislation in the coming  weeks, I will ask for a vote on this bipartisan policy. Senator  Grassley has been a great partner in this effort; and we will work to  bring this dose of sunshine to the airwaves. It is about time Americans  catch a break when it comes to the cost of drugs.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1250         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Drug-Price Transparency for       Consumers Act of 2023'' or the ``DTC Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF THE SENATE.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription       pharmaceuticals is legally permitted in only 2 developed       countries, the United States and New Zealand.        (2) In 2018, pharmaceutical ad spending exceeded       $6,046,000,000, a 4.8 percent increase over 2017, resulting       in the average American seeing 9 drug advertisements per day.        (3) The most commonly advertised medication in the United       States in 2020 had a list price of more than $6,000 for a       one-month's supply.        (4) A 2021 Government Accountability Office report found       that two-thirds of all direct-to-consumer drug advertising       between 2016 and 2018 was concentrated among 39 brand-name       drugs or biologicals, about half of which were recently       approved by the Food and Drug Administration.        (5) According to a 2011 Congressional Budget Office report,       pharmaceutical manufacturers advertise their products       directly to consumers in an attempt to boost demand for their       products and thereby raise the price that consumers are       willing to pay, increase the quantity of drugs sold, or       achieve some combination of the two.        (6) Studies, including a 2012 systematic review published       in the Annual Review of Public Health, a 2005 randomized       trial published  [[Page S1298]]       in the Journal of the American Medical Association, and a       2004 survey published in Health Affairs, show that patients       are more likely to ask their doctor for a specific medication       and for the doctor to write a prescription for it, if a       patient has seen an advertisement for such medication, even       if such medication is not the most clinically appropriate for       the patient or if a lower-cost generic medication may be       available.        (7) According to a 2011 Congressional Budget Office report,       the average number of prescriptions written for newly       approved brand-name drugs with direct-to-consumer advertising       was 9 times greater than the average number of prescriptions       written for newly approved brand-name drugs without direct-      to-consumer advertising.        (8) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is the       single largest drug payer in the United States. Between 2016       and 2018, 58 percent of the $560,000,000,000 in Medicare drug       spending was for advertised drugs, and in 2018 alone, the 20       most advertised drugs on television cost Medicare and       Medicaid a combined $34,000,000,000.        (9) A 2021 Government Accountability Office report found       that direct-to-consumer advertising may have contributed to       increases in Medicare beneficiary use and spending among       certain drugs.        (10) The American Medical Association has passed       resolutions supporting the requirement for price transparency       in any direct-to-consumer advertising, stating that such       advertisements on their own ``inflate demand for new and more       expensive drugs, even when these drugs may not be       appropriate''.        (11) A 2019 study published in the Journal of the American       Medical Association found that health care consumers       dramatically underestimate their out-of-pocket costs for       certain expensive medications, but once they learn the       wholesale acquisition cost (in this section referred to as       the ``WAC'') of the product, they are far better able to       approximate their out-of-pocket costs.        (12) Approximately half of Americans have high-deductible       health plans, under which they often pay the list price of a       drug until their insurance deductible is met. All of the top       Medicare prescription drug plans use coinsurance rather than       fixed-dollar copayments for medications on nonpreferred drug       tiers, exposing beneficiaries to WAC prices.        (13) Section 119 of division CC of the Consolidated       Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public Law 116-260) requires the       Secretary of Health and Human Services to increase the use of       real-time benefit tools to lower beneficiary costs. However,       there still remains a lack of available pricing tools so       patients may not learn of their medication's cost until after       being given a prescription for the medication. A 2013 study       published in The Oncologist found that one-quarter of all       cancer patients chose not to fill a prescription due to cost.        (14) The Federal Government already exercises its authority       to oversee certain aspects of direct-to-consumer drug       advertising, including required disclosures of information       related to side effects, contraindications, and       effectiveness.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) a lack of transparency in pricing for pharmaceuticals       has led to a lack of competition for such pharmaceuticals, as       evidenced by a finding by the Department of Health and Human       Services that ``Consumers of pharmaceuticals are currently       missing information that consumers of other products can more       readily access, namely the list price of the product, which       acts as a point of comparison when judging the reasonableness       of prices offered for potential substitute products'' (84       Fed. Reg. 20735);        (2) in an age where price information is ubiquitous, the       prices of pharmaceuticals remain shrouded in secrecy and       limited to those who subscribe to expensive drug price       reporting services, which typically include pharmaceutical       manufacturers or other health care industry entities and not       the general public;        (3) greater insight and transparency into drug prices will       help consumers know if they can afford to complete a course       of therapy before deciding to initiate that course of       therapy;        (4) price shopping is the mark of rational economic       behavior, and markets operate more efficiently when consumers       have relevant information about a product, including its       price, before making an informed decision about whether to       buy that product;        (5) providing consumers with basic price information may       result in the selection of lesser cost alternatives, all else       being equal relative to the patient's care, and is integral       to providing adequate competition in the market;        (6) the WAC is a factual, objective, and uncontroversial       definition for the list price of a medication, in that it is       defined in statute, reflects an understood place in the       supply chain, and is at the sole discretion of the       manufacturer to set;        (7) there is a governmental interest in ensuring that       consumers who seek to purchase pharmaceuticals for purposes       of promoting their health and safety understand the objective       list price of any pharmaceutical that they are encouraged       through advertisements to purchase, which allows consumers to       make informed purchasing decisions; and        (8) there is a governmental interest in mitigating wasteful       expenditures and promoting the efficient administration of       the Medicare program by slowing the growth of Federal       spending on prescription drugs.       SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT THAT DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISEMENTS                     FOR DRUGS AND BIOLOGICALS INCLUDE AN                     APPROPRIATE DISCLOSURE OF PRICING INFORMATION.
