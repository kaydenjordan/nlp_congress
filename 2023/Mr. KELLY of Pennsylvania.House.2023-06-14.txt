 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr.  Paul Nelson, a longtime Erie, Pennsylvania, businessman who passed away  on Sunday, May 21.   Mr. Nelson was 89 years old, but I don't think you could ever say  that Mr. Nelson was old. Oftentimes, people compared him to a cross  between Willy Wonka and Peter Pan. Why was that? Well, Mr. Nelson ran  Waldameer Park & Water World.   Mr. Nelson started working there when he was 11 years old. He married  the love of his life, Lane, and together, they ran Waldameer.   You can say many things about Mr. Nelson, but what you can't say is  that he ever had a bad day because he never had a bad day.   I think when we talk about people at their passing, oftentimes, we  are very sad, and we say it is horrible that we have lost him. I am  different. I am just happy that we had him.   What if Paul Nelson had never been born? What if Paul Nelson had  never been in Erie, Pennsylvania? What if Paul Nelson had never married  Lane? What if Paul Nelson had never taken Waldameer and made it an  iconic place for people to take their children?   When he was 83 years old, Madam Speaker, I was visiting with Mr.  Nelson up at Waldameer, and he goes: Mike, how much time do you have?   I said: Mr. Nelson, as much time as you need.   He says: Come with me.   We went to his office. He looked around to see who else was there and  pulled out a set of plans. He unfolded them.   I said: What are you going to show me?   He said: This is my 10-year plan for Waldameer Park.   I said: Mr. Nelson, I don't think you could define optimist other  than an 83-year-old man with a 10-year plan.   His passing, yes, we grieve. We don't want to lose him, but what if  we never had him? Where would the tragedy have been? The tragedy would  not have been that he was here and died. The tragedy would have been if  Mr. Nelson had never lived.   I think when we go through moments like this and have a chance to  reflect on the people who we represent, we understand that we represent  more than a person. We represent an attitude. We represent a legacy. We  represent people who rely on us to come here and represent them.   Look, you can't say enough about Mr. Nelson. I told you, he is a  cross between Willy Wonka and Peter Pan. I always found him to be so  charming. We awarded him as a Community Champion of the district when I  was able to see him.   I think people need to take time every once in a while to look not  just at the birth date and passing date but look at the time in  between. What did they do with that time? Was it time well spent? At  the end of that time, can we look back and smile and say how blessed  was I to have had something that made saying good-bye so hard to do?   This guy was incredible.   Madam Speaker, I will never yield this man's memory and what he did  for Erie, Pennsylvania, and for childhood devotees who just couldn't  wait to go to Waldameer in the summer.                            ____________________
