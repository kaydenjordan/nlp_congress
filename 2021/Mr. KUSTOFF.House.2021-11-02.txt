 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak about something that  plays a special role in American life, and that is college athletics.   College sports is ingrained in our culture, and its impact is far- reaching on student-athletes, alumni, and their fans.   For decades, college athletics have been governed by the National  Collegiate Athletic Association, more commonly known as the NCAA. The  NCAA has tremendous power, really omnipotent power over college  athletics. The NCAA decides the rules of play, who gets to play, and  who gets the revenue.   Now, the NCAA investigates and penalizes any school, coach, or  student-athlete that it claims infringes on its rules. This is what the  NCAA calls the infractions process.   Let's be clear. The NCAA infraction process is systemically and  fundamentally flawed. The NCAA's rules are vague, constantly changing,  and irregularly enforced. The NCAA's investigations lack transparency  and established procedures and are performed while universities are  often kept in the dark.   Fundamentally, there is no due process for member schools nor for  their students. The NCAA investigations can last years, and they cost  universities millions of dollars in legal fees and other expenses.   Finally, the NCAA punishes universities and student-athletes with no  consistency and no predictability. The NCAA may decide to punish one  school but not another.   Without a doubt, the NCAA acts with little regard for fairness, due  process, or transparency. Through its monopolistic power and lack of  oversight, the NCAA has caused irreparable damage to athletic  departments, to colleges, and to universities across the Nation.   That is why today I am introducing the NCAA Accountability Act with  my colleagues, Representatives Burgess Owens and Josh Harder.   This bipartisan legislation will establish due process protections  for any athlete, university, or individual going through the NCAA  infraction process. These protections include fair notice on  enforcement proceedings, a defined statute of limitations, and a  deadline for the completion of investigations.   The NCAA Accountability Act also includes mechanisms to ensure that  NCAA sanctions are equitable and fit the alleged infraction.    Universities will have the right to resolve punishment disputes with  the NCAA through binding arbitration. This will bring an independent,  unbiased voice into the process to ensure that an equitable outcome is  obtained.   If the NCAA fails to comply with these obligations, the Department of  Justice will have the authority to fine the NCAA and its staff, and the  Department of Justice will have the power to permanently remove any  member from the NCAA Board of Governors.   For our universities and our student-athletes, it is vital that  Congress end the NCAA's long reign as prosecutor, judge, jury, and  executioner over college athletics.   I urge my colleagues to support this important, bipartisan  legislation that will finally hold the NCAA accountable.                            ____________________
