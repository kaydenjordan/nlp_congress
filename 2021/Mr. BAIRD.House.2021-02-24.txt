 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to commend the work of Under  Secretary of Agriculture for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs Ted  McKinney. Ted is the first person to hold this position, and he set a  high bar for whoever succeeds him.   His work has been an integral part of shaping trade agreements,  including the successful renegotiation of the NAFTA into the USMCA. His  determination to help American farmers get their products to new  markets has not only helped our American farmers but has helped feed  the world.   Ted's remarkable passion for agriculture began at an early age,  growing up on a farm in Tipton, Indiana, and was active in 4-H and with  the Future Farmers of America organization. He then graduated from  Purdue University with a B.A. in agricultural economics and later  served as the director of the Indiana State Department of Agriculture.   Thank you, Ted, for your outstanding work and devotion to our  Nation's farmers.                            ____________________
