 Madam President, today the Secretary of Homeland Security  has the opportunity to prevent an injustice and keep a family together.  At 9 a.m. Hawaii time, Andres Magana-Ortiz was scheduled to report to  the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Honolulu to be  deported from his home of nearly 30 years.   Andres was brought to America when he was only 15 years old. In the  years since, he has raised three children who are U.S. citizens, is  married to a U.S. citizen, has built a business, and has distinguished  himself as a hard worker and a pillar of the South Kona community in  Hawaii.   Andres' immigrant story is one familiar to so many American families.  After working for more than a decade as a laborer on coffee farms  across the Big Island, Andres saved enough money to buy his own farm.  In the years since, Andres has taken on management of 15 other area  coffee farms.   Suzanne Shriner, president of the Kona Coffee Farmers Association,  put it best in her letter of support for him when she said:         Mr. Ortiz is a true example of the American Dream. Rising       from a farm worker to a farm owner, he has created a       successful business through hard work.        He has sent his children to college. And he has given back       to his community, by working with other farms and farmers to       control an invasive pest. His story is why we need to find a       path to citizenship for these vital members of our farming       community.    Andres has three children. Victoria, age 20, is a junior at the  University of Hawaii. Paola, age 14, and Hector, age 12, are still in  middle school. Their lives will be shattered without their father.   Andres remains on very good terms with his first wife, Veronica  Ledesma Magana. In a letter she wrote to me, Veronica shared how much  Andres cares for his children and how devastated they would be if he is  forced to leave. She said:         Andres is a wonderful father to our children. They depend       on him for so much and need him during these years that are       so important to their development as human beings and       citizens of the United States. Paola and Hector are children       with special education needs.        This has been very hard for us as parents, but together we       have worked to help her through school and life.        I am not able to support this family by myself.        Andres is an amazing role model to my children. He is a       patient, loving, and supportive father to them in whatever       they need. Victoria, Paola, and Hector love Andres very much       and would go through extreme emotional hardship if he is       deported.    She continues:         My oldest daughter will need to halt her college career to       help me support Paola and Hector, especially because this       deportation would bar him from returning to the [United       States] for 10 years.        My children deserve a father to care for them, they deserve       the educational opportunities he can offer them, and the love       he shares with them every day.    I couldn't agree more.   In September 2014, Andres received a stay of removal in order to  pursue various paths to achieving legal status. In fact, he has a  pending application to receive such legal status.   Last November, he applied for an additional stay. Without warning or  explanation, the government changed its position in March 2017 and  ordered that he be removed.   At that point, Andres filed for relief in Federal court. His case  ultimately reached the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where his  request for an emergency stay was denied. Although the Ninth Circuit  found it could not stay his removal, the chief judge of that court,  Judge Reinhardt, issued a powerful, concurring opinion that clarifies  the injustice in this case and made a powerful moral argument against  President Trump's immigration policy.   Judge Reinhardt wrote:         It was fully within the government's power to once more       grant his reasonable request. Instead, it has ordered him       deported immediately. In doing so, the government forces us       to participate in ripping apart a family. Three United States       citizen children will now have to choose between their father       and their country. If they leave their homeland with their       father, the children would be forced to move to a nation with       which they have no connection. All three children were born       in the United States. None has ever lived in Mexico or       learned Spanish. Moving with their father would uproot their       lives, interrupt their education, and deprive them of the       opportunities afforded by growing up in this country. If they       remain in the United States, however, the children would not       only lose a parent, but might also be deprived of their home,       their opportunity for higher education, and their financial       support.        Subjecting vulnerable children to a choice between       expulsion to a foreign land or losing the care and support of       their father is not how this nation should treat its       citizens.        President Trump has claimed that his immigration policies       would target the ``bad hombres.'' The government's decision       to remove Magana Ortiz shows that even the good hombres are       not safe.    Mr. Ortiz is by all accounts a pillar of his community and a devoted  father and husband.   The court went on to say:         It is difficult to see how the government's decision to       expel him is consistent with the President's promise of an       immigration system with ``a lot of heart.'' I find no such       compassion in the government's choice to deport Magana Ortiz.        We are unable to prevent Magana Ortiz's removal, yet it is       contrary to the values of this Nation and its legal system.       Indeed, the government's decision to remove Magana Ortiz       diminishes not only our country but our courts, which are       supposedly dedicated to the pursuit of justice.        Magana Ortiz and his family are in truth not the only       victims. Among others are judges who, forced to participate       in such inhumane acts, suffer a loss of dignity and humanity       as well. I concur as a judge, but as a citizen I do not.    Judge Reinhardt made an important point, and I agree. The government  has the power to prevent this family from being torn apart. Even now,  Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly can issue an administrative  stay to let Andres stay in this country while the government processes  his application to receive legal status.   Earlier this week, I spoke to Secretary Kelly on the phone to discuss  Andres' case and to urge him to issue a stay that would allow him to  stay in this country. Hawaii's congressional delegation has also  written him a letter and provided a variety of other letters of support  that Andres' friends, family, and neighbors have written on his behalf.   Secretary Kelly, I renew our call once more: Let Andres stay in our  country. Let his children have a father present and active in their  lives. It is not too late to keep this family together.   This entire ordeal speaks to the fear and anxiety spreading through  immigrant communities across our country. Even the good hombres, as  Judge Reinhardt called them, are at risk of being torn away from their  families.   In an email, a spokesperson for ICE said: ``While criminal aliens and  those who pose a threat to public safety will continue to be a focus,  DHS will NOT''--and the word ``not'' is in all caps--``exempt classes  of removable aliens from potential enforcement.'' This is chilling. It  means that 11 million people in our country will live in fear that they  could be deported at a moment's notice.   We must pass comprehensive immigration reform that provides a pathway  to citizenship and which prioritizes the unity of families. Andres'  case is a tragedy, if not averted. There will be more cases like his in  Hawaii and across the country. We must continue to fight on behalf of  the good hombres and not stop until we succeed.   I would like to conclude by reading part of a letter I received from  Gerald Personius, one of Andres' friends and a fellow coffee farmer  from Captain Cook. He said:         Andres is a courageous, honest, caring, and dedicated       person. So I ask you as a citizen of our beloved country to       do the best you can to help this man continue to pursue his       citizenship. He will not let America down.    We cannot let Mr. Ortiz down.   I yield the floor.   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.  [[Page S3353]]
