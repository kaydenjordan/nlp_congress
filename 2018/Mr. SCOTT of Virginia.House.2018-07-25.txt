 Mr. Speaker, I rise as ranking member of the  Committee on Education and the Workforce in support of H.R. 2353, the  Strengthening CTE for the 21st Century Act, which will reauthorize the  Perkins Career and Technical Education Program, the CTE program.   Mr. Speaker, the House passed the CTE reauthorization in the last  Congress and again last year. The Senate made minor changes to the  bill, and now we are on the verge of final passage today. In passing  the bill, we will be updating the Federal investment in CTE to provide  increased State flexibility, while ensuring greater accountability for  program quality.   H.R. 2353 will also require a more inclusive collaboration between  educational institutions, industry, employers, and community partners.   Today's CTE will not be the vocational education of the past. Workers  rarely hold the same job for 40 years. Workers often have several jobs  throughout their careers, which is why modern CTE programs must help  ensure that students receive a foundational education that will help  students switch in their career or academic tracks at any time.   I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Krishnamoorthi) and the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for their bipartisan  leadership, and, of course, the chair of the Committee on Education and  the Workforce, Dr. Foxx. Because of their work, the House was able to  produce a comprehensive reauthorization of Perkins CTE, which will  improve program quality and services for students, and support  educational programming that engages all students by linking core  academic content with real-world, work-based skills development.
