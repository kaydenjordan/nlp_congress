 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman very much for  yielding.   I, too, add my appreciation to Mr. Collins' eagerness to adhere to  what I think is an appropriate policy that reasserts the article I  authority, if you will, of the Congress. And I think it is important  for my colleagues to recognize that Americans are wondering. They are  wondering. They have heard over and over again of Russian collusion.  They have heard the factual affirmation that the Russians did interfere  with the 2016 election and tried to interfere with the 2018 election.  Therefore, it is important for them, in their concern, to be informed.  They are taxpayers. We say this all the time.                                time  0945    And it is important to note that, through this investigation, the  National Security Advisor and former foreign policy advisor and many  others have gone to court because of Mr. Mueller.   It is indeed important to know that we have learned much because of  his report, but we have not learned all. And we must overcome Attorney  General Barr's hesitation, because the American people have made the  point. The point is that 68 percent of them say that they would like to  see this report.   Now, we know that it has been bandied around that we cannot indict a  President. This is not about indicting a President. But assuming,  arguendo, that this regulation is correct, that someone thinks that  that is constant law and the President cannot be subjected to criminal  process and, therefore, cannot and should not be indicted, it is a  logical fallacy to say that because he cannot be indicted by virtue of  his office and because it is the Justice Department's regulation not to  reveal information about unindicted parties and individuals.   The Justice Department cannot reveal any information or potential  wrongdoing by the President and not reveal any information to the body  that possesses the constitutional responsibility for holding this  President accountable.   So let us follow good policy. Even the words of Attorney General Barr  that recognizes that the DOJ's purpose is to release investigations in  the public interest. This is in the public interest.   Mr. Speaker, I would suggest to all that we do this in a bipartisan  way to give to the American people what they deserve and what they  want.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committee on Judiciary, which  has oversight of the Department of Justice, and as a Senior Member of  the Committee on Homeland Security, which has oversight over our  election security infrastructure, I rise in strong support of H. Con.  Res. 24.   Mr. Speaker, I rise because I believe our nation will soon be at an  inflection point.   For many years now, Americans have wondered about the role of  Russia's interference in the 2016 election and whether that crime was  aided and abetted by Associates of the Trump Campaign.   Americans have been concerned as we have watched a parade of  colleagues and contemporaries of the President hauled before court.   This includes the President's National Security Advisor, his longtime  confidante, his former foreign policy advisor, and yesterday his former  campaign manager and his former campaign manager.   Indeed, the future that awaits the President's former campaign  manager is bleak--he is facing 7.5 years in federal prison, and today a  16-count indictment was returned in Manhattan detailing residential  mortgage fraud, conspiracy and falsifying business records.   Indeed, most if not all of what we have learned about those who  surround the president has been because of the work of the Special  Counsel, Robert Mueller.   It is important that whatever work Mr. Mueller has done, be shared by  the American people.   This is for any number of reasons.   First of all, broad swaths of the American people want this report  published.   The last public opinion poll conducted showed that 68% of Americans  want this Mueller report published.   Next, the entire purpose of appointing a special counsel was because  the president's first attorney General had to recuse himself because he  was found to be less-than-truthful about his contacts with Kremlin  officials during the 2016 campaign, on behalf of then Candidate Trump.   According to the former Acting Attorney General, the Special Counsel  was appointed in order for the American people to have full confidence  in the outcome of the investigation . . . the public must be assured  that government officials administer the law fairly.   And thus far, Mr. Mueller's investigation has revealed the public  indictment of 34 individuals, 3 companies, 7 guilty pleas and one 1  conviction following trial.   Through the work done by Mr. Mueller and his ``speaking  indictments,'' we learned that Russian military officials tried to wage  an active measures campaign.   We know that the Russians manipulated our social media systems.   They did this by turning our social media platforms like Twitter and  Facebook, into rowdy and unwieldy debates that turned Americans against  one another.   They did this by creating fake online social media accounts and  populated them on social media platforms.   After infiltrating the social media accounts of real Americans, these  fake accounts sought to sow discord in these online communities by  purposely exacerbating divisions within our nation and creating new  ones--all with the intent of pitting Americans against one another.   While they were distorting the social media landscape, they were also  selectively disseminating emails stolen from the Democratic National  Committee and the campaign of Hillary Clinton with the purpose of  timing the dissemination to maximize political damage on Secretary  Clinton's campaign.   All the while, the President was encouraging this behavior.   And, despite protestations by the President, this is not a witch  hunt--it has yielded the  [[Page H2728]]  public indictments of 34 individuals and 3 companies, 7 guilty pleas,  and 1 conviction.   The American people are watching and paying attention.   The most recent public opinion poll shows that a super majority of  Americans--a full 68%--wants the Mueller Report made public.   The Mueller Report is one unparalleled way in which Americans can  learn this information with confidence.   And, finally, we must tackle a serious issue that is being discussed  among elected officials and the Justice Department.   Over the past two years, we have been told that it is Justice  Department regulations that a sitting President cannot be indicted. I  will note that this principle has not been tested in court.   That regulation was implemented during the Watergate investigation,  under the theory that the President cannot be subjected to criminal  process.   But, assuming arguendo that this regulation is correct, and the  President cannot be subjected to criminal process and therefore cannot  and should not be indicted, it is a logical fallacy to say that because  he cannot be indicted by virtue of his office, and because it is  Justice Department regulation not to reveal information about  unindicted parties and individuals, the Justice Department cannot  reveal any information of potential wrongdoing by the President and not  reveal any information to the body that possesses the constitutional  responsibility for holding this president accountable.   For these reasons, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 24, and  urge my colleagues to support it and urge passage so the American  people can learn how the 2016 election became a crime scene.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to David  Leon Loya. This is a young man who was full of life.   David loved life and enjoyed something that many of us have  participated in and that we see more Americans doing across the Nation,  and that is bicycling. He was an avid bicyclist and enjoyed the  outdoors in Houston, Texas.   He was a young man with a future before him with a loving family.   He was a young man that we want to pay tribute to because we know  that he exhibited values of love and generosity, because of the  community who came out to express their remorse and their sadness that  he lost his life while bicycling.   We understand, in tribute to him, recognizing that as the world  changes, more Americans will be riding their bicycle. We want to make  sure, in his name, that we have designed bicycle paths, that in the  urban areas they cover streets in a lighted way so that vehicles can  acknowledge those on bicycles and that they can be protected.   David Leon Loya, we honor him and love him. In his name, Mr. Speaker,  we will make these bicycle paths the best and the most safe, and he  will not have died in vain.   To his family, my deepest sympathy.                            ____________________
