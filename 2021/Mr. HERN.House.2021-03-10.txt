 Mr. Speaker, last year, I stood right here and argued  against the many concerns I have with the PRO Act. Thirteen months  later, nothing has been done to address those concerns or earn  bipartisan support.   The PRO Act is a dangerous example of power for union leaders without  necessary protections for union members.   One of the biggest glaring failures of this legislation is taking  away employee choice, effectively repeating right-to-work laws across  the country, like in my home State of Oklahoma, where we choose to  empower employees and employers alike. Where workers have previously  had the freedom to choose whether or not to pay fees and join unions,  they will now be forced to pay membership fees or lose their job.   American workers and American ingenuity made our country what it is  [[Page H1194]]  today. If my colleagues insist on moving forward with legislation that  empowers union bosses and strips independence from our workers, we will  lose to countries like China, who profit from sweatshops and child  labor.   Many of the ideas in this bill have already been rejected in the  court system, making this bill pointless and a waste of time.                            ____________________
