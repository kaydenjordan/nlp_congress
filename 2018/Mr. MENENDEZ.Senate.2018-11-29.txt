 Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the  nomination of Thomas Farr to the Eastern District of North Carolina.  Those who sit on the Federal bench are bound to uphold the Constitution  for all Americans, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, or political  leaning, but Mr. Farr cannot be trusted to defend equal justice under  the law.   Working to disenfranchise voters with a particular hostility toward  African-American voters has been his lifelong passion. Consider his  work for Jesse Helms' 1990 Senate campaign. We all know Helms' record  on race.   When the Justice Department brought a lawsuit against the Helms  campaign for sending over 100,000 postcards to mostly African-American  voters, falsely warning them that they were ineligible to vote and  could be prosecuted for casting a ballot, it was Mr. Farr who defended  the scheme. Yet, despite having served as the Helms' campaign attorney,  Farr denied having any involvement with the postcards in his Senate  questionnaire.   Mr. Farr claimed he did not ``participate in any meetings in which  the postcards were discussed before they were sent,'' but according to  the former head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division,  Gerald Hebert, ``the answers in [Farr's] questionnaire are contrary to  the facts.''   Mr. Hebert took contemporaneous notes while investigating the Helms  campaign--notes that place Mr. Farr at  [[Page S7203]]  a meeting on the postcard scheme just 3 weeks before they were sent.   Years later, Farr led a 3-year legal battle to defend North Carolina  law that disgracefully shortened early voting, instituted onerous  government ID requirements, and eliminated same-day voter registration  and out-of-precinct voting, all of which are known to  disproportionately suppress minority, elderly, and disabled voters.   Federal courts ruled the law unconstitutional for targeting African- American voters ``with almost surgical precision''--purposeful,  surgical precision--calling it the most restrictive law since the era  of Jim Crow.   I know Republicans want to confirm as many judges as possible, but  why this judge when there are so many other qualified jurists to choose  from? I think it is because they know the GOP agenda of enriching big  corporations at the expense of everyday working families is incredibly  unpopular with the American people.   Consider that while the Republicans held onto the Senate this year,  they lost by 16 million votes nationwide. Democracy is supposed to be a  battle of ideas, but when it comes to healthcare or student loan debt  or climate change, they don't have any. When you can't win a fair  fight, what do you do? You tilt the playing field in your favor.   Republicans want to stack the court with judges who will do their  bidding--grossly out of step with the American people on everything  from voting rights and redistricting to healthcare and climate change,  to the constitutionality of Whitaker's appointment to lead the Justice  Department. That is what Leader McConnell meant about nominations being  Republicans' best chance of having a long-term impact on the Nation's  future. It is their best chance at denying minorities from voting and  forcing their bad ideas on the American people.   The Republicans are so intent on confirming judges with shameful  records on voter suppression that they have shredded the blue-slip  process here in the Senate, which allows the Senators to green-light or  to prevent hearings on nominees from their home States. It is a  process--Senator Hatch once called the blue-slip process the last  remaining check on the President's judicial appointment power.   Ironically, back in 2013, when President Obama nominated an African- American assistant U.S. attorney named Jennifer May-Parker to this very  seat, the Democrats respected Senator Burr's decision not to return a  blue slip, and then-Chairman Pat Leahy chose not to hold a Judiciary  Committee hearing. Then, in 2016, President Obama nominated Patricia  Timmons-Goodson, the first African-American woman on the North Carolina  Supreme Court, to this same seat. If confirmed, either of these  trailblazing women would have become the first African American to  serve in the Eastern District of North Carolina--a district that is 27- percent African American. Yet neither Senator Burr nor Senator Tillis  returned a blue slip for Ms. Timmons-Goodson; thus, Chairman Grassley  did not act on her nomination.   Yet, today, President Trump's nominees are being confirmed despite  objections from home State Senators. Paul Matey, a nominee from New  Jersey, will likely become another example. Neither I nor Senator  Booker were meaningfully consulted by the White House regarding New  Jersey's open seat on the Third Circuit. For several reasons, we  haven't returned blue slips for Paul Matey; yet they moved ahead with  the hearing for him. So it has been eviscerated--totally, totally.   It has gone little by little. First, if one of the two Senators  turned in a blue slip, that was enough. Now it doesn't matter that  neither Senator turns in a blue slip; they go ahead with the hearing  and probably with a vote. So the precious check and balance that  Senator Hatch talked about as the last vestige of a check and balance  on judicial nominations has largely been lost.   The Republicans claim to be the party of conservatism. Yet I see  nothing conservative in their willingness to sweep aside century-old  procedures for policy gain. They put their party before their country  and show no fidelity to the institutions that have truly made this  country great. Something is wrong with any political party that makes  the suppression of voters its chief electoral strategy. Mr. Farr is  just one more card in their deliberate effort to stack the deck against  our democracy, to disenfranchise voters and force their unpopular, bad  ideas on our country.   For the sake of our democracy, I urge my colleagues, in this case  particularly, to do the decent thing, to do the right thing--to stand  up for the voting rights of all Americans and reject this nominee.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to raise the alarm about  the escalating violence in the Anglophone regions of Cameroon and to  urge the administration to develop  [[Page S7234]]  and execute a meaningful strategy to help prevent additional bloodshed.   For several years, Cameroon, a historically stable country bridging  west and central Africa, has faced a significant security threat in its  far north. Boko Haram combatants, originating from Nigeria, have  crossed the border into Cameroon and carried out hundreds of attacks on  local residents. Reports indicate Boko Haram killed more than 900  people in 2017 in Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin subregion, which  includes northern Cameroon. Boko Haram's Islamic State-aligned splinter  faction, ISIS-West Africa, also poses a threat to the country. With  U.S. help, Cameroon has been responding to the challenge, although some  of these efforts have prompted concerns about its military's respect  for human rights.   Now, Cameroon faces another challenge, one that some observers fear  has already burgeoned into a civil war. A budding separatist insurgency  emerged in Cameroon's Anglophone regions in 2017. Insurgent attacks and  a brutal military crackdown have caused significant internal  displacement and given rise to credible allegations of serious human  rights abuses by both separatists and government security forces. The  separatist movement grew out of longstanding grievances among  Anglophones over their perceived political and economic  marginalization. These tensions worsened in 2016 due to the central  government's appointments of French-speakers to local schools and  courts in Cameroon's Anglophone majority western provinces in 2016. The  government violently suppressed a largely peaceful protest movement  that arose in response, quashing demonstrations by force, arresting  prominent civil society activists on what appear to be trumped up  terrorism charges, cutting internet access to the region, and banning  some civil society organizations.   On October 1, 2017, secessionists symbolically declared the  independence of ``Ambazonia.'' According to Amnesty International,  security forces responded by killing at least 20 protestors and  arresting over 500. Cameroonian soldiers have reportedly killed  civilians, used excessive force against peaceful demonstrators,  tortured and mistreated suspected separatists and detainees, and burned  hundreds of homes in several villages as violence has escalated. Some  extremist Anglophone separatists, meanwhile, have burned down schools;  kidnapped traditional leaders, police, and government administrators;  and killed civilians. More than 220 civilians have lost their lives,  according to the International Crisis Group, including an American  missionary killed in October when he was caught in crossfire between  armed groups. As of May, at least 160,000 people were internally  displaced, 80 percent of whom are reportedly hiding in forests. At  least 25,000 Cameroonians have sought refuge in Nigeria since late  2017, according to UN agencies, although some observers on the ground  assess the number of refugees and internally displaced to be higher.   The separatist insurgency and the heavy handed government response  has put thousands of innocent lives at risk, destabilizing an already  fragile region.   There is no military solution to this problem. Immediate, strategic  action by the government, the diaspora, separatist leaders, as well as  the U.S, and other international partners could bring peace, but the  window of opportunity to prevent widespread civil conflict is quickly  closing. I therefore call on each of the aforementioned actors to take  steps right away to avert the worst case scenario.   The Trump administration must develop a comprehensive strategy to  prevent widespread conflict and violence. This strategy must go beyond  military support. The State and Defense Departments have administered  training and equipment in support of the Cameroonian military's  counterterrorism efforts, as well as its peacekeeping deployment to the  Central African Republic. However, disturbing reports of security force  abuses in the far north and Anglophone regions merit serious attention.  I trust and expect that the administration is conducting Leahy vetting  on all of the individual and units with whom it is working. But we must  do more. Given that security force abuses have been shown to be a major  driver of extremist recruitment in Africa, the State Department should  conduct a thorough policy review of our decision to partner with  Cameroon on counterterrorism and in security assistance more broadly.   A critical element of the administration's approach must be support  for building democratic practices, assistance aimed at opening  political space, and activities to combat corruption in Cameroon. While  this administration may fail to understand that democratic values,  human rights, and good governance promote long-term sustainable peace,  Members of this body understand that these values are and must remain a  core component of U.S. foreign policy. I am pleased that the  administration has finally seen fit to set aside money in Fiscal Year  2018 funds for such activities, after years of disappointing neglect  for the sector. But $1 million is far too modest an amount to have an  appreciable impact. Our actions must match our rhetoric. Our Ambassador  in Cameroon has been outspoken, forthright, and, as perhaps a  predictable result, has been unfairly criticized by the government.  State Department officials at the highest levels here in Washington  must support him in speaking truth to power both publicly and in  private messaging, and follow that messaging with actions that will  have a tangible impact.   The government of Cameroon must take urgent steps as well. President  Paul Biya's administration has applied a military solution to a  political problem. It must now must take critical steps to forestall a  worse-case scenario by committing to a political resolution. The  highest levels of government--including President Biya--must rethink  the wisdom of sending the Cameroonian military to make war upon its own  citizens. It should publicly and unequivocally instruct security forces  to stop targeting civilians, cease abuses and excesses, and hold those  responsible for human rights abuses accountable--including through  military prosecutions where appropriate--in a clear, transparent  manner.   The government should facilitate access to the Anglophone regions by  humanitarian organizations and independent human rights investigators.  I urge the government to consider neutral third party mediation to  engage organizations that represent Anglophones and facilitate a  dialogue without preconditions to end the violence. In January 2018,  Nigerian authorities forcibly returned 47 Anglophone activists,  including reported asylum seekers, to Cameroon, where they were  detained as ``terrorists.'' To show its good faith support for a  peaceful resolution, the government should release peaceful, moderate  voices from the Anglophone region who represent those with legitimate  political grievances. And the Biya administration must be willing to  contemplate greater political decentralization to address legitimate  grievances in peripheral regions--possibly including a return to  federalism.   The government needs to open political space more broadly. In the  wake of October's elections, President Biya, who has been in office  since 1982, will serve a seventh term in office. October's elections  are the latest in a string of elections marred by controversy,  harassment of opposition, and other irregularities. A press conference  broadcast on state-run television featuring people identified as  international election observers from Transparency International--who  in fact were in no way affiliated with that organizations endorsing the  conduct of elections, was a brazen attempt to provide a veneer of  legitimacy to a process that was deeply flawed due to restricted  political space.   It is time for President Biya to cement his legacy by laying the  groundwork for meaningful political competition in Cameroon. As Benin's  then-President Mathieu Kerekou said in 2009 when he decided not to  change the constitution and run for a third term, ``if you do not leave  power, power will leave you.'' Future elections must take place on a  level playing field. In this year's elections the field was heavily  tilted in favor of the ruling party. Addressing meaningful barriers to  political participation may go a long way towards addressing the root  causes of discontent in the Anglophone regions.   I call upon separatist leaders and their supporters to commit to  seeking a peaceful, negotiated solution to the  [[Page S7235]]  Anglophone crisis. The separatists too must support accountability for  all actors engaged in hostilities who may have committed human rights  abuses. Attacks on civilians are inexcusable. All armed and political  actors must unequivocally condemn human rights abuses,   Finally, the diaspora has a critical role to play. I urge members of  the diaspora to clearly and unambiguously condemn violence in the  Anglophone regions of Cameroon. The inflammatory rhetoric on social  media by some Cameroonians at home and abroad is unhelpful. All  diaspora should scrupulously investigate the charities and  organizations to which they are contributing funding, lest they  unwittingly send money to organizations that have engaged in violence  against the very people they are trying to help.   Mr. President, the U.S. and Cameroon have a long history of cordial  relations. Peace Corps has been in Cameroon since 1962. State  Department and USAID-administered bilateral funding amounted to $83  million in FY2017. And for the past decade we have partnered with  Cameroon to counter terrorism and maritime piracy, with U.S. security  assistance rising substantially since 2014 in response to the Boko  Haram crisis. Since 2015, Cameroon has hosted hundreds of U.S. military  personnel who conduct regional intelligence, reconnaissance, and  surveillance operations and otherwise support counterterrorism efforts.  As conditions on the ground deteriorate, the U.S. is in a position  where immediate concentrated action to support a resolution of the  problem might disrupt the cycle of violence and help all parties work  toward a negotiated solution. Our diplomatic intervention, if well  thought out, could make a difference. I urge the administration to take  swift, meaningful action.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
