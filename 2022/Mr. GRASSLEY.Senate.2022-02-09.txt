 Madam President, last week, a member of the Biden  administration was confused--very confused--why FOX News is talking all  the time about crime. That person is the Press Secretary to President  Biden, Ms. Psaki. She said Americans care more about what is happening  in their daily lives than what the news says about crime.  [[Page S592]]    How much more out of touch could the Biden administration be? Crime  is happening in Americans' daily lives all across America. Thousands  more people a year are being murdered.   Violent crime has increased for 2 years, and there is no sign of it  slowing down.   The administration's plan to fix the violent crime spike is merely  another partisan gun control plan. That is what they think about, doing  something about crime: control the guns of people who abide by the law.   They won't seriously reduce violent crime. If you do that, it focuses  on issues that make up a tiny fraction of violent crimes or maybe it  doesn't contribute to the problem at all.   For example, the administration wants to crack down on ghost guns,  but ghost guns are involved in only a fraction of 1 percent of the  crimes--particularly of the murders.   The Biden administration also wants to focus on the so-called ``Iron  Pipeline,'' and that is blaming red States for guns in crime-ridden  blue States. But on that issue, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and  Firearms, their data shows that guns used in blue-city crimes usually  come from that very same blue State.   Finally, the Biden administration wants to focus on lawful gun  sellers, but we have a Department of Justice study finding most crimes  are committed with stolen guns from the black market.   So I worry about the Department of Justice could use efforts to  reduce violent crime as a pretext to harass lawful gun dealers and  owners. Gun sales have increased nationwide because Americans don't  feel safe anymore. They feel the police are not proactively policing,  so they get a gun to protect themselves.   Honest people who don't break the law want to feel safe, and that  makes them feel safe. I don't blame them for taking protection of their  life and property into their hands.   I related recently about the increases in crime that have nothing to  do with guns, and yet all we hear from this administration is about  controlling guns. But what does that have to do--gun control is not  going to stop criminals from pushing people in front of subway trains.  Gun control won't stop flash mobs from stealing goods from stores. It  isn't going to stop the thieves from looting train yards, and you see  evidence of this all the time on television--almost daily--people going  into stores with bags, filling it up, and just think in San Francisco  some prosecutor said if you steal less than $950, you won't be  prosecuted.   So you wonder why people commit crime. If you aren't going to pay a  penalty for it, why not do it? So the Biden administration is wasting  precious resources and taxpayer dollars on partisan pet projects of gun  control.   The Biden administration has ordered the Department of Justice to  look like it is doing something without really doing anything at all.   You know what Americans actually need to reduce violent crime? They  need police forces empowered to do their jobs with the right resources  and protections.   Now, we hear the Biden administration just last week in New York  saying it supports police. The President himself was up there. But a  leaked Executive order shows it wants to take away their nonlethal,  lifesaving tools, and make it more difficult for police to get grants  for funding.   Americans also need responsible bail policies--these policies that,  if they were responsible, wouldn't let dangerous criminals back out  onto the streets to kill people.   They need prosecutors who will actually do their job to keep violent  criminals away from the vulnerable. The Biden administration has a  chance to make a real difference in reducing violent crime. It is a  shame that they are wasting their time and resources on a misleading  message.   When you see the prosecutors in Los Angeles and San Francisco listing  a whole bunch of crimes that they are not going to prosecute, it just  invites lawbreaking. We need to stop this ``defund the police''  crusade. We need to step up prosecution. We need to eliminate  progressive prosecutors. We need to make sure that people don't get  bail if they are repeat criminals or a threat to society.   In the final analysis, taxpayers are paying for public safety, but in  some places in the United States, they aren't getting their money's  worth for public safety they pay for. Government is set up to maintain  public safety, and that is what we are all about with this War on  Crime, protecting the taxpayers, protecting every citizen taxpayer or  not.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I want to take a moment to recognize the  life and memory of Dr. Donald Gurnett. Dr. Gurnett recently passed away  following a lifetime of scientific curiosity and achievements. Dr.  Gurnett studied, taught, and researched at the University of Iowa for  more than 60 years.   His career was rooted in his childhood interest in flight, where he  built rockets and model planes, which led to studying electrical  engineering at the University of Iowa. During his studies, he had the  opportunity to work and learn with Dr. James Van Allen, who helped  launch the first U.S. satellite into space and established the field of  magnetospheric space research. Dr.  [[Page S610]]  Gurnett's success led to working on more than 30 spacecraft projects,  including Voyager 1 and 2 flights to the outer planets, the Galileo  mission to Jupiter, and the Cassini mission to Saturn.   His legacy remains with the students he mentored by pushing them to  take on important projects and work towards their own success. In 2019,  I wrote about the importance of STEM education and the accomplishments  by Drs. Van Allen and Gurnett. I think my words then still encompass  the curiosity and passion that Dr. Gurnett carried with him throughout  his life.         For the students across Iowa heading to class in the new       school year, remember to dream big. Don't forget that a       couple of farm boys from Mount Pleasant and Fairfax reached       for the stars and wrote new chapters of space innovation and       exploration. Their odyssey took them all over the world and       their scientific quest took their research beyond the solar       system to interstellar space.                            ____________________
