 Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss where we are now and where  I expect to be in the coming hours and days.   First of all, I would caution all of us. We had a procedure in place  where we would come on the floor in relatively small numbers and exit  the floor.   Our President and the First Lady have been found to be afflicted with  COVID-19. We pray for their health and their safety.   But we ought to also admonish ourselves to practice that distancing  and that wearing a mask. We don't wear them when we are speaking so  people can hear us, but I would urge all of us to understand that,  obviously, COVID-19 is still very much among us. And for all of our  sakes, and for the people's sake who we represent who want us to be  healthy and articulate their position when we come to the floor, that  we would be cautious.   Secondly, let me say, Mr. Speaker, that we have not, sadly, come to  either a legislative agreement or an agreement between the  administration and ourselves on a resolution of the next steps to take  dealing with the COVID health crisis and the economic consequences of  that crisis.   I want to tell Members that it is my expectation that this will be  after this coming vote, which will be the last vote of today. There may  well be, in discussions with our both sides, unanimous consent  requests, but obviously they will have to be unanimous consent  requests, and they will be agreements between both sides.   In addition to that, we will not be leaving for the break that  usually occurs in October for the election that is about to come  because, obviously, all of us want the opportunity to be talking to our  constituents, but we also have a responsibility to ensure that our  constituents are safe and get the help that they need.   So we are negotiating, and negotiations are going on as we speak  between the administration and between our side of the aisle both here  and across the Capitol. Hopefully, those negotiations will bear fruit  sooner rather than later. When I say ``sooner rather than later,'' I  hope that this weekend perhaps an agreement can be reached.   Now, if an agreement is reached, it will take some time to  memorialize that agreement on paper. So I do not necessarily expect  that a Monday or Tuesday vote is likely, but I want everybody to know,  and it will be 24 hours' notice. It will not be 36 and it will not be  48 hours. I know that is difficult, but I think all of us feel, on both  sides of the aisle, an urgency.   Clearly, for tactical reasons, we go back and forth and try to get an  advantage on one another. That is what both sides do. I will tell you  as sincerely as I can tell you, I know that the Speaker, who is  negotiating with Secretary Mnuchin, I believe both of them are  negotiating in goodwill, and both of them very much want to get to an  agreement.   I know how hard our Speaker has been working and I know how hard  Secretary Mnuchin has been working because I know, when they meet with  one another and when they talk with one another on the phone, I almost  invariably get a call from the Speaker, saying: This is what happens.  This is where we are.   So I want to advise all of you that, while this vote that is to come  is going to be our last vote of the day--and I don't expect even if an  agreement were reached in the next hour that we would be able to bring  something to the floor.   So after this next vote, Members are free to go where they want to  go. Just be aware that there will be very short--no shorter than 24  hours'--notice so that we can come back and try to do what the American  people want us to do, notwithstanding the fact we have different  perspectives exactly what that is.   I hope that all of us will be focused and will be thinking about what  we think is a reasonable agreement that we will reach, and hopefully  whatever agreement is reached will be perceived by both sides as  something that we can vote for.   Obviously, it won't have everything in it that each person wants or  maybe has something that each person or some people may not want, but  we have come together four times, Mr. Speaker. One was by unanimous  consent. There was no vote. It passed by voice vote. I don't know if  everybody was for, it but at least nobody said ``no.'' The other three  were overwhelmingly passed and, in the Senate, I think at least twice,  by voice vote.  [[Page H5659]]    So that, Mr. Speaker, is where we are at this point in time. I may  make another announcement 45 minutes from now just to let other Members  know.   I hope Members are watching, and certainly we will send it out, but  Members need to check flights, obviously. My staff member tells me. I  presume all of you understand that you have to check which flights are  available. Obviously, that is a challenge. One of the things that we  need to deal with is, obviously, the airlines. We need to deal with a  lot of other things as well, and we will try to do that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
