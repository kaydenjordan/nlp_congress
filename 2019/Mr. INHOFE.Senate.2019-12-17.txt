 Mr. President, the vote we are talking about is to waive  the budget point of order that was raised by Senator Enzi. If the  budget point of order is not waived, the NDAA--which I believe is the  most significant vote we pass every year; it has passed for 58  consecutive years--will be referred back to committee. So that is  really what is at stake here.   The budget point of order on the NDAA is primarily caused by three  provisions: first, repealing the widow's tax phased in over 3 years. We  have been talking about that. That is part of this point of order;  secondly, giving visas to Afghans who work closely with the U.S.  military during the war; and, third, allowing military servicemembers  to file claims for medical malpractice.   Now, all three provisions have significant bipartisan support. The  widow's tax, as was just stated, has 76 cosponsors in the Senate, 383  in the House.   A vote in this Chamber in late September to instruct conference on  the widow's tax passed 94 to 0. You might keep that in mind. Anyone who  talks now about opposing it actually voted for it back in September.   Now, as I mentioned in my remarks last night, I started working to  repeal the widow's tax after being inspired by one of my personal  heroes, a young lady named Jane Horton.   I can remember back in September of 2011, I was in a little town  north of Tulsa, OK--Collinsville, OK--and I was up there talking to  people, the normal type of thing we do, going around speaking with our  constituents, and I recall that is when I first met Jane Horton. She  lived in Collinsville.   After I had visited for a while with the group, I commented that I am  the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I am going to  be going to Afghanistan in this next week. She said that her husband,  Chris Horton, was also right at that moment in Afghanistan. I made the  statement: Well, let's find out where he is, and I did. I checked into  it and arranged to go by to see him as I left for Afghanistan, but I  didn't see him because on September 9, 2011, Chris Horton was killed in  action.   Now, after all of Jane's sacrifices in losing her husband in the line  of duty, it seemed unimaginable to me that she should have to deal with  the further pain of a dollar-for-dollar offset in her benefits as a  Gold Star spouse. So we have worked with Jane and the other Gold Star  spouses for a long time to figure out how we can do this in a  responsible way. That hasn't been talked about so far, but we did it.  So it has happened over a period of time.    Similarly, supporting the Afghan partners who sacrificed so much to  help us help their country has long been a bipartisan priority.  Everyone involved in this conference, including the Department of  Defense, recognized the importance of fixing the medical malpractice  issues in a commonsense fashion.   I understand my colleagues' concerns. We have worked hard to make  each of these provisions fiscally responsible, and we will continue to  do that.   There is a document, which nobody reads anymore, called the  Constitution. The Constitution says that our top priorities here should  be defending America. That is what we are supposed to be doing. Each of  these provisions enables us to better defend America and allows us to  take up this bill and actually pass it for the President to sign.   So I urge you to vote to allow this bill to move to final passage so  that we can send this legislation to the President's desk, where he  said he would sign it immediately, and he will. By doing so, it will  send a clear message to our troops and adversaries that this body is  serious about America's national security.                           Vote on Motion to Waive    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget  Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of applicable budget resolutions,  I move to waive all applicable sections of the act and applicable  budget resolutions for the purpose of the conference report to  accompany S. 1790, and I ask for the yeas and the nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be  in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for as  much time as I need.    Mr. President, as I have reminded you all many times,  this is the 59th straight year we will be passing the NDAA, the  National Defense Authorization Bill. It has passed for all these years  in a row because we all know just how important it is. It is the most  important thing we do around here. We are building on nearly six  decades of bipartisan support for our troops and national security.   This year, I am glad to say, it is no different. We all came together  to produce a conference report that is good for all of America. The  House passed it overwhelmingly; the Senate passed it overwhelmingly. We  voted for it overwhelmingly yesterday. And the President says he will  sign it immediately. I am grateful to the President for understanding  the importance of this bill.    This bill means everything for our national security. Every American  benefits from a strong national defense. Their lives, their  livelihoods, their freedoms are all because we fight to protect them.   When I go around my State of Oklahoma, people think we have the best  of everything militarily. We have the best people. We have the best  soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen. There is no doubt about it. But  we can do better when it comes to giving them the best equipment and  the best training. That is what this bill does. It does that. The  backbone of a strong national defense is the force--the men and women  who lay their lives on the line each and every day.   When I travel around, I like to take some time to meet with the  enlisted guys in the mess halls. You can learn more from them than you  can learn from some of the brass. They are the ones who really know  what it is that we can do to effectively build a strong national  defense. We get to hear what they are worried about. We get to hear how  we can support them.   They need the training and equipment that makes them the most  fearsome fighting force in the world. This bill does that. They need a  safe roof over their heads and over the heads of their families, and  this bill does that. They need to know that they have the full support  of the U.S. Government throughout their service. This bill does that.  At the end of the day, we have the best military in the world because  of our people. We take care of them, and that is what this bill is all  about.   We are here today because of the brave men and women who wear and  have worn the uniform. We are safe and prosperous and free because of  them. That is what this bill is all about.   The Senate just passed the Defense authorization bill for the 59th  year in a row. There isn't much left around here that has that kind of  longevity. It is a testament to the importance of the bill.   It is also a testament to the hard work of the staff. They worked  tirelessly to bring this conference report to the floor. I want to take  just a moment to recognize and thank everyone who made this bill  possible, starting with the Armed Services Committee staff, especially  the staff directors, John Bonsell for the majority and Liz King for the  minority. They are the ones who provided the leadership behind the  scenes. They did most of the work.   Then there is my partner, Senator Jack Reed. We are a real team. We  know how to do things and have learned over the years how to do things  right. I couldn't praise him more. In fact, we had a lot of obstacles  this year that we didn't have before. If it hadn't been for Senator  Reed and the staff working on it, we wouldn't have pulled this thing  off.   A few minutes ago, Senator Reed read the names of all of the members  of the Armed Services Committee. I want to go ahead and get those in my  statement here also.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the names of the Armed  Services Committee staff that were listed by Senator Reed be placed in  the Record in my statement.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         My staff from the Senate Armed Services Committee:        John Wason, Tom Goffus, Stephanie Barna, Greg Lilly, Rick       Berger, Marta Hernandez, Jennie Wright, Adam Barker, Augusta       Binns-Berkey, Al Edwards, Jackie Kerber.        Sean O'Keefe, Tony Pankuch, Brad Patout, Jason Potter, J.R.       Riordan, Katie Sutton, Eric Trager, Dustin Walker, Otis       Winkler, Gwyneth Woolwine, Katie Magnus.        Arthur Tellis, Leah Brewer, Debbie Chiarello, Gary Howard,       Tyler Wilkinson, John Bryant, Patty-Jane Geller, Baher       Iskander, Keri-Lyn Michalke, Jackie Modesett, Soleil Sykes.        From the minority side:        Jody Bennett, Carolyn Chuhta, Jon Clark, Jonathan Epstein,       Jorie Feldman, Creighton Greene, Ozge Guzelsu, Gary Leeling,       Kirk McConnell, Maggie McNamara, Bill Monahan, Mike Noblet,       John Quirk, Arun Seraphin, Fiona Tomlin.     Again, I want to thank my personal staff, office staff,  and floor staff.   We need to pivot to our next task at hand: funding the Department of  Defense. This puts financial resources behind all of the policies we  just approved today.   Our military leaders have told the Armed Services Committee over and  over again--and I have repeated this several times--that stable,  predictable, on-time funding is the most important way Congress can  support our national defense. It is now 2\1/2\ months into the new  year, and we got it done.   To all of my fellow Members here, I thank you again for your support  of the national defense authorization bill.   Merry Christmas.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 6 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
