 Mr. Speaker, today marks the conclusion  of the annual Catholic Schools  [[Page H964]]  Week in America, and I rise today to celebrate these quality  educational institutions.   This year, the theme celebrated was ``Catholic Schools: Communities  of Faith, Knowledge and Service.'' Schools across the country observe  the week with masses, open houses, and other activities for students,  families, parishioners, and community members. Through these events,  schools focus on the value Catholic education provides to young people  and contributions to their church, communities, and to our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, Catholic schools provide an excellent education to  Catholics and non-Catholics alike. These schools offer academic  excellence and faith-filled education for students nationwide. National  test scores, high school graduation rates, college attendance, and  other data show Catholic schools frequently outperform schools in both  the public and private sectors.   While there have been challenges to enrollment in some areas, the  good news is that there is a strong demand and enthusiasm for the  rigorous and quality education Catholic schools provide. Nearly 30  percent of the schools have waiting lists for admission, and new  schools are opening across the country.   Congratulations to all involved in Catholic Schools Week and your  efforts to educate the next generation.                            ____________________
