 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk for the  House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. Senator Markey's question for the House  managers reads as follows:         It has recently been reported that the Russians have hacked       the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma, presumably looking       for information on Hunter Biden. Our intelligence community       has warned us that the Russians will be interfering in the       2020 election. If Donald Trump is acquitted of these pending       charges but is later found to have invited Russian or other       foreign interference  [[Page S735]]       in our 2020 election, what recourse will there be for       Congress under the Dershowitz standard for impeachment, which       requires a president to have committed a statutory crime?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senator, absolutely no recourse. No recourse  whatsoever. If, in fact, it were later to be shown that not only did  the Russians hack Burisma to try to get dirt on the Bidens and drip,  drip, drip it out as they did in the 2016 election--let's say it were  found that they did so at the request of the President of the United  States; that in one of these meetings that the President had with  Vladimir Putin, whose contents is unknown, that the President of the  United States asked the President of Russia to hack Burisma because he  couldn't get the Ukrainians to do what he wanted, so now he was turning  to the Russians to do it. Under the Dershowitz theory of the case,  under the President's theory of the case, that is perfectly fine.   But that is not--that is not how bad it is because it goes further  than that. If the President went further and said to Putin in that  secret meeting: I want you to hack Burisma. I couldn't get the  Ukrainians to do it, and I will tell you what, if you hack Burisma and  you get me some good stuff, then I am going to stop sending money to  Ukraine. And I will go a step further. I am going to stop sending money  to Ukraine so that they can't fight you in Donbass. And what is more,  those sanctions that we imposed on you for your intervention on my  behalf in the last election, I am going to make those go away. I am  going to simply refuse to enforce them. I am going to call it a policy  difference.   That is perfectly fine under their standard. That is not an abuse of  power. You can't say that is criminal. Yet it is akin to crime--or  maybe it is not, but that is what an acquittal here means. It means  that the President is free to engage in all the rest of that conduct,  and it is perfectly fine.   And what is the remedy that my colleagues representing the President  say that you have to that abuse? Well, you can hold up a nominee. That  seems wholly out of scale with the magnitude of the problem. That  process of the appropriations or nominations is not sufficient for a  Chief Executive Officer of the United States who will betray the  national security for his own personal interests.   He got on the phone with Zelensky asking for this favor the day after  Bob Mueller testifies. What do you think he will be capable of doing  the day after he is acquitted here, the day after he feels: I have  dodged another bullet. I really am beyond the reach of the law. My  Attorney General says I can't be indicted; I can't even be  investigated. He closed the investigation into this matter before he  even opened it. And I can't be impeached either. I have got the best of  both worlds. I have got Bill Barr saying I can't be investigated. I  can't be prosecuted. I can be impeached, however. That is what Bill  Barr says. But I have got other lawyers who say I can't be impeached.   That is a recipe for a President who is above the law. Not only is it  not required by the Constitution--quite the contrary. The Founders  knew, coming from a monarchy, that if they were going to give  extraordinary powers to their new Executive, they needed an  extraordinary constraint. They needed a constraint commensurate with  the evil which they sought to contain. That remedy is not holding up a  nomination. The remedy they gave for an Executive that would abuse  their power and endanger the country, that would endanger the integrity  of our elections, was the power of impeachment.   As one of the experts said in the House, if this conduct isn't an  impeachable offense, then nothing is.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from South Carolina.
