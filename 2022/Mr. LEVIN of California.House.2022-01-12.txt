 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano for  yielding and for his support and partnership on this legislation and  all the work that he does leading our committee.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Guard and Reserve GI Bill  Parity Act, bipartisan legislation I introduced to deliver some basic  fairness in the way we provide GI Bill benefits for the men and women  who serve our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, the GI Bill has allowed millions of veterans to pursue  higher education and find rewarding career paths.                                time  1300    Servicemembers consistently cite GI Bill benefits as one of the top  reasons  [[Page H53]]  they choose to serve in our Armed Forces because of the opportunities  those benefits provide for them and their families. However, the way  that we allow servicemembers to accrue GI benefits is inherently  unfair. While Active-Duty servicemembers receive credit for GI Bill  benefits every day that they are in the service, Guard and Reserve  members only accrue those benefits in very limited circumstances.   That disparity continues to exist despite the fact that Guard and  Reserve members are increasingly taking on the same risks and doing the  same jobs as their Active-Duty counterparts. We have seen this trend  for decades but it has become especially pronounced over the last 2  years.   In response to the attack on our Capitol on January 6 of last year,  25,000 National Guard members mobilized from 54 States and territories  to protect this institution. For a time, they slept on the cold, hard  floors of this building. National Guard members have also deployed  across our country to support the COVID-19 response, including Guard  members who deployed from Ohio, Maryland, Delaware, and Georgia to  assist healthcare operations this month.   In 2020, 1,300 soldiers and airmen from five different States were  mobilized to fight wildfires in my State of California and throughout  the West Coast. Not only are these National Guard and Reserve members  risking their lives to serve our country, but they are also forced to  put their civilian lives on hold when they are called up, leaving  behind their families and interrupting civilian careers. Similarly,  they are forced to put their lives on hold every time they are called  up for training. In some of those settings they are serving side by  side with Active Duty members doing similar jobs and facing similar  risks, but they are not earning the same GI Bill benefits as their  peers. That is unacceptable and it is shameful that we have asked Guard  and Reserve members to step up in response to natural disasters, the  pandemic, and an attack on our democracy without providing them with  this fundamental benefit.   Clearly, it is long past time that we provide some basic fairness in  the way that we allow Guard and Reserve members to accrue these  benefits. The legislation that we are considering today will do exactly  that, with a simple fix to ensure that every day they spend in uniform  counts towards their GI Bill benefits.   Now, I know my friends on the other side of the aisle might raise  concerns about the costs of expanding eligibility for these benefits,  and I would note that this bill includes provisions my Republican  colleagues have supported in the past to help defray the cost of  veterans' benefits. And to my colleagues who still are not willing to  pay for these benefits, I would ask them to share their concerns  directly with Guard and Reserve members the next time they are deployed  in response to a natural disaster or other emergency in the community  that they represent.   So I think we all want the same thing. My friends across the aisle,  us on this side of the aisle, we all want the same thing. We all want  to provide benefits to those who have served our country. I believe  that in good faith. I do think that we have to not pay lip service,  though. We have to make sure that we support servicemembers and not  just when it is politically convenient. We don't need half measures. We  don't need things that shortchange our servicemembers. So I think it is  time for us to step up. It is time to give them the benefits they have  earned for protecting the American people in a way now that they are  doing unlike before. And that is what this bill aims to do.   As the chairman mentioned, it has support from a wide range of  veteran service organizations, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars,  the Student Veterans of America, the National Guard Association of the  United States, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the  United States, and Reserve Officers Association. They are asking us to  pass this bill, the Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act, today because  they agree that it is past time to provide some basic fairness in the  way that we provide GI Bill benefits to Guard and Reserve members.   Mr. Speaker, passing this bipartisan bill is the right thing to do  for all the men and women who serve and protect our Nation, and I urge  my colleagues to vote ``aye.''
