 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to recognize an incredible,  longtime labor leader in Florida, a man who spent so much of his life  to improve the lives of working families throughout the Sunshine State,  and a man I call a dear friend.   Robert Michael Williams, or, as we knew him, Mike Williams, was born  on October 27, 1950, in McIntosh, Florida, to Bob and Martha Williams.  Mike's father worked in the paper mills and relocated his family to  work in North Carolina and St. Marys, Georgia, where  [[Page H4021]]  Mike graduated from Camden County High School in 1968.   Mike lettered in football and basketball during all 4 years of high  school. He was a pretty tall guy. He excelled in academics, represented  his school at Boys State, participated in debate club, and, in his  senior year, served as the student council president and ``Mr. CCHS,''  along with several other superlatives.   After attending Georgia Tech and Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College  for a brief time, Mike packed his acoustic guitar, backpacked Europe,  and then returned home only to head west to Colorado.   To support himself, Mike worked several different jobs, reflecting,  ``I worked many temporary jobs in the service and construction  industries, living paycheck to paycheck.''   Mike returned to Florida and began his career as a construction  electrician with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers,  otherwise known as IBEW, Local 177 in Jacksonville. During his time at  the local, he chased work for years, traveling around the country in a  travel trailer.   For Mike, holding a union card meant having dignity and respect on  the job, a living wage, healthcare, retirement benefits, education, and  training opportunities.   Mike learned early on in his career that, for far too long, far too  many middle-class families had difficulty with basic workplace rights  and that those rights remained out of reach as they struggled to pay  rent, put food on the table, and seek medical attention.   ``Becoming a member of the union meant finally having my hard work  pay off by creating an opportunity for achieving personal goals and  being able to provide for my family the way I wanted to. And it meant  having the opportunity to achieve the American Dream, a dream that so  many want to take away today.''   After working his trade for 15 years, Mike decided to take on  leadership roles with his union by running for and being elected to  become the business manager of his local.   Eight years later, Mike went on to serve as president of the Florida  Building Trades Council, increasing the presence of the Florida  building trades during the legislative session in Tallahassee and  building a powerful voice for construction trades statewide.   Mike understood the impact a voice on the job can make on the lives  of working people, but it wasn't until his trip to Colombia with the  AFL-CIO Solidarity Center that he understood the global imperative of  worker solidarity.   During the trip, Mike witnessed the damage both corporate and  government forces could inflict on the rights of workers and the  dangers of living in a state lacking the institutions to help combat  these abuses.   He saw violence and hatred directed at those who were trying to  organize for better living conditions and to make a better life for  their families. The trip solidified Mike's commitment to fight for all  working people.   In 2009, he was elected president of the Florida AFL-CIO. During his  term, the Florida AFL-CIO expanded its powerful legislative and  political advocacy by introducing Working Families Lobby Corps, a  program where union members travel to Tallahassee daily during the  legislative session and directly engage with their lawmakers.   This program continues to be a central force in building coalitions  between labor and community organizations. His efforts are still  thriving and carry on the vision that he saw for all working families.   Mike also extended the vision of labor to represent all workers by  fostering new alliances with community, immigrant, and faith-based  groups. To enact that vision, Mike spearheaded the creation of Fight  for Florida to communicate the labor movement's message to the broader  public.   Fight for Florida started as a website and blog that evolved to  engage people and content creators outside of union membership on  social and economic justice issues with the primary focus of informing  the public that the work the Florida AFL-CIO does is for every working  family.   As a Florida native, Mike understood the impacts that hurricanes can  have on our communities and residents. Mike was hugely instrumental in  organizing and participating in hurricane relief efforts in Florida and  for other neighbors in the Southeast. He coordinated with various  entities, including the Teamsters, to move goods, as well as FEMA and  the national AFL-CIO to supply and staff these efforts, often traveling  to the affected areas himself to distribute ice, water, food, formula,  and diapers.   Later in his tenure as president, the AFL-CIO appointed Mike to their  Racial Justice Task Force Advisory Committee, joining other union  leaders from across the country to help combat racism in the ranks of  union members and their locals.   As someone born in the South who attended segregated schools, as a  southern White gentleman, this left a profound impact on him,  reinvigorating his resolve for equality and justice for working people  facing hardships due to discrimination.                                time  1945    Mike leaves behind his loving partner, Jeanette ``Jet'' Netwal;  daughters, Amanda Williams of Saukville, Wisconsin, and Suzanne  Williams of Asheville, North Carolina; grandchildren, Zane Tinney,  Ethan Williams, and Hailey Wilson; sisters, Jane Buffkin of Locust  Grove, Georgia; and Beth (Tom) Mason of Riverview, Florida; brother,  Mike (Laurie) Williams of St. Petersburg, Florida; and many nieces and  nephews.   Beyond his dedication to fighting for the rights of working families,  Mike was a man of diverse passions. Whether strumming his guitar or  relaxing on his beloved boat, a 1985 Chris Craft Constellation, he  found solace and joy in the simple pleasures in life, almost always  wearing one of his iconic tropical, Florida T-shirts and button-down  shirt.   Joined by his loving partner Jet, he cherished precious moments  watching the mesmerizing Florida sunsets and embarking on unforgettable  road trips. Never failing to advocate for his fellow union members,  Mike often visited picket lines and organizational efforts in support  of those in need. His absence reverberates through the labor community  in Florida, as his unwavering commitment inspired a generation to carry  forth his legacy and fight tirelessly for the rights of working  families in Florida and beyond.   Mike will be sorely missed, but his transformative impact will  continue to shine brightly and guide us in the pursuit of a fairer and  more just society.   Mr. Speaker, I had the honor of serving nearly 10 years in  Tallahassee, both in the State house and State senate, and Mike and I  worked on a lot of battles together. We worked to help those who served  our State in administrative capacities. We worked for first responders  like our cops, firefighters, and EMTs, our teachers, and so many other  civil servants to protect pensions so that they can retire in dignity.  We fought for better pay, better benefits, and for safer working  conditions throughout the Sunshine State.   When I got here to Washington in 2017, I made sure to always remember  our roots, and I would go back to visit them every year in Tallahassee  during session. Some years were good. Some years not so much. However,  we always fought side by side to improve progress.   I remember so many issues starting to happen while we were here in  Congress that we would work on together. When the SunRail was being  expanded and plans were made to expand it, as well as Brightline, a  high-speed rail coming from Miami to Orlando, and when we worked on  Amtrak issues together, I remember being the first one to sit in his  office and let him know that high-speed rail was coming to Florida and  how we needed to make it safe and economical, and make sure that people  were being paid fairly and had the opportunity to unionize should they  want to.   Then, Mr. Speaker, after a tough couple of years, Mike got to see  President Biden sworn into office after 4 years of tough situations  with labor. He saw us have the most productive session in 50 years. We  passed giant laws out of this very Chamber: The American Rescue Plan,  the infrastructure law, the CHIPS Act, the PACT Act, and the Inflation  Reduction Act.   We got to talk about so many of those issues, but particularly for  him as an electrician, as an IBEW guy, as a building trades guy, the  infrastructure  [[Page H4022]]  law was of particular importance to him.   A generation of so many Americans, from sea to shining sea, will have  work to do to upgrade America, to make sure all of our bridges, all of  our roads, all of our highways, all of our water systems, all of our  utility systems--which Mike would be most particularly proud about--as  well as rural broadband and so many other areas. So many jobs, such a  way to invest in the future. There are also a lot of clean energy  projects coming to Florida and around our Nation to help boost solar,  wind, nuclear, hydro, so many areas he cared deeply about. The CHIPS  Act, which is bringing a record number of manufacturing starts in our  Nation. In fact, we have seen a doubling, year over year, of new  advanced manufacturing centers coming across the Nation.   The good news, Mr. Speaker, it takes thousands, hundreds of thousands  of construction workers to help make these visions for our country a  reality.   Mike always remembered our veterans. We have so many members of the  AFL-CIO who served in the military. I remember getting to talk to him  proudly about when we passed the PACT Act, helping so many veterans  coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan, those facing terrible injuries  from burn pits, and the veterans from Vietnam who still weren't getting  their benefits, finally done in this critical landmark legislation to  help our veterans.   Of course, he definitely had a smile as President Biden talked about  these major laws and that they are going to provide good-paying union  jobs. Of course, this is a fight now for the next generation.   I am going to miss him, Mr. Speaker, and I know so many of my  colleagues will as well.   I also have some remarks from Representative Wasserman Schultz that I  will read into the Record:         Mr. Speaker, with a heavy heart, I rise to honor the       remarkable life of the recently departed Florida AFL-CIO       President Mike Williams.        Starting as an apprentice, he became an electrician,       working the temporary service and construction jobs, and       living paycheck to paycheck, like so many workers do.        Seeing the critical value of job protections and livable       wages, he devoted his life to the labor movement, first as a       rank-and-file member for 15 years, before becoming business       manager of his Jacksonville Local IBEW 177.        Later he became president of the Florida Building Trades       Council, and in 2009 Mike was elected President of the       Florida AFL-CIO, where he served distinctively until his       death.        A natural born leader, Mike revitalized Florida labor by       fostering new alliances with community, immigrant, and faith-      based groups.        Tall, with a contagious smile, he told it to you straight       and always brought a worthy cause and compelling case for       workers to the Capitol.        Direct and trustworthy, he was a man of standards whose       shoes will be hard to fill.        Mike's empathy, dedication, and compassion will be sorely       missed, but his legacy and impact must never be forgotten.        May his memory be a blessing.    Mr. Speaker, I had lunch with him just in April, when I was there for  legislative session. We talked about how he was looking forward to  doing his summer boating that he would do every year. He would go all  the way up the East Coast and then through the Great Lakes, down the  Mississippi, and back out around. Other times he would go to the Keys  or to the Bahamas or to other areas.   I am deeply saddened that he lost his life doing something he loved,  but he got to see so much and meant so much to so many folks on my team  and throughout the State legislature and the Congress.   Mike, I pray for you, and I hope you rest in peace. God bless your  family.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
