 Madam Speaker, the leaked Supreme Court document shows a  complete disregard by the Court majority for the fundamental right to  control one's own body by having access to safe abortion care.   In Wisconsin, the end of Roe v. Wade would drag us back to 1849, when  our State law banning abortion was enacted and is still on the books.   In 1849, in Wisconsin, the first telegraph was received, there was a  6\1/2\ cent tax on every vehicle drawn by a single horse, and railroad  tracks were constructed going west for the first time outside of  Milwaukee.   My constituents, like the vast majority of Americans, don't want to  go back. They want healthcare decisions to be made by laws that weren't  passed when slavery was legal. They want women to have full access to  modern healthcare, and that means access to safe abortion care.                            ____________________
