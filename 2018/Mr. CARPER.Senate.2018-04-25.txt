 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I don't know if the Presiding Officer was  able to be present in the House of Representatives earlier today when  the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, spoke to us about a variety  of things, including the Paris accords, the Iran deal, the long history  we have between their country and our country; the fact that the  American Revolution and the French Revolution were really  contemporaneous. We share the birth of democracy in our country and, to  an extent, in their country at roughly the same time.   Those who have studied American history know that one of the ways we  won our freedom and independence from the tyranny of that British  throne was with the support of the French. We have not always agreed  with one another in the years since then, but mostly we have. The bond  between their Nation and our Nation continues to be strong, not just  between our leaders but also between our people.   We are fortunate to have a number of French tourists who come to our  country. From time to time, some of us are fortunate to go to that part  of the world and to visit them, to know them as human beings. The bond  between our countries is a benefit for both them and for us, and, I  think, for the world.   I have never come to the floor to start reading someone else's  speech, but I am really tempted to read some parts of what President  Emmanuel Macron said today. I speak a little bit of French. I spoke to  him briefly in French before he gave his remarks. His English is a lot  better than my French. I want to mention a couple of things that he  said and add some comments of my own.   He talked a bit about the Paris Agreement, and he talked about  climate change. These were his words, and I think they are worth  repeating and reflecting on.   He said:         I believe in building a better future for our children       which requires offering them a planet that is still habitable       in 25 years. Some people think that securing current       industries and their jobs is more urgent than transforming       our economies to meet the global challenge of climate change.    He went on to say:         I hear these concerns, but we must find a smooth transition       to a low-carbon economy. Because what is the meaning of our       life, really, if we work and live destroying our planet while       sacrificing the future of our children?    President Macron then said:         What is the meaning of our life if our conscious decision       is to reduce the opportunities for our children or for our       grandchildren? By polluting the oceans, not mitigating carbon       dioxide emissions, and destroying our biodiversity, we're       killing our planet.    He went on to say:         Let us face it. There is no planet B.    I turned to my colleague sitting next to me and I said, I am going to  steal that line: There is no planet B.   He is right.   I like to say this is the only planet we have, and it is going to be  the only one we ever have in our lifetime, and probably the lifetime of  anybody around this planet.   Then President Macron went on to say:         On this issue, it may happen that we have disagreements       between the United States and France. It may happen. Like in       all families. But that's, for me, a short-term disagreement.       In the long run, we will have to face the same realities, and       we're citizens of this same planet, so we will have to face       it. We have to work together with business leaders and local       communities. Let us work together in order to make our planet       great again--    Isn't that terrific? ``Let's work together to make our planet great  again''--not just to make America great again; not just to make France  great again but to make our planet great again--       and create new jobs and new opportunities. While safeguarding       our earth.    He concluded this part of his speech by saying:         And I'm sure, one day, the United States will come back and       join the Paris Agreement. And I'm sure we can work together       to fulfill, with you, the ambitions of the global compact on       the environment.    I had the opportunity last week to speak at the University of  Delaware to a couple hundred graduate students. It is an annual  gathering that they have and they were nice enough to invite me to come  and talk to them about leadership. One of the things I mentioned is  that leaders are aspirational. We appeal to people's better angels.  Leaders unite, not divide. Leaders build bridges, not walls.   I thought we were privileged today to hear that kind of leader. When  I spoke to him in French, I wished him well. I wished him good luck,  and I thanked him for joining us in the kind of message he brought to  us.    I don't suspect he would have any reason to know this, but when  people got up today and went to work in this country, 3 million people  went to work in jobs that probably didn't exist 20, 30 years ago--3  million people. The jobs they went to work on are jobs where they are  creating renewable energy, sustainable energy, clean energy, carbon- free energy, or they are going to work in jobs which conserve energy so  we just use a whole lot less altogether. Think about that. Three  million people  [[Page S2417]]  in this country went to work in those kinds of jobs. We are adding  75,000, 100,000 of those jobs every year.   I have always had a close relationship with the auto industry until  about 6 or 7 years ago. We had a GM plant and a Chrysler plant in  Delaware, with about 4,000 employees in each of them at one time. We  lost them both at the bottom of the great recession. I have always, and  even now, tried to work closely with the auto industry, even though  they don't have the kind of presence today in Delaware they once did,  but they have provided a lot of jobs. Part of the supply chain is in  Delaware, Pennsylvania, and other places.   Sometimes people say we cannot have clean air, clean water, and a  strong economy. I think that is a false choice. The President of France  as much as said that today.   It was not a Frenchmen, but it was Einstein who said that ``in  adversity lies opportunity.'' I think if we are smart about it and we  look at climate change, global warming, sea level rise, and pollution  of one kind or the other, there is actually great opportunity that each  of those present to us. They present difficulties and challenges but  also great opportunity.   I will never forget a couple of years ago what happened in a hearing  in the Environment and Public Works Committee on the issue of mercury  emissions from powerplants. We had, I think, four or five, maybe six  witnesses. The first four or five witnesses said: We cannot reduce  mercury emissions by 80 percent over the next decade. I think that is  what they said. They said we cannot; it is just not possible for us to  reduce mercury emissions.   Why do we want to reduce mercury? Because it is up in the air; it is  carried by the winds, the rains; it ends up in the water; it ends up in  fish; we eat fish. It is harmful especially for pregnant women. They  give birth, in many cases, to children with brain damage. So we had  this hearing, and the first four or five witnesses, all from coal-fired  utilities, said: We can't do it. Eighty percent is not a reasonable  target for mercury reduction.   The last witness was from a trade association whose members actually  focus on developing technology to reduce harmful emissions of all  kinds, including mercury emissions from powerplants. Our last witness  said: I think we can not only meet that target of 80 percent reduction  in 10 years, I think we can do better than that, and I think we can do  it in less than 10 years. Do you know what? He was right. It turned out  he was right. We ended up with a 90-percent reduction in mercury  emissions, and that technology has been used in this country.   The nice thing about it is that technology--there are plenty of coal- fired plants around the world where they need to reduce mercury, and we  are selling that technology all over the world. So that is really one  of the opportunities the President of France was talking about--looking  at adversity and finding opportunities, including climate change and  other kinds of pollution; pollution of our water, you name it.   Anyway, it was just a joy to hear him speak today. I was really  impressed.   We have a bunch of pages sitting in here today. I don't know if they  were able to hear the speech, but if you got to hear the speech today,  raise your hands. I think it had to be uplifting for young people  because he was focused very much on the future. He was not just looking  back but focusing very much on young people. I liked that a lot.   One of the other things he spoke about was the Iran deal. For years  and years, as some of my colleagues may recall, we suspected that Iran  was secretly developing nuclear weapons. We didn't know for sure. We  suspected the worst. In the last administration in this country, we  went to work with a new leader in Iran to see if we might be able to  better ensure that they are not going to develop nuclear weapons, and  we provided safeguards and early detection systems so that if they do,  we will know about it. In the meantime, we placed a lot of economic  sanctions on Iran, trying to get them to give up what we thought was  the development of nuclear weapons. They always said, ``No, we are not  doing that,'' but we didn't believe them.   At the end of the day, we looked at entering into this agreement  between the United States and Iran and five other nations. Iran had to  open themselves up to intrusive inspections. They had to be willing to  give up some of the more modern centrifuges they had for developing  highly enriched uranium. To the extent that they are willing to do that  and continue to put up with intrusive inspections by the atomic energy  agency, then we would gradually reduce and relax the economic  sanctions.    The intrusive inspections have continued now for several years, and  the agencies responsible for this say, so far, they are keeping their  word. Does that mean they are always going to keep their word? Not  necessarily. Does that mean we should be less resolute in watching what  they are doing? No. We should be resolute and hold their feet to the  fire. But to the extent that they are keeping their word, I think the  idea of lifting our sanctions--along with other countries as part of  these accords and joint agreement--is good, not only for Iran but also  for us.   We have this agreement because we felt it was important for  inspectors to have a window into that country to see what they are  doing. We have that. So far, it seems to be working.   Our President now says that in a couple weeks he would like to close  out of the Iran deal. If we do that, my fear is they will simply go  back to a secret program to develop nuclear weapons. That will  encourage the Saudis to do the same and maybe lay a precursor or put us  in motion to have a nuclear arms race in that part of the world. Sunni  versus Shia, Saudis versus Iran--that is not a competition that will  end well.   I am not going to read everything President Macron said today about  the Iran deal, but a fair amount is worth repeating. I will do that,  and then add some comments of my own:         As for Iran, our objective is clear: Iran should never       possess any nuclear weapons. Not now, not in 5 years, not in       10 years. Never.    ``Never'' is a long time.         But this policy should never lead us to war in the Middle       East. We must ensure stability, and respect sovereignty of       the nations, including that one of Iran, which represents a       great civilization.        Let us not replicate past mistakes in the region. Let us       not be naive on one side. Let us not create new walls       ourselves on the other side.        There is an existing framework--called the JCPOA--to       control the nuclear activity of Iran. We signed it at the       initiative of the United States. We signed it, both the       United States and France. That is why we cannot say we should       just get rid of it like that. But it is true to say that this       agreement may not address all concerns, very important       concerns. This is true. But we should not abandon it without       having something substantial, more substantial, instead. That       is my position. That is why France will not leave the JCPOA,       because we signed it.        Your President and your country will have to take, in the       current days and weeks, [its own] responsibilities regarding       this issue.        What I want to do, and what we decided together with your       President, is that we can work on a more comprehensive deal       addressing all these concerns. That is why we have to work on       this more comprehensive deal based--as discussed with       President Trump yesterday--on four pillars.    And then President Macron went on to talk about those four pillars.         [No. 1] the substance of the existing agreement, especially       if you decide to leave it, [No. 2] the post-2025 period, in       order to be sure we will never have any nuclear activity for       Iran, [No. 3] the containment of military influence of the       Iranian regime in the region, and [No. 4] the monitoring of       ballistic activity.    The Iranians have a penchant for firing and testing ballistic  missiles. They say that it is not offensive; it is defensive. But one  would wonder about that. Questioning minds way wonder.         I think these four pillars, the ones I addressed before the       General Assembly of the United Nations last September, are       the ones which cover the legitimate fears of the United       States and our allies in the region.        I think we have to start working now on these four pillars       to build this new, comprehensive [deal] and to be sure that,       whatever the decision of the United States will be, we will       not leave the floor to the absence of rules.        We will not leave the floor to these conflicts of power in       the Middle East, we will not . . . [increase] tensions and       potential war.        That is my position, and I think we can work together to       build this comprehensive deal for the whole region, for our       people, because I think it fairly addresses our concerns.       That is my position.   [[Page S2418]]     I have heard several Presidents speak to joint sessions of Congress  over the years; I have heard any number of leaders from other nations  speak before joint meetings of Congress in the years I have been  privileged to serve here. I don't know that I have seen a warmer and  more enthusiastic welcome than the one we witnessed today for the  President of our close ally, our friends, the French. I hope the  standing ovations he repeatedly received reflect not just the emotion  of the moment but reflect the belief that he may be on to something  here.   One of my colleagues whom I was sitting next to during President  Macron's remarks said that the President of France was delivering an  elegant rebuke to our President, and he was so skillful in doing it, it  was hard to tell that was what he was doing. Maybe that is true. But I  think he might be on to something. He didn't just come up with it  today. This is something that President Macron has been talking about  for days, weeks, months--at least since last fall.   I hope our President, with whom he had a chance to spend some time,  might say: Let's drill down on that. I think you might be on to  something.   Meanwhile, I don't know what others have been saying about former  Secretary of State Tillerson, but I thought he was an unlikely person  to be Secretary of State. He had been the leader of Exxon, knew the  world, and knew the world's leaders. It was unusual to have someone  with that pedigree to be our Secretary of State. He exceeded  expectations, at least for me. I think he was fired by the President a  couple of months ago through Twitter, and that was it--no ceremony, no  handshake, no thank-you for taking on a tough job and doing his best.   I would say to Rex Tillerson: Thank you for your willingness to give  it a shot, for taking on a tough job in a tough administration. We may  not agree with everything he said or thought, but he took on a tough  job, and we are grateful for that.   The question is, Who is going to succeed him. I have asked to meet  with the President's nominee. They have not been able to find time to  do that, which I think is unfortunate.   If we had had the time to meet, I would have wanted to talk with him  about a number of issues. One of those would be the Iran nuclear deal  and how he feels about it. I would like to hear his thoughts on what  President Macron suggested today as a possible alternative follow-on to  the JCPOA. But I am not going to have the opportunity to do that.   I was reminded recently of something John Kennedy once said. I hope I  have this right: America should never negotiate out of fear, but we  should never fear negotiating. Think about that. Our country should  never negotiate out of fear, but we shouldn't be afraid to negotiate.   I think President Macron may have given us an opening here, and the  opening is to come up with something that could be even more effective  than the JCPOA. If we are smart, the door has been opened and we will  walk through it instead of walking backward.   While we prepare to vote, maybe tomorrow, on the nominee to be our  next Secretary of State, one of my disappointments is not having had a  chance to--not negotiate with him but to share with him what President  Macron had to say, to try to get his take on that and, if he were  Secretary of State, how he might pursue this opening. Unfortunately,  that is not going to happen.   I notice my neighbor from across the border in Pennsylvania has risen  to address the Senate.   I yield the floor.
