 Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman for  giving me this opportunity because I wanted my colleagues on the other  side to see what an insulin patient looks like. You are looking at him.   I need insulin in order to stay alive. The boot that I am wearing is  not a fashion decision, it is because I have a diabetic ulcer on my  foot, the fourth one I have had in 7 years.   I have left my insulin in New Jersey, gone to the drugstore when I  arrived down here in Washington, and said: I need insulin. They said:  Well, Mr. Payne, your insurance isn't ready to cover it. I said: Well,  that is all right. I am doing okay in life, I will pay for it. She goes  back, she gets the bag and hands it to me and says: $348. What happens  to the people that are not at the level of a Member of Congress? Think  about that. It is $12 in Canada.   We are asking for it to be three times higher than it is in Canada.  Think about that. I live it every single day.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the Affordable  Insulin Now Act.   In America, a unit of insulin costs almost $100. I paid $348 for a  vial. Across the border in Canada, it costs $12 for the same insulin.   This enormous price difference causes diabetics to take drastic steps  to survive. They ration their insulin to make it last. Some of them  stop taking it for days to save money. These are life-threatening  financial decisions.   As a diabetic myself, I know the importance of insulin to daily life.  This boot on my foot is not a fashion choice. It is for a diabetic  ulcer that I have been fighting for 8 months, and I have had seven in  10 years. I am one of the more than 37 million diabetics in America.   If we can cap insulin payments to $35 per month, it saves lives. That  is why we need the Affordable Insulin Now Act.                            ____________________
