 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the career of Palm  Springs Police Chief Bryan Reyes, who retired after nearly 30 years of  service to our communities.   A veteran of the United States Marine Corps, Chief Reyes began his  career in law enforcement as a reserve police officer for the Compton  Police Department in 1991.   After transferring to the Palm Springs Police Department in 1993, he  rose through the ranks, serving as an officer, detective, sergeant,  lieutenant, and captain before ultimately becoming police chief.   Chief Reyes has had a lasting impact on the Palm Springs community  and has led the department through difficult times.   On October 8, 2016, during the first year of his tenure as chief of  police, Palm Springs Police Officers Lesley Zerebny and Gilbert Vega  were tragically killed in the line of duty.   Chief Reyes recognized the devastating impact this would have on the  department, community, and the officers' families. In this difficult  time, he prioritized the mental health needs of those affected, and his  guidance brought us all closer together.   I am honored to have collaborated with Chief Reyes in authoring  legislation to commemorate the tremendous sacrifice made by Officers  Zerebny and Vega that day. Named in their honor and inspired by our  local police officers at the Palm Springs Police Department, the Heroes  Lesley Zerebny and Gilbert Vega First Responders Survivors Support Act  would get families of our fallen heroes the support they need and  ensure they have every opportunity to succeed in life.   During his more than 6 years of leadership, Chief Reyes strengthened  the department's community policing in neighborhoods and expanded  engagement with residents and community organizations.   Further, he has received numerous accolades for his incredible  leadership, including lifesaving medals, the officer of the year award,  and the community heroes award.   Chief Reyes' 28 years of tireless and dedicated work for the Palm  Springs community is a testament to his outstanding leadership,  character, and commitment to the well-being of Palm Springs residents.   I have no doubt that changes brought about under his leadership will  continue to improve the lives of Palm Springs police officers and the  entire Palm Springs community.   On behalf of the great people of California's 36th Congressional  District, thank you, Chief Bryan Reyes, for all you have done for our  community. Congratulations on your well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
