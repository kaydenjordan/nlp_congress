 Mr. Speaker, I have had it up to here with lies coming  from the other side about food assistance programs like SNAP.   This weekend, five of my Republican colleagues said that they could  save $400 billion by cutting SNAP and instituting tougher work  requirements for folks on the program. Clearly, they didn't do their  homework. Let me correct the record.   First, 9 out of 10 SNAP recipients are in households with children,  seniors, and people with disabilities.   Second, there are already strict work requirements for SNAP. Let me  repeat that. Most of the people receiving  [[Page H784]]  SNAP who can work actually do work. They come home when their shift  ends and count pennies because the average benefit is only a couple of  bucks.   I am sick and tired of Republicans coming down to the floor and going  on social media to beat up on poor people.   Members of Congress are not on SNAP. Do you know who is? Children,  seniors, veterans, people with disabilities.   For the record, there is a special place in hell for those who want  to take food out of the mouths of vulnerable Americans.                            ____________________
