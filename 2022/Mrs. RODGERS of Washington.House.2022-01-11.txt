 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and submit extraneous materials.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer a  resolution. I do not offer this resolution on my own behalf. I offer it  as a representative of the people of the United States, to formalize  the unspoken sentiments and concerns that abound in our Nation right  now. Any authority I have is given to me by the people.   And this is what we believe:   Our Nation is unique. It is distinctive, exceptional. American  exceptionalism is too often misunderstood to mean something that it is  not. It does not mean justification to dominate or condescend to other  nations, or indulgent flattery to ourselves that we are better. It does  not mean that we are a chosen people, or that circumstances give us  privilege to circumvent law. Our Nation is bound by the same universal  moral principles that must bind and shape the behaviors of all  civilized nations. In this regard, we are all the same, as nations, and  yet, we are different, very different in a very important way.   It is not wealth or military power that makes us exceptional. It is  not our institutions nor the genius of our written Constitution or our  Bill of Rights; not directly. These are manifestations of something  more fundamental and profound.   Our exceptionalism is based on something else, a singular belief, a  proposition you might call it, a proposition underlying all legal and  constitutional beliefs. Our assertions of human equality and  unalienable rights: life, liberty, and the right to pursue happiness,  the right to find meaning and purpose and value in our individual  lives, derives from a single assertion--that life, given to us by  Creator God, is the moral basis of the unshakeable bedrock of our  Republic.   That proposition, the thing that makes us distinctive, is that we  believe a Creator God endowed us with rights. Not just us. Everybody,  everywhere. It is a gigantic revolutionary belief, and it is a belief.  It is our faith statement. It is what speaks to the soul of our Nation.   There are many great and ancient nations that believe in freedom as  we do. Most countries in the world claim the rule of law and have  written constitutions. Many of us use the language of rights and  equality and declare for human dignity. But none have a coherent basis  for doing so. We alone occupy that space. God gave us rights; made us  in his image and, therefore, demonstrated all human beings are created  equal, even the unborn, from conception. The poor, the infirm, the old,  the weak, all colors and kinds, all races, all of us, are endowed by  the Creator equally because we are made in His image.   Without this fundamental belief, rights become only social protocol,  conventions, historic inheritances, creatures of state citizenship,  class, identity and features of consensus. They become malleable and  fading creatures in the capricious hands of willful men.   But America is different. God endowed us with rights, and that belief  is either true or it is false. If it is false, then we Americans, among  all mankind, are most to be pitied. The experiment must fail. It cannot  and must not succeed.   But if it is true, then we have built our country on a foundation  that cannot be shaken, if we are true to it, we are anchored in the  eternal bedrock of all truths. As Lincoln said: ``As a nation of free  men we will live forever or die by suicide.''   To those who are given much, much is expected.   And somewhere, deep down inside ordinary Americans know this. It is  the air that we breathe.   Only we ourselves can end this great experiment. There are no  external mortal forces that can overcome the bulwarks of that eternal  truth.   And therefore, what we believe matters, Madam Speaker. Our invisible  immaterial beliefs are the strength of our national soul. The things  that we hold on to and serve are the foundations of our institutions,  our laws, our liberty, and the hope of our Nation.   When the Founders established this Republic 250 years ago, and  created the institutions that guide us, they were well aware that those  institutions were insufficient in themselves to govern a free people.  The lifeblood and the heartbeat of the Nation is moral character, not  the institutions. Not the institutions, or even the laws themselves.  For laws and institutions are corruption without the rectitude and  wisdom of a moral, decent people. Without the people bracing themselves  to wisdom and the holdfasts of character, our institutions have no  power to preserving us.   If the people ever lose their love of truth, justice, goodness, and  the efflorescence of beauty that flourishes in them, there can be no  hope in the parchment barriers of a Constitution,  [[Page H37]]  or the institutions created by it; no matter how noble that hope is. In  effect, everything rises and falls in our Republic as a consequence of  the character of the people.   As a Nation, we live or die by the standards of our own moral  character. The Founders knew this, but many of us know we are  forgetting it.   ``We have no government armed with power capable of contending with  human passions unbridled by morality and religion. Avarice, ambition,  revenge, or gallantry would break the strongest cords of our  Constitution as a whale goes through a net. Our Constitution was made  only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the  government of any other.''    John Adams wrote that to the militia of Massachusetts. What he is  saying is this: The power of the State is not secured by the power of  arms. It is anchored in the honesty and decency of the people.   Today, this may seem a quaint notion. I hope it is not. But the  Founders who experimented in government to create a just and free  society understood explicitly that freedom and justice are not the  products of institutions, but, rather, institutions that defend freedom  and justice are the product of a moral people.   Freedom cannot exist without morality. George Washington understood  this. John Adams understood this. Abraham Lincoln understood this. Dr.  Martin Luther King understood this. I believe this, not because they  believed it, but because it is true. I believe that most Americans  understand this.   When we drift from the Creator, we drift from the source of our own  liberty. When we forget our duties to God, we forget our duties to each  other. When we become proudful and lazy and forget the father of all  rights, we become orphans of oppression. We are lost without the  guiding hand of the Almighty.   It may seem that Congress is not the place to introduce an appeal to  God. I disagree. Insofar as all our rights and all our institutions are  based upon the presumption of a just and Almighty God, and since this  Congress itself rests upon the foundation that our Creator gave us the  right to govern ourselves, to quote my hero, Abraham Lincoln: ``It is  altogether fitting and proper that we do this.''   It is precisely because of America's distinctive belief that I rise  in this House to offer a resolution to humble ourselves and entreat  wisdom from God, the Father of all blessings and mercy; a resolution of  contrition, prayer, and fasting; a resolution in the great tradition of  our free people.   We have, as His guidance many times before, a resolution to return to  the wellspring of liberty and our rights; a resolution to depart from  iniquity and entreat His guidance; a prayer that we remember Him as the  Father of every good thing that we have, and everything as a Nation and  people we aspire to be.   Whereas, We the People of the United States of America continue our  search for a more perfect union and;   Whereas, we are a people conceived in liberty and dedicated to the  proposition that all are created equal, yet like in the days of Abraham  Lincoln, when he observed that ``We have forgotten the gracious hand  which preserved us in peace and multiplied, and enriched, and  strengthened us;''   Whereas, ``We have vainly imagined, in the deceitfulness of our  hearts, that all these blessings were produced by some superior wisdom  and virtue of our own;''   Whereas, we confess we are self-consumed, prideful, and unloving,  quick to point out the speck in another person's eye while missing the  log in our own;   Whereas, we are trusting in our wealth and skill, and leaning on our  own understanding;   Whereas, we have become ungrateful, lovers of pleasure, stubborn,  hard-hearted, divisive, and unforgiving;   Whereas, we confess that instead of speaking of forgiveness, we cry  out for vengeance. We have allowed the poisonous root of bitterness to  grow up and trouble us;   Whereas, the global pandemic of COVID-19 has intensified fear,  unknowns, chaos, and confusion;   Whereas, the impact of lockdowns and isolations has been severe,  further exacerbating the breakdown of mental health, families,  communities, and our Nation;   Whereas, we are divided, perhaps like we haven't seen since the Civil  War, when Abraham Lincoln, President Abraham Lincoln, by faith, prayed,  saying:         May we again devote ourselves to prayer and acknowledge as       a people and as a Nation our dependence upon the overruling       power of God. Let us confess our sins and transgressions in       humble sorrow, yet with the assured hope that genuine       repentance will lead to mercy and pardon;                                time  1530    Whereas, by faith, at the 1787 Constitutional Convention, when the  outlook looked grim, Benjamin Franklin appealed to the delegates and  urged prayer, asking: ``I have lived a long time, and the longer I  live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth--that God governs  in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground  without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his  aid?'' and   Whereas, during World War I and at the signing of the Armistice,  President Wilson proclaimed: ``Complete victory . . . God has indeed  been gracious, let us thank him.'' and   Whereas, this year marked the 80th anniversary of the initial  National Bible Week declaration made by President Franklin D. Roosevelt  just weeks before the start of World War II; and   Whereas, George Washington Carver, born a slave during the Civil War,  testified in 1921 in front of the House Ways and Means Committee  expounding on the myriad of ingenious uses for the peanut transforming  the economy and which had been revealed to him by faith as he regularly  walked through the woods at 4 a.m., and   Whereas, President John F. Kennedy said: ``The guiding principle of  this Nation has been, is now, and ever shall be `In God We Trust,' ''  and   Whereas, Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., encouraged to us  ``Pray daily to be used by God in order that all men might be free,''   Therefore, be it resolved by those assembled, we pray that in this  hour of our great need, our Sovereign God will come and do again as He  has done in days gone by; we pray for a time of healing from our  brokenness, broken lives, broken families, broken communities, and  broken systems.   We resolve to humble ourselves, pray, seek God's face, turn from our  wicked ways, and thank and praise the God of our ancestors who has  given us wisdom and strength and who controls the course of events; and   Therefore, it behooves us to call upon the people of our Nation to  humble ourselves before our Creator and acknowledge our complete  dependence upon Him, to repent of our pride and selfishness, and to ask  the Lord to break our hearts for the things that break His heart;   That we may not miss hearing His voice, and that He will pour out His  spirit, once again, on our Nation and leaders; and   We proclaim a year of National Humiliation, Fasting, and Prayer. What  might God do in the next 365 days if we commit to reading His Word  daily and praying together for our Nation? In our families? For the  young generation, this generation in misery and despair? We are  expectant that He will do immeasurably more than all we could ask or  imagine and that He will hear from heaven, forgive our sins, and heal  our land. May He be as original with us as He has been with others.  Amen.                            ____________________
