 Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman  yielding.   I grew up in a small town, Kettle Falls, and I have lived through the  challenges that people face in rural communities.   I have also visited hospitals and healthcare facilities all  throughout my district. During the pandemic, Providence Health System  scaled up their telehealth services with a 1,000 percent increase in  volume.   Telehealth visits by seniors on Medicare increased from 840,000 in  2019 to 52.7 million in 2020 nationwide. Many of these visits were from  seniors' homes, which were not paid for by Medicare prior to the  pandemic.   Congress and the Trump administration, by action, required Medicare  to pay for more telehealth services, reducing out-of-pocket costs and  expanding the availability of telehealth services and long-term care  where people are especially vulnerable to COVID-19. This bill today  makes some of those actions last beyond the public health emergency  through 2024.   While I support this legislation, I do think this is a missed  opportunity to do more. Republicans on the Energy and Commerce  Committee have many solutions to not just look at telehealth and  Medicare for a couple of years but to look also at how we incentivize  employers to provide access to telehealth for an estimated 156 million  people with employer health insurance.   We have examined and worked on solutions to address both where  telehealth may not be appropriate and where it drives better outcomes  for patients.   Healthcare providers and patients need certainty. The pandemic has  made it clear that telehealth can and should be a part of modernizing  healthcare.   I plan to support this legislation and hope to continue to work to  unwind the public health emergency in a way that provides patients and  our healthcare providers the certainty that they need. I do think that  we could have done more on this and hope that this process won't be a  model for the rest.
