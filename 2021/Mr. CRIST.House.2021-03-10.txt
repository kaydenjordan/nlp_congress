 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Bipartisan  Background Checks Act.   I also rise for my constituent, Mohammed Haitham. Mo was a young  sailor who followed his mother's footsteps into the Navy, with the  dream of becoming a pilot.   When a Saudi terrorist started shooting, Mo sacrificed himself to  protect others. That is who he was.   Service, selflessness, sacrifice, Mo represented the very best in all  of us. The great State of Florida is proud of him and proud to call him  one of our own.   The attack at Naval Air Station Pensacola killed three young sailors  and wounded eight more.   The terrorist bought the gun legally, using a hunting license to get  it. Al-Qaida and ISIS know about this loophole, and until we close it,  the American people will remain vulnerable.   That is why my bipartisan bill to close the Pensacola loophole has  the support of the Brady Campaign, the Giffords, Major County Sheriffs,  and the Fraternal Order of Police.   I look forward to working with the chairman and my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to pass this bill.
