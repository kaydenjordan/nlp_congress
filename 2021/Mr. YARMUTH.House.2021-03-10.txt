 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 198, I call up  the bill (H.R. 1319) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II  of S. Con. Res. 5, with the Senate amendment thereto, and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material into the Record on the Senate amendment  to H.R. 1319.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as the sponsor of this legislation, I am immensely proud  that we will soon send this bill to President Biden's desk to be signed  into law. We have acted with the urgency this pandemic demands, while  following every House rule and proper procedure required for a budget  reconciliation package.   The American Rescue Plan is aggressive--no doubt about it. But  researchers and health professionals have told us this is what is  needed to scale up testing and tracing, to address PPE shortages, and  to speed up equitable vaccine distribution. They have told us these  investments are needed if we want to save lives and defeat this  pandemic once and for all.   Economists have also made clear what is needed to generate a strong,  inclusive economic recovery. And again, we listened. This bill provides  direct financial relief to more than 80 percent of American families.  It helps feed hungry Americans and provides financial support so  families can afford health coverage during the greatest health crisis  of our lifetimes. It prevents more than 10 million workers from losing  lifeline unemployment benefits--while also making the first $10,200 of  these payments tax free. It helps families facing eviction stay in  their homes. And it expands the earned income tax credit, putting more  money in the pockets of hardworking Americans.   The American Rescue Plan will provide the resources needed to open  schools safely and make up for lost time in the classroom. It will cut  the child poverty rate in half--in half. Just think about what that  will mean for those children and their futures--and the future of our  country.   The legislation has been called one of the most consequential pieces  of legislation in modern history. Well, I guess that depends--if you  are measuring in terms of relief for nearly every American family and  hardworking individual; if your yardstick is lifting millions of  children out of poverty and giving parents the help they desperately  need; if your metrics are a strong and inclusive economic future both  in the short term and long term, then it is easy to agree.   And the American people do. They get what we are doing. They know all  too well the challenges facing our Nation, and that is why the vast  majority of them--Democrats, Republicans, and independents--support the  American Rescue Plan.                                time  1015    Look, this is it. Congress' work on the bill is almost done. In just  a short time, we will pass this legislation. We will send it to  President Biden's desk, and he will sign it into law. We promised  relief. The President promised relief, and now help is on the way.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from  Nevada (Mr. Horsford), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the majority whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I suspect we will listen to this throughout this debate.  The ranking member of the Budget Committee, Mr. Smith, persists in  trying to scare the American people because he doesn't have a valid  argument against this incredible popular bill.   Let me make this very clear: The statutory PAYGO requirements, which  would cause a cut in Medicare, has never happened, won't happen, and  will never happen. In 2017, when Republicans cut taxes for the wealthy  and big corporations, we faced the same problem. We cured that.  Democrats helped Republicans solve that issue. The only way any  Medicare dollars get cut because of this bill is if Republicans don't  help us correct it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Levin), a distinguished member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman from  the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Jeffries), the Democratic Caucus chairman and a  distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I remind the gentleman that the push to  give $2,000 to every citizen under a certain income level was former  President Donald Trump's idea. He campaigned on that. I guess the  Republicans have had a change of heart now that it is a different  President.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from New York  (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the distinguished chair of the Oversight and  Reform Committee.    Mr. Speaker, we have just listened to a repetitive  recitation of all the arguments we have heard about the American Rescue  Plan for the last 6 weeks or so, and they consist essentially of scare  tactics, misinformation, and then calling everything socialism. You  know, if Democrats had a potluck picnic, the Republicans would call it  socialism.  [[Page H1268]]    What we say is: This is a bill that responds uniquely to a unique  national crisis and it does it in a way that the American people  believe is the right way.   So I respond to the minority leader by saying, a poll just this  morning reported that 75 percent of the American people support the  American Rescue Plan. Only 18 percent oppose it. Fifty-nine percent of  Republicans support the American Rescue Plan.                                time  1115    Despite his attempts to divide this country and to demonize the  Speaker and others, the American people understand that this is the  appropriate step to take at the appropriate time.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Chu), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on both  sides.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Scott), the distinguished chairman of the Education  and Labor Committee and also a member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle), a distinguished member of the  Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Waters), the distinguished chair of the Committee  on Financial Services.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. Wexton), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett), a member of Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), a distinguished member of the Foreign  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Clarke), a distinguished member of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Khanna), a distinguished member of the Agriculture  Committee and Oversight and Reform Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), a distinguished member of the  Oversight and Reform Committee and the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Meeks), the distinguished chairman of the Foreign  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Green), a distinguished member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this morning there was a really interesting article in  the Louisville, Kentucky, paper, The Courier-Journal, because yesterday  the Beshear administration presented to the general assembly the  numbers that Kentucky was going to experience based on this American  Rescue Plan, the money that was going to go to the State, the money  that was going to go to counties and cities, the money that was going  to go to higher education--half of which has to be used to support  students in need--and the amount of money that was going to go to help  children out of poverty.   The way it was described in this article was that these legislators-- overwhelmingly Republican, our State house is 75-25, and our senate is  38-9--were stunned and they were excited. One person described it as:  the excitement was palpable.   Of course it is. This is life changing for so many constituents of  theirs. It is life changing for the future of the Commonwealth of  Kentucky.   Let me put it this way: We have 4.4 million Kentuckians--4 million  out of 4.4 million, 92 percent--who will be getting a check, a $1,400  check, some a little bit less, but most $1,400, and 1.2 two million  children will become eligible for an extended child tax credit--1.2  million children. The magnitude of the impact of this bill is truly  stunning.   Now, some people will say--and you can infer this, Mr. Speaker, from  many things the Republicans have said--that none of those people  deserve the $1,400. They don't need it.   I hope they all go home and tell those people that they represent,  you really don't need that $1,400. You haven't suffered because of this  pandemic. You haven't had to care for a relative or a child who has not  been able to go to school, and you haven't had any extra expenses  because of the pandemic. You just don't need it. You are a moderate- income person. Don't take the $1,400.   I want to hear that conversation because it is not going to happen.  As a matter of fact, what we are all concerned about on our side is  Republicans are all going to vote against this and then are going to  show up at every ribbon cutting for every project that is funded out of  this bill, and they are going to puff up their chest and take credit  for all these great benefits that are coming to their citizens. It is  okay if they want to take credit for it. It is fine.   What we are concerned about is that we have finally, in this body and  in this Congress, risen to the occasion in the context of a terrible  national disaster.   What astounds me when I listen to the arguments against this bill is  that nobody was at fault here. At least nobody out in the country was  at fault. All these people who are going to get $1,400 didn't do  anything wrong. All these kids who are going to get raised out of  poverty certainly didn't do anything wrong. The people who are now in  food lines in many cities across the country, who never ever would have  been in a food line before, didn't do anything wrong.   Who is going to help?   Do we say this is all survival of the fittest?   No. We rose to the occasion. We delivered. The American people I know  support us.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to support the American Rescue Plan Act  of 2021, and I yield back the balance of my time.
