 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I also rise in support of H.R. 2420 for several reasons.   If you look at the impact of the Hispanic culture here in the United  States, all you have to do is go back. The first language that was ever  spoken in the United States, a European language, was Spanish.   The first settlement in the United States was St. Augustine, Florida.   And if you look at the impact that the Spanish culture has had on the  U.S., all you have to do is look at the State symbols like the State  coats of arms, seals, and flags, and you will see that the coats of  arms and the flags of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Montana, New  Mexico, Texas, Puerto Rico, Los Angeles, Santa Fe, St. Louis, San  Diego, Baton Rouge, Riverside, Pensacola, Cupertino, and St. Augustine  all have the symbol.   Finally, let me just say this as I close. Even the U.S. dollar has  had an impact. When the Spanish explorers developed settlements in the  United States, they brought along the trading coins, or Spanish  dollars, that were used regularly by the people in that region.                                time  1045     Madam Speaker, in 1775, the Spanish dollar was announced  as the first currency with legal use in the United States, and this was  approved by the Continental Congress, suggested by Thomas Jefferson.   The design of the American dollar in 1792 was based off its Spanish  counterpart. All you have to do is look at the dollar sign, and you  will see the Spanish influence.   Again, the Spanish culture has had an influence, and I certainly ask  all Members to support this legislation.
