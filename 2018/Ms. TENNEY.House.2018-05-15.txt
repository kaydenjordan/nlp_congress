 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Rick Mansfield, an  airman in the U.S. Air Force and Vietnam veteran from the town of  Vienna in Oneida County. He recently gave me a World War II artifact  belonging to Sergeant Joseph J. Benenati. It is called a Heart Shield  Bible, and I have it in my hand.   These are now fading from use, and this particular one is very faded.  It has a gold-leaf steel cover with the words ``God's Weapon'' engraved  on the front.   Sergeant Benenati was a New York State police officer and U.S. marine  who served in the Pacific theater, and he was the Chenango County  sheriff in my district for 21 years. Sadly, in 2011, at the age of 97,  Sergeant Benenati passed away.   Sergeant Benenati's Heart Shield Bible is one that was given to World  War II soldiers by their loved ones to protect them in battle. These  Bibles were designed to fit securely in the chest pocket of a soldier's  uniform. The metal plates were securely attached to the front cover of  the Bible to stop a bullet from reaching the soldier's heart.   I would like to thank Rick Mansfield for giving me this truly  invaluable piece of history. I would also like to extend my sincere  appreciation to former airman Rick Mansfield as well as Sergeant Joseph  Benenati for their honorable service to our great Nation.                            ____________________
