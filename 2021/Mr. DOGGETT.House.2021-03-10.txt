 Mr. Speaker, rescue and relief for those awaiting  lifesaving vaccines, for struggling small businesses, indebted families  about to lose their home, for impoverished children, and for those who  are eager to get their children back in school, survival checks are  coming.   And the same Republicans who delayed relief for 7 long months last  year seem determined to block this lifeline this year. Texas families  tell me they cannot wait for more of your Republican gamesmanship. Our  mayors and county judges across Texas, they have been the ones who  stood alone, shouldering the burden of leadership, after multiple Trump  failures and outrageous Abbott interference. They need help in  providing for our communities. That is the relief we will provide.   Let's preserve the promise of life and liberty for those whose future  has been dimmed by hardship. Republicans will not again deny the relief  that we are delivering today.    Mr. Speaker, this bill simply requires that the  background check for a purchase that occurs within a gun shop applies  outside a gun shop. That doesn't take away anyone's right, but it does  protect us from convicted criminals, fugitives, and family abusers who  are prevented from evading the law to buy a weapon of war online or at  a gun show. Texas Gun Sense knows the gap in safety makes no sense.   Unfortunately, NRA has come to stand for ``No Republican Action.''  They offer us only moments of silence for mass murder, but they always  come up short with one very important type of ammunition--courage.  Students in March for Our Lives have that courage. Moms Demand Action  are steadfast in demanding meaningful action.   As these gun lobbies continue to oppose reasonable action, we must  speak up for gun safety. We must listen to the victims of violence  before their number is increased by another El Paso shooting, another  school shooting, or another concert interrupted by gunfire.   We must act now to save lives.
