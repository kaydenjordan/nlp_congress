 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and the  good gentleman here for explaining why $1.9 trillion in spending is  reckless, irresponsible, and the wrong thing to do.   We still have $1 trillion set aside for COVID relief and spending.  There is no need to enslave the American people, our children, our  grandchildren, our great grandchildren, and generations going forward  in more debt.   We are $28 trillion in debt. This Congress is ramming through  unbelievable things at a rapid pace.   This must be stopped. We have to give pause and consideration to what  we are doing. This is a waste of money and a complete waste of time.   Reopening America is a much better way to go.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.
