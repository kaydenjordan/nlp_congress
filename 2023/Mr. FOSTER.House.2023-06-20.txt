 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  my dear friend, Alderwoman Scheketa Hart-Burns, and to recognize her  important contributions to the city of Aurora, Illinois.   Ms. Scheketa Hart-Burns moved to Aurora in 1978 where she became the  first African American elected to the Aurora City Council in 1991 and  the first African American Mayor Pro Tem from 2016 to 2017.   Throughout her career, Alderwoman Hart-Burns spearheaded dozens of  initiatives to benefit the people she represented and everyone who  calls Aurora home.   Alderwoman Hart-Burns was an active member of her church, the Greater  Mount Olive Church of God and Christ, and brought an inspirational  spirit to everything that she did. She was my ambassador to the  African-American churches of Aurora.   Although she had children of her own, she was known as mother to all  for her nourishing spirit and her kind heart. Scheketa Hart-Burns  passed away yesterday on June 19, 2023. She will be greatly missed and  always remembered by those of us, like me, who are lucky enough to have  known her and to have called her a friend.                            ____________________
