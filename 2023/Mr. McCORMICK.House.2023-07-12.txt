 Mr. Chairman, I applaud Chairman Rogers and Ranking  Member Smith and the House Armed Services Committee and its staff for  crafting the fiscal year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act, and I  urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   This is not an easy process, but even as a freshman member of the  committee and as a veteran of over 20 years, I always felt my voice was  heard, as well as my colleagues, and that we were heard and considered.   This NDAA secures the future of our military and our Nation. It makes  critical investments to improve the lives of our servicemembers and  give our warfighters the tools they need to meet tomorrow's needs.   H.R. 2670 also combats another concerning trend, which is on the mind  of every American, particularly those who serve, the politicization of  our military.   In the military we may be different shades of green, but we all bleed  red.   Mr. Chair, I am pleased to support the NDAA that ensures our military  is squarely focused on the mission set outlined in the oath of office  that my fellow servicemembers and I swore to uphold.   Once again, I thank Chairman Rogers for bringing this year's NDAA to  fruition, and I urge my colleagues to vote for this bipartisan piece of  legislation.
