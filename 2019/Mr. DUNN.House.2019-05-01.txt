 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because we have failed our  military and all the victims of 2018 disasters across the country.   On October 10, Tyndall Air Force Base took a direct hit from a  category 5 hurricane. Over 6 months later, no disaster funding has been  provided. Air Force Secretary Wilson warned us that if she did not  receive supplemental funding by May 1, all new work on Tyndall Air  Force Base would stop. This delays the return of base operations,  impacts flight operations throughout the Air Force, and forces our  airmen to work in degraded facilities.   Mr. Speaker, May 1 has come, and I stand before you today because we  have failed to deliver funding, and now our military readiness is  suffering. We only have until May 15 to provide funding to the Air  Force before they start cutting airplane repairs.   I urge the leadership of the House and the Senate to pass a clean  disaster supplemental immediately. It is necessary, and it is the right  thing to do.                            ____________________
