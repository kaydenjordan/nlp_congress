 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Clinch  Memorial Hospital for being named the Hometown Health Hospital of the  Year for 2019.   I am proud of the work that Clinch Memorial Hospital is doing to  provide high-quality care to our rural communities in the First  Congressional District of Georgia. With unique challenges facing rural  healthcare systems across the Nation, Clinch Memorial Hospital has met  these challenges head-on and is using groundbreaking programs to better  the care for individuals in the surrounding rural communities.   Over the last 2 years, the hospital's CEO, Ms. Angela Ammons, has  added new programs to help people with substance abuse issues, a swing- bed system to more efficiently use their resources, and a new wound  care unit. But most importantly, she has nearly miraculously turned  around the hospital's financials, maintaining the community's access to  healthcare and keeping the local economy churning.   Clinch Memorial Hospital is more than deserving of the Hospital of  the Year Award.   Congratulations, and keep up the good work.                        National Pharmacist Month 2019     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize October  as being National Pharmacist Month 2019.   According to Census data, there are over 200,000 pharmacists across  the U.S., with another 25,000 pharmacy aides. Every day these  pharmacists are providing vaccines for a number of illnesses and  carefully counseling patients on prescriptions to help heal sickness  and reduce pain. Through this work, pharmacists are considered one of  the top three most-trusted professions in America.   Mr. Speaker, this month, as well as through the rest of the year, I  encourage everyone to visit your pharmacist, ask questions about your  prescriptions, and get to know the people who provide your medicine and  work to keep you healthy.   As the only pharmacist currently serving in Congress, I am proud to  recognize the work these individuals are doing every day to serve their  local communities around the country.   Keep up the good work.                           Forty-Day Pro Life Vigil     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize all  those participating in the 40 Days for Life Vigil happening September  25 through November 3.   For the past 40 days, individuals in cities across the world have  been fasting, praying, campaigning, and holding a vigil in order to end  abortion. In the First Congressional District of Georgia, Savannahians  have been contributing to the cause through their own vigil and  luncheon. The organization has helped save 16,000 lives, close 104  abortion centers, and 191 abortion workers to quit their jobs.   As a medical professional, father, and grandfather, I believe that  every life is sacred. I cannot thank these individuals enough for their  important work. After the 40 Days for Life Vigil is over, I hope you  will join me in continuing the fight to save the lives of our children.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms.  Sheila McNeill for receiving the 2019 Distinguished Civilian Award by  the Naval Submarine League.   Ms. McNeill was the first-ever woman to win this award, and I could  not be more proud of the work she has done in the First Congressional  District of Georgia over the last 20 years.   Living in Camden County, near the Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base, she  has advocated for the U.S. submarine force at both the national and  local levels, often traveling to Washington and meeting with dozens of  Members of Congress to keep our submarines at sea, protecting our  Nation.   On one specific occasion, Ms. McNeill was critical in retaining the  Nation's first four ballistic missile submarines by converting them  into guided-missile submarines. Her commitment to the Armed Forces  extends deeply into the surrounding communities, ensuring that they  maintain close-knit relationships through her work as president of the  Camden Partnership.   Mr. Speaker, I thank and congratulate Ms. McNeill for her work in the  First Congressional District of Georgia.                            ____________________
