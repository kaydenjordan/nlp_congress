 Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Utah for leading this  amendment, and I thank my friends in the San Antonio delegation for  standing up for the people of San Antonio, who are on the outside  looking in.   San Antonio is a city of 1.5 million people. It is the seventh  largest city, Joint Base San Antonio. My colleagues on both sides of  the aisle just smirk it off and say: Oh, no, don't disrupt my flights.  Don't disrupt my ability to get to my local airports.   Do you know what? The next time you come to San Antonio, explain that  to the men and women in uniform serving their country who can't take a  flight to Reagan because you guys got something in 1966, and now it is  a protectionist racket to hold onto something for yourselves.   I won't take this flight, for the most part, unless I am going back  to San Antonio. I have a direct flight because Austin was exempted,  like 10 other cities were exempted. This is seven slots. It is less  than 2 percent of the total. Stop the protectionist racket. Open it up  to competition, seven airlines, seven slots.
