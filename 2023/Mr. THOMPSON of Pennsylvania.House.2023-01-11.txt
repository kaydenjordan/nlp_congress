 Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania kicked off one of my favorite events: the  Pennsylvania Farm Show.   For more than a century, 170 years, farmers have gathered each  January at the Pennsylvania Farm Show in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. This  week-long event is the largest indoor agricultural exposition in the  Nation, showcasing more than 6,000 animals, nearly 12,000 exhibits, and  more than half a million visitors.   Each year, I host a listening session at the farm show, and we cover  a range of topics during the public forum, from raising awareness about  agriculture education to hearing very real concerns from our farmers,  ranchers, producers, processors, and many more key rural stakeholders.  This year, the listening session will take place on Friday, January 13.   The Pennsylvania Farm Show brings together so many different  agriculture advocates from all different corners of the industry. It is  an event like no other. I am very proud that this takes place in the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   The Pennsylvania Farm Show provides an atmosphere for everyone to  walk through, observe, and educate  [[Page H160]]  themselves about different areas of agriculture, the Commonwealth's  largest industry, which brings nearly $6.9 billion annually in  agricultural cash receipts. Almost half a million jobs are tied to the  industry, which positively impacts all Pennsylvanians.   Undoubtedly, one of the most popular attractions of the Pennsylvania  Farm Show is the food court. Located in the Expo Hall and Main Hall of  the complex, the food court offers visitors a variety of Pennsylvania  products, which generates income to support the nonprofit Pennsylvania  Agricultural Commodity Organizations.   Mr. Speaker, more than a century ago, the first Pennsylvania Farm  Show was a 3-day exhibit. Today, the event is a week-long celebration  of how the agriculture industry touches our lives every day. Proudly,  this event draws visitors from across the country to highlight  everything our State has to offer when it comes to agriculture.   I have been hosting this listening session as a Representative of  Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District for 13 years. Like every  year, I am looking forward to hearing directly from the backbone of our  Nation, the hardworking men and women of American agriculture.   The Pennsylvania Farm Show goes through this Saturday, January 14.  Like I said, we look forward to 3 o'clock in the banquet hall to be  hosting this year's listening session on Friday, January 13. I  certainly invite and encourage my colleagues and actually anyone that  would like to join us for this event.   It is 24 acres under roof, almost a million square feet. It  represents not just Pennsylvania's number one industry, but agriculture  is the industry that touches the lives of American families more times  a day than any other.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate National Milk Day.   Today is a great day to raise a glass of milk in honor of our dairy  farmers, who work 24/7 to bring fresh, nutritious, and delicious milk  to our tables every single day.   We celebrate National Milk Day on January 11 because on this day in  1878 milk was delivered in sterilized glass bottles for the first time.   I am proud to come from a long line of dairy farmers. According to  the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, Pennsylvania has 500,000  cows producing more than 10.2 billion pounds of milk annually.   The Keystone State ranks seventh in milk production in the country,  and Pennsylvania is also second nationally in the number of dairy  farms, with 6,200 farms across the Commonwealth.   Agriculture is the number one industry in Pennsylvania, with the  Pennsylvania dairy industry providing 52,000 jobs and generating $14.7  billion in annual revenue.   Madam Speaker, please join me in celebrating National Milk Day and  thanking our dairy farm families for their continued efforts to provide  us with such a delicious and nutritious treat.                            ____________________
