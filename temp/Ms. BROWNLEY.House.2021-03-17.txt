 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of our Nation's  immigrants, the farmworkers who toil in our fields to feed us, and our  Dreamers, the exceptional young people who are the promise and future  of America.   Our immigration laws should reflect our shared values as a Nation,  especially the importance of keeping families and communities together.   In my district in Ventura County, California, agriculture is a  cornerstone of our regional economy. Immigrant farmworkers are  essential to putting food on America's table.   Because of the essential role farmworkers play in our economy and our  communities, I support the creation of an earned pathway to  citizenship.   I also stand with our Dreamers, many of whom have known no other home  than the United States. Dreamers are the embodiment of the American  Dream. Dreamers represent the very best of our country, and they are  realizing their fullest potential. Their success is America's success.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Farm Workforce  Modernization Act and the American Dream and Promise Act.                            ____________________
