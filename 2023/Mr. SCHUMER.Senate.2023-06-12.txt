 Madam President, last Friday, the Department of Justice  announced Donald Trump had been indicted on 37 counts related to his  mishandling of classified documents. One only has to listen to the  statements from former Trump National Security Advisor John Bolton and  Trump's former Attorney General to know just how serious this  indictment is.   As I have said before: No one is above the law--including Donald  Trump. This case must be allowed to play out through the legal process  without outside political or ideological interference. I encourage both  supporters and critics of Donald Trump to maintain the peace and let  the justice system do its work.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    I move to proceed to executive session to consider  Calendar No. 26.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I move to proceed to legislative session.    I move to proceed to executive session to consider  Calendar No. 29.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I move to proceed to legislative session.    I move to proceed to executive session to consider  Calendar No. 23.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.
