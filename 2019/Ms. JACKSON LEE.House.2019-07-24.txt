 Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House  Committees on the Judiciary, Homeland Security, and Budget, I rise in  strong support of H.R. 3409, the ``Coast Guard Authorization Act of  2019.''   H.R. 3409 is bipartisan legislation that reauthorizes appropriations  for the Coast Guard and Federal Maritime Commission through the 2021  Fiscal Year.   This legislation contains improvements to promote the U.S. maritime  industry and offshore renewable energy development, authorization of  funding for new heavy ice breakers, and provisions to increase  diversity at the United States Coast Guard Academy.   Additionally, this legislation will enhance recruitment and retention  of merchant vessels, along with advancing new opportunities to  strengthen the competitiveness of the U.S. maritime and shipbuilding  industries.   Earlier this year the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees  the United States Coast Guard, was adversely affected by the Trump  Administration's government shutdown.   The shutdown affected the pay of over 40,000 active duty Coast Guard  members, 6,000 reservists, and 8,500 civilian employees.   It took 35 days for Congress and the White House to agree on a FY  2019 funding bill.   During this time the brave men and women of the Coast Guard endured  the cold winter weather while conducting life-saving rescues, drug  interdiction operations, environmental protection missions, and costal  security operations.   This bill will guarantee that the Coast Guard's active duty and  civilian personnel are paid in the event of another federal government  shutdown.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1649  ``Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2019'' in order to ensure that the  Coast Guard has all of the resources required to carry out their  missions and maintain safety along our coastal borders.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1984,  the Disclosing Aid Spent to Ensure Relief Act'', or ``DISASTER Act'',  which directs the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to  submit to Congress a report on all disaster-related assistance provided  by the Federal Government.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is not only a reasonable exercise of  Congress' power of oversight but it is also fiscally prudent.   To understand the scope of disaster-related spending and expenditures  by the Federal Government, Congress must have a comprehensive  understanding of the various multi-agency and multiyear efforts in  helping disaster-stricken areas recover.   Additionally, having estimates of these expenditures for individual  Federal agencies will also help inform the congressional appropriations  process as well as presidential budget requests.   Mr. Speaker, knowledge about disaster-related expenses will also  yield opportunities for reducing these expenses through mitigative and  preventative efforts.   Because transparency and open government are important, it is  essential that Congress has a single, publicly available estimate of  spending on disaster-related assistance.   The American people deserve to know how their tax dollars are being  spent and how these dollars are being used to help them when disaster  strikes.   This report would also be crucial in helping educate the public about  the numerous agencies involved in disaster relief efforts.   While many would immediately recognize agencies such as FEMA and the  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, less conspicuous agencies such as NOAA,  EPA, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, play a crucial role in  disaster relief.   In short, H.R. 1984 will better inform both Congress and the public  about what the Federal Government is doing to help those affected by  disaster.   I strongly urge all members to support this necessary and vital  legislation.                                time  1400     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3375, the  ``Stopping Bad Robocalls Act.''   H.R. 3375 will require the Federal Communications Commission to  update the definition of what qualifies as a robocall and ensure that  any attempt to circumvent its rules using new or different robocall  technology is outlawed.   The Stopping Bad Robocalls Act would also require telecommunications  corporations to implement new technology to ensure that calls are not  spam.   In addition, it will yield more efficient investigations conducted by  government officials and the heightened enforcement of anti-robocall  rules.   In June of 2019 4.4 billion robocalls were placed nationwide.   Texas led all 50 states, receiving over 500 million robocalls in that  month.   Mr. Speaker, robocalls have become an overwhelming issue in our  country and threaten to paralyze our most critical communications  lines.   These callers are not only a nuisance but are also predatory.   They have begun to target crucial establishments including hospitals,  cancer centers, and medical research organizations, creating conditions  that can potentially lead to a health crisis.   Administrators at these institutions worry that, without  intervention, the myriad of incoming robocalls could eventually  outmatch their best efforts to keep hospital phone lines free during  emergencies.   Robocallers have gone even further to perform scams using the  spoofing tactic, in which they can appear to take on existing phone  numbers.   With the aid of spoofing, scammers can take on phone numbers that are  the same as or very similar to the numbers of health care providers.   Robocallers use the names and numbers of these organizations, to aid  their scam of telling people that they owe money and requesting private  information.   We are all aware of the difficulty millions of Americans face in  attaining affordable health care.   Robocallers are maliciously taking advantage of these circumstances  and seek to profit from the exacerbation of the stress that families  are challenged with.   The federal government as well as multiple large telecommunications  corporations are equipped with information on these robocallers and the  groups whom they seek to take advantage of.   The virulent aspirations of these callers must be met with the  commitment of our government to protect our citizens by placing the  responsibility on these corporations to protect consumers.   I urge all members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 3375, the  ``Stopping Bad Robocalls Act.''    Mr. Chair, as a senior member of the Judiciary  Committee, I rise in support of the H.R. 3239, a the ``Humanitarian  Standards for Individuals in Customs and Border Protection Custody  Act.''   I support H.R. 3239, because it would require CBP to perform an  initial health screening on all individuals in CBP custody and ensure  that everyone in custody has access to water, sanitation and hygiene,  food and nutrition, and safe shelter, among other provisions.   I have also offered two amendments that I truly believe keeps the CBP  staff and detainees safe under the current conditions.   My first amendment to H.R. 3239 requires retention of video  monitoring and certification that the video is on at all times.   CBP is considered ``at capacity'' when detainee levels reach 4,000.   However, between May 14 and June 13, 2019, CBP detained more than  14,000 people per day--and sometimes as many as 18,000.   A cell with a maximum capacity of 12 held 76 detainees; a cell with a  maximum capacity of 8 held 41 detainees, and a cell with a maximum  capacity of 35 held 155 detainees.   Individuals were standing on toilets in the cells to make room and  gain breathing space, thus limiting access to the toilets.   There is limited access to showers and clean clothing, and  individuals have been wearing soiled clothing for days or weeks.   While DHS concurred with the recommendation made to alleviate  overcrowding at the Del Norte Processing Center, it identified November  30, 2020 as the date on which the situation would be corrected.   There have been reports of agitation and frustration from the CBP  staff and the detainees.   This legislation provides some of the transparency, accountability  and oversight that protects the detainees and the CBP employees and  contractors.   My second amendment to H.R. 3239 requires that the Commissioner shall  ensure that language-appropriate ``Detainee Bill of Rights,'' including  indigenous languages, are posted in all areas where detainees are  located.   The ``Detainee Bill of Rights'' shall include all rights afforded to  the detainee under this bill.   In July, Border Patrol was holding about 8,000 detainees in custody  at the time of the DHS OIG visit, with 3,400 held longer than the 72  hours generally permitted under the Transport, Escort, Detention, and  Search (TEDS) standards.   Of those 3,400 detainees, Border Patrol held 1,500 for more than 10  days.   Border Patrol data indicated that 826 (31 percent) of the 2,669  children at these facilities had been held longer than the 72 hours  generally permitted under the TEDS standards and the Flores Agreement.   The estimated completion date is November 30, 2020 which is too far  in the future for the pressing issue we are having today.   Border Patrol agents has said that some single adults had been held  in standing-room-only conditions for days or weeks. Border Patrol  management on site said there is an ongoing concern that rising.  [[Page H7340]]    Currently, there are no regulations to guide CBP on medical  evaluation or sanitation within the short-term detention facilities.   It is very concerning that CBP has reported the deaths of four  children and six adults in CBP custody.   The posting of the Detainee Bill of Rights allows the detainees to  understand what screenings will be done during their intake, and what  help is afforded to them during custody.   The posting will also help the detainees communicate with the CBP  employees about what needs may not be met under the provisions of this  legislation.   I truly believe this will ease some of the tensions and frustrations  at the detention facilities.   I applaud Rep. Raul Ruiz for introducing the Humanitarian Standards  for Individuals in Customs and Border Protection Custody Act and my  colleagues for working together to ease tensions in a difficult  situation.   I believe that the adoption of the Jackson Lee amendments strengthen  H.R. 3239 by continuing to provide transparency, accountability and  oversight.   I also believe that the Jackson Lee amendment that provided  transparency for duties that are outsourced to private contractors to  be subject to FOIA through CBP would have strengthened the bill more  and is also needed to keep all parties safe.    Mr. Chair, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman,  and I want to personally thank her for her constant and needed fight  for women's rights and, particularly, protecting these women against  sexual assault and sexual abuse.   I cannot tell you how many stories that we have heard at the border  of young women who have come either by coyotes, or even when they get  here to this country, the fear that they have of sexual assault and  sexual abuse. It is a long walk and a long journey from the  [[Page H7343]]  Northern Triangle, and I want to thank the gentlewoman again for  recognizing that.   So, I rise to support the Kuster amendment, and I rise to support the  underlying bill, H.R. 3239.   I thank the gentlewoman from California for her leadership, and I  thank my good friend Dr. Raul Ruiz. We have talked about this. The  gentleman has talked about this. I have heard the gentleman on many  occasions speaking to us as Members of Congress, not Democrats, but  Democrats and Republicans and Independents who would listen.   In his conversation, we did not hear anything that would suggest that  we would undermine, in any way, our friends or veterans who are in need  of great medical care. We stand ready, as we have done over the past,  to continue to try to push dollars to help them.   This bill in particular deals with CBP to perform an initial health  screening on all individuals in CBP custody, and ensures that everyone  in custody has access to water, sanitation, hygiene, food, nutrition,  and safe shelter.   But having been to the border, I will say that they are still in  cages. They are still in small areas where they only have standing  room.   This is to protect both contractors, employees, and those human  beings who came because they are desperate and fleeing violence. The  stories tell you of their fathers being murdered, their husband's being  murdered, and their sons being taken away.   This underlying bill, its purpose is to ensure that the American  people are protected so that epidemics don't start, so that little  babies don't die--like the seven who have died on the watch of the  Trump administration.   I am delighted that my amendment was included, which requires  retention of video monitoring and certification that the video is on at  all times. It will enhance the amendment of Ms. Kuster.   The other amendment I want to appreciate is the Detainee Bill of  Rights. I support the amendment and the underlying bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for  yielding, and I thank him for his leadership and the leadership of  Chairman Grijalva, for the full committee, and, certainly, the ranking  member for his courtesies.   I thank the manager tonight, a friend from Utah, for their kindness  in yielding to me. This is an emotional moment for me and, as well, for  many in my constituency, and I am delighted to be able to rise to give  strong support to H.R. 434, the Emancipation National Historic Trail  Study Act.   I thank all of the Members, as I have indicated, and also thank  Congresswoman Haaland, chair of the Natural Resources Committee's  Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands, for holding  the hearing that allowed the committee to learn of the strong support  enjoyed by H.R. 434 and the hard work of dedicated historic  preservationists to preserve the rich history of former slaves.   I also thank Naomi Mitchell Carrier of Houston, Texas, for her  stalwart efforts to share the stories of newly freed slaves who settled  in Freedmen's Town, a section of Houston, to begin their lives as free  persons during the end of the Civil War. I want to thank Ms. Carrier as  an educator, historian, and author with expertise in African American  music, Texas history, and heritage tourism.   I also thank Ms. Eileen Lawal for her April 2019 oral testimony  before the Natural Resources Committee in an amazing, passionate  expression of how vital this trail will be. Ms. Lawal is the president  Houston Freedmen's Town Conservancy, whose mission is to protect and  preserve the history of Freedmen's Town.   I also thank the Mayor of the city of Houston, Sylvester Turner;  Commissioner Rodney Ellis; the mayor of the city of Galveston; my  colleague, my original cosponsor, Congressman Weber, who represents the  Galveston area.   The work of H.R. 434 will result in only the second trail in the  United States that chronicles the experience of African Americans.   I am hoping that this will move swiftly through the United States  House, then to the United States Senate, and then is signed by the  President of the United States.   Currently, the National Park Service only has one national historic  trail which centers on the African American experience. It is a Selma  to Montgomery National Historic Trail which covers a 54-mile path  between Selma and Montgomery.   But as slaves lived in this land from 1619 to 1865 as slaves, a 250- year history, to think only one trail would commemorate that historic  moment--although a moment in history that all of us are saddened by--it  is important to capture the bravery, the courage, the strength of those  families who managed to stay together.   The establishment of the Emancipation National Historic Trail will be  the second trail for which the National Park Services would have  responsibility and, again, would tell the wonderful story for future  generations of the rich history of this Nation and the role that  African Americans played in the economic, political, religious,  cultural, and governmental efforts of this Nation. It ties into the  work that we are continuing to do.   The Emancipation National Historic Trail Study Act would pave the way  to working to establish an important story. It will go 51 miles from  the historic Osterman Building and Reedy Chapel in Galveston, Texas,  along Highway 3 and Interstate 45, all the way up to Freedmen's Town  and Emancipation Park and Independence Heights, which was the first  city organized by African Americans here in the Southwest region.   H.R. 434 requires that we study the post-Civil War history of newly  freed slaves in a major slave-holding State following the largest  military campaign waged on domestic soil in the history of the United  States.   It is important to take note of the fact that those of us west of the  Mississippi did not know that Abraham  [[Page H7354]]  Lincoln had freed the slaves until 1865. Captain Granger came to the  shores and said to us in 1865, those of our ancestors, that they had  been freed.   In a second inaugural address, President Abraham Lincoln declared  that slavery was America's original sin: ``Yet, if God wills that it  continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's 250 years of  unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with  the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said  3,000 years ago, so still it must be said `the judgments of the Lord  are true and righteous altogether.' ''   We know that Abraham Lincoln wanted to maintain the unity of this  Nation, but he wanted it to be without slaves. The story of the trail  will be one that will be enlightening because the newly freed slaves  established communities. They established schools. They established  churches, and they migrated into the Houston community, coming up from  that Emancipation National Historic Trail.   Today, the city of Houston is fortunate to call those communities  Freedmen's Town and Emancipation Park. The first park that was bought  in the State of Texas was bought by freed slaves in Independence  Heights. Freedmen's Town survived while other communities did not, and  it continues to have some of the historic buildings.   By 1915, over 400 African American-owned businesses existed in  Freedmen's Town. By 1920, one-third of Houston's 85,000 people lived in  Freedmen's Town.   Freedmen's Town is recognized as a historic district. Emancipation  Park was established in 1872 as Texas' oldest park, and it was bought,  as I indicated, by freed slaves for a mere $8. After the emancipation,  Freedmen's Town became one of the only sanctuaries for free persons in  Houston.   The Freedmen's Town community has fought to preserve its structures,  and though we are suffering from gentrification and the movement of our  historic structures, we still have the character of that community.   I am delighted that the new neighbors, the new residents of that area  will now be able to recognize how important Freedmen's Town is, and we  can work together to build the historical story.   One such struggle was to preserve the handmade red bricks, and this  evidences the restoring, the very important ceremony to put the old  bricks that were made by freed slaves, to put them back into Freedmen's  Town.   There are many stories that have come with this recurrent retelling  of this trail, and I believe it will be an important trail and  important story as well.   Let me also indicate that Independence Heights, as I said, was the  first city, and we have already discussed the importance of  Emancipation Park.   On September 24, 2016, the National Museum of African American  History and Culture opened its doors, after 13 years of planning and  construction and over 100 years of struggle, to see the history of  former slaves as part of the complex of the museums of the Smithsonian  that began in 1915.   I am proud to say that one of my predecessors, the Honorable Mickey  Leland, was the first to seek to establish a museum dealing with  slaves.   Then came   John Lewis, who introduced his bill in 2003. I was  delighted to be able to be part of it.   I am asking for strong support for H.R. 434. As I indicated, it  brings back great memories of understanding our discussion in school  about slavery and its aftermath. There was no commemoration to  recognize that historic march, that historic migration when the slaves  were freed in Galveston at that time and the settling that went on in  the city of Houston.                                time  2130    It is very important to have knowledge of our history. With this  trail, not only will the information about this historic trail be  placed in the annals of the history of the United States, but I will be  very grateful that the children and their children's children will  really understand the important collective history of this great  Nation.   Again, I wish to thank all of those who supported this. It is  important to be able to thank Harris County Precinct 1 Commissioner  Rodney Ellis, the African American Library at Gregory School, the  Houston Freedmen's Town Conservatory, the Freedmen's Town Advisory  Committee, the Emancipation Park Conservancy, the Independence Heights  Redevelopment Council, the Freedmen's Town Preservation Coalition, the  Kohrville Community Amos Cemetery Association, the Texas Center for  African American Living History, the Rutherford B. Hayes Yates Museum,  the Heritage Society of Sam Houston Park, the Houston Association of  Black Psychologists, the Kinder Foundation, and Vanderbilt University.   Ramon Manning, who heads the Emancipation Park Conservancy, was an  avid and strong supporter, also, as I mentioned, Sylvester Turner, the  mayor of the city of Houston; Jacqueline Bostic; the Fourth Ward  Redevelopment Authority; the head of the Emancipation Park Conservancy;  and the director of parks. As I said, the mayor of the city of  Galveston was also a supporter.   Mr. Speaker, I include letters in support of H.R. 434                                                    City of Houston                                              Library Department,                                         Houston, TX, July 22, 2019.      Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee: The Houston Public       Library, on behalf of the African American Library at the       Gregory School (The Gregory School), endorses H.R. 434, the       Emancipation National Historic Trail Act, which had a hearing       before the Subcommittee on April 2, 2019.        The Library has a vested interest in the Emancipation       National Historic Trail because The Gregory School currently       holds and has held a very unique place in the histories of       Texas, Houston, and Freedmen's Town/Fourth Ward history for       more than 152 years.        In 2009, The Gregory School was established by the Houston       Public Library as an African American Research and Archival       Center in Houston's Historic Fourth Ward or Freedmen's Town.       Freedman's Town was established in 1865 as the destination of       former enslaved people in Texas and Louisiana after the Civil       War. In 1866, the Freedmen's Bureau opened schools for black       children and adults in the area. The Texas Legislature       authorized the creation of public schools for the black       community in 1870. By 1872 most of the students and teachers       who were at the Bureau schools, which were closing, left them       to attend the state-managed Gregory Institute. The Gregory       Institute was the first school for freed slaves in Houston.       Mike Snyder of the Houston Chronicle said that it was       ``perhaps the first school for freed slaves in the State of       Texas.'' By 1876 the Gregory Institute became a part of the       Houston Public School System. The building that now houses       the African American Library at the Gregory School first       opened in 1926, as a two-story public school building for       ``colored children,'' and was named Gregory Elementary       School. In March 2019, The Gregory School was designated as a       ``site of Memory associated with the UNESCO Slave Route       Project'' for being the first public school for freed slaves       in the state of Texas.        This bill will result in the Emancipation National Historic       Trail, which extends approximately 51 miles from the Osterman       Building and Reedy Chapel in Galveston, Texas, along Texas       State Highway 3 and Interstate 45 North to Freedmen's Town,       then to Independence Heights, and Emancipation Park in       Houston, Texas. This trail follows the migration route taken       by newly freed slaves from the major 19th century seaport       town of Galveston to the burgeoning community of Freedmen's       Town, which is now the 4th Ward of Houston, home to the 18th       Congressional District.        The start of the trail is located where General Gordon       Granger sailed into Galveston, Texas, with troops on June 19,       1865, to announce the freedom of the last American slaves.       His announcement belatedly freed 250,000 slaves nearly two       and a half years after Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation       Proclamation. The newly freed slaves traveled from Galveston       to spread the news to neighboring communities.        Should this bill become law it would establish the first       trail in the Southwest United States that recognizes the role       of African Americans in the legacy of freedom in the United       States. An Emancipation Historic Trail designation would       bring long overdue historic recognition due to the role       African Americans played in the building of the today's       Houston and the state of Texas. In addition, the revenue       generated by people who come to visit the area and walk this       trail will result in tourism dollars to the city of Houston       and the adjoining areas.            Sincerely,                                          Rhea Brown Lawson, Ph.D.,      Director of the Houston Public Library.                                   ____                                        Harris County Precint One,                                         Houston, TX, July 22, 2019.      Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee: I would like to       express my strong support for H.R. 434, ``Emancipation       National Historic Trail Act.'' The trail will follow the       migration route taken by newly freed slaves from Galveston to       the vibrant settlement of  [[Page H7355]]       Freedmen's Town, which today is located outside downtown       Houston in the 18th Congressional District. The trail would       extend north 51 miles from Galveston's historic Osterman       Building and Reedy Chapel AME Church along Highway 3 and       Interstate 45 to Freedmen's Town and Emancipation Park in       Houston.        As the Harris County Precinct One Commissioner, I have the       privilege of representing the Freedman's Town and       Emancipation Park areas; I firmly believe the trail will       further elevate the historical significance of these vibrant       communities and tell an important part of our local and       national history. The Emancipation National Historic Trail       would be the first trail in southwest United States that       recognizes the role of African Americans in the legacy of       freedom.        I applaud you for introducing the bill, which I       wholeheartedly support, and urge your support of the creation       of the Emancipation National Historic Trail Act. It would       bring national attention to a period of history when our       nation took significant strides to make real the promise of       our founding documents that give all people the right to       freedom--a worthy goal, indeed.        Thank you for your time and consideration.            Sincerely,                                                      Rodney Ellis,      Commissioner.                                   ____                                            Vanderbilt University,                                       Nashville, TN, July 19, 2019.      Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee: As the U.S. Member       of the UNESCO International Scientific Committee for the       Slave Route Project: ``Resistance, Liberty and Heritage,'' I       write to endorse H.R. 434, the Emancipation National Historic       Trail Act, which had a hearing before the Subcommittee on       April 2, 2019.        My UNESCO charge has been to help identify sites of       importance for the history of Africans and their descendants       in our country, and to support the nomination of these sites       for a UNESCO Slave Route designation. Since 2017, I have had       the pleasure of working with the organizations and       individuals in Houston who have been dedicated to preserving       this important and underappreciated history. After much hard       work on their part, this year a number of Houston sites won       the UNESCO Slave Route designation. As an historian of the       African past in the Americas, I have long recognized the role       Galveston played in the African slave trade, filtering newly       imported Africans into the U.S. Southwest. Nor did       Galveston's engagement in that trade end in 1808 when       Congress officially abolished that trade.        This bill will result in the Emancipation National Historic       Trail, which extends approximately 51 miles from the Osterman       Building and Reedy Chapel in Galveston, Texas, along Texas       State Highway 3 and Interstate 45 North to Freedmen's Town,       then to Independence Heights, and Emancipation Park in       Houston, Texas. This trail follows the migration route taken       by newly freed slaves from the major 19th century seaport       town of Galveston to the burgeoning community of Freedmen's       Town, which is now the 4th Ward of Houston, home to the 18th       Congressional District.        The start of the trail is located where General Gordon       Granger sailed into Galveston, Texas, with troops on June 19,       1865, to announce the freedom of the last American slaves.       His announcement belatedly freed 250,000 slaves nearly two       and a half years after Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation       Proclamation. The newly freed slaves traveled from Galveston       to spread the news to neighboring communities.        Should this bill become law it would establish the first       trail in the Southwest United States that recognizes the role       of African Americans in the legacy of freedom in the United       States. An Emancipation Historic Trail designation would       bring long overdue historic recognition due to the role       African Americans played in the building of the today's       Houston and the state of Texas. In addition, the revenue       generated by people who come to visit the area and walk this       trail will result in tourism dollars to the city of Houston       and the adjoining areas.        This August I will attend the meeting of the UNESCO       International Scientific Committee for the Slave Route       Project in Cotonou, Benin, where we will celebrate the 25th       anniversary of the project and where I will be proud to       report on the successes in Texas. I hope that the passage of       this bill will be an additional item to celebrate.            Sincerely,      Jane Landers,        Gertrude Conaway Vanderbilt Chair of History, Vanderbilt       University, Director, Slave Societies Digital Archive,       Member, UNESCO International Scientific Committee for the       Slave Route Project.                                   ____       Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee: The Kohrville       Community Amos Cemetery Association endorses H.R. 434, the       Emancipation National Historic Trail Act, which had a hearing       before the Subcommittee on April 2, 2019.        The Amos Cemetery is the oldest African-American burial       ground in the Kohrville community. Amos Cemetery is a       significant part of Texas history by awarding it an Official       Texas Historical Marker. The designation honors the cemetery       as an important and educational part of local history. In       1881, former enslaved blacks from Alabama and Mississippi       settled the area located on Cypress Creek. The Kohrville       community, centered on farming, ranching and lumber       industries, and offered schools for black students. Families       that established this community are buried here as history is       preserved by the Kohrville Community Amos Cemetery       Association.        This bill will result in the Emancipation National Historic       Trail, which extends approximately 51 miles from the Osterman       Building and Reedy Chapel in Galveston, Texas, along Texas       State Highway 3 and Interstate 45 North to Freedmen's Town,       then to Independence Heights, and Emancipation Park in       Houston, Texas. This trail follows the migration route taken       by newly freed slaves from the major 19th century seaport       town of Galveston to the burgeoning community of Freedmen's       Town, which is now the 4th Ward of Houston, home to the 18th       Congressional District.

Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee: This letter is       written to advise you that the Freedmen's Town Preservation       Coalition was established in June 2014 to preserve and       protect historical sites and properties. We therefore,       enthusiastically endorse H.R. 434, the Emancipation National       Historic Trail Act, which had a hearing before the       Subcommittee on April 2, 2019.        FTPC is a grassroots citizens-based organization that saw a       problem with the destruction of historical cultural sites and       properties in Freedmen's Town, the first place for settlement       of formerly enslaved Africans. The trail of Freedom led to       establishment of Freedmen's Town. FTPC stopped the       destruction and removal of the historic bricks that were       made, paid for and laid by freedmen and their descendants by       first, developing an awareness campaign, secondly, placing a       human body in the hole of destruction and finally, through       legal action. Hence, as you can see, we recognize that       preservation must happen and thusly, we are delighted with       your proposed action to establish an Emancipation National       Historic Trail.        This bill will result in the Emancipation National Historic       Trail, which extends approximately 51 miles from the Osterman       Building and Reedy Chapel in Galveston, Texas, along Texas       State Highway 3 and Interstate 45 North to Freedmen's Town,       then to Independence Heights, and Emancipation Park in       Houston, Texas. This trail follows the migration route taken       by newly freed slaves from the major 19th century seaport       town of Galveston to the burgeoning community of Freedmen's       Town, which is now the 4th Ward of Houston, home to the 18th       Congressional District.

[[Page H7356]]                                          ____      Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee: The Houston       Association of Black Psychologists (HABPsi) endorses H.R.       434, the Emancipation National Historic Trail Act, which had       a hearing before the Subcommittee on April 2, 2019.        As a group of mental health professionals, HABPsi is of the       opinion that the recognition of the Emancipation National       Historic Trail would extend further the redemption of people       of African descent who continue to live with the legacy of       enslavement to this day. Even after more than 150 years since       the Emancipation Proclamation, African Americans experience       mental, emotional and spiritual pain from the experience of       generations of enslavement. Acknowledgement of slavery ending       . . . of free men, women and children walking away is a       powerful remembrance.        This bill will result in the Emancipation National Historic       Trail, which extends approximately 51 miles from the Osterman       Building and Reedy Chapel in Galveston, Texas, along Texas       State Highway 3 and Interstate 45 North to Freedmen's Town,       then to Independence Heights, and Emancipation Park in       Houston, Texas.

Sheila Jackson Lee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee: On behalf of the       Board of Directors, staff and community of historic       Independence Heights. we are pleased to offer this letter       supporting the establishment of the National Emancipation       Heritage Trail. We are excited about this effort and have       been engaged to assure all of our local churches, businesses       and community groups join us as we endorse H.R. 434: the       Emancipation National Historic Trail Act, referenced in a       hearing held before the Subcommittee on April 2, 2019.        As the local convening agency in Independence Heights, we       work everyday to preserve the rich heritage of Independence       Heights, the first municipality established by African       Americans in the State of Texas. This is especially important       to us as we are amongst only a handful of communities       remaining across America that still exist today. We are       hopeful that H.R. 434 will serve as a beacon and give hope to       many other places that are struggling to protect heritage       before it is all erased.        African Americans were tenacious people. After the Civil       War, they united and established settlements and even       incorporated towns in the south amidst racial upheaval and       reconstruction. We are proud f this heritage and are proud to       stand with other communities including Galveston,       Emancipation Park and Freedman's Town in Houston. The passing       of this bill will result in the Emancipation National       Historic Trail, which extends approximately 51 miles from the       Osterman Building and Reedy Chapel in Galveston, Texas, along       Texas State Highway 3 and Interstate 45 North to Freedmen's       Town, then to Independence Heights, and Emancipation Park in       Houston, Texas. This trail follows the migration route taken       by newly freed slaves where General Gordon Granger announced       the Emancipation Proclamation on June 19, 1865, freeing the       last American slaves. The newly freed slaves traveled       spreading the news to neighboring communities.        Should this bill become law it would establish the first       trail in the Southwest United States that recognizes the role       of African Americans in the legacy of freedom. It would also       bring awareness highlighting the undertold story of many       African Americans towns and places. In addition, the revenue       generated by people who come to visit the area and walk this       trail will result in tourism dollars to the city of Houston       and the adjoining areas.            Sincerely,      Tanya Debose,        Executive Director, Independence Heights Redevelopment       Council, Inc.                                   ____                                    Emancipation Park Conservancy,                                                      April 2, 2019.      Hon. Deb Haaland,      Chairwoman--House Subcommittee National Parks, Forest, and           Public Lands Natural Resources Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Don Young,      Ranking Member--House Subcommittee National Parks, Forest,           and Public Lands Natural Resources Committee, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairwoman Haaland and Ranking Member Young: I write       to express strong support for H.R. 434, the Emancipation       National Historic Trail Act, introduced by Congresswoman       Sheila Jackson Lee. Enactment of this bill will make possible       an Emancipation National Historic Trail, which will extend 51       miles from the historic Osterman Building and Reedy Chapel in       Galveston, Texas, along Highway 3 and Interstate 45, north to       Freedmen's Town and Emancipation Park in Houston, Texas. This       trail follows the migration route taken by newly-freed slaves       from the Galveston, Texas a major nineteenth century port to       the vibrant settlement of Freedmen's Town, which is today the       Fourth Ward of Houston, in the 18th Congressional District.        The Emancipation National Historic Trail would be the first       trail in the southwest United States that recognizes the role       of African Americans in the legacy of freedom in the United       States. An Emancipation Historic Trail designation would       bring national recognition to a period of history when our       nation took significant strides to make real the promise of       our nation's founding documents attesting to the rights of       all to live free.        Sparked by the desire to have a place to commemorate the       anniversary of their emancipation, known as Juneteenth,       former slaves and community members in the Third and Fourth       Wards led by Reverend Jack Yates, Richard Allen, Richard       Brock, and Reverend Elias Dibble united to raise $1,000 in       1872 to purchase 10 acres of park land to host Juneteenth       Celebrations. Emancipation Park is the most historic and       culturally significant park in the city of Houston and was       formerly one of the only communal spaces for Blacks in       Houston. Over the years, Emancipation Park's immediate       surrounding area experienced an economic boom, where many       Black owned and frequented businesses, financial institutions       and venues flourished in Houston's Third Ward. Emancipation       Park is significant, not only as a ritual of remembrance and       celebration, but also as an early act of exercising the       rights of property ownership, commerce and cooperative       economics amongst Blacks, which were formerly denied, known       in our nation's founding documents as ``life, liberty, and       the pursuit of happiness''. The Emancipation National       Historic Trail would serve as an invaluable opportunity to       share rich cultural, social, historical and economic strides       that have shaped society in the past and present. Thank you       for your consideration in this designation.            Sincerely,                                                  Ramon Manning,                                                     Board Chairman,      Emancipation Park Conservancy.                                   ____                                                     Freedmen's Town                                              Advisory Committee,                                         Houston, TX, July 20, 2019.      Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Jackson Lee: The Freedmen's Town       Advisory Committee would like to express our enthusiastic       support for H.R. 434, the Emancipation National Historic       Trail Act, which had a hearing before the Subcommittee on       April 2, 2019.        The Freedmen's Town Advisory Committee was established by       Mayor Sylvester Turner to help preserve the historical       integrity of Freedmen's Town for the benefit of generations       to come. Historians have stated that Freedmen's Town is       potentially the ``largest linear architectural footprint       still preserved in America'' of black urban life during the       post-slavery Reconstruction era.        The Committee has worked to promote Freedmen's Town and       bring international recognition from the United Nations       Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization to the       area. As a result of this collaboration, multiple sites       located on the proposed Trail have been designated as ``Sites       of Memory Associated to the UNESCO Slave Route Project''.        This bill will result in the Emancipation National Historic       Trail, which extends approximately 51 miles from the Osterman       Building and Reedy Chapel in Galveston, Texas, along Texas       State Highway 3 and Interstate 45 North to Freedmen's Town,       then to Independence Heights, and Emancipation Park in       Houston, Texas. This trail follows the migration route taken       by newly freed slaves from the major 19th century seaport       town of Galveston to the burgeoning community of Freedmen's       Town, which is now the 4th Ward of Houston, home to the 18th       Congressional District.        The start of the trail is located where General Gordon       Granger sailed into Galveston, Texas, with troops on June 19,       1865, to announce the freedom of the last American slaves.       His announcement belatedly freed 250,000 slaves nearly two       and a half years after Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation       Proclamation. The newly freed slaves traveled from Galveston       to spread the news to neighboring communities. Should this       bill become  [[Page H7357]]       law it would establish the first trail in the Southwest       United States that recognizes the role of African Americans       in the legacy of freedom in the United States.        An Emancipation Historic Trail designation would bring long       overdue historic recognition to the role African Americans       played in the building of today's Houston and the state of       Texas. In addition, the revenue generated by people who come       to visit the area and walk this trail will result in tourism       dollars to the city of Houston and the adjoining areas.

Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Jackson Lee: With this letter, The       Houston Freedmen's Town Conservancy would like to express our       enthusiastic support for H.R. 434, the Emancipation National       Historic Trail Act, which had a hearing before the       Subcommittee on April 2, 2019.        The Houston Freedmen's Town Conservancy is a 501(c)(3) non-      profit corporation that was established to protect and       preserve the history of Freedmen's Town for the benefit of       future generations. Freedmen's Town was listed on the       National Register of Historic Places in 1985, by the U.S.       Department of Interior, and some of the historic sites       located in this ``Mother Ward'' as it is commonly known, were       recognized in March, 2019 by the United Nations Educational,       Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Seven of these       historic sites, all located along the proposed Historic       Trail, have been designated as ``Sites of Memory Associated       with the UNESCO Slave Route Project''.        This bill will result in the Emancipation National Historic       Trail, which extends approximately 51 miles from the Osterman       Building and Reedy Chapel in Galveston, Texas, along Texas       State Highway 3 and Interstate 45 North to Freedmen's Town,       then to Independence Heights, and Emancipation Park in       Houston, Texas. This trail follows the migration route taken       by newly freed slaves from the major 19th century seaport       town of Galveston to the burgeoning community of Freedmen's       Town, which is now the 4th Ward of Houston, home to the 18th       Congressional District.        The start of the trail is located where General Gordon       Granger sailed into Galveston, Texas, with troops on June 19,       1865, to announce the freedom of the last American slaves.       His announcement belatedly freed 250,000 slaves nearly two       and a half years after Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation       Proclamation. The newly freed slaves traveled from Galveston       to spread the news to neighboring communities. Should this       bill become law it would establish the first trail in the       Southwest United States that recognizes the role of African       Americans in the legacy of freedom in the United States.        An Emancipation Historic Trail designation would bring long       overdue historic recognition due to the role African       Americans played in the building of today's Houston and the       state of Texas. In addition, the revenue generated by people       who come to visit the area and walk this trail will result in       tourism dollars to the city of Houston and the adjoining       areas.            Warm Regards,                                                      Eileen Lawal,                                      Board of Directors President.     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to  me. I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 434 enthusiastically. We look  forward to the history being told for all to know, to appreciate, and  to understand.   Mr. Speaker, as the author and principal sponsor, I rise today in  strong support of H.R. 434, the ``Emancipation National Historic Trail  Act.''   I thank Chairman Raul M. Grijalva for shepherding this legislation to  the floor.   I also thank Congresswoman Haaland, chair of the Natural Resources  Committee's Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands  for holding the hearing that allowed the Committee to learn of the  strong support enjoyed by H.R. 434, and the hard work of dedicated  historic preservationists to preserve the rich history of former  slaves.   Let me begin by thanking Ms. Naomi Mitchell Carrier of Houston,  Texas, for her stalwart efforts to preserve and share the stories of  newly freed slaves who settled in the Freedmen's Town section of  Houston to begin lives as free persons following the end of the Civil  War.   Ms. Mitchell Carrier is an educator, historian, and author with  expertise in African American music, Texas history, and heritage  tourism.   I also thank Ms. Eileen Lawal for her April 2019 oral testimony  before the Natural Resources Committee, in support of H.R. 434.   Ms. Lawal is the president of Houston Freedmen's Town Conservancy,  whose mission is to protect and preserve the history of Freedmen's Town  for the benefit of future generations.   The work of H.R. 434 will result in the second trail in the United  States that chronicles the experience of African Americans.   Currently, the National Parks Service only has one National Historic  Trail, which centers on the African American experience.   It is the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail, which covers a  54-mile path between Selma and Montgomery, Alabama, was designated a  National Historic Trail in 1966.   The Selma to Montgomery Trail tells an important story about a  pivotal moment in the nation's struggle with turning away from a  history of segregation and toward a future of equality and justice.   Establishment of the Emancipation National Historical Trail will be  the second trail for which that the National Parks Services would have  responsibility, and it will tell the story of African Americans and  will preserve for future generations the rich history of the newly- freed slaves who journeyed to Houston in search of economic and  political opportunity, and greater religious and cultural freedom.   It is a remarkable story and one that all Americans can be proud to  share with the world.   The Emancipation National Historic Trail Act would pave the way for  the establishment of only the second nationally-recognized historic  trail that chronicles the experience of African Americans in their  struggle for equality and justice.   H.R. 434, the Emancipation National Historical Trail Act, designates  as a national historic trail the 51 miles from the historic Osterman  Building and Reedy Chapel in Galveston, Texas, along Highway 3 and  Interstate 45, north to Freedmen's Town and Emancipation Park in  Houston, Texas.   H.R. 434 requires that we study the post-Civil War history of newly- freed slaves in a major slave holding state following the largest  military campaign waged on domestic soil in the history of the United  Sates.   This period is more than just a story about the North's victory and  the South's loss--it is a story about a newly-freed people emerging  from over 250 years of slavery and how they survived into the 21st  century when other similarly situated communities did not.   In his Second Inaugural Address President Abraham Lincoln declared  that slavery was America's Original Sin:         Yet, if God wills that it continue [The Civil War] until       all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty       years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop       of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn       with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so       still it must be said ``the judgments of the Lord are true       and righteous altogether.''    The bloody civil war was one phrase often used by battlefield  survivors to describe what it was--blood, suffering, tears, and death,  but from this struggle came a new birth of freedom for millions of  former slaves.   There were thousands of communities comprised of freed slaves  throughout the United States--although most of these communities were  found in the South, they could also be found in the North, South, and  Midwestern sections of the country.   Newly-freed slaves held malice toward none, including former slave  owners.   But the same could not be said for those who once owned slaves.   Through economic hardship, natural disasters, and the period of 1919- 1921 called the ``Burnings,'' dozens of communities ceased to exist.   The City of Houston is fortunate that much of this early history of  former slaves has survived to this day: Freedmen's Town, Independence  Heights, and the Emancipation Park areas, which are treasures in our  nation's history.   Freedmen's Town survived where other communities did not, and it is  the only surviving 19th century community built by former slaves to  have a notable number of original structures that have been protected,  preserved, or restored.   Freedmen's Town became the center of opportunity for freed slaves  throughout the Houston area.   By 1915, over 400 African American-owned businesses existed there.   By 1920 one-third of Houston's 85,000 people lived in Freedmen's  Town.   Freedmen's Town is a recognized Historic District.   Emancipation Park was established in 1872 and is Texas's oldest  public park.   After emancipation, Freedmen's Town became one of the only  sanctuaries for freed persons in Houston, Texas.   Today, Freedmen's Town hosts an impressive number of post-Civil War  surviving structures--which include homes, public buildings, and  commercial spaces built by former slaves.   The Freedmen's Town community has fought to preserve structures,  unique construction features, and period materials which are unique in  their continued presence as originally installed.   One such struggle was the work to preserve handmade red brick street  in Freedmen's  [[Page H7358]]  Town that streets would have been destroyed had community leaders and  preservationists not fought and succeeded in winning needed  infrastructure improvements, and the re-installation of the period  bricks onto the street.   There are concerns that Texas Department of Transportation's  announced highway improvements on I-45 in the City of Houston would  impact the historic areas of Independence Heights before the study  directed by this bill could begin.   The reason the National Parks Service exists is to preserve the  public lands for all to use and enjoy.   The nation has invested a great deal in protecting national parks and  historic places due to their unique beauty, typographical features, or  historic relevance.   The stories that make up the American experience have, for far too  long, been limited to those of one group of Americans.   The limited view of what is of value or interest to the American  public has changed with the establishment of a Native American History  Museum and most recently the opening of the National African American  History and Culture on the Mall.   The ``whites-only'' version of American history must end and at the  same time we can make room for other American stories.   In 1915, the first suggestion of creating an African American History  Museum came from African American Union veterans of the Civil War.   By 1988, Congressmen John Lewis and Mickey Leland introduced  legislation for a stand-alone African American history museum within  the Smithsonian Institution.   Their bill faced significant opposition in Congress due to its cost.   Supporters of the African American museum tried to salvage the  proposal by suggesting that the Native Indian museum (then moving  through Congress) and African American museum share the same space.   But the compromise did not work, and Congress took no further action  on the bill.   In 2001, Congressman Lewis and Congressman J.C. Watts reintroduced  legislation for a museum in the House of Representatives which became  law, creating a federal commission to study the idea of an African  American Museum near Capitol Hill.   After completing a 2-year study the Commission determined that an  African American history museum would be of substantial benefit to the  nation.   In 1994, despite winning approval in both House and Senate  committees, the bill died once more, due to opposition by North  Carolina Senator Jesse Helms, who refused to allow the legislation to  come to the Senate floor despite bipartisan support.   In 2003, the House passed the ``National Museum of African American  History and Culture Act,'' which passed the Senate and was signed into  law by President George W. Bush.   On September 24, 2016, the National Museum of African American  History and Culture (NMAAHC) opened its doors after 13 years of  planning, and construction and over a hundred years of struggle to see  the history of former slaves as part of the complex of museums on the  Capital Mall began in 1915.   The success of the National Museum of African American History and  Culture reveals the hunger in the nation and across the world for  authentic stories from our past.   Since its opening the NMAAHC has generated a sustained demand for  tickets, an unprecedented problem for a museum--where interest far  outstrips capacity to accommodate visitors.   About three million people have already visited the NMAAHC, which is  the newest museum in the Smithsonian Institution and houses close to  37,000 rare artifacts within three stories.   Not only is demand for tickets high, according to the museum's  associate director, so is the amount of time visitors spend in the  museum once they get in.   The museum's associate director told NPR.com that while most venues  have a ``dwell'' time of an hour and 45 minutes to two hours, visitors  are spending up to six hours exploring. It's already an important part  of many people's list of things to do in Washington, D.C.''   There is a hunger in the nation for stories about African Americans  from our past that link us to our present and act as guideposts to our  future.   This is a momentous opportunity--one that fires the imagination for  fully telling the American story from the voices and perspectives of  all of our nation's citizens.   The richness of these diverse stories is found in Houston's African  American historic areas.   These areas of Houston tell the story of many peoples who are part of  our nation's history by filling in gaps of the story of the United  States that too many Americans do not know or understand because these  stories are now being taught as part of American history.   It is important to ensure that the public trust to preserve our  nation's history is also a commitment to preserving all of its history,  including that which reflects both its best and worst moments.   By way of example, when I was a young girl, I learned the story of  Crispus Attucks--a key figure in our nation's history who on the eve of  the American Revolution lost his life during a protest of British rule  prior to the start of the Revolutionary War.   However, Crispus Attucks was not the sole person of African descent  who wanted to see freedom from British rule--he fought for the United  States and was joined by thousands of other persons of African descent  who participated in the Revolutionary War.   Over time the history of the American War for Independence is  revealing a tapestry of diversity that had not been well understood.   In the 1980s the daughters of the American Revolution initially would  not accept black women as members until one stood up and took a stand.   According to a March 1984 story in the Washington Post, Lena Lorraine  Santos Ferguson, a retired school secretary, was denied membership in a  Washington, D.C. chapter of the DAR because she was black.   Her two white sponsors, Margaret M. Johnston and Elizabeth E.  Thompson, were shocked at Ms. Ferguson's rejection.   Ms. Ferguson met the lineage requirements and could trace her  ancestry to Jonah Gay, a white man who fought in Maine.   When the reason for not admitting Ms. Ferguson became known, the  public reaction was swift and negative.   The Daughters of the American Revolution revisited their denial of  Ms. Ferguson, and upon reconsideration accepted her as a member, making  her the first of many women of color who became members of the  organization.   The history of the United States is more complex and immensely richer  than would be apparent if we only consider the history of one group of  people.   The tenacity demonstrated and the focus on historical accuracy and  the need to save what is a unique aspect of American history for future  generations is important.   For this reason, I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  vote in support of H.R. 434.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following  letters in support of H.R. 434, the Emancipation National Historic  Trail Act:                                                City of Houston,                                        Houston, TX, March 26, 2019.      Hon. Raul M. Grijalva,      Chairman, Natural Resources Committee,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grijalva: I write today to express my support       of Representative Sheila Jackson Lee's bill, H.R. 434, the       Emancipation National Historic Trail Act. Passage of this       bill will pave the way for the Emancipation National Historic       Trail, which will extend approximately 51 miles from the       Osterman Building and Reedy Chapel in Galveston, Texas, along       Texas State Highway 3 and Interstate 45 North to Freedmen's       Town and Emancipation Park in Houston, Texas. This trail       follows the migration route taken by newly freed slaves from       the major 19th century seaport town of Galveston to the       burgeoning community of Freedmen's Town, which is now the 4th       Ward of Houston, home to the 18th Congressional District.        The start of the trail is located where General Gordon       Granger rode into Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865, to       announce the freedom of the last American slaves. His       announcement belatedly freed 250,000 slaves nearly two and a       half years after Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.       The newly freed slaves traveled from Galveston to spread the       news to neighboring communities.        The Emancipation National Historic Trail would be the first       trail in the Southwest United States that recognizes the role       that African Americans in the legacy of freedom in the United       States. An Emancipation Historic Trail designation would       bring long overdue historic recognition due to the role       African Americans played in the building of the today's       Houston and the state of Texas. In addition, the revenue       generated by people who come to visit the area and walk this       trail will result in tourism dollars to the city of Houston       and the surrounding area. I urge you to pass this bill to       create the Emancipation National Historic Trail.            Sincerely,                                                  Sylvester Turner,                                                             Mayor.                                   ____                                                                                  Kinder Foundation,                                         Houston, TX, July 22, 2019.      Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee: The Kinder       Foundation endorses H.R. 434, the Emancipation National       Historic Trail Act, which had a hearing before the       Subcommittee on April 2, 2019.        The Kinder Foundation actively supports the community       development and preservation of the historic Freedmen's Town       and Third Ward in Houston, Texas, which has a direct       relationship and serves as a key location in H.R. 434, the       Emancipation National Historic Trail Act. The Kinder       Foundation is participating in planning efforts for       Freedmen's Town and provided early funding for the renovation       of Emancipation Park located in Third Ward. Emancipation Park       began as 10 acres of land purchased in 1872, by Reverend Jack       Yates, Richard Allen, Richard Brock, and Reverend Elias       Dibble to serve as a gathering place for former slaves living       in the Third and Fourth Wards to commemorate the anniversary       of their emancipation (``Juneteenth''). The Kinder Foundation       also actively supports the Emancipation Park Conservancy to       further programming and operations at Emancipation Park, as       well as the Emancipation Community Development Partnership       and the Emancipation Economic Development Council in an       effort to revitalize the area through affordable housing and       education initiatives. Passing H.R. 434, will have an       enormous impact and be a major contribution towards the       historical and cultural preservation of three of Houston's       most historically significant neighborhoods.        This bill will result in the Emancipation National Historic       Trail, which extends approximately 51 miles from the Osterman       Building and Reedy Chapel in Galveston, Texas, along Texas       State Highway 3 and Interstate 45 North to Freedmen's Town,       then to Independence Heights, and Emancipation Park in       Houston, Texas. This trail follows the migration route taken       by newly freed slaves from the major 19th century seaport       town of Galveston to the burgeoning community of Freedmen's       Town, which is now the 4th Ward of Houston, home to the 18th       Congressional District.        The start of the trail is located where General Gordon       Granger sailed into Galveston, Texas, with troops on June 19,       1865, to announce the freedom of the last American slaves.       His announcement belatedly freed 250,000 slaves nearly two       and a half years after Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation       Proclamation. The newly freed slaves traveled from Galveston       to spread the news to neighboring communities.        Should this bill become law it would establish the first       trail in the Southwest United States that recognizes the role       of African Americans in the legacy of freedom in the United       States. An Emancipation Historic Trail designation would       bring long overdue historic recognition due to the role       African Americans played in the building of the today's       Houston and the state of Texas. In addition, the revenue       generated by people who come to visit the area and walk this       trail will result in tourism dollars to the city of Houston       and the adjoining areas.            Sincerely,                                                   Nancy G. Kinder,                                                   President & CEO.                                   ____                                                                                Rutherford B. H. Yates                                                    Museum, Inc.,                                                        Houston, TX.      Hon. Shiela Jackson Lee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee: The Rutherford B H       Yates Museum, Inc. endorses H.R. 434, the Emancipation       National Historic Trail Act, which had a hearing before the       Subcommittee on April 2, 2019.        The Rutherford B H Yates Museum, Inc. believes that the       approval of H.R. 434 will be the first major step toward the       goal for the 40 block Freedmen's Town National Register       Historic Place-TCP and its related sites, to become U.S.       National Landmarks and ultimately to receive UNESCO-World       Heritage Cite recognition. In March 2019, the first six (6)       of the (74) sites that RBHYates Museum, Inc. had nominated in       2016, have been awarded as ``Sites of Memory Associated with       the UNESCO-Slave Route''. We continue to submit documents for       consideration of the nominated sites, in the UNESCO-Slave       Route process.        This bill will result in the Emancipation National Historic       Trail, which extends approximately 51 miles from the Osterman       Building and Reedy Chapel in Galveston, Texas, along Texas       State Highway 3 and Interstate 45 North to include the       Freedmen's Town National Register Historic Place-TCP, then to       Independence Heights, and Emancipation Park in Houston,       Texas. This trail follows a migration route taken by       previously enslaved peoples from the major 19th century       seaport town of Galveston to the founding of the earliest       Urban settlement of Freedmen's Town-4th Ward, Houston, home       to the 18th Congressional District.        The start of the trail is located where General Gordon       Granger sailed into Galveston, Texas, with troops on June 19,       1865, to announce the freedom of the last American slaves.       His announcement belatedly freed slaves nearly two and a half       years after Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. The       newly freed slaves traveled from Galveston and from       Plantations throughout Texas. to other cities and states in       search of family members who had been previously sold into       slavery, and to spread the news of freedom to neighboring       communities.        The Emancipation National Historic Trail Act would bring       long overdue historic recognition for the role African       Americans played in the building of Houston and Texas. In       addition, the revenue generated by heritage cultural tourists       who visit and walk this trail will benefit the City of       Houston and the State of Texas.            Sincerely,      Theophilus Herrington, Ph.D.                                   ____                                                The Heritage Society                                             at Sam Houston Park,                                                        Houston, TX.      Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee: The Heritage Society       endorses H.R. 434, the Emancipation National Historic Trail       Act, which had a hearing before the Subcommittee on April 2,       2019.        Since its founding, The Heritage Society, a non-profit       501(c)(3), has acquired and restored ten historic buildings       in the city of Houston. The result is a treasure for our       city, with buildings that tell the stories of how diverse       segments of society lived daily, from freed slaves building       new lives for themselves to prosperous merchant families from       Houston's early years. The Heritage Society is an educational       institution whose mission is to tell the stories of the       diverse history of Houston and Texas through its collections,       exhibitions and programing.        This bill will result in the Emancipation National Historic       Trail, which extends approximately 51 miles from the Osterman       Building and Reedy Chapel in Galveston, Texas, along Texas       State Highway 3 and Interstate 45 North to Freedmen's Town,       then to Independence Heights, and Emancipation Park in       Houston, Texas. This trail follows the migration route taken       by newly freed slaves from the major 19th century seaport       town of Galveston to the burgeoning community of Freedmen's       Town, which is now the 4th Ward of Houston, home to the 18th       Congressional District.        Two of the historic buildings cared for by The Heritage       Society, the Jack Yates House and the 4th Ward Cottage, have       been nominated as ``Sites of Memory'' as part of the UNESCO       Slave Route Project. Obtaining international recognition to       the Jack Yates House signifies its importance as a place that       embodies what is was to be an enslaved African-American, who,       once freed, became a community leader whose lasting impact is       seen today. Recognizing this Historic Trail would truly       provide a larger understanding of how Houston's history is       both unique and  [[Page H7360]]       also very much a part of the larger story of the impact of       enslavement of African Americans in the United States.        Should this bill become law it would establish the first       trail in the Southwest United States that recognizes the role       of African Americans in the legacy of freedom in the United       States. An Emancipation Historic Trail designation would       bring long overdue historic recognition due to the role       African Americans played in the building of the today's       Houston and the state of Texas. In addition, the revenue       generated by people who come to visit the area and walk this       trail will result in tourism dollars to the city of Houston       and the adjoining areas.            Sincerely,                                                    Alison A. Bell,      Executive Director.                                   ____       Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee: The Texas Center for       African American Living History endorses H.R. 434, the       Emancipation National Historic Trail Act, which had a hearing       before the Subcommittee on April 2, 2019.        Owing to my research to document historic sites and markers       from Galveston to Houston Freedmen's National Historic       District, I, Naomi Carrier, develop a written testimony that       has become a part of the historical record for H.R. 434, as       expressed in this excerpt from Congresswoman, Sheila Jackson       Lee:         ``As the founder and CEO of Texas Center for African       American Living History, your insight will be beneficial to       the effort to see H.R. 434 become law. In the past thirty       years, you have endeavored to bring a fresh perspective to       Texas History through performance art and education. If you       will prepare written remarks in support of the bill, I will       see that your written statement is placed into the record for       the hearing and that you will be recognized. There will also       be a seat for you to observe this historic hearing. I ask       that you plan to attend, you should plan to arrive the       evening before or the morning of the hearing to allow us an       opportunity to speak before the hearing begins.        Your written testimony is welcomed and appreciated.        Very truly yours,        Sheila Jackson Lee        Member of Congress''         This bill will result in the Emancipation National Historic       Trail, which extends approximately 51 miles from the Osterman       Building and Reedy Chapel in Galveston, Texas, along Texas       State Highway 3 and Interstate 45 North to Freedmen's Town,       then to Independence Heights, and Emancipation Park in       Houston, Texas. This trail follows the migration route taken       by newly freed slaves from the major 19th century seaport       town of Galveston to the burgeoning community of Freedmen's       Town, which is now the 4th Ward of Houston, home to the 18th       Congressional District.        The start of the trail is located where General Gordon       Granger sailed into Galveston, Texas, with troops on June 19,       1865, to announce the freedom of the last American slaves.       His announcement belatedly freed 250,000 slaves nearly two       and a half years after Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation       Proclamation. The newly freed slaves traveled from Galveston       to spread the news to neighboring communities. Should this       bill become law it would establish the first trail in the       Southwest United States that recognizes the role of African       Americans in the legacy of freedom in the United States. An       Emancipation Historic Trail designation would bring long       overdue historic recognition due to the role African       Americans played in the building of the today's Houston and       the state of Texas. In addition, the revenue generated by       people who come to visit the area and walk this trail will       result in tourism dollars to the city of Houston and the       adjoining areas.        My research gathered over the past 30 years will be an       invaluable asset to the National Park Service in the study of       the Trail and relevant 19th and early 20th century historic       sites in the surrounding areas.

Re H.R. 434, the Emancipation National Historic Trail Act       Hon. Deb Haaland,      Chairwoman, House Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and           Public Lands, Natural Resources Committee, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairwoman Haaland: On behalf of the Boards of       Directors for Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone Number       Fourteen, City of Houston, Texas (``TIRZ #14'') and Fourth       Ward Redevelopment Authority (the ``Authority''), please       allow this correspondence to serve as our expression of       support for H.R. 434, the Emancipation National Historic       Trail Act, introduced by Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee.        It is our understanding that the enactment of this bill       will make possible an Emancipation National Historic Trail       which will extend 51 miles from the historic Osterman       Building and Reedy Chapel in Galveston, Texas along Highway 3       and Interstate 45 north to Freedman's Town and Emancipation       Park located in Houston, Texas. The trail will follow the       migration route taken by newly-freed slaves from Galveston,       Texas, a major nineteenth century port, to the vibrant       settlement of Freedmen's Town which today is also referenced       as the Fourth Ward Houston within the 18th Congressional       District.        The Emancipation National Historic Trail would be the first       trail in the southwest region of the United States that       recognizes the role of African Americans in the legacy of       freedom in the United States. An Emancipation Historic Trail       designation would bring national recognition to the period of       time when our nation took significant strides to make real       the promise of our nation's founding documents attesting to       the rights of all men to live free.        Freedmen's Town is contained within the boundaries of TIRZ       #14 and within our zone we have significant structures that       are directly related to the founders of Emancipation Park. Of       note are the historic brick streets that were laid by freed       slaves; Bethel Church founded by Jack Yates which has been       restored as an open space park; and The African American       Library at Gregory School which originally served as the       first public school for black students. Antioch Missionary       Baptist Church, the oldest African American church in Houston       (1876) whereby Jack Yates served as pastor still resides in       the historic boundaries of Freedmen's Town just east of the       TIRZ boundaries.        Through our project plan that directs TIRZ #14 to allocate       its funds to historical preservation, among other designated       projects, the Authority has set its priorities on preserving       and renovating the institutional vestiges of Freedman's Town       to assure that for generations to come the story of the       African-American experience in Houston can be retold and       personally experienced. We strongly believe that The       Emancipation National Historic Trail will lend itself to act       as the impetus by which the nation will come to know and       experience the tenacity and strength of the freed slave to       build, thrive and prosper in its own community.        Therefore, it is an honor to lend our support to the H.R.       434, The Emancipation National Historic Trail Act.            Very truly yours,                                                 Jacqueline Bostic,      Chair.                                   ____                                    Emancipation Park Conservancy,                                                      April 2, 2019.      Hon. Deb Haaland,      Chairwoman, House Subcommittee National Parks, Forest, and           Public Lands, Natural Resources Committee, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Don Young,      Ranking Member, House Subcommittee National Parks, Forest,           and Public Lands, Natural Resources Committee,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Haaland and Ranking Member Young: I write       to express strong support for H.R. 434, the Emancipation       National Historic Trail Act, introduced by Congresswoman       Sheila Jackson Lee. Enactment of this bill will make possible       an Emancipation National Historic Trail, which will extend 51       miles from the historic Osterman Building and Reedy Chapel in       Galveston, Texas, along Highway 3 and Interstate 45, north to       Freedmen's Town and Emancipation Park in Houston, Texas. This       trail follows the migration route taken by newly-freed slaves       from the Galveston, Texas a major nineteenth century port to       the vibrant settlement of Freedmen's Town, which is today the       Fourth Ward of Houston, in the 18th Congressional District.        The Emancipation National Historic Trail would be the first       trail in the southwest United States that recognizes the role       of African Americans in the legacy of freedom in the United       States. An Emancipation Historic Trail designation would       bring national recognition to a period of history when our       nation took significant strides to make real the promise of       our nation's founding documents attesting to the rights of       all to live free.        Sparked by the desire to have a place to commemorate the       anniversary of their emancipation, known as Juneteenth,       former slaves and community members in the Third and Fourth       Wards led by Reverend Jack Yates, Richard Allen, Richard       Brock, and Reverend Elias Dibble united to raise $1,000 in       1872 to purchase 10 acres of park land to host Juneteenth       Celebrations. Emancipation Park is the most historic and       culturally significant park in the city of Houston and was       formerly one of the only communal spaces for Blacks in       Houston. Over the years, Emancipation Park's immediate       surrounding area experienced an economic boom, where many       Black owned and frequented businesses, financial institutions       and venues flourished in Houston's Third Ward. Emancipation       Park is significant, not only as a ritual of remembrance and       celebration, but also as an early act of exercising the       rights of property ownership, commerce and cooperative       economics amongst Blacks, which were formerly denied, known       in our nation's founding documents as ``life, liberty, and       the pursuit of happiness''.        The Emancipation National Historic Trail would serve as an       invaluable opportunity to  [[Page H7361]]       share rich cultural, social, historical and economic strides       that have shaped society in the past and present. Thank you       for your consideration in this designation.            Sincerely,                                                  Ramon Manning,       Board Chairman, Emancipation,      Park Conservancy.                                   ____                                                  National Trust for                                           Historic Preservation,                                                     March 29, 2019.      Chairman Raul Grijalva,      Washington, DC.      Ranking Member Rob Bishop,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member Bishop: We       appreciate the opportunity to share our support for H.R. 434,       the Emancipation National Historic Trail Act. The National       Trust enthusiastically endorses this legislation and looks       forward to its enactment in this Congress.          Interests of the National Trust for Historic Preservation         The National Trust for Historic Preservation is a       privately-funded charitable, educational, and nonprofit       organization chartered by Congress in 1949 to ``facilitate       public participation in historic preservation'' and to       further the purposes of federal historic preservation laws.       The intent of Congress was for the National Trust ``to       mobilize and coordinate public interest, participation, and       resources in the preservation and interpretation of sites and       buildings.'' With headquarters in Washington, D.C., nine       field offices, 27 historic sites, more than one million       members and supporters, and a national network of partners in       states, territories, and the District of Columbia, the       National Trust works to save America's historic places and       advocates for historic preservation as a fundamental value in       programs and policies at all levels of government.              H.R. 434, Emancipation National Historic Trail Act         We appreciate Representative Sheila Jackson Lee's       leadership on this legislation to establish the Emancipation       National Historic Trail in the state of Texas. The route       would extend approximately 51 miles from the Osterman       Building and Reedy Chapel in Galveston along Texas State       Highway 3 and Interstate Highway 45 North to Freedmen's Town       and Emancipation Park located in Houston.        The designation of this historic trail-to be administered       by the National Park Service-traces the 19th century       migration route from Galveston to Houston of newly freed       slaves and persons of African descent. On June 19, 1865,       General Gordon Granger arrived at Galveston to announce the       freedom of the last American slaves, which belatedly freed       approximately 250,000 slaves nearly two and a half years       after Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. Their       migration to the community of Freedmen's Town located in the       Fourth Ward of Houston would be codified in this proposed       historic trail designation and further allow the National       Park Service to tell the stories of all Americans.        National Historic Trails administered by the National Park       Service provide an opportunity to recognize, commemorate, and       interpret travel routes of national historic significance       while sharing the significant histories of our nation. We       urge Congressional support of this legislation and look       forward to enactment of H.R. 434.            Sincerely,                                                     Pam Bowman,       Director of Public Lands Policy.                                   ____                                    Emancipation Park Conservancy,                                         Houston, TX, April 2, 2019.

Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committee on  the Budget, I rise in strong support of H.R. 776, the Emergency Medical  Services for Children Program Reauthorization Act of 2019.   The Emergency Medical Services for Children Program (EMSC) reduces  child and youth mortality and morbidity due to severe illness or injury  by increasing awareness among health professionals, providers and  planners, and the general public of the special needs of children  receiving emergency medical care.   Specifically, the EMSC program has provided grants to all states  since I 1985 for the State Partnership, Targeted Issues, State  Partnership Regionalization of Care, and The Pediatric Emergency Care  Applied Research Network.   Additionally, the EMSC program has been used to establish national  resource centers and a pediatric emergency care research network.   Mr. Speaker, the majority of children are treated in community and  rural emergency departments rather than specialized centers such as  large children's hospitals.   As a result, pediatric visits make up less than 20 percent of cases  at emergency departments, so they lack the quality of pediatric  emergency care needed for established practice guidelines.   I support H.R. 776 because Congress has a responsibility to ensure  that every child has access to necessary emergency medical services and  that no child in our nation is left untreated.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 776,  the ``Emergency Medical Services for Children Program Reauthorization  Act of 2019.''    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of both the  Judiciary Committee and the Committee on Homeland Security, I rise in  strong support of H.R. 2507, the ``Newborn Screening Saves Lives  Reauthorization Act of 2019.''   The Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act would yield  major improvements in both the screening and follow up processes  involved in the testing of infants for heritable diseases and  conditions.   In the United States, more than 4,000,000 infants and children are  screened every year, and up to 4,000 of the children test positive for  one or more disease or disorder.   Mr. Speaker, 4,000 conditions detected are 4,000 young lives saved,  as many of the diseases on the uniform screening panel, the list of  conditions that newborns are tested for, are very treatable but can be  deadly if left unaddressed.   However, there is an ever-present need to continue adapting the panel  of conditions that newborns and young children are tested for, as  improvements in technology allow medical professionals to identify new  diseases, sooner.   Mr. Speaker, children and their families should have access to state  of the art testing, and treatments.   H.R. 2507 specifically improves the current Newborn Screening Act in  several ways, including:   Creating new educational strategies and practices regarding the  screening and follow-up treatments for heritable diseases and  conditions;   Creating an advisory committee for heritable diseases in newborns and  children;   Creating a Clearinghouse of newborn screening information;   Improving laboratory quality and surveillance, which includes  implementing new tools, resources and infrastructure, to improve data  analysis, interpretation and lab practices;   Increasing funding for the Hunter Kelly Institute; and   Authorizing $2 million in Appropriations to the National Academy of  Medicine, to fund studies dedicated to further improving the practice  and procedure of the Uniform Screening Panel.   The screening of children has already been proven to be effective,  and improvements and additions to the panel of diseases that are tested  for can only result in more lives being saved.   I urge all members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 2507, the  ``Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2019.''
