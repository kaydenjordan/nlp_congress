 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to apologize to the American  taxpayers for this total sham of a process that the Democrats and this  leadership are trying to spread. They continue to have Trump  derangement syndrome.   Here are the questions I would ask my Democrat colleagues:   If the Democrats are so concerned, then why have we not had a hearing  about the Postal Service issues since June 15 of 2019?   If the Democrats are so concerned, why have we not had round-the- clock meetings to discuss the bill that we intend to fund at $25  billion which is being proposed?   We have been out of session for 17 percent of the time since March  15. Why haven't we been called back in to discuss this?   If you do the math, on $25 billion, and we have got 70 days left,  that is roughly $325 million per day.   You tell the American taxpayer where you are spending that money. You  tell the American taxpayer how we are going to come up with it. You  tell the American taxpayer this is like dropping money from a  helicopter.   If the Democrats are so concerned about the post office, why are we  having to vote today when the Postmaster General is appearing at the  hearing on Monday? This is just like determining the score of a  football game and then playing the game on Monday. It makes no sense.                                time  1430    The Democrats have no interest in hearing the testimony of Mr. DeJoy.  The only thing they want to do is berate and not give the Postmaster  General the opportunity to answer, just like they did Attorney General  Barr, which was a disgrace to this country. The taxpayers deserve  better.   The Democrats will have no discussion on the spying of the President  since 2016.   The Democrats have no explanation of a failed Mueller Report.   The Democrats have no explanation for the impeachment of the  President.   The post office will fail as well.
