 Mr. Speaker, China is the biggest threat  facing America today. The Chinese Communist Party uses its centrally  controlled economy to pick winners and losers through massive  government subsidies and handouts that benefit the ruling party's  political allies. They do not adhere to free-market principles and the  high labor and environmental standards that we have here in America.  This is not a model America should embrace.   We succeed when we reward hard work, creative thinking, risk-taking,  and innovation and ensure that a company's success isn't contingent on  the approval, direction, or spending by the Federal Government.   I support making chips in the United States, but we cannot lead a new  era of innovation through massive government subsidies. We cannot beat  China by trying to outspend them.   The CHIPS bill unlocks the Democrats' radical tax and spending spree  and will make President Biden's inflation crisis worse.   American competitiveness is suffering today as a result of harmful  regulatory barriers and record government spending. This has resulted  in unaffordable, high prices for every family, supply chain issues,  and, as we learned today, the U.S. is entering a recession.   Meanwhile, Democrats' new reconciliation package spends hundreds of  billions of dollars and raises taxes to achieve their grand socialist  agenda for more control and more inflation.   To win the future, we need a reliable regulatory and permitting  environment that unleashes innovation, secures our supply chains, and  ensures American companies are creating jobs right here at home in the  United States of America.   Instead of more radical spending, lifting these barriers must be  central if we want to secure American leadership and beat China.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 4346.
