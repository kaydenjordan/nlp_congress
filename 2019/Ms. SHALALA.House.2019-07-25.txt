 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule and  H.R. 549, the Venezuela TPS Act of 2019, this is lifesaving, bipartisan  legislation to designate TPS for Venezuelans, and I appreciate the  generous remarks of Ranking Member Cole.   The socialist, narco regimes of Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro have  plunged Venezuela into catastrophe. Venezuela was once a thriving  democracy. Now the economy, the health sector, the education system,  and virtually every democratic institution is in ruins. The Venezuelan  economy has completely collapsed, and the inflation is expected to  reach 10 million percent this year.   More than 4 million refugees have fled the continuous worsening  conditions in Venezuelan. They have fled to Colombia, to Brazil, to  Peru, to so many countries, and they have come to the United States,  following the footsteps of millions of refugees before them; those who  have helped make this the greatest country on Earth.                                time  1230    They have come to our shores in search of the freedom, democracy, and  security that the Maduro regime has stolen from them, and so many  Venezuelans have come to south Florida where they have contributed so  much to our diverse community.   In my district, there are approximately 17,000 Venezuelan-born  residents, so this is personal for us. These are our neighbors, our  friends, our students, and our teachers. My constituents cannot safely  return.   As the vote on Tuesday demonstrated, we are ready to take legislative  action to allow Venezuelans to apply for temporary protective status.  TPS has bipartisan support in the House and in the Senate, but now it  is time for the Senate to take this bill up.   Our hope is that passage of this bill in our House will light the  fire under the Senate. Bipartisan TPS legislation has passed through  the Senate committees. Now more than ever, it is time for them to take  it up and to get TPS signed into law.   TPS is a fundamental, literally, lifesaving component to our approach  to the crisis in Venezuela, but TPS alone won't solve the crisis. The  United States and the international community must continue to put  pressure on the regime to facilitate a peaceful change in leadership.  We must expose the corrupt networks that prop up the Maduro government  and meet the urgent basic needs of the poor, the hungry, and the sick.   Because our ultimate goal is to secure a stable and peaceful  transition of power for the Venezuelan people, I want to thank my  Florida colleagues, including lead sponsors Mr. Soto and Mr. Diaz- Balart, as well as Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Debbie Mucarsel-Powell  and also our Puerto Rican colleague, Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon. I also  want to thank Chairman McGovern for his work to help make sure this  bill was included in this rule.   Viva Venezuela.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 549, the  Venezuelan TPS Act of 2019.   And I thank my distinguished colleague from south Florida,  Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart, for his comments and for his coaching  during my first year.   Venezuela was once the richest country in Latin America. Now, the  economy, the health sector, the education system, and virtually every  democratic institution is in ruins because of the Socialist policies of  the evil Maduro regime.   Venezuela is experiencing the largest refugee crisis in the history  of the Western Hemisphere. There are tens of thousands of Venezuelan- born residents in south Florida--17,000 in my district alone. My  constituents cannot safely return to a country in chaos.   This is why TPS was created. As the vote on Tuesday demonstrated,  this Congress is ready to allow Venezuelans to apply for TPS. TPS has  bipartisan support in the House and in the Senate. It is time for the  Senate to take this bill up.   TPS is a fundamental component in our approach to the crisis in  Venezuela, but it will not alone solve the crisis. The United States  and the international community must continue to put pressure on the  regime to facilitate a peaceful change in leadership, because our  ultimate goal is to secure a stable and peaceful transition of power  for the Venezuelan people.                                time  1530
