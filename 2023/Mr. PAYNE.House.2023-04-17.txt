 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 106th  anniversary of Abyssinian Baptist Church.   For 106 years, the Abyssinian Baptist Church has helped thousands of  people find salvation and spiritual health. It  [[Page H1742]]  serves the community through faith-based initiatives and brings hope to  residents who need it. The spirit of this congregation is represented  in one of the church's original names.   In 1939, the church was called Friendship Baptist. It is through  friendships that this congregation shows how much it cares about  people.   In addition, it inspires the community with a strong dedication to  serving the Lord our Savior. In the process, it has helped thousands of  people who have walked crooked roads to find a straight path.   Congratulations again to Deacon James Destin and the pious  congregation of Abyssinian Baptist Church. It is an exceptional faith- based community in my district.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida and the  gentleman from Illinois for leading this Special Order hour, which is a  great responsibility given to them by the chairman of this body.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the recent expulsion of two  elected members of the Tennessee Legislature and the threat this action  poses for American democracy.   On April 6, two Black elected officials, Justin Jones and Justin  Pearson, as we all know, were expelled from the Tennessee State  Legislature. They were involved in peaceful protests to demand  legislators pass stricter gun laws in the State.   Why they were engaged in that peaceful protest is because their  colleagues had tried to silence them so many times during normal  debate, in committee, and on the floor of the Tennessee Legislature  that they finally had to take these actions in order to be heard. They  were expelled because of that protest.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of those young men. They stood up for what  they felt was right, and they took their opportunity, as elected  officials of that body, to be heard. If it took rebellion to be heard,  a megaphone to be heard on the floor, then that is what they had to do.   I was honored to be part of something similar that the Congressional  Black Caucus led on this floor not too many years ago. I see my  colleague Joyce Beatty and my colleague Yvette Clarke here. They were  both part of that rebellion. We sat down on the House floor, which is  against the rules.   We sat down because of the same issue these young men spoke up for:  gun violence. We were tired. John Lewis led us, as he had done so many  times before, and we sat right down on that floor and held the House of  Representatives for over 24 hours.   Our colleagues tried to come back and disrupt us and scare us, but we  were unbowed. We continued to hold this floor until we had people  understand that we were serious about this.   Our children are being killed all over this Nation, and the  unfortunate thing that happens with so many of my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle is that, until it happens in their community,  until it happens to their friends, until it happens to their family,  they don't want to talk about it. Let it happen in their community and  to their friends and to their family, and then we have to do something.   It is just like the fentanyl problem, a major problem in this country  now.  [[Page H1746]]  Urban communities screamed about the opioid issue for 20 years, and  nobody did anything. Now that it is impacting their families, it is a  major health issue.   We have to understand that all issues in this country should be  looked at in that manner. These young men were brave and articulate. It  made sense for them to protest the horrible and unnecessary gun  violence that occurs every day in this country.   In March, a former student entered the Covenant School in Nashville  and killed three students and three adults. The school was part of  Nashville's Covenant Presbyterian Church. Like millions of Americans,  Tennessee residents are sick and tired of gun violence.   I have many Members behind me, so I will not belabor the point, but,  Mr. Speaker, when are we going to address this issue?   The majority of the people in this country say they are willing to  have reasonable gun background checks to make sure criminals or people  with mental illness do not have these weapons because we are finding  many times those are the people that are having these issues.   Why can't we deal with that? It is not unreasonable. Every American  has a Second Amendment right to own a gun, but we should make sure we  keep guns out of certain people's hands. That is what we need to do.                                time  2000    Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), from the Third District.
