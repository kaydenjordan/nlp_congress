 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Boy Scout Troop 14 of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, on its centennial  celebration.   Troop 14 is the oldest consecutively chartered troop in the  Susquehanna Council Boy Scouts of America. Saint John's-Newberry United  Methodist Church has been its sponsor for these 100 years.   Troop 14 has provided scouting to boys in Newberry and the  surrounding area. Impressively, the troop has produced 127 Eagle Scouts  during that time. It has been through the efforts of many that the  troop has been and continues to be an active and strong unit. For 100  years, Troop 14 has helped scores of Boy Scouts build a more  conscientious, responsible, and productive society.   The Boy Scouts of America is one of the Nation's largest and most  prominent values-based youth development organizations, providing  programs for young people that build character, train them in the  responsibilities of participating citizenship, and develop personal  fitness.   Mr. Speaker, along with my colleague,  Tom Marino, I commend Troop 14  on its centennial celebration for building so many future leaders by  combining educational activities and lifelong values with fun. I wish  them the very best on this milestone occasion and look forward to  another 100 years of excellence.                            ____________________
