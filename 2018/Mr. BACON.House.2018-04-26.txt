 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize three amazing kids:  Arianna, Julius, and Kaydin, who join me today on the floor. All three  are taking part in Take Our Children to Work Today hosted by Tuesday's  Children. This is my second year participating in this wonderful event,  and both times it has brightened my day.   Tuesday's Children provides support to children whose parents passed  away in the military or due to terrorism. More than 15,000 individuals  directly impacted by the events of September 11 have been supported by  Tuesday's Children, and more than 6,000 individuals are currently  served by Tuesday's Children's First Responder Alliance program today.   In my 30 years in the Air Force, I was able to meet with the families  of loved ones who passed. I know how important organizations like  Tuesday's Children are for our Nation's youth.   Today, it is about kids like Arianna, Julius, and Kaydin. They are  shadowing me this morning and seeing what life is like in Congress.  Julius is 9 years old. He is from Maryland and enjoys robotics and  LEGOs. Kaydin, from Pennsylvania, is 10 years old, and is a big New  York Giants fan. I tried to make him a Chicago Bears fan, but I  couldn't do it. Finally, Arianna is from Maryland. She is 7 years old,  and loves to play tennis.   I hope they enjoy their time in Washington and remember this day as a  very special one, because they are special. I look forward to spending  more time with them this afternoon.
