 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to my friend and  colleague, Congressman Doug Lamborn, for organizing this Special Order  series in recognition of the 76th anniversary of National Bible Week.   I am delighted to stand with these other Members today to share our  perspectives on why the Bible is so important to us and to our country.  As we approach the Thanksgiving holiday, there is really no better time  to present these reflections.   I wanted to share the preface to a historic text that I have in my  collection. What I am holding here is a copy of the New Testament Bible  study course that was approved by and published for the public schools  of Dallas, Texas, by its board of education in September of 1946. The  preface was written by Henry Van Dyke, and it is a wonderful summary of  what the Bible means to us and to the world.   Mr. Speaker, let me read to you what it says here in the text:         Born in the East and clothed in that form and imagery, the       Bible walks the ways of the world with familiar feet and       enters land after land to find its own everywhere. It has       learned to speak in hundreds of languages to the hearts of       men. It comes into the palace to tell the monarch that he is       a servant of the Most High and into the cottage to assure the       peasant that He is a son of God. Children listen to its       stories with wonder and delight, and wise men ponder them as       parables of life. It has a word of peace for the time of       peril, a word of comfort for the time of calamity, a word of       light for the hour of darkness. Its oracles are repeated in       the assembly of the people, and its counsels whispered in the       ear of the lonely. The wicked and the proud tremble at its       warnings, but to the wounded and the penitent, it has a       mother's voice. The wilderness and the solitary place have       been made glad by it, and the fire on the hearth has lit the       reading of its well-worn pages. It has woven itself into our       dearest dreams so that love, friendship, sympathy, devotion,       memory, and hope put on the beautiful garments of its       treasured speech, breathing of frankincense and myrrh. No man       is poor or desolate who has this treasure for his own. When       the landscape darkens and the trembling pilgrim comes to the       valley named of the shadow, he is not afraid to enter. He       takes the rod and the staff of Scripture in his hand. He says       to friend and comrade: Good-Bye; we shall meet again. And       comforted by that support, he goes toward the lonely pass as       one who walks through the darkness into light.    Mr. Speaker, I love those words. I also love the words that are  inscribed above the Speaker, where it says in the marble: In God We  Trust.   There is a reason for that. Our Founders understood that this is our  foundation. George Washington, the father of our country, famously said  in his Farewell Address: ``Of all the dispositions and habits which  lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable  supports.''   Adams was our second President. He comes next. He said: ``Our  Constitution is made only for a moral and religious people. It is  wholly inadequate for the government of any other.''   We have to remember these truths. I close with the words of ``The  Gipper.'' Ronald Reagan said it more recently: ``If we ever forget that  we are one nation under God, we will be a nation gone under.''    I am so grateful for National Bible Week. I am so grateful to my  friends and colleagues here for our recognition of this great truth,  what it means to our country, and what it means to each of us.
