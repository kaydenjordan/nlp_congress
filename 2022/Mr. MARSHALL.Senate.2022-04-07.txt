 Mr. President, I am here today to talk about the  extraordinary accomplishments of the University of Kansas's men's  basketball team. As the Nation saw on Monday night, KU beat the  University of North Carolina in the NCAA championship game, doing so in  a historic fashion.   The game started strong for the Jayhawks, taking an early 7-0 lead,  but after some back and forth, North Carolina seemingly broke the game  open, ending the first half on an 18-3 run to go up 15. This deficit  proved to be the largest ever overcome in an NCAA championship game.  Going into the locker room, one could only imagine the sense of  determination running through their minds. To win this game, they  literally needed to pull off the biggest comeback in championship  history in front of thousands of Kansas schoolchildren who look up to  these young men as role models and student-athletes. How would they  respond to this adversity?   This question was answered as the referee handed the ball to a Tar  Heel player and he looked up to see a Jayhawk in his face. The Jayhawks  had a look of champions in their eyes. This game meant too much to  everyone back home to give up. They stormed out of the locker room  after inspirational words from power forward David  [[Page S2087]]  McCormack, who started the half by giving Jayhawk fans back home  something to cheer about with an electrifying, signature Jayhawk alley- oop. That play ignited a 20-6 run that brought the Jayhawks within 1  point. In true Kansas fashion, the Jayhawks ramped up their defense and  began executing the fundamentals of basketball Kansans learn in the  front driveway and haymounds across the state. The game became a  slugfest at that point with KU and North Carolina trading body blows  back and forth until McCormack sank one last shot to take the lead with  just over a minute left. That shot ultimately sealed this KU team's  spot in the history books, brought KU its fourth NCAA national  championship, and added to their lead as the winningest basketball  program in NCAA history.   For all of us who saw the game, it was clear that this championship  lived up to the March Madness hype. Every Kansas basketball fan will  remember this team for their ability to share the ball--or as Coach  Self says, ``to not let the ball stick.'' Each game during this  tournament seemed to have a different hero, but in this historic  championship game, every player was a hero, and everyone's  contributions were necessary to win. This Jayhawk team made us all  proud to be Kansans and delivered the greatest final game comeback  ever.   This group should relish in that fact, and I hope they also  understand the enormity of the impact they have made with this title on  so many fans, young and old alike. This team gave us hope and  entertainment to distract us from a challenging past couple of years.  They showed up every day and did their job. With this title, current KU  students now have the experience of a lifetime, alumni and fans  everywhere are connected forever through this one game, and every  little girl and boy across Kansas has learned what hard work, teamwork,  and a never-give-up attitude can accomplish.   To the players graduating or heading to the draft,I wish you the best  of success and happiness in your future endeavors. To Coach Self and  everyone else returning, I look forward to current and future  generations of Kansans cheering you on and celebrating the tradition of  Kansas Basketball. ``Rock Chalk!''                            ____________________
