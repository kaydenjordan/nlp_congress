The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr. Jim Paxton  of the First District of Kentucky on his retirement from the Paducah  Sun newspaper.   Within the first year of his career, he quickly rose through the  ranks to serve as the Paducah Sun's editor and publisher. As he and his  brothers joined the generations of Paxton family members who have led  and managed Paxton Media Group, they began to expand their operations  into local television broadcasting with WPSD-TV and radio broadcasts,  eventually owning and managing more than 35 daily and weekly newspapers  throughout the Southeastern United States.   The Paducah Sun's continued success is a testament to Jim's belief  that local newspapers should focus on prominently featuring news from  the community, while also striking the appropriate balance of State and  national coverage.   Throughout his career, Jim Paxton has established an outstanding  legacy as a revered public servant and titan of western Kentucky media.  He is widely respected for his pursuit of meaningful, insightful  journalism, and I am thankful for his friendship and guidance  throughout the years.   As he begins the next phase of his life, I join with his family and  friends, as well as those he has impacted during his career, to express  our dedication and gratitude for his contributions to western Kentucky.                            ____________________
