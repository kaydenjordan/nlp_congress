 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today to offer my  amendment to H.R. 8, the Water Resources Development Act of 2018.   Madam Chair, my amendment is a commonsense and cost savings amendment  that would allow the Army Corps of Engineers much-needed flexibility  when acquiring certain rights to the procurement of land.   Specifically, it would direct the Secretary to prefer acquiring the  minimum interest necessary in real property needed to support a project  or an action. This allows flexibilities for the Corps to consider the  use of a temporary easement estate or other interest to facilitate a  reduction in overall project cost, to reduce project time, and minimize  conflict with property owners related to the project or action.   This approach will allow the Corps to take a more sensible approach  to projects and not force the Federal Government to purchase more  property in order to undertake critically needed projects.   Historically, in my home State of Louisiana, many of the projects are  accomplished through partnerships between the Federal Government and  State and private landowners who often can offer more favorable and  economical terms than the Federal Government's outright purchasing of  property.   As we have heard throughout debate on the underlying bill, there are  countless and widely known deficiencies in the way business is  conducted by the Corps. Many of these issues are caused by bureaucratic  regulations that get in the way of real progress being made in a manner  that is responsible to the taxpayers we represent.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I thank my colleague from  Louisiana for supporting the bill, and I urge my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to support this commonsense amendment, as well as  final passage of the chairman's bill.   Madam Chairwoman, I yield back the balance of my time.
