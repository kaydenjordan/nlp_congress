 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, these are  not usual times. Representing the State of Hawaii, of course, we care  about clean water. So with all due respect to my colleague from  Montana, we understand the importance of this issue to the people of  his State. However, as I said, these are very unusual times, and, on  the President's decision to fire Director James Comey in this manner,  under this pretext, and at this time, it is also a total disservice to  the American people.   This attempt, intended to derail and disrupt the FBI's ongoing  investigation into Russia's attempt to disrupt or interfere with our  democracy and the Trump team's ties to those attempts, should be a  matter of national concern, not a Republican or Democratic concern. We  need a bipartisan call for a special prosecutor who will conduct an  impartial, thorough investigation, untainted by political  consideration.   Therefore, I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, of course  we acknowledge the importance of the matters raised by my colleague  from North Dakota and, representing my State, the State of Hawaii, yes,  there is support for education of Native people, of Native children,  which I hope will include Native Hawaiian children. That is important  as well as recognizing various Indian Tribes and the other matters that  were raised by my friend from North Dakota.   However, as I mentioned, these are not business-as-usual times. The  untoward firing of the FBI Director, who was conducting an ongoing  investigation into Russian attempts to interfere with our Democracy and  the Trump team's ties to those attempts, should be a matter of national  concern, should be a matter of concern to every single Member of the  Senate.   This is not a Republican or a Democratic concern. This is a threat to  our democracy. We know Russia did this. We know we need to get to the  bottom of this. We need to get to the bottom of the Trump team's ties  to these efforts, and this thinly veiled attempt by President Trump to  derail or disrupt these investigations cannot be sustained or  supported.   We continue to ask for a bipartisan call for a special prosecutor who  will conduct an impartial, thorough investigation, untainted by  political considerations into the Russia-Trump matter. Therefore, Mr.  President, I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   The Senator from Minnesota.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor our former  colleague, Senator Daniel K. Akaka, for his lifetime of distinguished  leadership, service, and contributions to our Nation's veteran and  Native Hawaiian communities.   Daniel Kahikina Akaka dedicated his life to serving the people of  Hawaii. He served as a Member of the U.S. Senate for 22 years. Prior to  that, he served Hawaii's 2nd Congressional District in the United  States House of Representatives for 14 years.   However, his story of leadership and service begins well before his  tenure on Capitol Hill.   On December 7, 1941, a young Senator Akaka witnessed Japanese fighter  planes attacking Pearl Harbor from his dorm room at the Kamehameha  Schools. The events of that morning were life-altering for him and many  young men his age, and he joined the war effort.   Following his service in World War II with the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers,  [[Page S2879]]  Senator Akaka earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Hawaii.  He later attained a master's degree as well. As he has relayed in the  past, had it not been for the benefits received under the G.I. Bill,  Senator Akaka's future in public service would not have been more than  a dream.   A believer in the power of education, Senator Akaka made it a career.  Before entering politics, he served as a teacher, principal, and  educational administrator, making a difference in the lives of many  students for over 15 years.   As a veteran himself, Senator Akaka dedicated his service in Congress  to helping servicemembers, veterans, and their families. His commitment  to these issues led to his service as chairman of the Senate Committee  on Veterans' Affairs from 2007 to 2011. As chairman, he worked to  expand VA services. He also authored and passed the Post-9/11 G.I.  Bill, which is making a difference to new generations of veterans as  the original G.I. Bill did for his generation.   Not only was Senator Akaka a champion for education and veterans, he  was also a champion for Native Hawaiians. He is the first person of  Native Hawaiian ancestry to serve in the U.S. Senate, and he grew up in  an era where the Hawaiian language and culture were heavily looked down  upon. To help change this perception, he committed to protecting the  language, culture, and traditions of indigenous peoples.   Senator Akaka advanced these priorities as chairman of the Senate  Committee on Indian Affairs from 2011 to 2013. He also played a key  role in ensuring the passage of legislation that enhanced Native  Hawaiian education programs and authored a joint resolution that  acknowledged the U.S. Government's role in the overthrow of the Kingdom  of Hawaii in 1893, while recognizing the special trust relationship  held with the Native Hawaiian community.   He also fought tirelessly for self-determination for Native  Hawaiians.   During his time in Washington, DC, he served the people of Hawaii  well and with distinction. Although he retired in 2012, Senator Akaka  has continued down a path of leadership and service, speaking to  students and mentoring some of Hawaii's up-and-coming leaders. We all  appreciate his continued service.   Mahalo nui loa, my dear friend, for being a true champion of aloha.                            ____________________
