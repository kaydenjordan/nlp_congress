 Madam Speaker, December is such a great  month, and there are so many great dates in December. We talk about the  wonderful things that have happened in Decembers of the past.   In addition to Christmas being something we celebrate, the Boston Tea  Party took place in December. Also, on December 7, 1941, a horrific act  happened in the United States, one that President Roosevelt said: This  is a date that ``will live in infamy.''   Today, December 18, 2019, is another date that will live in infamy.  Just because you hate the President of the United States, and you can  find no other reason other than the fact that you are so blinded by  your hate that you can't see straight, you have decided the only way we  can make sure this President doesn't get elected again is to impeach  him.   On the floor of the people's House, the bastion of democracy and  liberty in the whole world, we have decided that political power is far  more important than principle.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members of the House to vote ``no'' on  impeachment and to look their voters in the eye.   Listen, let me tell you, the voters will remember next November what  you are doing this December. This is a terrible time. This is a date  that will live in infamy.
