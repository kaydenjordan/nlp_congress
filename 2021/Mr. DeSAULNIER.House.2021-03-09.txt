 Mr. Speaker, I am a proud former member of Teamsters  Local 170 in Worcester, Massachusetts, and a former member of AFL-CIO  Local 2 in San Francisco. From that experience, I know personally the  value of being a union member.   I am also a former small business person who knows the value of  having good-paying jobs in a community represented by union members to  small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, the wealthiest Americans continue to take home a larger  and larger share of America's wealth. According to Fed data, the top 1  percent of Americans have a combined net worth of $34.2 trillion, which  is 15 times more wealth than the bottom 50 percent of Americans. One  percent has more wealth than 160 million Americans.                                time  1400    This is unparalleled in our existence and must be addressed if you  really care about working people. This inequality has contributed to  what is called diseases of despair by public health experts and has  worsened the behavioral health crisis exponentially in this country.   At the same time, union coverage today is half of what it was 40  years ago, and research shows deunionization  [[Page H1152]]  accounts for up to one-third of the inequality of which I speak.   The Economic Policy Institute estimates that deunionization has led  to working people losing $200 billion per year, and that money goes to  make inequality greater and goes into the already exceedingly  disproportionate wealth by those in the 1 percent. It hurts all of us,  including them.   Strengthening access to unions and American workers being able to  organize will help restore the balance of power between workers and  employers, wages and capital. The research is clear that when workers  collectively bargain and organize, their pay goes up. On average, a  worker covered by a union contract earns 13 percent more than a peer in  a nonunionized workplace.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman for yielding me the time,  and I ask my colleagues to enthusiastically support this initiative.
