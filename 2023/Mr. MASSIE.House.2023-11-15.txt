 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 869 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 869         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 5893) making appropriations for the       Departments of Commerce and Justice, Science, and Related       Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, and       for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be       dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived.

The previous question shall be considered       as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any further       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except one motion to recommit.        Sec. 6.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 5961) to freeze       certain Iranian funds involved in the 2023 hostage deal       between the United States and Iran, and for other purposes.       All points of order against consideration of the bill are       waived. In lieu of the amendment recommended by the Committee       on Foreign Affairs now printed in the bill, an amendment in       the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules       Committee Print 118-14, modified by the amendment printed in       part B of the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying       this resolution, shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as       amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill,       as amended, and on any further amendment thereto to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate  [[Page H5862]]       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs or their       respective designees; and (2) one motion to recommit.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the ranking member of the Rules Committee,  the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), pending which I yield  myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this  resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    House Resolution 869 provides for a structured rule for  consideration of H.R. 5893, the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related  Agencies Appropriations Act and a closed rule, H.R. 5961, the No Funds  for Iranian Terrorism Act.   We have a structured rule for H.R. 5893, which makes in order 119  amendments for consideration on the floor. This rule provides the chair  and the ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations  limited en bloc authority and provides one motion to recommit.   We have a closed rule for H.R. 5961. Debate for this bill will be  evenly divided over 1 hour between the chair and ranking minority  member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the rule provides one  motion to recommit.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support House Resolution 869 in the  spirit in which it was created, one that allows for robust debate and  gives Members the opportunity to submit amendments for consideration on  this floor, as many amendments were included in this rule as possible.   We are encouraging debate on the floor and for Members to fight for  their priorities. There is absolutely no reason not to support this  rule. Let's not forget what we have been committed to fighting for  these last several months, bringing all 12 appropriations bills to the  floor.   The days of Christmas omnibus bills are over. We still have more work  to do to fight against inflated budgets and the growing national debt,  but the step we are taking this week that prevents a Christmas giveaway  on the House floor in an omnibus is a major step in the right  direction.   This is what the American people expected of us. This is what we were  elected to do, discuss and debate appropriation of taxpayer dollars.   Speaking of appropriations, this is our 12th appropriations bill, 12  of 12. Finally, here we are.   Do I wish this were done in a timelier manner? Of course.   Do I wish the government functioned more efficiently for the sake of  the constituents we each represent? Absolutely.   We find ourselves now completing this process in the manner in which  it was intended--draft, amend, debate, and vote. No Member can say  today that they did not have the opportunity to participate in this  process, and no Member can argue that these appropriations were not  brought forward in an open and transparent manner.   I applaud the relative committees and everyone in the GOP Conference  who has worked so hard to bring this bill and all of the appropriations  bills forward to get this work done.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, to say that the Democrats spend like drunken sailors is  an insult to sailors.   This bill cuts wasteful spending. If there is any scorecard to be  kept between Democrat Speakers and Republican Speakers, it should be on  spending. I would like to note that 40 percent of all of the national  debt--which, by the way, is approaching $34 trillion--40 percent of all  of the national debt that exists today, from the beginning of our  country until this moment, was incurred under one Speaker. That was  Speaker Pelosi.   If we are keeping score here, it should be about wasteful spending,  deficit spending, and debts. We can blame Presidents for it, but the  reality is, Congress--in fact, the House of Representatives--has the  power of the purse. We need to look at ourselves when we look at that  debt, and this bill is a good step toward reducing deficits.   The Commerce, Justice, Science and related agencies appropriations  bill provides net new spending of $58.383 billion for programs under  the jurisdiction of the subcommittee, which is $23.765 billion below  FY23 enacted levels. That is a large cut. Maybe it is not large enough,  but it is what has upset the other side of the aisle, that is for sure.   You can disguise it as anything you want, but they are really upset  about this bill because it cuts spending. Not the kind of cuts to  spending where we pretend to cut spending, where we have some baseline  that is actually increasing spending, and then we reduce the baseline.  No, I am talking about actual cuts in real dollars. That is what this  bill does, and that is why they are so excited, that is why they are so  angry about this rule and this bill.   By the way, this rule allows for 119 amendments. When they say those  are extreme amendments, what do those amendments do? They cut more.  That is what the amendments do. None of those amendments increase  spending. I think that is what they are upset about on the other side  of the aisle is that not only have we brought forth a bill that cuts  $23 billion of Federal spending, we are allowing 119 amendments to cut  even more spending.   Let me talk about the priorities in this bill. By the way, Congress  has the power of the purse, and we complain about a lot of things the  executive branch does, but then we, too, will frequently turn around  and fund the things that we complain about. This bill actually defunds  some of the things that we have been complaining about.   I and several Members of Congress had the great fortune to share  breakfast with Justice Antonin Scalia before he passed away. One of my  colleagues asked Justice Scalia: When are you going to help us restore  constitutional balance of government? Scalia scoffed at him. He said:  What are you talking about? You are the most powerful branch. In fact,  every tool you need is right there in the Constitution to restore  constitutional balance of government.   Another of my colleagues said, but impeachment is so unwieldy, and we  can never get that through the Senate. Scalia said: I am not talking  about impeachment. I am talking about the power of the purse. It is  right there in the Constitution. You have it. You are the most powerful  branch, and quit complaining about the things you are funding or quit  funding the things you are complaining about. That is what this bill  does.   It eliminates more than 70 unnecessary and wasteful programs and  initiatives, including 14 polarizing diversity, equity, and inclusion  offices and programs. I don't find diversity, equity, and inclusion in  the Constitution. It is just not in Article I, Section 8. It is not  there for us to do, and so we are eliminating those programs.   It defunds at least 15 executive orders. What are executive orders?  Are they laws? No, they are not laws. The lawmaking authority is here.  We should probably defund every executive order, but this defunds 15 of  them--rules, memoranda, and other Biden administration policies that  usurp our congressional authority to make law.   This bill reduces wasteful spending on climate change initiatives.   It prevents the FBI from using its construction balances to build a  new headquarters. Why is that important? It is important because they  have become weaponized against the American  [[Page H5864]]  public, showing up at school board meetings and targeting parents and  saying they are terrorists. They don't need a new headquarters.   It rejects the administration's plans to replace the Department of  Commerce and Department of Justice vehicle fleets with electric  vehicles, saving taxpayers nearly $54 million.   This is what we are doing in this bill. We are using the power of the  purse. There are 119 amendments. None of those amendments increase  spending. I can tell you, we went through all of them. Maybe that is  why they are upset that some of their amendments didn't make it in  there because maybe they were trying to spend more money. I am sorry,  we are not going to do that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0945     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me point out that my colleague from Kentucky is  right that Social Security is a legal and moral obligation to seniors.  Let me also point out that every time we engage in deficit spending and  spend too much money, we cause inflation.   When we have the Fed create dollars out of thin air so we can launder  them through banks and then borrow them back from ourselves, we are  really causing inflation.   What does inflation do to those Social Security checks? It reduces  the value of those Social Security checks.   This bill is actually a step in reducing inflation by reducing  Federal spending, and that will be to the benefit of those seniors who  are going to be living on a fixed income.   We all know there is a cost-of-living adjustment applied to Social  Security, but the reality is it is not keeping up with inflation.   Inflation is so rampant now due to the spending that we have engaged  in in Congress. There is a moral imperative for us to reduce spending  because it trickles down. Inflation is very detrimental to our seniors.  That is why we have to pass this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Langworthy), my good friend and colleague on the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   If I had a nickel for every time the other side of the aisle uses the  word ``extreme,'' I would buy you lunch today. It must be poll tested.  ``Extreme'' must be good for them in the polls.   Let me tell you what is extreme and what every American thinks is  extreme: $33.7 trillion is extreme. The fact that we are now paying,  this year, a trillion dollars in interest on that debt, on that  national debt, that is extreme.   Spending money we don't have is extreme. Funding an FBI that targets  its own citizens who have done nothing wrong, funding the censorship of  speech of Americans, that is extreme. The American people know that is  extreme.   The inflation that is caused by this is extreme, and it is affecting  everybody. The cost of transportation, the cost of food, and the cost  of housing are skyrocketing. That is extreme.   Now, my colleague mentioned that we didn't allow every amendment in  this rule. Well, as the ranking member of the committee, surely he  knows not every amendment is in order. We have certain rules in the  Rules Committee, and a lot of these amendments, unfortunately--and I  have to tell some of my friends this--failed our own test.   For instance, they weren't germane to the underlying bill. Americans  don't want amendments tacked onto bills that have nothing to do with  the underlying bill, so the amendments have  [[Page H5866]]  to be germane. We are protecting the American people when we keep this  process for allowing amendments that are only germane.   The amendments to spending bills, as a rule--it has been a rule since  I came here 11 years ago--they can't increase spending, yet  unfortunately some of my colleagues introduced amendments that do  sometimes intentionally, sometimes unintentionally, but especially the  Democrats like to increase spending. We can't allow those amendments.   Finally, we don't allow the amendments that try to legislate on an  appropriations bill. We don't allow you to change laws on a bill that  has to do with spending. That is the primary reason most of those  amendments that the other side is always complaining about are not in  this bill. There are 119 good amendments that were allowed that we will  debate later today and that we will vote on in transparency and full  light of day, not snuck in at the last moment. The American people will  get to see how they are being represented through these 119 amendments.   This appropriations bill, I would like to point out, satisfies some  of our constitutional obligations. Adam Smith said there are three  primary roles of government: to provide for the national defense, to  fund public infrastructure, and to institute a system of justice. It is  that third obligation that we are fulfilling here today with this bill.   Then we have some constitutional obligations beyond that that are  fulfilled in this bill. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,  intellectual property, which is in Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of  the Constitution. That is an obligation of Congress, to provide for the  protection of intellectual property. That is in this bill.   The Bureau of the Census is funded in this bill. We are directed by  the Constitution to have a census every 10 years, so that is another  function in this bill.   This bill funds the National Institute of Standards and Technology,  sometimes called NIST. This used to be called the Bureau of Weights and  Measures. The Constitution, Article I, Section 8, directs Congress to  establish the weights and measures so that we are not all using in this  country a different set of weights and measures.   There are many constitutional obligations provided in this bill, many  necessary roles of government, some things that aren't technically in  the Constitution, but we agree publicly that these are in the benefit  of our country. For instance, NASA is funded in this bill.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I urge my colleagues to support this rule,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I look forward to the passage of this rule because there are 119  amendments that are going to expose 430-plus Members of this body to  their voters.   How is that? Well, each of these amendments gets 10 minutes of  debate. If so ordered, there will be recorded votes on these  amendments. They address issues fundamental to our rights.   There will be amendments in this debate after this rule passes on  protecting the First Amendment to the Constitution, the freedom of  religion, freedom of speech, will we allow our government to censure us  on social media. They have been doing it through NGOs and private  organizations and research grants. I don't think we should allow it. I  don't think it is constitutional. You can't launder a violation of the  First Amendment. There will be a debate on that after this rule passes  because of this rule.   There will be a debate on whether you support the Second Amendment,  the right to keep and bear arms. There is an amendment that we will  debate when this rule passes that prohibits the ATF from using funds to  maintain a database. They are prohibited already, but they keep trying  to do it, so we have to defund them from that.   There is even an amendment--I am particularly fond of this debate  that is  [[Page H5867]]  coming up--to prevent Federal funds from being used to prosecute a  Presidential candidate. We look like a banana republic when our justice  system indicts candidates for President to try to bring down their poll  numbers. This is something that you do in Third World countries.    In any event, there are 119 amendments. I think the other side is  against this rule because they don't want to have these debates. They  surely don't want to have to vote because that record will be for all  time. Every 2 years, each of us faces our voters with those records  that will be created today as a result of this rule.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the word of the day is ``extreme'' because the other  side uses it in every sentence.   Let me tell you what is extreme: Violating the First Amendment, the  principles of freedom of speech and freedom of religion. That is  extreme, and that is going to be addressed in this bill and this rule,  utilizing the power of the purse. Violating the Second Amendment rights  of Americans, their God-given rights to defend themselves; that is  extreme. This bill addresses that. This rule provides for robust debate  on that issue.   Extreme is violating the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution and the  rights there enshrined. Violating the 10th Amendment and Federalizing  our police forces. That is extreme. These are the things that Americans  find extreme. These are the things that are addressed in this rule and  in the underlying bill using the power of the purse.   The most extreme thing--and I do have to say that the Democrats are  really good at this form of extremism--the most extreme thing is to  continually spend money we don't have, to borrow until they won't lend  us any money, and then to print money so we can spend more of it.  Extreme is putting ourselves $33.7 trillion in debt. When I say  ourselves, I mean, the American taxpayers. They are on the hook for  this.   Even if you don't pay taxes, if you have worked a hard life, you have  saved and you have got money in the bank and you are relying on your  Social Security, what is extreme is the inflation that we have created  through out-of-control spending in this Chamber over many, many years.  Both parties are guilty of it. It is extreme because it hurts every  American when we devalue the dollar through extreme spending.   What does this bill do?   It cuts spending.   This fight is really simple. The disagreements between both sides of  the aisle--we can argue about the minor issues--but the major issue is:  Do you want to expand government? Do you want it to be more prevalent  in your life? Do you want to pay more taxes? Do you want to put your  grandkids in hock?   If you do, vote for that side of the aisle.   If you want to put us on a path to fiscal responsibility, if you want  to have open debates, if you want to have 72 hours to see what is in  the bill, if you don't want to have to vote for a bill to find out what  is in it, then you are with this side of the aisle. You should support  this rule. I urge adoption of this rule.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:    An Amendment to H. Res. 869 Offered By Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 7. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 178) affirming the House of       Representatives' commitment to protect and strengthen Social       Security and Medicare. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees.        Sec. 8. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 178.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
