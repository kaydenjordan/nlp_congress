 Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring  the life of Dr. S. Jim Farha.   On January 17, 2020, Dr. Farha passed away, leaving behind family,  friends, and a legacy of making Wichita and our State a better place.   After leaving his native Lebanon in search of an opportunity in  America, Dr. Farha worked hard to become a cardiothoracic surgeon. In  1963, Dr. Farha and his brother George began a surgical practice in  Wichita to meet a critical need of surgeons in the region. Over time,  the practice would eventually become the largest of its kind in the  State of Kansas.   In addition to leading the practice for nearly 40 years with his  brother, Dr. Farha also worked tirelessly to improve our community.  From landmarks like the Wichita Art Museum to the YMCA, the  philanthropy and service of Dr. Farha and his late wife, Darla, can be  seen throughout Wichita and our region.   His dedication to serving others, whether in the operating room or in  the community, has left an inspiring imprint, which will be felt for  generations. Dr. Farha's life is a true testament to the American  Dream, and he will be missed.                            ____________________
