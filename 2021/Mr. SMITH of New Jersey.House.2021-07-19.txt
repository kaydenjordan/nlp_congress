 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Refugee Sanitation Facility  Safety Act.   I commend my colleagues, Representative Meng and Chairman Meeks, for  their work on this issue.   Around the world, we are seeing unprecedented levels of displacement  due to conflict and humanitarian disasters. Unfortunately, many of  these crises have gone on for many years, even decades, like we have  seen in South Sudan.   I would just note, parenthetically, my good friend Karen Bass and I  have been to refugee camps throughout Africa and have seen the great  work that is done by the United States, working with the UNHCR and  other international organizations, literally saving people who  otherwise would die of starvation or sickness, so what a great  humanitarian effort made by this country and by others, including the  UNHCR.   I would point out to my colleagues that new emergencies, like  Ethiopia and the growing instability in Afghanistan, have stretched the  capabilities of the United Nations and the international community. The  COVID-19 pandemic, as it surges in much of the developing world, is  only making these crises worse. Lack of access to clean water and  cramped living conditions continues to hamper prevention efforts.   A generation of young people is growing up knowing only life in a  refugee camp. The conditions in many of these camps around the world  are dire and particularly dangerous for vulnerable populations, such as  women and children.   This bill ensures support for safe sanitation facilities for refugees  and displaced persons living in camps around the world.   The U.S. continues to be the largest donor to refugees and displaced  persons around the world. That has been a historical fact no matter who  was in the White House, speaking to the humanitarian beliefs of this  country to care for those who are at risk and who are vulnerable.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise today in support of the Divided Families Reunification Act.  The sorrowful legacy of the Korean war is with us even today, almost 70  years after the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed.   The Korean peninsula remains divided between a nation of free people  and a nation that subjects its people to utter tyranny.   The barbaric Kim regime continues to threaten the peace and security  of South Korea, the region, and even the world.   And families remain broken, from those still fighting to bring their  loved ones' remains home, to those with family members trapped in North  Korea. This is an attempt to try to say let's get this moving to try to  get those families reunited.   Our vibrant Korean-American community, led by groups such as the  Korean American Grassroots Conference,  [[Page H3652]]  feels this legacy strongly, so I commend Congresswoman Meng for  introducing this legislation which directs the State Department to  consult with South Korea and Korean Americans on opportunities to  reunite families separated by the DMZ.   I also trust that the State Department will be vigilant in ensuring  that organizations with ties to North Korea will not be exploiting the  desire of these families to be reunited with their loved ones to raise  hard currency for the Kim regime.   Mr. Speaker, with that in mind, I urge support for the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim), the vice ranking  member of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific and  an original cosponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 294, which reaffirms  the House's commitment to support our Korean-American families seeking  to reunite with relatives who are trapped in North Korea.   The resolution, authored by my good friend and colleague, the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass), rightly observes that family  reunification is a humanitarian priority.   As she points out, it calls on the United States and North Korea to  begin the process of reuniting North Korean and Korean-American divided  family members with their immediate relatives through ways such as--and  I quote from the resolution:   ``Identifying divided families in the United States and North Korea  who are willing and able to participate in a pilot program for family  reunions;   ``Finding matches for members of such families through organizations  such as the Red Cross; and   ``Working with the Government of South Korea to include American  citizens in inter-Korean video reunions;   ``Reaffirms the institution of the family as inalienable and,  accordingly, urges the restoration of contact between divided families  physically, literarily, or virtually.''   Mr. Speaker, it is a very, very good resolution. I thank my good  friend and colleague for authoring it. I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Securing America From Epidemics  Act.   I thank my colleagues, Congressmen Bera and Fitzpatrick, for  introducing this bill and for their work to address this important  issue.   COVID-19 has shown once again that pandemics know no borders, and  that the United States and the world must be better prepared to respond  to disease outbreaks, including pandemics, around the world.   The bill authorizes the United States to participate in the Coalition  for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, or CEPI, an alliance of  countries and private partners that are financing and coordinating the  developing of new vaccines for infectious diseases.   In addition to COVID-19, CEPI has developed a list of priority  diseases with epidemic potential, including MERS, the Middle East  Respiratory Syndrome.   By leveraging contributions from member states with expertise and  funding by private partners, CEPI seeks to develop vaccines before a  disease outbreak occurs.   I would note, parenthetically, that in October of 2020, the Trump  administration gave CEPI a $20 million grant to advance its work.   Mr. Speaker, according to the Johns Hopkins Resource Center, COVID-19  has killed over 4,092,000 people worldwide, including 609,000 in the  United States and in my home State of New Jersey, 26,545 deaths, the  most COVID-19 deaths per capita in the United States.   The pandemic could cost the global economy approximately $10  trillion, or more than 12 percent of global GDP. The loss of jobs and  businesses is unprecedented in modern times. And all of us know it from  our case work working with our local businesses. This has been an  incredibly horrible pandemic, and we have to make sure it is never  repeated.   Developing vaccines and treatment for emerging infectious diseases is  not just an issue of individual health, but it is important to national  security, including economic security.   Our committee has worked together on many pieces of legislation over  the last several months in response to COVID-19. The SAFE Act, for  example, is an example of this kind of bipartisan effort.   I urge all my colleagues who believe we must do all we can to prevent  another pandemic like COVID-19 from emerging in the future to support  this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Desert Locust  Control Act, a bill I introduced along with my good friend and  colleague, Representative Karen Bass of California, and we have worked  on this issue together for quite a long time trying to mitigate its  impact that it is having, particularly on Africa.   I thank Representatives Meeks and McCaul for their work in ensuring  that this legislation is on the floor today so that we can vote on it  and hopefully see it enacted into law.   Mr. Speaker, this bill will establish--and this is the core of it--an  interagency working group to develop a comprehensive, strategic plan to  control locust outbreaks in the East Africa region and address future  outbreaks in order to avert famine, starvation, and mass scale food  insecurity and potential political destabilization that goes along with  all of that.   According to USAID: ``The desert locust is one of the most  destructive migratory pests in the entire world, rapidly consuming most  vegetation in its path, including crops and pastureland critical to  maintaining the food security and livelihoods of populations in East  Africa. Locust swarms are highly mobile and carried on the wind; swarms  can travel up to 100 miles per day, and even a relatively small, 0.4  square mile-sized swarm can consume an amount of food sufficient for  approximately 35,000 people in one day.''   As recently as July 6, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, or  FAO, has said that ``a desert locust upsurge is still underway in the  Greater Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula,'' and that ``although  substantial control operations are underway, the battle to control the  desert locust is not yet over.''   The World Bank notes that: ``A new generation of locusts emerges  every eight weeks. Each generation, on average, sees a 20-fold increase  in the population. The growing swarms spread to new areas, disrupting  the food supply, upending livelihoods and requiring substantial  resources to address.''   Mr. Speaker, I believe there are three very important reasons to  support this bill.   The first is an obligation that we have to mitigate suffering  wherever we are able to do so, and prevent starvation, famine, food  insecurity, and stunting. Stunting increases when food is not available  to young people especially during the first thousand days of life from  conception to the second birthday.   The second is our strategic U.S. national interest. Food insecurity  causes instability, as we saw with the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood  in Egypt a decade ago. Here, the Horn of Africa is vitally important,  and we see an area wracked by war and violence, be it the war in the  Tigray region of Ethiopia and ethnic violence elsewhere in that  strategically important country, or Al-Shabaab's efforts in neighboring  Somalia to establish a radical terror regime. On top of this political  chaos then is the food crisis caused by locusts, compounded by the  ongoing COVID concerns.   The third is that this legislation is both penny-wise and pound-wise.  The bill calls for greater intergovernmental coordination so that we  don't waste resources through redundant efforts but work in a highly  coordinated fashion. Further, by addressing the food insecurity problem  at the source, the locusts, we mitigate the need down the road to  provide disaster and humanitarian assistance, which is more costly not  only in terms of dollars, but most importantly in terms of human lives.   I would further note that just last week Administrator Samantha Power  addressed the Foreign Affairs Committee, and she addressed how spending  a little money up front can save more down the road, while underscoring  there is much work to be done.   She said: ``We have treated more than 5 million acres of infested  lands since 2020``--and the last administration and this administration  is very focused, I would say parenthetically, on this--``preventing the  loss of four million metric tons of crops. That's $1.2 billion worth of  crop yields that were saved by virtue of this effort. I gather that  things got better and now are turning downward again, so that is  something that has my attention.''  [[Page H3657]]    She went on to say: ``Whether it is providing surveillance, aircraft  training, pesticides, and training about how to use the pesticides in  order to avoid environmental damage and so forth--it is a very  important enabling complement to the other work we do on food  security.''                                time  1600    Finally, I would like to call attention to the yeoman's work that was  done by our past ambassador to the United Nations Food Agencies, Kip  Tom. This is an absolutely critical position that tends to be  overlooked.   He advised us, provided unbelievably important insights and  information that helped us craft a response to push the previous  administration to do more. And, hopefully, this will help coordinate  everything.   I would note, parenthetically, that President Biden has nominated  Cindy McCain to fill that role at FAO, and I look forward to working  with her and the rest of the administration on this important  initiative.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to  close.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, I thank my good friend and colleague,  Congresswoman Karen Bass, the chair of the Subcommittee on Africa,  Global Health, Global Human Rights and International Organizations. We  have worked so close on so many issues. Sometimes she takes the lead;  sometimes I take the lead, but we are always striving for that same  outcome, and I thank her for her great support for this. It really is  an honor to work with the gentlewoman.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Rewards for Justice Act  introduced by our good friends,   Joe Wilson and Congressman Deutch. It  is a good bipartisan bill, and I think it will really make a  difference.   The bill would expand the Rewards for Justice program at the State  Department to authorize rewards for individuals coming forward with  information on sanctions evasion practices.   The bill was inspired by Bassam Barabandi, a Syrian defector and  former diplomat at the Syrian embassy in Washington, who worked to  provide passports to critics of the criminal Assad regime.   For years after his defection, Bassam lobbied the U.S. Government  with information on Syrian oligarchs close to Assad, detailing their  sanctions evasion practices. Bassam's assistance highlighted the need  to create a clear mechanism to incentivize individuals to come forward  with this kind of vital information.   The legislation will do just that and ultimately enhance compliance  with U.S. and international sanctions, increase confidence in the rule  of law, and bring criminals and rogue regimes seeking to circumvent  U.S. law to justice.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
