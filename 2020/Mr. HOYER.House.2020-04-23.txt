 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I have heard a number of people, including my friend, the minority  leader, stand up and say we need to act in a bipartisan fashion, and  the next statement is a partisan attack on one of our Members. It is  either schizophrenia or a lack of understanding of what this Congress  has been doing over the last few weeks.   I don't know about you, Madam Speaker, but I have been working 6  hours, 7 hours on the phone and another 3 or 4 hours reviewing the  materials that have gotten us here today.   Why did it take so long? Because it took 2 weeks for my Republican  colleagues--and this is a partisan statement, I understand that, but I  think we ought to all be realistic.   We are all trying to get to a place where America and Americans are  safe and where our economy is working, because the statistics we see  are statistics of pain and of fear and of anxiety about tomorrow.                                time  1415    So what have we been doing? We have been on the phone with one  another. I have talked to the minority leader numerous times over the  last 2 weeks, not only on this particular piece of legislation, but on  the process going forward.   So if anybody on that side is saying that Congress is not working,  they must be speaking for themselves, because every one of these  colleagues on my side of the aisle--and I believe on their side of the  aisle--has been working very hard: in touch with their local  government, in touch with their Governor, in touch with their  healthcare delivery people, anybody who works in a hospital or a  healthcare center or a federally qualified health center. They are  working hard.   Let us not denigrate ourselves or this institution or our commitment  to the American people because that is blatant partisanship.   We waited 2 weeks, Madam Speaker, that is correct. What for? So that  the proposal that we made 2 weeks ago--or 3 weeks ago--which has now  effectively been accepted by the Republicans would be accepted. That is  what we waited for.   And what did we get? $120 billion additional money for small  business. And be assured, we are talking about for the small business.  What this bill does is puts $120 billion, in addition, $370 billion,  for small business.   Now, we are talking about bipartisanship. The first bill we did  dealing  [[Page H1942]]  with coronavirus on this floor passed 415-2. It doesn't sound like  partisanship to me. It sounds like we came together and agreed on how  we could help. And it wasn't enough.   And then on phase two, which we passed on March 14, 10 days later, is  Congress not working? Ten days later, we passed 363-40. It doesn't  sound like partisanship to me.   And then phase three we passed on March 27, 13 days later, on a voice  vote, with only one Member in the Senate or the House demurring.   It doesn't sound like partisanship to me, Madam Speaker, and I don't  think today's vote will be a partisan vote. I certainly hope it will  not be.   Why? Because for the last 2 weeks, we have been working with one  another to try to get to a place where we think we are giving the  needed resources, because we think the initial request was  shortchanging hospitals, shortchanging testing. It still shortchanges  our States and local government, and so we will need another bill to  try to get there.   Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, the Senate came together to pass this  legislation in a bipartisan way. Now, unlike the House, no Senators  came to the floor except three or four. They did it by unanimous  consent. We are not able to do that--although I think this bill will  pass overwhelmingly--because some of our Republican friends wanted to  vote.   Fine. We are here. We are wearing masks. I am not wearing a mask  while I am speaking, but as soon as I stop speaking, I am going to put  my mask back on as I turn around to go among us. Congress is doing its  job.   And I want to tell the American people one more time: Members are  working daily to respond to the coronavirus that is putting our people  and our country and our economy at risk.   Last month, we enacted emergency legislation that included more than  $2 trillion in assistance for workers, veterans, small businesses,  healthcare systems, and communities dealing with the spread of  coronavirus. One of the programs we created together was the Paycheck  Protection Program to try to keep people on a payroll, even if they  could not go to work because health professionals say don't congregate.   The Paycheck Protection Program provides loans to small businesses  that will be forgiven--that will be forgiven--if they keep their  workers on the payroll. The need was so great that the initial $350  billion, as has been pointed out, in funding, Madam Speaker, was  exhausted in a matter of days. So, today, we are providing another $310  billion for that program, and an additional $60 billion for the most  at-risk small businesses.   Critically, $60 billion of that, as I just said, will be set aside  for smaller banks where they focus on community development financial  institutions that service businesses in rural and minority communities  that were left out of the initial program.   I bet if you ask your small businesses or rural people, your  hospitals or those State officials who are saying testing is essential,  I bet they would say: I am glad you waited because you got us resources  that we needed.   That wasn't in the initial proposal, of course, that came from the  administration, and it was objected to, and the leader in the Senate  would not provide for such sums.   More help is still needed, of course, for nonprofits as well as small  and minority-owned businesses, those in underbanked communities and the  self-employed. Those must be, Madam Speaker, priorities in the next  bill that, clearly, is going to be necessary.   In addition to the increased funding for the Paycheck Protection  Program, Democrats insisted on recapitalizing economic injury disaster  loans as well, providing an additional $60 billion for this program,  which can be leveraged to $300 billion.   Yes, we asked for, we worked for, we negotiated to get small  businesses, minority businesses, businesses that couldn't get into the  system that the other bigger businesses got in--some so big that they  were ashamed and gave the money back.   We are also providing an additional $75 billion for hospitals and,  crucially, $25 billion for testing.   I guarantee you, not one of your hospitals is going to call you up  and say: You should have acted sooner and not had the hospitals in  there--not one of them. And no Governor or county executive or mayor or  county commissioner or county council person is going to say: Gee whiz,  we didn't want that money for testing.   We will not be able to return our economy to normal operations, Madam  Speaker, without a robust testing system in place to know we can safely  go to work without putting workers at risk and to identify those who  have coronavirus so we can take necessary steps to isolate them and  trace those with whom they came in contact, because that is how we win  this battle.    This bill is an interim step, the fourth interim step as we continue  to work on the next major piece of legislation. I hope we can include,  by the way, Madam Speaker, in the next bill, provisions that,  unfortunately, we were unable to secure in this bill.   First of all, we shortchanged--we are all in the Nation's Capital.  Millions of Americans come here, and we gave Wyoming and Vermont--small  States, less population than the District of Columbia, the Nation's  Capital, to which millions of your constituents will come. We  shortchanged them by giving them 40 percent of what we gave the  smallest States, smaller than the District of Columbia.   We wanted to add that $700 million in this bill. Unfortunately, we  couldn't get agreement on that. I think that was penny-wise and pound- foolish for those of us who want our constituents to visit Washington  to see their government.   We also must include more help for State and local governments. They  have been on the front lines of fighting this scourge and, as a result,  have spent a lot of resources they budgeted for other issues, including  employees, including police and fire and health workers. We need to do  that. We wanted to do it in this bill. But those of you who argue for  delay, I will bet that you are going to vote in the next tranche for  additional State and local help--maybe not all of you. Why you are  delaying that help is beyond me.   This, by the way, is not an abstract accounting problem. We are  talking about States and counties across the country being able to keep  teachers, first responders as tax revenues collapse due to the  necessary social distancing.   This pandemic, Madam Speaker, has shown a spotlight on the stark  disparities in health status and treatment of African Americans in  particular and minority communities in general. That reality is an  indefensible and unacceptable one.   While we do include new ways of tracking certain data relating to  racial disparities in this pandemic, there is more we must do, not  simply for those who are at greater risk, but for all of us who wear a  mask; not because we don't want to be with one another, but because  this pandemic has made us a risk to others, to our neighbors, our  friends, our family.   Furthermore, we need to do more to protect our elections. My Governor  has ordered that an election that is coming up next Tuesday be all by  mail. Now, in Wisconsin, the Governor tried to do that and Republicans  fought us. The Republican speaker of the Wisconsin House was covered  from head to toe in a gown, super mask, and gloves.   Do we want to ask all of our citizens to be so at risk because they  are exercising their franchise to vote in America? I surely think that  is not the case.   And so we need some additional money to facilitate, because they  didn't plan on it, because they didn't plan on this pandemic, to allow  our citizens to vote, to encourage them to vote, to facilitate their  vote, to welcome their vote, and to provide for a way that they can do  it safely without endangering themselves or others.   Furthermore, we need to do more to protect our elections in this  administration. I am glad that the House is moving forward today with  the creation of a select committee to oversee the coronavirus response.   Now, my friends on the other side of the aisle had eight different  partisan commissions overseeing what happened in Benghazi where four  American lives were tragically lost. 44,575 Americans have lost their  lives. Is it too much to ask that we would have a special committee to  make sure that the money that we are appropriating in historic amounts  is spent correctly?  [[Page H1943]]    Congress has a responsibility to ensure that the extraordinary sums  we have authorized and appropriated are disbursed efficiently and  consistent with our intent. Such great sums can not only be a source of  economic recovery, but, surely, everyone on this floor knows that that  sum of money on the table can also be a magnet for waste, fraud, abuse,  and, yes, criminality. We owe the American people, as we appropriate  unbelievable sums, to make sure that the American people are the ones  advantaged.   Any time Congress spends taxpayer money, particularly in such large  amounts, we owe it to the American people to know where that money is  going and to ensure that it is being spent as directed.   Now, I know the President of the United States said he is going to do  the oversight. I don't think that is what the Framers had in mind in  terms of checks and balances.   And in the most efficient and ethical ways possible, we must know  which programs are working best, which aren't, and that way we can  modify what we do in the future.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Speaker Pelosi. I want to thank the  chair of the Small Business Committee, and I want to thank the chair of  the Financial Services Committee. I want to thank the chair of the  Education and Labor Committee.   I want to thank Mr. Neal, who is on the floor, and many other chairs,  Mr. Peterson, who is very nervous about not having a nutrition program  in this bill, which we wanted. That would have delayed it further  because, of course, we didn't get support on the other side of the  aisle for that. But people are in incredibly long food lines because  their nutritional health, as well as their psychological health, is at  risk because they can't get food.                                time  1430    I thank Speaker Pelosi for having the courage and the wisdom to stand  up and say, ``We need these items.'' And we have gotten a lot of them.  We asked for $500 billion total. This is $484 billion total.   My, my, my, you held out for 2 weeks for a $16 billion savings.   I also thank our Members who have been working--let me repeat this  once again, Madam Speaker. These Members, those Members, have been  working round-the-clock to make sure their communities are safe, to  make sure their hospitals are getting what they need, to make sure that  their teachers are teaching kids at home. Everybody has been working  hard. You may not see us, but millions and millions and millions of  Americans are working at home. They are teleworking. That is  essentially what we have been doing--teleworking. And don't tell them  they are not working, because they know they are working. They have  been a credit to their districts. Every Member--Republican, Democrat--I  presume, and I only know about the Democrats--225 of our 234 have been  on the phone 2\1/2\ hours a day talking back and forth between one  another to see what policies we need. They have been a credit to their  districts, to the institutions of the House and this Nation, spending  hours on the phone, through videoconference, making sure that Congress  is doing its job, and talking to State and local leaders and healthcare  providers.   Let me thank the Members and staff who volunteered to be here on the  floor. We will go off the floor and we won't be as exposed as they are.  They are all wearing masks. They are wearing masks because they know  there is a risk. Perhaps not as great a risk as those courageous  individuals who work in our hospitals and our healthcare providers in  many different modes, but courageous and patriotic, nonetheless. Thank  you, staff.   I thank those who are working in our grocery stores, our police, our  fire, our truck drivers, who are getting food and products from here to  there; EMS personnel who respond to emergencies; delivery workers. And  every time I go to the grocery store--and I hope all of you do it--I  thank those people who are stocking the shelves. I thank those people  who are checking us out. I thank those people who are putting the carts  where they need to be. They are the best of America, and we owe it to  them to do all we can to bring this pandemic to an end as quickly and  safely as possible. We all want to go back to work in the regular  fashion. The Democratic-led House will continue to do everything  possible, working with our Republican friends, who we believe want the  same objective, a safe America, a working America.   We want to help small businesses, workers, and their families get  through this crisis, and to ensure that our courageous healthcare  workers who are on the front lines have all the support necessary to  win this fight against COVID-19.   Madam Speaker, I hope, and I pray that every Member of Congress will  vote for America and Americans, and vote for this bill. We may need  more, but we certainly need to do this this day and get more assistance  to the American people.
