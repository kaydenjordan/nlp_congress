SEC. 5. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the House of       Representatives, provided that such statement has been       submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend and include extraneous  materials on H.R. 2486.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2486, Fostering Undergraduate  Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education, or better known as the  FUTURE Act.   This bill is an absolutely crucial piece of legislation. It  represents the number one priority of our minority-serving  institutions, which educate nearly 30 percent of all undergraduate  students in America.   The FUTURE Act would reauthorize title 3, part F of the Higher  Education Act, providing $255 million in funding for MSIs for the next  2 years.   This includes:   $85 million of historically Black colleges and universities;   $30 million for Tribal colleges and universities;   $100 million for Hispanic-serving institutions; and   $15 million each for predominantly Black institutions, Alaska Native  and Native Hawaiian-serving institutions and Asian American and Native  American Pacific Islander-serving institutions.   First authorized in 2010, title 3, part F have helped MSIs prepare  their students for STEM professions, fortified failing infrastructure  on MSIs campuses, and provided fiscal stability for many of our smaller  MSIs.   In order for MSIs to continue this work for fiscal year 2020 and  beyond, the House must act tonight and ensure that our low-income,  first generation college students are not left behind. This bill is  about their future.   H.R. 2486 is not only integral to MSIs and the millions of students  that they serve, it is also responsible legislation that is completely  paid for, not adding one cent to the deficit. H.R. 2486 does this by  repealing automatic maintenance fees, a relic of the now-defunct  Federal Family Education Loan Program, where the government-paid  private institutions called guaranty agencies to manage student loan  accounts. And with the Federal Government now directly lending to  student borrowers, these fees are no longer paid, and are increasingly  being phased out.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for support for H.R. 2486, and I include in the  Record a letter from the American Council on Education and 43 other  national organizations in support of passage of this bill tonight by  the House.                                  American Council on Education,                                 Washington, DC, September 16, 2019.      Representative Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Representative Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: On behalf of the       undersigned organizations representing Historically Black       Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and       Universities (TCUs), Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs),       other Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), and the higher       education community at large, we write to ask that you and       the members you lead vote in favor of H.R. 2486, the       Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for       Education (FUTURE) Act when it comes up for a vote tomorrow.        This bicameral, bipartisan bill was introduced by       Representative Alma Adams (D-NC) and Representative Mark       Walker (R-NC) to extend vital mandatory funding for Science,       Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education,       student completion and infrastructure programs benefiting       HBCUs, TCUs, HSIs, and other MSIs in Title III, Part F of the       Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) before it expires on       September 30, 2019.        Mandatory funding for STEM education and other programs at       these important institutions was first instituted when the       College Cost and Reduction Act of 2007 was signed into law.       This bill passed both the House and Senate on a bipartisan       basis and allowed for mandatory funding to flow to HBCUs,       TCUs, HSIs and other MSIs from 2008 to 2009. Shortly       thereafter, the Higher Education Opportunity Act, which       maintained this important stream of funding, passed both the       House and Senate on a bipartisan basis and was signed into       law in 2008.        It was not until 2010 that these mandatory funds were       extended for an additional ten years because Congress       recognized the value in securing funding for institutions       that served large numbers of low-income, first-generation       college students of color.        According to a recent report, there are more than ``20       million young people of color in the United States whose       representations in STEM education pathways and in the STEM       workforce [fall] . . . far below their proportions of the       general population.'' It was emphasized in this report that       ``the educational outcomes and STEM readiness of students of       color will have direct implications on America's economic       growth, national security, and global prosperity.''        Furthermore, a report released by the White House's       National Science and Technology Council stated that the       ``national benefits of a strong STEM foundation cannot be       fully realized until all members of society have equitable       access to STEM education and [until] there is much broader       participation by those historically underserved and       underrepresented in STEM fields . . .'' The report goes on to       highlight the importance of diversity in the workplace       leading to more engaged, innovative, and higher-performing       organizations.        It is clear that diversifying our STEM workforce should be       a priority for our country and would pay immediate dividends       to our economy. The FUTURE Act helps avoid a $2.55 billion-      dollar cliff in funding over 10 years for HBCUs, TCUs, HSIs,       and other MSIs by extending mandatory funding until Fiscal       Year 2021. This bill is revenue neutral and allows these       important institutions to continue the valuable work of       offering quality STEM programs.        We thank you for your consideration of this request, and       look forward to working with you to enact this legislation       before the September 30 deadline.            Sincerely,                                                      Ted Mitchell,                                                         President.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), the chair of the Committee on Education and  Labor, of which I am privileged to serve under.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   AMFs are a maintenance fee given to guaranty agencies for a program  that no longer originates new loans. And while some guaranty agencies  may be using AMFs for financial literacy, it is important to know that  these are auxiliary activities not required by HEA, and guaranty  agencies do not report any information on these activities.   There is no data across agencies that show how much of the AMF, if  any, is actually being used for this type of outreach or what the  actual impact will be on students in your district.   If this were true when Republicans had control of the House, they  would have moved a bill to permanently authorize funds to these  institutions. Instead, the Republicans allowed for the expiration to  happen in hopes that it would be eliminated through no action.   The MSI mandatory funding is a unique program, and it expires in less  than 15 days. And this justifies immediate action. I also mentioned  that these schools will lose a tremendous amount of money that they  need, and I just want to remind the gentlewoman from North Carolina  (Ms. Foxx) that we are talking about $1.1 million in fiscal years 2017  and 2018 to Winston-Salem State University; that is in the Fifth  District.   As we look at all of the schools that will benefit from this funding,  I think we have some responsibility to help these young people--who, we  said to them, You need an education--and help them move through this  process that will make it easier for them to not only stay in school,  but for these colleges and universities to stay open.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, but before I close, I do  want to, first of all, thank both gentlemen from North Carolina,  Representative Walker and Representative Budd, for their support of  HBCUs.   Congressman Walker is correct. He represents the largest public HBCU  in the Nation, of which I had the privilege of studying at and  graduating from twice, North Carolina A&T, and served that school for  more than 40 years in the district.   I am watching Congressman Walker, and I appreciate him and  Representative Budd and all the support they are giving to our HBCUs.   I taught 40 years at Bennett College in Greensboro, so HBCUs are  really running through my veins.   Mr. Speaker, I will include in the Record letters of support  submitted by 36 individual schools--IHEs, HBCUs--for the passage of  this bill, and I have some other documents that I also will include in  the Record from NAFEO, UNCF, and TMCF, and also from Harry Williams  from TMCF.   Mr. Speaker, let me just say before I close, Mr. Budd mentioned a  couple of those statistics about our schools.   Our schools, HBCUs, confer 40 percent of all STEM degrees, 60 percent  of all engineering degrees. We educate 50 percent of African American  teachers and 40 percent of African American health professionals. We  produce 70 percent of African American dentists and physicians. I could  go on and on.   Yes, there is a serious economic impact of about $15 billion--$14.8  billion, to be specific. We are not slouching. HBCUs are doing a lot  with a little. We still don't receive equitable funding, but this,  certainly, will help not only the colleges and universities, the MSIs,  but it is also going to help our students--first-generation students,  as I was--who have the privilege of going on and getting a good  education from one of our Nation's best HBCUs.   Let me say before I close, I, again, thank both gentlemen, and I ask  the House to approve H.R. 2486.   Mr. Speaker, I want to rebut a couple of things.   First, as has been explained, account maintenance fees are a  dwindling source of funds. They have been made obsolete now, and they  are being replaced by the Direct Loan Program. The funds now represent  3.5 percent of the average guaranty agency's total revenue, which last  year totaled about $4 billion. When the opposition talks about AMFs and  how important they are, we have to note that they are referring to just  3.5 percent of $4 billion.   I would also like to say that because funds from AMFs can be used for  whatever purpose they desire, on the contrary, title III, part F only  can be used for specific purposes that improve institutional stability  and academic programs.   We don't want to be on record saying that $140 million that may be  used to help low-income students is more important than $255 million  that must help low-income students, which comprises about 60 percent of  the population at our HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs.   The other side says that the mandatory funds should not go to  institutions, but account maintenance fees are exactly that. They are  funds that must be paid by the government to private institutions.   Our HBCUs account for 3 percent of all colleges and universities. We  graduate 10 percent of all Black college graduates, a third of Black  STEM professionals.   Our TCUs serve geographically remote areas that help close gaps in  healthcare services and formal education attainment in Tribal  communities. Since 1965, the Federal Government has tried to atone for  this neglect by providing institutional aid to these students.   To turn our backs on these schools by letting these important  mandatory funds expire, which it has already been noted will expire in  about 2 weeks, is unconscionable. It is a slap in the face to many who  look to these schools as their ticket to the middle class.   Mr. Speaker, I have already submitted those documents for the Record,  but I do want to urge all of my colleagues to pass this FUTURE Act. It  is about the future of our schools, the future of our students, those  who need that opportunity, the opportunity that W.E.B. Du Bois spoke  about when he said, ``Of all the civil rights for which the world has  struggled and fought for 500 years, the right to learn is undoubtedly  the most fundamental.''   I thank my colleagues for continuing to believe in that fundamental  right for these young people to have that opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the Chamber again to support and champion our low- income, our first-generation college students by approving H.R. 2486,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
