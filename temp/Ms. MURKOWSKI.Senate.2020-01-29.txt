 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on  behalf of myself and Senator Young and Senator Crapo. The question is  to be directed to both parties.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question directed to counsel for the President and the House  managers:         The Constitution does not specify the standard of proof to       be used in trials of impeachment, and the Senate has not       adopted a uniform standard by rule, thus, the standard of       proof is arguably a question for each individual Senator. In       the Clinton trial and now with President Trump, it appears       that Republicans and Democrats apply different standards       depending on whether the President is a member of their       party. What standard of proof should be used in trials of       impeachment--preponderance of the evidence, clear and       convincing, beyond a reasonable doubt--and why?    I think it is the turn of the House managers to go first.   Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, there is no court  case on this. The House needs strong evidence, but it has never been  decided beyond a reasonable doubt, as the President's counsel has  suggested, and, as the question notes, the Constitution does not  specify either the House's evidentiary burden of proof or the Senate's.   I would note that the House Judiciary Committee held itself to a  clear and convincing standard of proof in the Nixon matter, which  requires that the evidence of wrongdoing must be substantially more  probable to be true than not and that the trier of fact must have a  firm belief in its factuality. In the Clinton case, the House did not  commit to any particular burden of proof. And I would recommend against  including an express standard; instead, like in Clinton's, simply  finding the facts and any inferences from those facts without legal  technicalities.   It has been opined that, in the end, it is up to each Senator to make  a judgment, and I think there is much truth to that. Your oath holds  you to a finding of impartial justice, and I trust that each and every  one of you is holding that oath very dear to your heart and will find  the facts and lead to a just result for our country, the Constitution,  and for a future that hopefully is as free as our past has been.   I yield back.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for the  question.   I think that the Constitution makes it clear in the terms that it  speaks of impeachment, all are related to the criminal law. It speaks  of an offense. It speaks of conviction. It speaks of a trial in saying  that crimes shall be tried by a jury except in the case of impeachment.   In both that and the gravity of a Presidential impeachment, which is  an issue of breathtaking importance for the country and could cause  tremendous disruption to our government, both counsel are in favor of  traditional criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.   In the Clinton impeachment, Senators--both Republicans and  Democrats--repeatedly advocated in favor of that standard.   Senator Russ Feingold then said:         In making a decision of this magnitude, it is best not to       err at all. If we must err, however, we should err on the       side . . . of respecting the will of the people.    Similarly, Senator Barbara Mikulski said:         The U.S. Senate must not make the decision to remove a       President based on a hunch that the charges may be true. The       strength of our Constitution and the strength of our Nation       dictate that the Senate be sure beyond a reasonable doubt.    The preponderance standard is wholly insufficient. That means just  50.1 percent. You think it is a little more likely than not. That is  not sufficient to remove the President. Even clear and convincing  evidence is not. It has to be beyond a reasonable doubt. As Senator  Rockefeller explained at the time of the Clinton impeachment, that  means ``it is proven to a moral certainty the case is clear.'' That is  the standard the Senators should apply because the gravity of the issue  before you would not permit applying any lesser standard.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.    Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Alaska.    I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. Senator Murkowski's question is for the  House managers:         In early October, Mr. Cipollone sent the letter saying none       of the subpoenas issued by the House were appropriately       authorized and thus invalid. When the House passed their       resolution authorizing the impeachment inquiry, and granting       subpoena power to the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees,       the body could have addressed the deficiency the White House       pointed out and proclaimed those subpoenas as valid exercises       of the impeachment inquiry. Alternatively, the House could       have reissued the subpoenas after the resolution was adopted.       Please explain why neither of those actions took place.    Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Chief Justice, Senator, I appreciate  your question.   These arguments, plain and simple, are a red herring. The House's  impeachment inquiry and its subpoenas were fully authorized by the  Constitution, House rules, and precedent. It is for the House, not the  President, to decide how to conduct an impeachment inquiry.   The House's autonomy to structure its own proceedings for impeachment  inquiry is rooted in two provisions of article I of the Constitution.  First, article I vests the House with the ``sole Power of  Impeachment.'' It contains no requirements--no requirements--as to how  the House must carry out that responsibility.   Second, article I states that the House is empowered to determine the  rules of proceedings. Taken together, these provisions give the House  sole discretion to determine the manner in which they investigate,  deliberate, and vote for grounds of impeachment.   In exercising its responsibility to investigate and consider the  impeachment of a President of the United States, the House is  constitutionally entitled to relevant information from the executive  branch concerning the President's misconduct. The Framers, the courts,  and past Presidents have  [[Page S682]]  recognized and honored Congress's right to information in an  impeachment investigation and is critical as a safeguard to our system  of divided powers; otherwise, a President could hide his own wrongdoing  to prevent Congress from discovering impeachable misconduct,  effectively nullifying--nullifying--Congress's impeachment power.   That is precisely what President Trump has tried to achieve here. The  President has asserted the power to determine for himself which  congressional subpoenas he will respond to and those that he will not.  The President's counsel would have you believe that each time anyone in  the executive branch gets a subpoena, it is open season for creative  lawyers in the White House and DOJ to start inventing theories about  House rules and parliamentary precedent.   This is not how the separation of powers works, and to accept that  argument would wholly undermine the House's and Senate's ability to  provide oversight of the executive branch. It would also make  impeachment a nullity.   The President argues that there was no resolution fully authorizing  the impeachment inquiry, but, again, there is no requirement for the  full House to take a vote before conducting an impeachment inquiry.  President Trump and his lawyers invented this theory.   As Chief Judge Howell of the U.S. District Court in DC has stated,  and this is a direct quote: ``This [claim] has no textual support in  the U.S. Constitution [or] the governing rules of the House.''   The Constitution itself says nothing about how the House may exercise  its sole power of impeachment, but instead confirms the House shall  have the sole power to determine the rules of its own proceedings. This  conclusion is also confirmed by precedent. Numerous judges have been  subjected to impeachment investigations in the House and even impeached  by the House and convicted by the Senate without any previous vote of  the House authorizing an impeachment inquiry.   As recently as the 114th Congress, the Judiciary Committee considered  impeaching the IRS Commissioner following a referral from another  committee and absent a full House vote. The Judiciary Committee began  an investigation into President Nixon's misconduct for 4 months before  approval of a full House resolution.   The House rules also do not preclude committees from inquiring into  the potential grounds for impeachment. Instead, those rules vest the  relevant committees of the House with robust investigatory powers,  including the power to issue subpoenas.   Each of the three committees that conducted the initial investigation  of President Trump's conduct in Ukraine--Intelligence, Oversight, and  Foreign Affairs--indisputably had oversight jurisdiction over these  matters. The President's counsel has pointed to the Nixon impeachment  with a full House.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you very much. Thank you.   Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Thank you. I yield back.
