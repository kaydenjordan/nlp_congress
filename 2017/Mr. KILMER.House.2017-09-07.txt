 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to this block of  amendments, and I do appreciate that this block seeks to increase  funding to address the National Park Service's $11.3 billion backlog of  deferred maintenance.   I firmly believe that we need to increase annual appropriations for  our parks, but funding shouldn't come at the expense of other critical  agency accounts.   In my neck of the woods, the Olympic National Park, alone, has $150  million in backlogged maintenance needs, so we are not going to  accomplish this enormous goal a few million dollars at a time. The real  solution is for Congress to provide a robust and dedicated funding  source, and that is why I partnered with Representative Hurd and my  fellow Washingtonian, Representative Reichert, to introduce the  National Park Service Legacy Act, which will create a dedicated source  of funding to address the National Park Service maintenance backlog.  This bipartisan and bicameral bill is funded through unobligated  mineral royalties and would generate up to $500 million, annually,  through 2047.   So, if we are serious about addressing the overwhelming maintenance  backlog in our national parks, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendment and join me in support of the National Park Service Legacy  Act.
