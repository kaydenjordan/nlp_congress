 Madam Speaker, the Appropriations Committee has now  passed legislation with $75.3 million in funding for the construction  of a new lock at the Soo Locks.   This is the first time in decades the construction of a new lock at  the Soo Locks is being funded in legislation.   I have been pushing for this funding with my work on the  Appropriations Committee, and I am grateful for the support of our  colleagues.   Right now, the lock is 50 years old, and it has survived harsh  winters through extraordinary maintenance.  [[Page H4054]]    However, if it were to fail for an extended period, it would create a  cascading problem for the economy and national security, because iron  ore that goes through the locks would have no way to get from Lake  Superior to factories across the country.   Also, this is an issue that Democrats, Republicans, and President  Trump all agree on.   When President Trump came to Michigan last year, I was joined by  Congressman Bergman and Congressman Mitchell. We told the President  about the Soo Locks, and he pledged his support. That was backed up in  March when the Army Corps of Engineers requested $75.3 million in its  budget for next year.   I appreciate and want to thank President Trump for his leadership on  this. That request is funded in legislation now, and I look forward to  working with my colleagues to keep this construction moving forward in  the years to come.                            ____________________
