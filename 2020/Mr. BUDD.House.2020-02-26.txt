 Madam Speaker, I rise today to reflect on the life of Jo  Allison Smith, a dear friend to many and lifelong North Carolinian who  passed away Saturday, February 15.   Jo was the devoted wife to Eddie Smith, Jr., for over 57 years, as  well as a loving mother to their son, Chris.   Beyond family, Jo was passionate about her faith and served as an  active member of St. James United Methodist Church in Greenville, North  Carolina. She will no doubt be remembered for her extraordinary voice,  which graced the music program for years.   She was also a strong supporter of women in need. She helped found  and lead Women for Women's Power of the Purse and served on the board  of many other local charities.   Jo was a passionate supporter of the UNC Tar Heels, where she served  on the Board of Visitors for the UNC Comprehensive Cancer Center and  graced UNC football fans with a wonderful rendition of our national  anthem.   Our State was blessed by Jo's presence, and our family was blessed to  call her friend. Please join me in giving thanks for Jo's life and  praying for the entire Smith family during this time.                            ____________________
