General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.  [[Page H2513]]     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, last night the Rules Committee met and reported a  rule, House Resolution 429, providing for consideration of three  measures: H.J. Res. 45, H.R. 467, and S.J. Res. 11.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 467 under a structured  rule, with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking minority member of the Energy and Commerce Committee or  their designees and provides one motion to recommit.   The rule further provides for consideration of H.J. Res. 45 and S.J.  Res. 11 under closed rules, with 1 hour of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the committee of  jurisdiction or to their designees.   Finally, the rule provides one motion to commit for S.J. Res. 11 and  one motion to recommit for H.J. Res. 45.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the rule and the  underlying legislation. Included within the measure is H.R. 467, the  HALT Fentanyl Act. It is important to say that the HALT Fentanyl Act  makes great strides in addressing the growing fentanyl crisis in our  country. By making permanent the scheduling of fentanyl-related analogs  in the schedule I category, in addition to giving researchers the  ability to conduct studies on these substances, we can begin to repair  the damage that this drug has inflicted on our communities and our  Nation.   I spent almost three decades practicing as a physician. I have  witnessed and heard so many devastating stories of the consequences of  this crisis which we now face. We face it in north Texas; we face it  across the country.   Between September and March, nearly a dozen teens spread across three  schools in Carrollton, Texas, were injured because of fentanyl  poisoning. In fact, three of those poisonings were fatal. One death is  too many, and we must equip our communities to address this issue from  the source.   The Committee on Energy and Commerce has a long history of producing  bipartisan policies to actually address the opioid crisis in this  country. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, known as the  SUPPORT Act of 2018, was a product of our committee, and it made  reforms to the way we administer programs to control and respond to and  better treat individuals who have a problem with opioids.   However, the landscape has drastically changed. It is now a different  disease than what it was in 2018, so we have gone from diversion of  prescription opioids to the manufacture and importation of illicit  fentanyl, products that are created in the People's Republic of China  in their base form, exported to Mexico, imported by cartels, and  poisoning our children.   We need to better understand the effects of fentanyl and fentanyl- related substances to better treat patients suffering from exposure.  The HALT Fentanyl Act will improve regulations to encourage research so  we can better understand the impacts of fentanyl on human health.   Our recent bipartisan mental health package passed in the Energy and  Commerce Committee worked on several provisions that would relax  regulations to expand access to evidence-based treatment programs and  ease restrictions on treatment options for substance use care.   Finally, the HALT Fentanyl Act will ensure that law enforcement  officers have the tools to prosecute cases relating to fentanyl and  fentanyl-related substances. Due to the crisis at our southern border,  illicit fentanyl remains an imminent threat throughout the country. At  a time when people are dying at alarming rates from fentanyl poisoning,  this legislation is an absolute necessity to counteract this crisis and  save our young American lives.                                time  1230    Madam Speaker, also included in this package is a provision that  would repeal a continuation of President Biden's war on affordable  energy and consumer choice.   S.J. Res 11 would be instrumental in protecting American families who  would suffer from additional costs passed along to them and ensure that  they, the American public, are able to select vehicles that best fit  their needs rather than functionaries in the administration in a far- removed Washington, D.C.   If not for our Republican majority, Madam Speaker, President Biden  could continue to act unilaterally to enact his radical Green New Deal  agenda. Thankfully, the American public saw fit to entrust Republicans  with the majority in the people's House to prevent President Biden and  Democrats from acting upon their worst impulses.   Once again, Democrats have seen fit to attack a vital component of  our Nation's economy. Why Democrats would want to make more difficult  the lives of those who deliver our food and our goods to our grocery  stores and our homes, and the fuel to our gas stations, I do not know.   Madam Speaker, what I do know is that every American owes these  hardworking men and women a tremendous debt of gratitude that we will  not soon be able to repay.   Madam Speaker, in 2021, trucks moved close to 11 billion tons of  freight across America. That is over 70 percent of the cargo shipped in  the continental United States.   During the COVID-19 pandemic, some were sitting in the comfort of  their homes while dozens of Amazon packages were dropped at their  doorsteps. That was only because of these long-haul drivers who  traverse our Nation daily, ensuring our communities are supplied with  goods that allow Americans to enjoy a high standard of living and  literally preventing American families from starving during the  pandemic.   So it is bewildering, Madam Speaker, that Democrats have decided to  reward the courage and perseverance of long-haul truckers with onerous  and expensive new regulations that will have a devastating effect upon  their livelihoods.   Madam Speaker, implementing these new regulations and standards will  burden truck drivers with as much as $8,000 per driver in new costs  when it comes time to retire their current vehicles.   Democrats pride themselves on being advocates of the little guy, the  downtrodden, but I would ask you, Madam Speaker, how is forcing  Americans already suffering from the sky-high inflation brought to us  by the Biden administration, saddling them with an additional $8,000  from their hard-earned dollars, how is that lightening their burden?  Madam Speaker, simply, it does not.   Once again, President Biden and members of the Democratic Party are  so single-minded in their pursuit of this Green New Deal agenda that  they are blind to the obvious collateral damage that their policies are  inflicting. Thankfully, our Republican majority will be able to deliver  tangible relief by repealing this counterproductive and misguided  executive action.   Madam Speaker, today, we are also considering H.J. Res. 45 to  formally disapprove of the authority the administration claims it has  to unilaterally forgive student loans.   In August 2022, the Biden administration announced a plan to cancel  student debt up to $20,000 for Pell grant recipients and up to $10,000  for non-Pell grant recipients for those making under $125,000 a year.   Madam Speaker, on May 11, 2023, 2 weeks ago, a glorious day, the  public health emergency came to an end. Americans are back to work.  They are back to school. They are returning to normal life.   The Biden administration is attempting to claim authority for this  $315 billion student loan forgiveness through the COVID-19 national  emergency status and the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for  Students Act, the so-called HEROES Act of 2003. This 2003 law provided  temporary relief to military members during their deployment following  9/11. This is a twisted interpretation of a bill that compensated our  Nation's servicemen and -women for their heroic efforts after the  Nation was attacked on 9/11.   The bottom line is this is quite likely unconstitutional. It is an  overreach of executive authority and would not make student debt  disappear. It would instead unfairly shift the burden of  [[Page H2514]]  student loans to the 87 percent of Americans who did not take out such  loans.   Madam Speaker, this is an important rule to consider these important  bills.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Langworthy), a valuable member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy), another member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Norman), another member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Molinaro).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Johnson), a fellow member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, it is important to point out, first off, that the  Republican House has voted on and passed an increase to the Nation's  debt limit. This happened 2 weeks ago. Further action is awaiting in  the Senate. Further action is awaiting down at the White House. This  House, under the leadership of Speaker McCarthy, has acted and acted  appropriately.   Furthermore, I would like to point out, in October of 2018, President  Trump signed the SUPPORT Act. The SUPPORT Act was the first meaningful  step toward countering what was at the time a crisis in this country  because of diversion of prescription drugs, the so-called opioid  crisis.   Mr. Speaker, it has changed since then. Since 2018, we are now faced  with a different disease in fentanyl poisoning brought to us because of  an open southern border, because the President has refused to secure  the southern border and because the border czar has refused to secure  the southern border. As a consequence, we have an unprecedented amount  of fentanyl flowing into our country.   Yes, it is quite right, apps on social media have made it easier for  kids to get access to this than ever before.   There is some good news. The Food and Drug Administration has allowed  for the over-the-counter sale of Narcan that is to begin this summer.  That is a good thing. However, that in no way counteracts the increase  in illicit fentanyl that is coming across the southern border because  of the refusal of this administration to secure our sovereign border.   Back in 2018 when the SUPPORT Act passed, it was largely through  bipartisan efforts on the Committee on Energy and Commerce that brought  that bill to its signing. Once again, I thank members of the Committee  on Energy and Commerce and members of the Senate for bringing before us  these important pieces of legislation to roll back the damage that  President Biden has done in the fentanyl crisis.   Republicans remain united in pursuing a legislative agenda that puts  the welfare of Americans above the special interests of a few.   Mr. Speaker, I urge fellow Members to support the rule and support  the underlying legislation.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Leger Fernandez is as  follows:     An Amendment to H. Res. 429 Offered by Ms. Leger Fernandez of New                                   Mexico         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 178) affirming the House of       Representatives' commitment to protect and strengthen Social       Security and Medicare. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees.  [[Page H2522]]         Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 178.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
