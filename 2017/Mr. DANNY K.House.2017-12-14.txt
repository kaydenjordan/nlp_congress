 DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, my good friend Timothy  ``Tim'' Bradford passed away last week.   Tim was a commissioner of the Cook County Metropolitan Water  Reclamation District, but he was much more than that. Tim grew up on  the west side of the city of Chicago, moved to the south suburbs, and  became known as the godfather of politics in south suburban Cook  County.   He was in love with everybody he met, involved in everything that  existed, and I simply express condolences to his wife and family on his  passing.
