 Madam Speaker, as co-chair of the Congressional Foster  Youth Caucus, I rise in recognition of National Foster Care Month and  in honor of the remarkable foster youth alumnus that I am fortunate to  host this week: Kennath Forsyth-Sears.   Kennath hails from the Ocean State, where he attends my alma mater,  Rhode Island College, and aspires to work with children with  disabilities.   Kennath is a reminder of why we must ensure every child has the  opportunity to reach their full potential. Madam Speaker, all children  need the support and love of a family, yet finding ``forever families''  for foster youth is one of our biggest challenges.   Madam Speaker, it is our moral duty to care for these children as we  would our own, including by supporting permanency for foster youth.   I thank my co-chair of the Congressional Foster Youth Caucus and the  leader of our Caucus, Congresswoman Karen Bass of California, for  bringing young people like Kennath to Capitol Hill for Foster Youth  Shadow Day, and I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring National  Foster Care Month.                            ____________________
