 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2002) to foster security in Taiwan, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2002         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Taiwan Assurance Act of       2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) April 10, 2019, marks the 40th anniversary of the       Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 (Public Law 96-8).        (2) Since 1949, the close relationship between the United       States and Taiwan has benefitted both parties and the broader       Indo-Pacific region.  [[Page H3456]]         (3) The security of Taiwan and its democracy are key       elements of continued peace and stability of the greater       Indo-Pacific region, which is in the political, security, and       economic interests of the United States.        (4) The People's Republic of China is currently engaged in       a comprehensive military modernization campaign to enhance       the power-projection capabilities of the People's Liberation       Army and its ability to conduct joint operations, which is       shifting the military balance of power across the Taiwan       Strait.        (5) Taiwan and its diplomatic partners continue to face       sustained pressure and coercion from the People's Republic of       China, which seeks to isolate Taiwan from the international       community.        (6) It is the policy of the United States to reinforce its       commitments to Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act in a       manner consistent with the ``Six Assurances'' and in       accordance with the United States ``One China'' policy.        (7) In the Taiwan Travel Act, which became law on March 16,       2018, Congress observed that the ``self-imposed restrictions       that the United States maintains on high-level visits''       between the United States and Taiwan have resulted in       insufficient high-level communication.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) Taiwan is a vital part of the United States Free and       Open Indo-Pacific Strategy;        (2) the United States Government--        (A) supports Taiwan's continued pursuit of asymmetric       capabilities and concepts; and        (B) urges Taiwan to increase its defense spending in order       to fully resource its defense strategy; and        (3) the United States should conduct regular sales and       transfers of defense articles to Taiwan in order to enhance       its self-defense capabilities, particularly its efforts to       develop and integrate asymmetric capabilities, including       undersea warfare and air defense capabilities, into its       military forces.       SEC. 4. TAIWAN'S INCLUSION IN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the People's Republic of China's attempts to dictate the       terms of Taiwan's participation in international       organizations, has, in many cases, resulted in Taiwan's       exclusion from such organizations even when statehood is not       a requirement, and that such exclusion--        (1) is detrimental to global health, civilian air safety,       and efforts to counter transnational crime;        (2) negatively impacts the safety and security of citizens       globally; and        (3) negatively impacts the security of Taiwan and its       democracy.        (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United       States to advocate for Taiwan's meaningful participation in       the United Nations, the World Health Assembly, the       International Civil Aviation Organization, the International       Criminal Police Organization, and other international bodies,       as appropriate, and to advocate for Taiwan's membership in       the Food and Agriculture Organization, the United Nations       Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and other       international organizations for which statehood is not a       requirement for membership.       SEC. 5. REVIEW OF DEPARTMENT OF STATE TAIWAN GUIDELINES.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall       conduct a review of the Department of State's guidance that       governs relations with Taiwan, including the periodic       memorandum entitled ``Guidelines on Relations with Taiwan''       and related documents, and reissue such guidance to executive       branch departments and agencies.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the Department of State's guidance regarding relations with       Taiwan--        (1) should be crafted with the intent to deepen and expand       United States-Taiwan relations, and be based on the value,       merits, and importance of the United States-Taiwan       relationship;        (2) should be crafted giving due consideration to the fact       that Taiwan is governed by a representative democratic       government that is peacefully constituted through free and       fair elections that reflect the will of the people of Taiwan,       and that Taiwan is a free and open society that respects       universal human rights and democratic values; and        (3) should ensure that the conduct of relations with Taiwan       reflects the longstanding, comprehensive, and values-based       relationship the United States shares with Taiwan, and       contribute to the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.        (c) Reporting Requirements.--Not later than 180 days after       the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State       shall submit to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the       Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of       Representatives a report that includes a description of--        (1) the results of the review pursuant to subsection (a) of       the Department of State's guidance on relations with Taiwan,       including a copy of the reissued ``Guidelines of Relations       with Taiwan'' memorandum; and        (2) the implementation of the Taiwan Travel Act (Public Law       115-135) and any changes to guidance on relations with Taiwan       that are the result of such implementation.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2002, the Taiwan Assurance Act of  2019.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 2002, the Taiwan Assurance Act of  2019.   Last month, we celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Taiwan  Relations Act, so it is fitting that we are standing here today to  bring two important measures to the floor, including this one, to  affirm the unwavering, bipartisan congressional support for Taiwan.   Taiwan serves as a steadfast and significant partner to the United  States, not just in the Indo-Pacific, but also around the world. It  makes substantial contributions to the international community by  tackling global challenges, from combating terrorism to promoting  public health; and it holds close the values we cherish the most,  standing as a beacon of democracy in Asia.   However, over the years, China has attempted to weaken Taiwan's  standing in the world. It has restricted Taiwan's access to  international organizations and poached its diplomatic allies, and it  has attempted to shape the way the United States conducts its  relationship with Taiwan, a dynamic we have, regretfully, allowed.   We must not--we cannot--stand for this. We cannot sit idly by and  allow one of our most valued democratic partners to be sidelined on the  world stage. It is time to revisit the guidelines we use in the conduct  of our relationship with Taiwan and ensure that the United States is  doing all it can to fulfill our commitments to Taiwan.   That is why I am proud to support and cosponsor the Taiwan Assurance  Act. This measure asks the State Department to take a closer look at  self-imposed guidelines we follow with Taiwan and assess them based on  merit, not on what would appease China.   As proud co-chair of the Taiwan Caucus, I strongly support the  passage of H.R. 2002, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I urge my colleagues to support this measure. This is an important  bill that demonstrates our historical bipartisan support for Taiwan,  and so, as co-chair of the Taiwan Caucus, I strongly promote the  immediate passage of H.R. 2002.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 273) reaffirming the United States commitment to  Taiwan and to the implementation of the Taiwan Relations Act.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 273         Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) was signed into law       on April 10, 1979, codifying into law the basis for continued       commercial, cultural, and other relations between the people       of the United States and the people of Taiwan, and serving as       the foundation to preserve and promote continued bilateral       bonds;        Whereas the TRA enshrines the United States commitment to       make available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense       services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable       Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability;        Whereas pursuant to section 1206 of the Foreign Relations       Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228; 22       U.S.C. 2321k note.), Taiwan is to be treated as though it       were designated a major non-NATO ally for transfers of       defense articles or defense services;        Whereas in 1982, President Ronald Reagan further clarified       the importance and resilience of the United States-Taiwan       relationship with the issuance of the Six Assurances;        Whereas the TRA and the Six Assurances are cornerstones of       United States policy with respect to Taiwan, as was       reaffirmed by the House of Representatives with the adoption       of H. Con. Res. 88 in 2016;        Whereas the TRA and the Six Assurances have been essential       components in helping to maintain peace, security, and       stability in the Western Pacific, thereby furthering the       political, security, and economic interests of the United       States and Taiwan;        Whereas the United States and Taiwan have forged ever       closer economic and security relations over the last four       decades based on their shared commitment to democracy, human       rights, the rule of law and free market principles, and their       willingness to partner in efforts to combat global terrorism       and to address other global challenges, such as those related       to the environment, public health, energy security,       education, women's empowerment, digital economy, poverty, and       natural disasters;        Whereas the United States-Taiwan partnership has been       further strengthened since the 2015 memorandum of       understanding establishing the Global Cooperation and       Training Framework (GCTF), which has allowed the two parties       to cohost many workshops on critical topics, including one in       December 2018 on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief       to which ten regional governments sent participants;        Whereas Taiwan has the expertise, willingness, and       capability to engage in international efforts to mitigate       global challenges related to such issues as public health,       aviation safety, crime, and terrorism, but its participation       in such efforts has been constrained by conditions imposed by       the People's Republic of China (PRC);        Whereas successive Congresses have called upon the       executive branch to develop strategies to obtain meaningful       participation for Taiwan in international organizations, such       as the World Health Organization (WHO), International Civil       Aviation Organization (ICAO), and International Criminal       Police Organization (INTERPOL);        Whereas the Congress most recently expressed support for       Taiwan's participation at the World Health Organization's       World Health Assembly as an observer on January 22, 2019,       with the adoption of H.R. 353 by the House of       Representatives;        Whereas communication on bilateral security, cultural, and       commercial interests would be greatly enhanced with the full       implementation of the Taiwan Travel Act (Public Law 115-135),       which became law on March 16, 2018, and which states that the       United States Government ``should encourage visits between       officials from the United States and Taiwan at all levels'';        Whereas the United States and Taiwan have built a strong       economic partnership, with the United States now Taiwan's       third largest trading partner and with Taiwan the 11th       largest trading partner of the United States and a key       destination for United States agricultural exports;        Whereas strong United States-Taiwan economic relations have       been a positive factor in stimulating economic growth and job       creation for the people of both the United States and Taiwan;       and        Whereas successive Congresses have publicly reaffirmed       United States commitments to Taiwan under the Taiwan       Relations Act and Six Assurances, including most recently on       December 31, 2018, with the enactment into law of the Asia       Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-409),       which stated among other things that--        (1) it is United States policy ``to support the close       economic, political, and security relationship between Taiwan       and the United States'';        (2) ``The President should conduct regular transfers of       defense articles to Taiwan that are tailored to meet the       existing and likely threats from the People's Republic of       China, including supporting the efforts of Taiwan to develop       and integrate asymmetric capabilities, as appropriate,       including mobile, survivable, and cost-effective capabilities       into its military forces.''; and        (3) ``The President should encourage the travel of high-      level United States officials to Taiwan, in accordance with       the Taiwan Travel Act.'': Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) reaffirms that the Taiwan Relations Act, together with       the Six Assurances, are and will remain cornerstones of       United States relations with Taiwan;        (2) encourages United States officials at all levels to       travel to meet with their counterparts in Taiwan, and for       high-level Taiwan officials to enter the United States and       meet with United States officials, per the Taiwan Travel Act;        (3) reiterates that the President should conduct regular       transfers of defense articles to Taiwan consistent with       Taiwan's national security requirements in accordance to       prior legislation, including the Asia Reassurance Initiative       Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-409);        (4) calls on the Secretary of State to actively engage       internationally in support of Taiwan's meaningful       participation in international organizations engaged in       addressing transnational threats and challenges such as those       related to health, aviation security, and crime and       terrorism;        (5) recognizes Taiwan's partnership in combating global       terrorism, including as a full partner in the Global       Coalition to Defeat ISIS, and in addressing other global       challenges through the Global Cooperation and Training       Framework (GCTF) and other such initiatives;        (6) underscores the importance of the close people-to-      people ties cultivated through initiatives such as the       Fulbright Program, which has supported thousands of scholar       and grantee exchanges between the United States and Taiwan       over the past 60 years; and        (7) acknowledges the important work done by the American       Institute in Taiwan and the Taipei Economic and Cultural       Representative Office in support of United States-Taiwan       interests.  [[Page H3458]]     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 273, reaffirming the United  States commitment to Taiwan and to the implementation of the Taiwan  Relations Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong support of H. Res. 273, reaffirming the United  States commitment to Taiwan and to the implementation of the Taiwan  Relations Act.   Signed into law four decades ago, the Taiwan Relations Act marked the  first and most significant act of support for Taiwan by Congress. It  unequivocally demonstrates our support to Taiwan. Along with the Six  Assurances, this act remains the bedrock of our deep partnership with  Taiwan.   With the support of this landmark piece of legislation and in the 40  years since, the United States has deepened security, economic, and  people-to-people ties with Taiwan. Our two nations have worked together  to maintain peace, security, and stability in the Pacific through our  shared commitment to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.   Unfortunately, China seeks to diminish Taiwan's presence on the world  stage. We must fully use the tools at our disposal to fight back  against these efforts.   It is important that Congress must do what we can to honor our  commitment to Taiwan. That is why I have long been a proud co-chair of  the Taiwan Caucus and why I support this measure.   H. Res. 273 reaffirms our commitment to the people of Taiwan,  encourages high-level engagement as called for in the Taiwan Travel  Act, promotes Taiwan's meaningful engagement in international  organizations, and calls to deepen cultural ties.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time and would  inquire through the Speaker if my colleague has any remaining speakers  on his side.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  important resolution, H. Res. 273, reaffirming our commitments made to  Taiwan 40 years ago and strengthens our ability to fulfill them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1704) to foster commercial relations with foreign countries and  support United States economic and business interests abroad in the  conduct of foreign policy, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1704         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Championing American       Business Through Diplomacy Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) According to the 2017 National Security Strategy of the       United States of America, ``Retaining our position as the       world's preeminent economic actor strengthens our ability to       use the tools of economic diplomacy for the good of Americans       and others.''.        (2) A November 7, 2018, cable from Secretary of State       Michael R. Pompeo to all diplomatic and consular posts--      ``Boosting Commercial Diplomacy Around the World''--stated       that ``helping American companies is a foreign policy       priority . . . Promoting broad-based, responsible, and       sustainable economic growth helps to stabilize regions and       creates new and growing markets for U.S. companies. A       transparent and level playing field for U.S. investment in       these countries counters real and growing challenges such as       China's Belt and Road initiative.''.        (3) In the January-February 2019 issue of The Foreign       Service Journal, Ambassador Barbara Stephenson, the President       of the American Foreign Service Association, wrote ``Foreign       Service support for American business . . . is a major reason       why the U.S. Foreign Service was created.''.       SEC. 3. ECONOMIC DIPLOMACY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE.         Subsection (c) of section 1 of the State Department Basic       Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2651a) is amended--        (1) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (4); and        (2) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following new       paragraph:        ``(3) Assistant secretary for economic and business       matters.--        ``(A) In general.--Subject to the numerical limitation       specified in paragraph (1), there is authorized to be       established in the Department of State an Assistant Secretary       of State who shall be responsible to the Secretary of State       for matters pertaining to international economics and       business matters in the conduct of foreign policy.        ``(B) Matters contemplated.--The matters referred to in       subparagraph (A) include the following:        ``(i) International trade and investment policy.        ``(ii) International finance, economic development, and       debt policy.        ``(iii) Economic sanctions and combating terrorist       financing.        ``(iv) International transportation policy.        ``(v) Support for United States businesses.        ``(vi) Economic policy analysis and private sector       outreach.        ``(vii) International data privacy and innovation policies.        ``(viii) Such other related duties as the Secretary may       from time to time designate.''.       SEC. 4. CHIEF OF MISSION RESPONSIBILITIES.         Section 207 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C.       3927) is amended by adding at the end the following new       subsection:        ``(d) Promotion of United States Economic Interests.--Each       chief of mission to a foreign country shall have as a       principal duty the promotion of United States economic and       commercial interests in such country.''.       SEC. 5. INCREASED TRAINING IN ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL                     DIPLOMACY.         Section 708 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C.       4028) is amended by adding at the end the following new       subsection:        ``(d) Economic and Commercial Diplomacy.--The Secretary of       State, with the assistance of other relevant officials and       the private sector, shall establish as part of the standard       training provided for economic and commercial officers of the       Foreign Service, chiefs of mission, and deputy chiefs of       mission, training on matters related to economic and       commercial diplomacy, with particular attention to market       access and other elements of an enabling framework for United       States businesses, commercial advocacy, and United States       foreign economic policy, in addition to awareness about the       support of the United States Government available to United       States businesses, including support provided by the       Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, the       Export-Import Bank of the United States, the Millennium       Challenge Corporation, the Trade and Development Agency, the       Department of the Treasury, the United States Agency for       International Development, and the United States       International Development Finance Corporation.''.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1704, the Championing American  Business Through Diplomacy Act of 2019.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank first Mr. McCaul for his hard work  on this legislation.   I am proud to be supporting this legislation, this bipartisan  measure, which makes better use of State Department resources to  increase exports of American-made goods and American-provided services  and, in turn, creates more jobs for American workers.   This important bill supports the 277,000 small and medium-sized  businesses that are trying to sell U.S.-origin goods and services  across the globe.   They need help understanding the overseas market, locating customers  for U.S.-origin products, dealing with local imports and customs rules,  and arranging financing for their export sales. All these efforts  support U.S. jobs. Economic officers in our embassies and at the State  Department in Washington can help exporters deal with these challenges.   This piece of legislation improves the State Department's training  program for economic officers, affirms a long-standing directive to  U.S. Ambassadors to include commercial and economic issues in their  portfolios, and strengthens coordination between the State Department  and the Commerce Department by consolidating data on overseas markets.   These efforts fortify the key role of our State Department, provides  critical confirmation to U.S. exporters, and makes more efficient use  of public funds.   H.R. 1704 is a critical bill that will not only spur exports and job  growth but will ultimately improve the lives of the American people.   Our sponsors and I would also like to clarify the requirements under  section 9 of H.R. 1704 to ``initiate and pursue negotiations with  countries to establish international standards for government-supported  quality infrastructure investment overseas'' are intended to be  fulfilled within the Organization of Economic Cooperation and  Development.   This bill does not direct or authorize the Secretary of State to  initiate or pursue negotiations in the World Trade Organization or  amend any multilateral or plurilateral WTO agreements.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  important measure, H.R. 1704, to fully and efficiently use the  resources we already have to increase exports and create jobs and, in  turn, improve the lives of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
