Madam Speaker, the gentleman from Maryland talked about  protecting this institution or talked about this institution, but we  have a $40 billion bill at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. I haven't had a  chance to review the bill. My staff is poring over the pages to try to  see what's in it.   You want to talk about the institution? You want to talk about  standing up alongside Ukraine?   Why don't we actually have a debate on the floor of the people's  House instead of the garbage of getting a $40 billion bill at 3 o'clock  in the afternoon; not paid for, without having any idea what is really  in it, with a massive slush fund that goes to the State Department--$13  billion; $8 billion for the Economic Support Fund, $110 million for  embassy security.   We got $40 billion that is unpaid for, and you want to sit here and  lecture this body about what we are going to do or not do about  standing alongside Ukraine?   Why don't we talk about the American people who are hurting, the  wide-open borders; the inflation that is killing people; the jobs that  people can't get because of the cost of goods and services in this  country.   Sitting here and being lectured to, when I don't even have time to  look at a $40 billion unpaid bill.
