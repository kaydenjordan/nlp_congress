 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the critically needed  support for northern Ohioans in the American Rescue Plan, which has  just passed this House.   For months, we fought to provide direct support to people across our  country who were suffering during the pandemic. I am thrilled that the  bill provides vital support for families, communities, essential  workers, and small businesses.   The bill provides $1,400 in stimulus payments to spur our economy and  help families, funding for vaccine distribution, and a historical  increase of the child tax credit from $2,000 to $3,000.   Let's be clear: The Republicans' opposition demonstrates their  callousness during this time of great human need. They cite the  deficit. Yet, I didn't hear a peep from the other side as the national  debt ballooned under previous Republican administrations.   President Bush's ill-advised wars have cost us nearly $2 trillion,  and the debt increased by $676 billion. President Trump's GOP tax scam  increased the deficit by $1.8 trillion, helping to lead to an increase  in national debt by $7.8 trillion.   Mr. Speaker, I am so thankful to President Biden for delivering on  his commitment to Build Back Better. The American Rescue Plan now goes  to the President's desk for signature. I can't wait.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Democrats.                            ____________________
