 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 900, I call  up  [[Page H984]]  the bill (H.R. 4445) to amend title 9 of the United States Code with  respect to arbitration of disputes involving sexual assault and sexual  harassment, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 4445.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 4445, the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual  Assault and Sexual Harassment Act, would restore access to justice for  survivors of sexual assault or sexual harassment who are forced to  settle their disputes against their harassers and abusers in a private  system of arbitration that is often stacked against them.   Arbitration was originally developed as an alternative to the court  system for parties of relatively equal bargaining power to enter into  voluntarily. In recent decades, however, forced arbitration clauses  have become ubiquitous in our lives, largely in the form of take-it-or- leave-it contracts between very large companies and individual  consumers. As a result, these clauses have rendered our court system,  in which plaintiffs have far stronger protections, inaccessible to far  too many.   Nowhere is that trend more apparent or problematic than in the  workplace. It is projected that, by 2024, 80 percent of private-sector  workers will be forced to sign an arbitration clause when accepting  employment. And consider that, over the past 5 years, employers  prevailed over their employees in 98 percent of these arbitration  cases. But these numbers cannot capture the true human toll of forced  arbitration.   Last November, the Judiciary Committee heard powerful testimony from  four survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment about their  harrowing experiences and the deep wounds they continue to carry with  them to this day. It was a hearing none of us will forget, and we  appreciate these brave women coming forward and sharing their stories.   Each of these women was subject to horrific treatment by a person  with power over their lives. Then, when they sought to hold their  assailants accountable in court, they were forced to relive the trauma  of their harassment and assault to find that their only recourse was a  secretive arbitration process that was stacked against them.   Forced arbitration clauses, buried deep in the fine print of the  paperwork required as a condition of employment, have bound workers to  a system in which they are nearly guaranteed to fail, foreclosed the  possibility of ever having their day in court, and in almost every case  taken away their right even to discuss their experience.   The company gets to pick the judge and the jury, truncate the  discovery process, choose the law applied, and  [[Page H985]]  prevent all appeals. When the company wins, it can request that the  victim pay its attorney's fees, and it can ensure that misconduct never  sees the light of day.   H.R. 4445 removes these barriers to justice for survivors of sexual  assault or sexual harassment by giving them a real choice of whether to  go to court or to arbitrate their claim.   In doing so, this legislation ends this unjust and, frankly,  repulsive system in which American companies are better off retaliating  against victims of sexual assault than taking responsibility and  holding perpetrators responsible for their horrific actions.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter to Members of  Congress dated February 4, 2022, and a letter to House leadership dated  February 7, 2022, both from organizations in support of H.R. 4445.                                                   February 4, 2022.      Re Pass the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and           Sexual Harassment Act of 2021 (HR. 4445).         Dear Members of Congress: On behalf of the undersigned       organizations, we write in support of the Ending Forced       Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of       2021 (H.R. 4445), a bill that would provide important new       opportunities for individuals who experience sexual       harassment and assault to seek justice without being forced       into closed-door and secretive forced arbitration       proceedings, where the deck is too often stacked against       them.        Today, individuals are routinely forced to sign an       arbitration clause to resolve disputes as a condition of       obtaining a job or purchasing a good or service, often       through language buried in fine print. Many individuals who       sign such documents have no idea they have waived the ability       to enforce their rights in court. Arbitrators are often       chosen and paid by companies. There is no public record of       the proceedings or the outcome, and rarely an opportunity to       appeal the arbitrator's decision. Many who come forward with       reports of sexual harassment or sexual assault, cannot afford       legal counsel. The arbitration clause may force them to bear       some of the significant costs of the arbitration. The       resolution of their disputes may fail to make them whole for       the harm they have suffered.        The lack of public accountability enabled by forced       arbitration has played a harmful role in allowing sexual       harassment and assault to persist in the shadows. In the four       years since #MeToo went viral, thousands of individuals,       disproportionately women, have come forward to share their       experiences--many several years after the fact--and to demand       justice. When women and all those who have experienced       assault and harassment share their stories, it gives others       the courage to come forward as well. But when women who       report such conduct are forced into arbitration, that       secretive process with no public accountability further       silences survivors, and employers and companies can continue       to employ and protect serial sexual harassers.        The Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual       Harassment Act is an important step towards restoring power       to survivors of sexual assault and sexual harassment by       ensuring they will not be forced into arbitration. It is       admittedly a partial solution, as no individual should be       forced to waive their ability to fully enforce their rights       to be free from other forms of unlawful harassment,       discrimination, and exploitation, whether as workers, as       consumers, as patients, or as students. We are therefore       hopeful that as a complement to this bill, Congress will       quickly take up and pass the FAIR Act (H.R. 963) and       Restoring Justice for Workers Act (H.R. 4841), which would       ensure that companies can no longer circumvent the legal       system by forcing individuals into arbitration. But the       Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual       Harassment Act represents an important partial restoration of       individuals' rights to seek accountability and justice.       Accordingly, we urge you to support this legislation. If you       have any questions, please contact Emily Martin       ([emailÂ protected]) at the National Women's Law Center.            Sincerely,        National Women's Law Center, National Employment Law       Project, National Employment Lawyers Association.                                   ____                                                   February 7, 2022.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy: We, the       undersigned groups, support passage of H.R. 4445, the Ending       Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment       Act of 2021. This bipartisan bill would empower survivors of       sexual assault and sexual harassment by allowing survivors of       sexual harassment and sexual assault to file a case in court       rather than be forced into arbitration. Survivors of sexual       assault and sexual harassment would be able to hold       perpetrators and institutions accountable outside of closed-      door arbitration proceedings and shine light on systemic       issues of wrongdoing. According to actor Eliza Dushku, one of       several witnesses who testified under the protection of       congressional subpoenas, at a powerful hearing last November       on H.R. 4445, forced arbitration ``protects the harassers,       the abusers, the corporations, and it isolates the victims .       . . [it] creates a culture of silencing.''        Many of the undersigned groups oppose the use of forced       arbitration against all consumers and workers. Predispute       binding arbitration clauses and class action waivers,       together known as forced arbitration clauses, are typically       buried in ``take-it-or-leave it'' agreements that waive an       individual's fundamental rights to seek accountability in       court when they are hurt or when their rights are violated.       These clauses deprive people of the opportunity to hold       wrongdoers accountable, no matter how widespread or egregious       the misconduct may be; and they also allow all types of       abuse, discrimination, and fraud to go unchecked.        In the privatized system of forced arbitration, there is no       judge or jury, and the right to appeal is severely limited.       Arbitrators do not have to follow the law or precedent. And       proceedings take place behind a veil of secrecy that       insulates perpetrators from public accountability. That is       why thousands of Google workers around the world walked off       the job in late 2018 to protest, among other things, Google's       use of forced arbitration clauses to hide mistreatment of       workers who alleged harassment and discrimination against       high-level executives. Also in 2018, in a rare gesture of       bipartisanship, all 56 attorneys general (in every state, the       District of Columbia, and territories) urged Congress to       immediately enact legislation that would ban forced       arbitration for sexual harassment claims. The letter said,       ``Victims of such serious misconduct should not be       constrained to pursue relief from decision makers who are not       trained as judges, are not qualified to act as courts of law       and are not positioned to ensure that such victims are       accorded both procedural and substantive due process.''        The Senate companion bill, which passed the Senate       Judiciary Committee on a voice vote, has ten Republican co-      sponsors, and support continues to grow. Conservative       commentator and women's rights advocate Gretchen Carlson, who       has been a vocal opponent of the way forced arbitration       clauses are used to silence victims of sexual harassment,       recently said that passing H.R. 4445 ``will be a victory for       American workers and I am incredibly optimistic this is going       to be the law of the land.''        H.R. 4445 has widespread, bipartisan support inside and       outside the walls of Congress. We urge all Members of the       House to vote for this important legislation. Your staff       should feel free to reach out to Remington A. Gregg should       you have any questions.

I thank my colleagues, Representatives Bustos, Griffith,  Jayapal, and Buck, for their leadership on this issue. I urge my  colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Mrs. Bustos), the sponsor of this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a distinguished member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), a distinguished member of the Committee  on the Judiciary.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), another distinguished member of the  Committee on the Judiciary.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Raskin), another distinguished member of the  Committee on the Judiciary.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Garcia), another distinguished member of the Committee  on the Judiciary.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from North Carolina (Ms. Ross), another distinguished member of the  Committee on the Judiciary.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  distinguished gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 4445, the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual  Assault and Sexual Harassment Act, removes barriers to justice for  survivors of sexual assault or sexual harassment by giving them a real  choice of whether to go to court or to arbitrate their claim after the  dispute has arisen.   Mr. Jordan is right. Many such victims, if given the choice, will  choose to go to court. Why shouldn't they? In arbitration, they lose 98  percent of the cases. The employer wins 98 percent of the cases in  arbitration. Why? Well, for one thing, the employer picks the  arbitrator, and the arbitrator is paid. So, naturally, the arbitrator  wants to rule in such a way that he or she is likely to get hired  again.   But 98 percent of the cases brought by women who have been sexually  harassed who are in forced arbitration are lost by them. That is why  this bill is necessary.   If we want to give women who have been sexually harassed a fair  chance at justice, we must pass this bill. If we want to give women who  have been sexually harassed a fair chance at winning against their  employer who did the sexual harassment or allowed the sexual  harassment, we must pass this bill.   That is why this critical measure is supported by a broad coalition  of public interest organizations, including the National Alliance to  End Sexual Violence, the National Center on Domestic and Sexual  Violence, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, the  National Partnership for Women and Families, RAINN, and many others.   Not one single group that deals with sexual violence opposes this  bill. Only employer organizations oppose this bill because it stacks  the deck in their favor.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues, Representatives Bustos,  Griffith, Jayapal, and Buck, for their leadership on this issue, and I  urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 45 seconds.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the  distinguished gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck), the ranking member of  the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law.   This amendment simply clarifies that H.R. 4445 does not amend current  law outside of the Federal Arbitration Act. It reflects the bipartisan  input of several of my colleagues in the House and Senate, including  the bill's sponsor, Congresswoman Bustos.   Importantly, this amendment would protect the rights of survivors of  sexual harassment by ensuring that they have a choice of litigating or  arbitrating any case relating to the conduct that is alleged to  constitute sexual harassment under applicable law. It does so by making  clear that anything related to sexual harassment or assault as  currently defined by law is covered by this bill.   This would include retaliation or any other misconduct that gives  rise to the underlying claim alleging a violation of these laws and  reflects an important compromise struck to protect these cases.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Illinois (Mrs. Bustos), the sponsor of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa).  [[Page H993]]         Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. Speier).    Madam Speaker, in closing, I thank Mr. Buck for offering  this helpful amendment.   I thank Ms. Speier, and I thank all the people who have been so  helpful on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
