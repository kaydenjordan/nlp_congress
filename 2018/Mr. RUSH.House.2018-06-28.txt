 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with excitement and a sense of  pride in my heart. Today, Mr. Speaker, I am here to share some great  news coming out of my hometown of Chicago, Illinois, because next week,  on Monday, a group of smart, dedicated, and hardworking young African  American men from Dunbar High School located in my district will start  new jobs in the skills-based industry.   These jobs, Mr. Speaker, and the young men's employment are a result  of a robust partnership and a sincere commitment to diversity that  brought the city of Chicago, the Chicago public schools, and the IBEW  Local 134 together to form an innovative construction trades program.   Mr. Speaker, I am extremely encouraged by these motivated and  diligent young men who never gave up and who saw the opportunity and  hope that was available to them that extended beyond their environment.  This program, the partnership it represents, and the hopes that it  inspires is spot on. It is exactly the type of investment our most  vulnerable communities need because it has the potential to yield life- altering results.   Programs like this one not only provide hope by decreasing  joblessness, but they have the ability to play a major role in reducing  the pervasive violence that plagues our Nation and our communities.   This particular program, Mr. Speaker, is an important endeavor that  offers more opportunities to underserved communities across the Nation  by providing students in their junior and senior years of high school  the chance to learn skills in fields including general construction,  carpentry, heating, air conditioning, plumbing, welding, and electrical  work, among many, many others.   After graduation, students have multiple options available to them.  They can enter a pre-apprenticeship program; they can pursue a  postsecondary education; or they can obtain professional certification  that will lead to immediate employment, as it has for these young men.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to take a moment and recognize Mayor Rahm  Emanuel's commitment to seeing this program's initiation and  inauguration to get off the ground.   Additionally, Mr. Speaker, this would not have been possible without  the hard work and devotion of some dedicated individuals and  organizations. So I want to thank the IBEW Local 134 and Don Finn, its  president, and the city of Chicago, the Chicago public schools, and,  most importantly, the instructors and the mentors of these young men  for their persistence in seeing that this vision emerged and ensuring  that the next generation that builds America represents the diversity  of America.   Mr. Speaker, I sincerely wish these young men the best as they embark  on this new chapter in their lives. I want them to know that, with  their perseverance, they have made it easier for those individuals,  those young men and young women, who will follow in their footsteps.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
