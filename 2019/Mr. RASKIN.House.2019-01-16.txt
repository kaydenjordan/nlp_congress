 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 43 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 43         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 268) making supplemental appropriations for       the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other       purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed       with. All points of order against consideration of the bill       are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and       shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Appropriations or their respective designees. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. An amendment in the nature of a substitute       consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 116-2,       modified by the amendment printed in part A of the report of       the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution, shall be       considered as adopted in the House and in the Committee of       the Whole. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as the       original bill for the purpose of further amendment under the       five-minute rule and shall be considered as read. All points       of order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are       waived. Clause 2(e) of rule XXI shall not apply during       consideration of the bill. No further amendment to the bill,       as amended, shall be in order except those printed in part B       of the report of the Committee on Rules. Each such further       amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the       report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the       report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for       the time specified in the report equally divided and       controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be       subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand       for division of the question in the House or in the Committee       of the Whole. All points of order against such further       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill, as amended, to the House with such further       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and       any further amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.        Sec. 2.  The requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII for a       two-thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee on       Rules on the same day it is presented to the House is waived       with respect to any resolution reported through the       legislative day of January 23, 2019, relating to a measure       making or continuing appropriations for the fiscal year       ending September 30, 2019.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 43, providing for consideration of  H.R. 268, making supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending  September 30, 2019, and for other purposes.   The rule provides for consideration of the legislation under a  structured rule. The rule makes in order 15 amendments from Members on  both sides of the aisle. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the  Appropriations Committee. The rule also waives the requirement for two- thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee on Rules on the  same day it is presented to the House with respect to any resolution  reported through the legislative day of January 23, relating to a  measure making or continuing appropriations for the fiscal year ending  September 30, 2019.   Madam Speaker, I rise now in support of the rule for H.R. 268, our  emergency disaster relief bill, to provide $12.14 billion in recovery  and relief assistance for millions of Americans suffering from the  damage caused by recent hurricanes, typhoons, mudslides, flooding,  earthquakes, and wildfires.   These national disasters follow decades of scientific warnings to  Congress that accelerating climate change would bring us extreme  weather events characterized by unprecedented ferocity and violence,  and here we are in the middle of the global crisis of climate change  dealing with profound natural catastrophes like these.   Last year, Hurricane Michael, the most intense hurricane ever to  strike the Florida panhandle brought winds surpassing 125 miles per  hour and gusts of up to 200 miles per hour, killing 45 people who were  crushed and drowned by the hurricane, and inflicting $40 billion in  economic damages, and $5 billion in insured losses.   In 2018, the people of California, who have lost 10 million acres of  forest in the last decade to wildfires, experienced the deadliest and  most destructive wildfire season in recorded history with more than  8,500 fires burning an area of 1,893,913 acres, the largest area of  burned acreage ever recorded in a fire season in the United States of  America.   An astonishing 7,100 structures burned to the ground. In July and  August, it seemed like the entire State was ablaze with the worst  damage taking place in northern California which was declared a  disaster area. Millions of people in San Francisco and the bay area  were forced to wear gas masks to go to school or to go to work.   In November, yet another round of wildfires visited massive  destruction of life, limb, and property on the people of California.  One fire, the so-called Camp fire, displaced tens of thousands of  people and killed at least 86 men, women, and children, burning many of  them to death in their cars or as they sought refuge and tried to flee  from their cars and run down the road.   The fire, which lasted many days, annihilated more than 18,000  structures and buildings and destroyed the entire town of Paradise,  turning it into an inferno, a hell on Earth. This was in our country.   The same kinds of astonishing events that destroyed entire  communities in Florida and in California were experienced by people all  over America last year: hurricane devastation in Puerto Rico, Texas,  and the Carolinas; unprecedented flooding and drought all over America;  and typhoons in the territories, a catalogue of climate-change  intensified misery and suffering that the entire Congress should see as  calling upon the decency and resources of the American people to  address.   The $12 billion legislation the majority brings forward today in H.R.  268 will ensure that communities across the land can recover from these  disasters with the resources that they need to rebuild.   The bill helps farmers suffering from crop and livestock losses,  coastal communities rebuilding their infrastructure and preparing to  weather future storms; dislocated workers, veterans, students, and  other Americans displaced and uprooted by these catastrophes.   The bill invests in restoration of disaster-damaged forests. It sends  aids to local communities to restore more than 250,000 acres of  watershed. It funds restoration of rural communities. It offers $600  million to continue disaster nutrition benefits to the hard-hit people  of Puerto Rico, still reeling from Hurricane Maria, and it allocates  critical funding for social services, mental health, education,  nutrition assistance, and infrastructure resiliency in communities  across the land.   We will rebuild our transportation systems with this legislation. We  will repair housing. We will repair businesses and public  infrastructure. We will repair and reconstruct hurricane-damaged  Veterans Administration and Department of Defense bases and facilities  across the country.   But the majority is not stopping there. We are not just offering aid  to States and local communities across the land to rebuild and renew.  We are reopening the Government of the United States so we can actually  send this aid, so we can offer the expert  [[Page H619]]  technical assistance these communities need, and so we can use the full  apparatus of our government, including the currently closed down  Department of Homeland Security and the Coast Guard where our  hardworking personnel are not being paid, to get America moving again   The National Governors Association, a bipartisan group of Governors  from the 50 States called for an immediate reopening of the government  that will allow for the release of $85 billion in Federal aid and loan  assistance that is being held up because a third of the government has  been shut down. That is the Governors of our States, the people closest  to surveying the damage on the ground.   Indeed, by reopening the Government of the United States of America,  we are not just helping to address the disasters that have befallen our  people across the country; we are ending the manmade disaster of the  government shutdown.   And when I say it is manmade, I don't mean to use archaic sexist  language, Madam Speaker. I am trying to be precise. This is the  shutdown that one man, President Donald Trump, gave us and proudly  claimed as his own in the December 11 White House meeting when he said,  ``I am proud to shut down the government, Chuck. I will take the  mantle. I will be the one to shut it down,'' said the President of the  United States. ``I'm not going to blame you for it.''   So far this shutdown that the President is proud to have delivered to  his people has closed nine Federal departments: Department of State,  Department of Agriculture, Department of the Interior, Department of  Commerce, Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security,  Department of the Treasury, HUD, and Department of Transportation.   It has caused 800,000 Federal workers to be furloughed or compelled  to work with no pay at all. It has threatened public safety in national  parks which are overflowing with garbage and backed up waste in the  bathrooms. It has threatened the tax refunds of millions of Americans.  It has threatened 38 million low-income Americans who depend on SNAP  benefits for proper nutrition for their families, and it has unleashed  profound chaos and anxiety in the land.   In my congressional district, tens of thousands of Federal workers  have been denied pay; air traffic controllers, Coast Guard personnel,  NIH researchers, scientists at NOAA. I have heard from scientists at  the FDA who have been furloughed and prevented from working on the  prevention and containment of E. coli, salmonella, and insect  infestation of our food supply.   I have spoken to an Army veteran who has spent the rest of his career  after leaving the Army as an air traffic controller who now must raid  his own retirement plan and his daughter's 529 college plan with a 10  percent penalty in order to pay his mortgage.   I have spoken to several constituents who have been forced to pay  their mortgages with credit cards or loans from other family members,  and I have talked to constituents who have been forced to forego  medical treatments because they can't balance their checkbooks, when  they are ordered to work but receive a pay stub like many have emailed  to me, showing zero net pay, zero gross pay.   Hundreds of thousands of people who work for private contractors and  small businesses working with the government across America have been  injured as well; many furloughed, laid off, or fired with no real  promise of making their money back, unlike the Federal workers who at  least, I hope, should be getting their money back because of  legislation that the majority has brought forward.   But the 172,000 Federal workers in my State are losing $778 million  every 2 weeks, and the State has already lost more than $60 million in  taxes.   The economic reverberations are awful, and they are spreading.                                time  1245    Now, this shutdown is a brutal assault on the separation of powers  and the Constitution of the United States:   It does not form a more perfect Union. It does not establish justice.  It shuts the Justice Department down.   It does not ensure domestic tranquility. It defunds the Department of  Homeland Security.   It does not provide for the common defense, but it robs our Coast  Guard personnel of their paychecks.   It does not promote the general welfare, but it furloughs food  inspectors.   It cheats civil servants out of their salaries; it promotes tax fraud  by locking IRS agents out of their offices; and it idles environmental  scientists, diplomats, air traffic controllers, and TSA agents who are  calling in sick because they can't even afford to get to work now.   This policy is not in service of ``we, the people,'' and that is why  every public opinion poll shows the American people overwhelmingly  rejecting the Trump shutdown, this scandalous assault on the public  good.   In America, we don't hold the government or the workforce or the  people hostage over a policy dispute. That is an absolute betrayal of  the separation of powers and how government is supposed to work in the  United States of America.   Now, my good friends across the aisle should be confronting the  shutdown with us. We are asking them to join us in getting the  emergency aid to our people all across the land and in reopening the  government.   I know it wasn't their idea, Madam Speaker. I know they were backed  into this situation by President Trump and FOX News and Ann Coulter,  whom the President apparently saw on TV and then changed his mind and  decided to shut the government down.   But now, I am afraid that our friends across the aisle have become  enablers of the President, and now they own a piece of the shutdown.  The party of Abraham Lincoln, who saved the Union with malice for none  and charity for all, has become the party of Donald Trump, who shut  down the government with charity for none and malice for all.   Let's put an end to it right now, Madam Speaker. In the age of  climate change, we have no time left for these foolish and self- destructive games. We must act as first responders for the American  people.   Our new majority in the House of Representatives is up to the task.  We are ready to govern. We are ready to lead. Let's help our people  recover from the natural disasters which have been exacerbated by  climate change, and let's end the manmade disaster of the shutdown of  our own government right now.   Americans know the truth of this situation. Let's act together to end  the Trump shutdown, which the American people rightfully despise and  deplore. Let's put the government back to work for the general welfare,  starting with the millions of Americans still buffeted by the  terrifying weather calamities of 2018.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Cole), my friend, for his very thoughtful words and that kind welcome  to the Rules Committee.   I have heard nothing but wonderful things about how he operates on  the Rules Committee, and we are indeed fortunate to have him serving in  this capacity. I really do look forward to working with him in the  months and years ahead.   And I admit that it has been a somewhat awkward process trying to  reopen the government of the United States. This shutdown is unique for  at least two reasons I can think of. One is it is already the longest  shutdown in the history of the United States; and the second is that,  when the shutdown began last year under the 115th Congress, it was the  only time that the Congress adjourned during a shutdown.   So rather than stay and try to work it out, we were adjourned before  recess, and the Congress went home, so it was left in the hands of the  new majority and the new 116th Congress to try to get it going again,  which is why, yes, it is the absolute first order of business for us to  open up the Government of the United States.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Shalala), who is also a new and a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington  State for his comments. I would urge him to stick with his original  instinct to support the legislation.   He said that he finds lots of important stuff in it, aiding the  victims of hurricanes and earthquakes and floods and so on. All of that  is absolutely right. That is why we are voting for it. We urge him to  vote for it, too.   He says that we are playing politics in a shameful way, that we are  engaged in partisan politics, by adding a measure to reopen the  Government of the United States that will allow us to get aid to all of  these people and to allow all our workers to be paid.   What I consider shameful is holding the Government of the United  States of America, the Federal workforce, private contractors, and the  people hostage over a policy debate.   We have never seen anything like this before, and now it is the  longest shutdown in history.   So let's reopen the government. And we are willing to debate anything  you want, but we can't do it in a hostage-taking, ransom-type  situation.   Since when did opening the Government of the United States become a  poison pill? I just don't see that.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Escobar).    Madam Speaker, the first thing I am afraid I need to  point out is that certain of our friends on the other side of the aisle  are experiencing a kind of a political speech impediment where they are  unable to correctly pronounce the name of our party. We are the  Democratic Party, not the Democrat Party.   I was reading a biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt recently called  ``Traitor to His Class,'' which was very interesting. He said:         If you don't want to call us the Democratic Party, call us       the democracy.    So those would be the two choices that would be the most suitable, at  least from our side of the aisle.   The second thing I want to point out is this is a clean continuing  resolution. We have not loaded it up with a bunch of partisan  sweeteners or ideological ``gotcha'' resolutions.   This is a clean continuing resolution to get disaster assistance to  our people, the people of the United States, and it opens up our  government to make that assistance possible so we can end the manmade  disaster of the shutdown.    So I think that it well suits those who are saying they both want to  get the aid to Americans and they want the government of the United  States to be reopened.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Mrs.  Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I continue to be baffled about why some of my colleagues think that  opening the Government of the United States--our government--is a  poison pill and something they can't support.   Look how far we have fallen, Madam Speaker. We are voting for  billions of dollars in aid to the people of Florida, and the people of  Texas and California and Puerto Rico, so we can deal with the mounting  natural crises and emergencies around the country. We need to open the  government to do it, and there are those who say that is too high a  price. They want to get the aid to the people, but it is too high a  price to reopen our own government.   We can't find an example of another democratic country where the  chief executive has shut down his own government the way that President  Trump has done in this case.   We know that he expresses a lot of admiration for Vladimir Putin in  Russia and for Orban in Hungary and for Duterte in the Philippines and  the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, who recently ordered out for the  assassination of a journalist for The Washington Post.   Those are his friends. Those are the people he looks up to. So maybe  he thinks this is a normal way of doing business.   Well, it is not in the United States of America. Let them close the  government in Russia. Let them send the workforce in Hungary home. Let  them put the civil servants in the Philippines at rest. Why don't they  shut down the government of Saudi Arabia?   Why are they doing this to the people of the United States of  America?   We are not playing games. He is playing a game with us. He is holding  us hostage over his pet obsession, and the American people know it.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms.  Bonamici).    Madam Speaker, may I ask how much time I have remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, our beloved colleagues across the aisle have asked us  to come back to the negotiating table and to compromise.   Madam Speaker, we have compromised. The bills that we started out  passing were bills that were overwhelmingly or unanimously passed by  the Republicans in committee or on the floor of the Senate, so we are  passing their bills to reopen the government. The very first order of  business is to reopen the government.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague for conceding the  fairness of the amendment process that we have adopted here today, and  I do hope that it will be the beginning of a new era in Congress where  we can work together and bring in the best ideas from everybody.   Having said that, we still have a disagreement, and the disagreement  is this: We brought forward four continuing resolutions that  incorporated the language that came from Republicans in the Senate, and  were voted out on a 92-6 basis, in order to pass it.   Now, my distinguished colleague says, well, maybe the Republicans in  the House would have felt differently about that. Well, of course, they  controlled the House in the last session, but they adjourned without us  ever taking it up. They adjourned into Christmas break and into a  shutdown.   We were left with this mess when we got into power. That is why our  first order of business must be to reopen the Government of the United  States. We have offered multiple continuing resolutions in order to do  that. In fact, I think a dozen of my Republican colleagues have already  voted for different CRs in order to keep the government going.   So when the gentleman kindly asks: ``Well, how can you expect us to  do this?'' lots of Republicans understand the urgency of reopening the  government.   One position says: We will reopen the government if you do what we  want. Our position is: Let's reopen the government.   You see the difference there? We are not holding anybody hostage.  There is no political ransom. We are not making any demands. We are  saying: Let's pass this legislation that has overwhelming, if not  unanimous, support to get disaster relief to our people, and let's  reopen the government so we can get them the relief.   Instead, we get accused of playing political games. They call  reopening the Government of the United States a poison pill. That has  to be making some history in itself.   The word ``emergency'' has been bandied about a lot, Madam Speaker,  over  [[Page H624]]  the last few weeks. The President even threatened to invoke emergency  powers that he thinks he has in order to impose his fantasy wall on the  government when it is very clear that he didn't get it through 2 years  of a Republican-controlled House and Senate. And he is not getting it  through this Congress, and he didn't get the funding from the Mexican  Government, which was what the original promise was.   So now he wants to see if he can find emergency powers to do it, but  he has delayed the emergency. Think about that. It is as if you saw an  emergency in your neighborhood, and you say: Well, instead of calling  the police or the fire department, I will wait a few weeks to do it.   That is not a real emergency. What is a real emergency?   Well, climate change is obviously a real emergency. The entire weight  of scientific evidence tells us that is a real emergency.   The government shutdown is an emergency for more than 800,000 Federal  employees who now have to explain to their kids why they don't have a  paycheck and why they are borrowing from their own retirement funds or  from the kids' college funds.    Where people can't get needed medical care, they are not able to pay  for medically indicated conditions they have because they don't have  the money to do it, that is an emergency.   Hurricanes Florence and Michael, those are emergencies, and that is  why we want to get aid to the people there.   That is what this legislation is all about.   The California wildfires, which killed dozens of Americans, that is  an emergency. That is why we are trying to get aid out to the people of  California.   But a legislative debate over the proper means of homeland security  when we spent more than $9 billion on homeland security over the last  decade, and our side is fighting for the best innovations, the best  technology to invest in border security? That is not an emergency. That  is a legislative debate that we can have.   So we go back to the basic point: Let's get aid to our people, from  Puerto Rico to North Carolina and South Carolina, from Florida to  Texas. That is what this bill does. It gets aid to our people. It  reopens the Government of the United States. It puts us back in the  business of promoting the general welfare.   That is what we have been sent here to do, to promote justice and the  general welfare and domestic tranquility, not shut down the government.  Let's open it up, and let's get aid to the people of the United States  of America. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
