 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the distinguished  chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and my friend, the  distinguished ranking member.   Today is a test for liberal democracy all over the world, and  particularly for us as Americans because today we witness the cost in  blood, sweat, and tears in the fight for freedom that liberal democracy  represents and provides: The simple desire of another people to have  what we have and that all too often we take for granted, the desire to  be a free people, under no one's shadow, under no one's yoke, and they  are willing to put their bodies on the line to fight for that simple  principle.   Weak punditry all too often has cast the opinion that liberal  democracy is on the decline. Well, not in Ukraine and not here. And not  with our allies and not at the United Nations. Because the scales have  fallen from eyes. The threat is real, and so are the stakes.   All of us today must be Ukrainian. All of us must join that fight.  All of us must understand that freedom, liberal democracy are resilient  but also fragile. They must always be perfected but also defended.   This resolution today is not just about an expression of  congressional solidarity. It is a recommitment by this body in the  principles that founded this Nation that another people are fighting  for to gain today.   I urge passage and proudly support this effort.
