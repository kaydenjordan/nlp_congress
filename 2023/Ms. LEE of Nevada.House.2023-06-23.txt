 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk made in  order by the rule.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of my amendment to H.R.  3564. This amendment serves one of my highest priorities, expanding  access to affordable housing across southern Nevada.   My amendment is quite simple. It would direct the Government  Accountability Office to assess how changes to the Federal Housing  Finance Agency's pricing framework would impact first-time, low-income  home buyers.   This is a critical addition to any proposed GAO report on new FHFA  policies, and it follows my commitment to making sure that any Federal  action on housing does right by all Americans and Nevadans, especially  those seeking reliable, affordable housing or seeking to buy a home for  the first time.   I represent Clark County, which ranks among the top 10 counties  nationwide with the highest concentration of renters. Clark County also  has one of the highest proportions of households that spend more than  30 percent of their income on rent, and the cost of rent has been going  up. The cost of homeownership as well has been going up, and the  American Dream remains out of reach for far too many.   We must focus how we can work across party lines, hand in hand with  the entities that help families buy their first homes, and ensure that  the American Dream can become a reality and not push it further out of  reach. We must find bipartisan ways to make access to affordable  housing easier, especially for the families of southern Nevada who most  need additional support as they work to affordably purchase a home.  This is just what my amendment will help us do.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1015     I am prepared to close, Mr. Chair, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, I am pleased to see bipartisan support for my commonsense  amendment to support first-time home buyers across the country. I look  forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  secure meaningful Federal action to better support hardworking families  in their efforts to buy their first home and to realize that part of  the American Dream.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk made in  order by the rule.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of this amendment to H.R.  3564.   Quite like my other amendment, this one also speaks to a top priority  of mine in Congress: expanding access to affordable housing across  southern Nevada.   This amendment would direct the GAO to assess how changes to the FHFA  pricing framework would impact affordable housing preservation, rural  housing, and manufactured housing.   This is another critical addition to any proposed GAO report on any  new FHFA policies, and it follows on my commitment to making sure that  any Federal action on housing does right by Nevadans and their need for  a fair and stable housing market.   I am committed to making sure that all Federal action on housing  improves southern Nevada's stock of affordable housing, including  manufactured and rural housing options.   This is not an area where we can risk unintended consequences, and,  as such, my amendment will direct the GAO to study and make absolutely  sure that our Federal Government is doing all it can do to improve  affordable housing availability.   In Clark County, Nevada, this is of utmost importance as we continue  to see a severe shortage in affordable housing stock. That means real  stress and uncertainty for far too many hardworking Nevadans and their  families. Again, I remain committed to working across the aisle to  ensure that every family has access to affordable, reliable, and safe  housing.   This amendment is a step in the right direction.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.  [[Page H3125]]    Mr. Chair, I am very pleased, again, to see bipartisan support for my  commonsense amendment to ensure that the Federal policy that we create  right here delivers affordable housing options across America.   I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides to better  support hardworking Americans and their families in securing reliable  and affordable housing in Las Vegas and across the country.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
