 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Taiwan Assurance Act and to recognize the 40th Anniversary of the  Taiwan Relations Act. Taiwan has made great strides over the past forty  years becoming a beacon of democracy and individual freedom.   The Taiwan Assurance Act reaffirms the United States' strong  commitment to Taiwan, and takes necessary steps to ensure that the  friendship between the people of the United States and Taiwan continues  to grow. Furthermore, this bill recognizes Taiwan's contributions in  various areas such as global health and makes it the policy of the  United States to advocate for Taiwan's inclusion in the United Nations  and other international organizations such as the World Health  Assembly.   It was an honor to travel to Taiwan last month with a few of my  colleagues to celebrate the 40th Anniversary of the Taiwan Relations  Act and to witness the opening of the new facility for the American  Institute in Taiwan.   While our relationship remains unofficial, enacted legislation such  as the Taiwan Travel Act will allow high level officials from both  governments to travel and meet with their counterparts, allowing both  parties to foster and strengthen the important relationship we share.   Mr. Speaker, in these rapidly changing times across the world, it is  important and even more necessary for us to recognize and appreciate  our allies who carry a strong belief in democracy and human rights.  Taiwan is a prime example of that and I commend them for the progress  they have made over the past forty years. I look forward to seeing this  relationship continue and strengthen over time.    Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the STEM  Opportunities Act of 2019 with the ranking member of the Committee on  Science, Space, and Technology, Mr. Frank Lucas.   The goal of our legislation is to develop and implement evidence- based policies to promote the progress of  [[Page H3463]]  women and minorities and other groups underrepresented in STEM studies  and research careers.   The result is a bipartisan bill that attempts to systematically  address the full suite of issues facing both female and minority STEM  researchers, from work/life balance policies, to campus climate, to  better data collection, to recruitment and retention practices.   Our economic future relies on what we do now to nurture the STEM  talent that will be necessary to meet the demands of an increasingly  technological and knowledge-based economy.   I want to thank Ranking Member Lucas for joining me in introducing  this bill, and I urge the rest of my colleagues to please join us. I  include my full remarks on this legislation for the Record.   Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the STEM Opportunities Act of  2019. A very similar bill passed the House as part of the America  Competes Act of 2010, but unfortunately did not make it into the  enacted law. As a result, every Congress since then, I have worked hard  to keep the legislation updated and to convince my colleagues of the  urgency of the challenges this bill addresses. Today I am reintroducing  this bill with Ranking Member of the Science Committee, Frank Lucas.  The goal of our legislation is to develop and implement evidence-based  policies to promote the progress of women, minorities, and other groups  underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics  (STEM) studies and research careers.   The need for full engagement in STEM by women and underrepresented  groups goes beyond enabling individuals to fulfill their dreams of  becoming a scientist. Our economic future relies on what we do now to  nurture the STEM talent that will be necessary to meet the demands of  an increasingly technological and knowledge-based economy. The Bureau  of Labor Statistics reports that STEM employment is the fastest growing  sector, with computer science and engineering jobs among the fastest  growing STEM occupations.   If things continue as they are now, however, I fear we will be ill  equipped to fill these jobs. We are nineteen years into the 21st  century and the demographics of the STEM workforce do not reflect the  diversity of the nation. In 2017, women earned only 20 percent of  bachelor's degrees in engineering and 19 percent in computer science.  Black and Hispanic students are similarly underrepresented in these  fields at the undergraduate level, and the problem is even more  pronounced in STEM faculty. Women hold only 26 percent of all tenured  and tenure-track positions, while Black and Hispanic faculty combined  hold a dismal 6.8 percent of these positions. We need to leverage all  of our human capital if we are to achieve the necessary capacity to  innovate and to discover.   The STEM Opportunities Act is focused on identifying and lowering  barriers for those who have already chosen a STEM path. First, so that  we better understand the nature and scope of the challenges, the STEM  Opportunities Act requires more comprehensive demographic data  collection on the recipients of federal research awards and on STEM  faculty at U.S. universities. These data would be available to  researchers to study the participation and trajectories of women and  underrepresented minorities in STEM so that policy makers can design  more effective policies and practices to reduce barriers.   Next, this bill requires the development of consistent federal  policies, such as no-cost award extensions, for recipients of federal  research awards who have caregiving responsibilities, including care  for a newborn or newly adopted child and care for a sick family member.  The bill also requires consistent federal guidance to grant reviewers  and program officers on best practices to minimize the effects of  implicit bias in the review of federal research grants. It requires  OSTP to develop guidance for universities and Federal laboratories to  aid them in identifying any cultural and institutional barriers  limiting the recruitment, retention, and achievement of women,  minorities, rural students, and other underrepresented groups in  academic and government STEM research careers and in developing and  implementing current best practices for reducing such barriers.  Finally, the legislation authorizes NSF to award grants to universities  to implement or expand research-based practices targeted specifically  at increasing the recruitment and retention of minority students and  faculty.   Mr. Speaker, in developing this legislation, we solicited extensive  input from governmental and non-governmental stakeholders to ensure  that the guidance and requirements reflect today's needs and  opportunities without unduly burdening our research universities. The  result is a bipartisan bill that attempts to systematically address the  full suite of issues facing both female and minority STEM researchers,  from work-life balance policies, to campus climate, to better data  collection, to recruitment and retention practices. This bill proposes  concrete and evidence-based solutions to the indisputable reality that  our nation continues to fall well short of engaging our entire talent  pool in STEM careers. That disparity in our STEM workforce will  continue to have real and increasing consequences for our economic and  national security if we do not begin to implement scalable solutions  soon.   I want to thank Ranking Member Lucas for joining me in introducing  this bill and for contributing his good ideas to make the bill even  better. I urge the rest of our colleagues to join us and to help us  move this legislation forward into law.                            ____________________
