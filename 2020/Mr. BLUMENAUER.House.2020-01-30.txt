 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   My service in the House has been marked by a loss of Congress' power  to deal with war and peace. I am proud to stand with my friend,  Congresswoman Lee, as I did with her in her 2002 amendment. Republicans  empowered President Bush for the worst foreign policy blunder in our  history, and we are still paying the price for the war in Iraq.    It is time to end this bipartisan failure, time to end it, stand up  for Congress. This is especially critical today with the reckless  current occupant who cozies up to dictators like Putin and some of the  worst people on the planet, and who attacks our allies with trade wars.  He committed colossal blunders like breaking the Iranian nuclear  agreement, which the Iranians had abided by, and by killing the second  most powerful person in Iran, which made us less safe.   It is time to vote for the Lee amendment, repeal the AUMF, a key tool  to rein in a reckless President and reclaim the rightful powers of  Congress over war and peace.
