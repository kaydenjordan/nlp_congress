 Mr. President, I rise today to salute John  Dumais for his many years of dedicated service at the New Hampshire  Grocers Association. John is retiring from his longtime role as  president and CEO of a trade association that represents hundreds of  retailers and suppliers and thousands of workers across the Granite  State, and he leaves a legacy worthy of our praise and our gratitude.   John draws on a lifetime of experience and in-depth knowledge in his  advocacy for the retail food industry. He grew up working in his  family's grocery store in Franklin, NH--Surowiec's Market--and put  aside a career track as a pharmacist to help run the shop when his  father passed away in 1971. Three years later, he took a role with the  New Hampshire Grocers Association. It was the start of an almost five- decade career in which John became one of the State's foremost  authorities on the many issues that impact New Hampshire's chained  grocery stores and independent retailers.   The Granite State is home to a growing number of retail food chains  that offer their services in multiple locations. It boasts a number of  independent, local corner stores and specialty shops that provide  distinct services to their communities. It also has a number of food  manufacturers, brokers, wholesalers, and distributers that serve and  support the State's many retailers. Each of these enterprises are  represented by the New Hampshire Grocers Association, and each of them  has found a knowledgeable resource and skilled advocate in John Dumais.  John and his hard-working team tap into their wealth of experience to  respond to present needs and anticipate future challenges in this  crucial industry.   In addition to his influential role and many achievements with the  New Hampshire Grocers Association, John is incredibly generous with his  time in a number of other community and charitable organizations. He is  a past chairman and current board member of the New Hampshire Food  Bank, the chairman of an anti-litter and pro-recycling campaign--New  Hampshire the Beautiful--and the past chairman of a scholarship  organization, the Asparagus Club. He is also a donor-adviser to  [[Page S8961]]  the Mary M. Dumais Memorial Fund, an endowment fund named for his wife  that assists women who face challenges entering or advancing in the  workforce. John's enthusiasm and desire to tackle serious community  issues reveal a deep understanding of the true value of service and  reflect the profound sense of community that defines our State.   I have known John for decades. As State senator, Governor of New  Hampshire, and now U.S. Senator, I have crossed paths with him at many  meetings and events around the State, including just last month at a  supply chain event in Manchester. I always welcome his perspective and  advice on ways we can strengthen the retail food industry. His wisdom  was especially vital in the past year and a half as the industry  navigated the challenges of a global pandemic and Granite Staters  counted on grocery stores to keep food on their tables. We relied on  this essential workforce, just as these retailers relied on John for  guidance through tough times.   On behalf of the people of New Hampshire, I ask my colleagues and all  Americans to join me in thanking John Dumais for his years of service  and advocacy and wishing him all the best in the years ahead.                            ____________________
