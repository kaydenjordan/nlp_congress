 Mr. President, would my colleague yield?    Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague. I am in such  strong support of her legislation, the No Junk Plans Act. I will speak  briefly on it after the Senator has concluded her important remarks.  But apropos of what the distinguished Senator from South Dakota just  said, isn't it correct that of course a plan is more affordable if it  doesn't cover anything? I would be interested in my colleague's  reaction to that, as she is the lead sponsor.  [[Page S3244]]    I remember being in Wisconsin and seeing the wonderful support folks  there have from my colleague because she has been a leader on these  issues.   I am just curious, because certainly my friend from South Dakota, who  is a distinguished member of the Finance Committee and works with  Senator Cortez Masto and me, often works with us on matters. But unless  I am missing something, he said that what he is interested in is care  that is more affordable. But it doesn't cover anything. What are my  colleague's thoughts on that?    Mr. President, before she leaves the floor, I want to tell  my colleague from Wisconsin--and I think I speak for the distinguished  Senator from Nevada as well--we are counting on our colleague from  Wisconsin to come back to this floor again and again to try to pass her  bill. I just want to tell her I will be with her every step of the way  because I think, colleagues, without the bill from the distinguished  Senator from Wisconsin, what we are looking at is a new golden age for  scam artists peddling insurance that isn't worth much more than the  paper it is written on.   I was struck by my friend from Wisconsin's mentioning the old days of  junk insurance.   Well, I was around for those old days. I remember when the health  insurance system in this country was basically for the healthy and  wealthy. If you were healthy, no sweat, you could get insurance. If you  were wealthy, you just went off and paid the bills. But the insurance  companies could go out there and clobber people with preexisting  conditions. So that was junk insurance.   But I am even older than that. I remember when I was director of the  Oregon Gray Panthers. I would go to a senior's house, and they would  pull out a shoebox full of policies--10 or 15 policies. The  distinguished Senator from Nevada, who has done so much consumer  advocacy for consumers, I am sure knows about this challenge with  seniors. These policies weren't worth the paper they were written on.  They had--because I am kind of a lawyer in name only--what were called  subrogation clauses. So if you had two policies, and they basically  covered the same thing, both of them would try to squirm out of  covering it. Talk about junk insurance.   Finally, I got elected to Congress, like my colleague activist, and  we passed a law that said we are going to get rid of that system and  that you could have really only one policy, except in unusual  situations. There were strong consumer protections.   But if you look at what the Trump golden age of scams is going to  bring back, there are going to be lots of people who are going to get  clobbered, and, as my colleagues know, the people who are really going  to get hit by this are, for example, older women who are pre-Medicare,  because very often, in their late fifties and early sixties, they have  a lot of difficulty trying to find jobs that pay good salaries and jobs  that have good healthcare coverage.   I am so appreciative of what my colleague is talking about.   We are going to hear a lot of buzz words. Opponents of the Baldwin  legislation are going to talk about how they are offering flexibility  and they are offering patient-centered care. But that is just a bunch  of eyewash because what they really do, as you touched on, is to fail  to give patients care when they most need care.   Today, Americans ought to be protected from these worthless,  predatory scams. One of the things that I was proudest of, really,  before my colleagues came here, is a piece of legislation I wrote, the  Healthy Americans Act. A number of Republican Senators were cosponsors  of this bill. It had airtight, loophole-free protection to ensure that  people with preexisting conditions didn't face discrimination.   By and large, we got that provision into the Affordable Care Act. It  meant, as John McCain knew--we often talked about it--that healthcare  would no longer be there just for the healthy and the wealthy. There  would be real protections for those with preexisting conditions.   For all practical purposes, that was really one of the two or three  centerpieces of the Affordable Care Act, because, talk about a new age  in insurance, that was it. Healthcare insurance would no longer be  there for the healthy and wealthy only.   Senator Baldwin is here, and what she is trying to do--I am looking  at that clock--is trying to keep the Trump people from turning it back.  That is what they want to do when Senator Baldwin talks about the old  days--a forced march back to the days when the insurance companies  could really, in many instances, just beat the stuffing out of  vulnerable people.   I thank my colleague for what she is doing. I heard just a little bit  about it before I came over. I basically said: Let's hold off on things  for a couple of hours so I can go out there and stand with Senator  Baldwin and her allies.   I say to the Senator: To me, what is important is that you have been  here today, and it is going to be even more important that you come  back again and again and again so that that clock continues to move  forward in terms of American healthcare and not go backward. I thank my  colleague.   We are really delighted to have Senator Cortez Masto on the Senate  Finance Committee, where she has been doing a lot of good work in  healthcare  [[Page S3245]]  for consumers and seniors. I look forward to her remarks and to working  with both of my colleagues.    Mr. President, today I am introducing a set of three bills  that will lower the cost of energy storage, increase flexibility in the  power grid, and create a comprehensive set of grant programs to advance  development of renewable energy technologies throughout the country.   Currently, many energy technologies--like energy storage--compete in  unfair markets, making it hard for new innovations to measure up to  more established technologies like those of the fossil fuel industry.  Congress and the Department of Energy  [[Page S3259]]  can work hand-in-hand with industry to level the playing field, using a  fair, tech-neutral approach when updating the electricity system, to  benefit the American consumer.   My Reducing the Cost of Energy Storage Act will provide funding to  the Department of Energy to research and develop ways to lower the cost  of energy storage technologies. Ultimately, this bill will make it  possible for renewable energy to be used on a more reliable and  affordable basis.   To protect the power supply from disruptions caused by natural  disasters, which can wipe out power to millions of homes, my Flexible  Grid Infrastructure Act will require the Department of Energy to find  and develop ways to make the power grid more flexible and responsive to  these challenges. The bill will also connect displaced workers to  training programs that will allow them to transition to high-skill  clean energy jobs. Finally, this bill will provide States and utilities  with resources to upgrade the flexibility and reliability of the power  grid.   In order to ensure private sector growth in distributed energy  technologies, my Distributed Energy Demonstration Act will create  competitive, cost-share grant programs for new small-scale, grid- connected projects, such as rooftop solar panels, hot water heaters,  electric vehicles, and modernized utility pricing technologies.   Together or apart, these bills will promote a more flexible  electricity grid that can respond to power disruptions from natural  disasters and ensure reliable, low-cost electricity for consumers now  and in the future. They will also lower costs for energy storage  technologies that make renewable energy more reliable and cost- effective, boost funding for cutting-edge research, and reward State  and private sector innovations, which will make renewable energy more  reliable and affordab1e for U.S. energy consumers.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself. Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Harris, and Ms.          Klobuchar):   S. 1744. A bill to provide lawful permanent resident status for  certain advanced STEM degree holders, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.
