 Mr. Speaker, for years Republicans in Congress and the  White House have made it a top priority to end healthcare protections  for millions of Americans. They voted more than 60 times to repeal the  Affordable Care Act, but when the time came, they had no replacement to  offer.   Since President Trump took office, more than 3 million fewer  Americans have health insurance. They have removed healthcare  information from government websites and arbitrarily shut down the  Federal marketplace website at peak times to drive down enrollment.   Now the Trump administration is at it again, pushing the extreme  Texas v. U.S. lawsuit that would repeal the entire ACA and throw  America's healthcare system into total disarray. More than 130 million  Americans with preexisting conditions would lose their healthcare  protections, out-of-pocket costs would jump for millions of America's  seniors and families, and some 53 million more Americans would lose  access to quality, affordable health coverage before 2024.    My Democratic colleagues and I are fighting back to improve coverage  and lower more Americans' health premiums, bring down prescription drug  costs, and strengthen Medicare and Medicaid for this generation and the  next.   The American people are right not to trust this Republican Congress  or President with their healthcare. Let's stop this endless repeal  without replace effort and get back to solutions that will work for the  people.                            ____________________
