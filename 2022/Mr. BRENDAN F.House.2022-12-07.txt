 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize and celebrate the legendary career of Philadelphia news  anchor Jim Gardner and to thank him for his remarkable contributions to  the Philadelphia area and broadcast journalism.   It was back in 1976 that Jim first started his career at  Philadelphia's local ABC affiliate, WPVI. For more than 46 years now,  he has helped bring the news, both good and bad, to millions of us who  live in the Delaware Valley.   Jim has been at the center of ensuring that Philadelphia and the  entire region were proud in times of success, unified in moments of  division, and calm during times of crisis.   Mr. Speaker, as a lifelong Philadelphian, it is simply impossible to  imagine Philadelphia TV without Jim Gardner. I thank him for his years  of service and wish him and his family all the best.                            ____________________
