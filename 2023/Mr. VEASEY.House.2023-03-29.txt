 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to call attention to how  Republicans' polluters energy package will do little of nothing to  finally--and I have to censor my poster here, Mr. Chairman--fix the  grid once and for all.   In February 2021, my own State of Texas had a catastrophic grid  failure during a deadly winter storm that caused 246 deaths and left 5  million people in record cold temperatures without heat and businesses  without power. Last summer, Texans again had to deal with the dangerous  and unexpected generation failures that put further strain on our  State's electric grid. These extreme weather events are not unique to  Texas.    Despite these continued problems of grid resiliency, the Republican- led package we are voting on will do little of nothing to actually fix  the grid.   It is, in fact, harmful. It is hyperpartisan. This package will make  the grid less stable. We need to make investments in electric  transmissions to meet our energy needs, create good-paying jobs, and  have cleaner air to breathe.   This package will do little to address the lower energy costs for  people across north Texas. Not only will it not help constituents pay  their energy bills, but CBO estimates that this bill will actually  increase the deficit over the 2023-2033 period by roughly $2.4 billion.   That is why I urge my Republican colleagues to stop putting polluters  over people and meet us in the middle to pass a bipartisan,  comprehensive solution that bolsters our Nation's energy independence,  helps the middle class, and finally fixes the grid.   Fix the grid, Mr. Chairman.
