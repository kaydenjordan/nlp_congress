 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for  yielding.   Endorsed by the Human Rights First, my amendment No. 182 is an answer  to what has been the opposite of the Confederate statues; that is, to  direct the military to look at outstanding African Americans to  determine the viability and the availability of naming military  installations and covered defense property after historic African  Americans who fought in every war since the Revolutionary War.    Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to have Bennie Thompson, William Lacy  Clay,   Gregory Meeks, A. Donald McEachin, Marc Veasey, Sanford Bishop,  Andre Carson, and Jahana Hayes joining me on this amendment. Let me  also say there is a long list of those who could be named.   I am offering, as well, Jackson Lee amendment 179 and ask for its  support.  [[Page H3577]]  It takes up the Cyberspace Solarium Commission report to secure our  emails. That is a very endangered species, if you will.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Congressmen Langevin, Gallagher,  Katko, and Joyce, for joining me in this bipartisan amendment.   Mr. Speaker, amendment No. 183 is clearly important to women in the  United States military. Triple-negative breast cancer, 10 to 20 percent  of breast cancer tests negative, this amendment provides $10 million  for that.   Also, we know how many of our soldiers are impacted by PTSD. Jackson  Lee amendment No. 181 provides $2.5 million for PTSD research,  something that I have been working on for more than a decade. I  organized a PTSD center in my district outside of the veterans hospital  that was funded by TRICARE.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, let me also indicate the Jackson Lee amendment No. 180,  which is very important, directs the Secretary of Defense to determine  the national security threat posed by domestic terrorist groups.   We have been working on this with Homeland Security, and we have been  embracing Armed Services. We thank them for their leadership.   This is not about violating someone's civil rights or due process. It  deals with these individuals who have gone into Black Lives Matter and  other peaceful protests to instigate activities that are violent,  including the killing of officers. I ask my colleagues to support them.   Mr. Speaker, finally, I am going to continue the work for National  Guard for COVID-19 in my district because, obviously, Texas is  suffering, with 300,000 cases and thousands of people dead. We need our  National Guard for testing.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in strong support of the Chairman En  Bloc Amendment No. 2, including all the Jackson Lee Amendments made in  order for consideration of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021   I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Thornberry and their staffs  for working with me and my staff and including these Jackson Lee  Amendments.   I offer my appreciation and thanks to Ranking Member Thornberry, for  his service to this body as the Chair of the Armed Services Committee  and now as Ranking Member of that Committee.   His even handed and balanced leadership of the Committee the support  of the current Chair of the Committee Chairman Smith is laudable and  noteworthy.   I offered several amendments to H.R. 6395 to improve the bill.   I thank the Rules Committee under the leadership of Chairman McGovern  for the inclusion of the following Jackson Lee Amendments:   Jackson Lee Amendment 180 in the Rule directs the Secretary of  Defense to report to Congress the extent, if any, of the threat to  national security posed by domestic terrorist groups and organizations  motivated by a belief system of white supremacy, such as the Boogaloo  and Proud Boys extremists.   As a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary and on Homeland  Security I have in the past and with increasing alarm, raised concerns  over the role that Boogaloo and Proud Boys have played in bringing an  element of violence into the otherwise peaceful protests following the  death of George Floyd.   The violence seen during the recent national movement to end the  deaths of unarmed black men while in police custody is not the start of  these violent activities associated with Boogaloo movement or Proud  Boys activity.   The threat posed by accelerationists and militia extremists-a range  of violent anti-government actors, movements, and organizations, some  of which spring from discredited but decades-old ideologies and others  which are relatively new has led to violent engagement of law  enforcement.   These varied threats range from decentralized and leaderless  accelerationist networks using social media platforms, such as the  Boogaloo movement, to more structured, far-right militia extremist  groups.   The ideologies undergirding these movements or groups have some  similarities to other anti-government and white supremacist beliefs but  are often not tied to a single, monolithic ideology.   In addition, in many cases, their adherents' decentralized and coded  use of digital tools poses unique challenges for law enforcement and  government officials to identify and track their activity.   These developments in domestic terrorism, as reported in the media  and government intelligence reports--coupled with recent arrests and  successful violent attacks carried out by ``Boogaloo boys'' and militia  extremists--are troubling.   One of my major concerns is that as the nation moves toward a  historic national election, the activity of violence influencers like  Boogaloo Boys or Proud Boys will increase and lead to attacks becoming  more frequent.   Mr. Speaker, a little background in order to place in perspective the  need for the Jackson Lee Amendment No. 180.   As reported in the Washington Post, on May 29, 2020, in Oakland,  California, a white van pulled up outside a federal courthouse while  protestors were gathered peaceably to protest the killing of George  Floyd earlier that month by officers of the Minneapolis Police  Department.   But on that day in Oakland, a door slid open, and a man peppered the  two security officers outside with bullets, killing one and wounding  the other.   For a little over a week, the crime was a mystery.   Was it related to the protests just blocks away?   It was not. The answer came on June 17, 2020, when federal  authorities identified the man, an Air Force Staff Sgt. who was an  adherent of the ``boogaloo boys,'' a growing online extremist movement  that has sought to use peaceful protests against police brutality to  spread fringe views and ignite a race war.   Federal investigators allege that is exactly what the shooter was  trying to do last month, to ignite a race war.   Mr. Speaker, this nation fought a bloody Civil War over 160 years  ago; we surely do not want to go down that path again.   Make no mistake, neither this amendment nor anyone of goodwill has  any purpose, interest, or desire in stifling or limiting the legitimate  First Amendment and other constitutional rights of any person.   I have devoted my entire congressional career to expanding civil and  human rights for all.   But in 2018, we saw too many instances of violent, not peaceful,  extremists searching for opportunities to sow violence and disrupt  democratic processes.   Boogaloo and Proud Boys are targeting constitutionally protected  activity for cooption or to provide cover for attacks.   Jackson Lee Amendment #180 direct the Secretary of Defense to submit  a report to Congress that will provide valuable insight into activities  associated with Boogaloo and Proud Boys.   To be clear, this amendment is concerned only with groups or entities  with a known history of violence or have a history of engaging in  violent activity directed at the United States government; it is not  intended to cover any other group or provide a justification for  investigating groups whose mission, purpose, and activities to date  have been peaceful and non-violent.   And as this legislative measure proceeds, I will be working closely  with my colleagues, administration officials, the ACLU and advocacy and  public policy groups to ensure that the amendment achieves its intended  purpose, including working to include additional refinements other and  conditions if necessary.   Jackson Lee Amendment 182, directs the Secretary of Defense to report  on the number of military bases, installations, and facilities that are  named after African Americans; and directs each Secretary responsible  for a branch of the military to establish a review process to consider  the naming of military installations and covered defense property under  the jurisdiction of that Secretary after African Americans who served  in the Armed Forces with honor, heroism, and distinction and are  deserving of recognition.   I thank my colleagues: Congressmen Bennie Thompson, William Lacy  Clay, Gregory Meeks, A. Donald McEachin, Marc Veasey, Stanford Bishop,  Andre Carson, and Johana Hayes for joining as cosponsors of this  Amendment.   In every war waged from the Battle of Lexington to the Battle for  Fallujah, African Americans have honorably answered the call to duty,  and served with valor and distinction in America's armed forces.   At decisive moments in our nation's history, the United States  military and its citizen warriors, were there and made the difference.   Our thanks to the military for being always ready to answer the call  of duty--whether that call comes in the dead of night or the light of  day--we know that we can count on you.   The fact that military bases have been named after Confederate  military leaders or  [[Page H3578]]  soldiers is hard to imagine given that they were fighting to end the  United States.   The Confederacy was not something that should be held up for honor by  the United States or our nation's military.   There is no shortage of honorable replacement candidates to receive  the honor of having a military base, installation or facility named in  their honor.   General Robinson was a 1951 graduate of West Point who attended the  service academy before the Army was desegregate. Robinson served in  Korea and Vietnam, with valor decorations in both conflicts, and as a  training officer as part of the U.S. military support mission in  Liberia. He went on to become the first black commander of the 82nd  Airborne Division, deputy chief of staff for operations in U.S. Army  Europe, commander of U.S. Forces Japan, the U.S. representative on the  NATO Military Committee, and the first black four-star general in the  Army.   William Carney was the first African American recipient of the  Congressional Medal of Honor, which he received for his actions on July  18, 1863 at Fort Wagner, SC while a member of the 54th Massachusetts  Regiment in the Civil War--the state's first all-black regiment.   The 54th Massachusetts was the subject of the film, ``Glory,''  starring Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman.   Lieutenant Colonel Charity Edna Adams was appointed to lead the  African-American Women's Army Corps unit designated as the 6888th  Central Postal Directory Battalion, which became known as the ``Six  Triple Eight.''   This unit was instrumental in establishing and maintaining morale  because it assured that mail from the battlefront and the home-front  flowed efficiently and timely.   In 1964, Margaret E. Bailey, Army Nurse Corps, was the first nurse to  be promoted to lieutenant colonel.   Dorie Miller, Messman First Class was Serving in a noncombat role in  the Navy, Dorie Miller responded heroically when the battleship West  Virginia was attacked at Pearl Harbor. He was the first African  American to be awarded the Navy Cross, the third highest honor awarded  by the US Navy at the time.   Admiral Michelle Howard is a four star Admiral and one of the  highest-ranking African American women ever to serve in any branch of  the military. Admiral Howard is also the first African American woman  to command a U.S. Navy ship, the USS Rushmore.   She is the Navy's second highest ranking officer and is currently  serving as the commander of U.S. Naval Forces Africa, commander of U.S.  Naval Forces Europe and commander of Allied Joint Force Command Naples.   In 2012, Lieutenant Colonel Kimbrell became the first female African- American fighter pilot in the Air Force history. Her flights in  Northern Watch marked her as the first female pilot to fly combat  missions for Misawa's 35th Fighter Wing, and the first African-American  woman to employ ordinance in combat. She has more than 1,110 hours in  the F-16, including 176 hours of combat time.   Colonel Lucas was the first African American woman in the Air Force  to be promoted to the rank of colonel. At the time of her retirement in  1970, she was the highest-ranking African American woman in the Air  Force.   In 1959 General Benjamin O. Davis became the first African-American  Major General in the United States Air Force. In 1943, he organized and  commanded the 332nd Fighter Group known as the Tuskegee Airmen. General  Davis received many decorations during his career, including two  Distinguished Service Medals and a Silver Star. On December 9, 1998,  General Davis was awarded his fourth general's star by President Bill  Clinton .   Chief Petty Officer Haley is best known for writing letters for his  shipmates and his short stories and articles, which got him promoted to  Chief Journalist of the Coast Guard in 1959. Haley ultimately received  a number of military honors, including the American Defense Service  Medal, World War II Victory Medal and an honorary degree from the Coast  Guard Academy. And most of you know him also as the author of  ``Roots.''   In 1957, Captain Bobby Wilks became the first African American Coast  Guard aviator. He later became the first African American to reach the  rank of Captain and the first to command a Coast Guard air station. He  accumulated over 6,000 flight hours in 18 different types of aircrafts.   Twenty-five percent of the today's military is comprised of persons  of color, of which 17.8% are African American.   In 2017, blacks made up 17% of the DOD active-duty military--somewhat  higher than their share of the U.S. population ages 18 to 44 (13%).  Blacks have consistently been represented in greater shares among  enlisted personnel (19% in 2015) than among the commissioned officers  (9%).   Jackson Lee Amendment 179 implements a recommendation made by the  Cyberspace Solarium Commission to require the Secretary of Homeland  Security to develop a strategy to implement Domain-based Message  Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) standard across  U.S.-based email providers.   I thank my Colleagues Congressmen Langevin, Gallagher, Katko, and  Joyce for joining this bipartisan amendment to the FY 2021 NOAA.   Internet's underlying core email protocol, Simple Mail Transport  Protocol (SMTP), was first adopted in 1982 and is still deployed and  operated today.   However, this protocol is susceptible to a wide range of attacks  including man-in-the-middle content modification and content  surveillance.   The security of email has grown in importance as it has become in  many ways the primary way that businesses, consumers, government  communicate.   This amendment would enact through the NDAA recommendations of the  Cyberspace Solarium Commission.   The Commission's 75 recommendations are organized under six pillars:   (1) Reform the U.S. Government's Structure and Organization for  Cyberspace;   (2) Strengthen Norms and Non-Military Tools;   (3) Promote National Resilience;   (4) Reshape the Cyber Ecosystem toward Greater Security;   (5) Operationalize Cybersecurity Collaboration with the Private  Sector; and   (6) Preserve and Employ the Military Instrument of Power.   This amendment presents an opportunity to take a significant step  forward in establishing a cybersecurity ecosystem that reinforces a  cultural shift in how the Federal government enforces norms that  sustain cybersecurity.   Ransomware, spyware, and botnet exploits use the untraceable nature  of email to wreak havoc and commit crimes.   I firmly believe that there is a means of assuring the privacy, and  security of email communications that are on par with the privacy and  security of physical mail delivery, and that this amendment is an  important first step in that direction.   Jackson Lee Amendment 183, in the Rule provides authorization for a  $10 million increase in funding for increased collaboration with NIH to  combat Triple Negative Breast Cancer.   As a Member of Congress, a mother, a sister and a spouse, and a  breast cancer survivor, I feel a special responsibility to do all I can  to ensure every American can win in the fight against all types of  breast cancer but especially triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).   About 10-20% of breast cancers test negative for both ; hormone  receptors and HER2 in the lab, which means they are triple-negative.   What is Triple Negative Breast Cancer?   The term triple negative breast cancer refers to the fact that this  form of breast cancer will test negative, which means that each of the  test will return negative results for the presence of breast cancer for  three types of breast cancer test: Estrogen receptor; Progesterone  receptor; and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 or the HER2 test  will be negative.   To understand triple-negative breast cancer, it's important to  understand receptors, which are proteins found inside and on the  surface of cells.   These receptor proteins are the ``eyes'' and ``ears'' of the cells,  receiving messages from substances in the bloodstream and then telling  the cells what to do.   Hormone receptors inside and on the surface of healthy breast cells  receive messages from the hormone's estrogen and progesterone.   The hormones attach to the receptors and provide instructions that  help the cells continue to grow and function well.   Most, but not all, breast cancer cells also have these hormone  receptors.   Roughly 2 out of 3 women have breast cancer that tests positive for  hormone receptors.   A smaller percentage of breast cancers--about 20-30%--have too many  HER2 receptors. In normal, healthy breast cells, HER2 receptors receive  signals that stimulate their growth.   With too many HER2 receptors, however, breast cancer cells grow and  divide too quickly.   Hormonal therapies and HER2-targeted therapies work to interfere with  the effects of hormones and HER2 on breast cancer, which can help slow  or even stop the growth of breast cancer cells.   Since hormones are not supporting its growth, the cancer is unlikely  to respond to hormonal therapies.   Triple-negative breast cancer also is unlikely to respond to  medications that target HER2.   In addition, triple-negative breast cancer: Tends to be more  aggressive than other types of breast cancer.   Five-year survival rates also tend to be lower for triple-negative  breast cancer.   Triple Negative Breast Cancer tends to be higher grade than other  types of breast cancer.  [[Page H3579]]    Studies have shown that triple-negative breast cancer is more likely  to spread beyond the breast and more likely to recur (come back) after  treatment.   These risks appear to be greatest in the first few years after  treatment.   For example, a study of more than 1,600 women in Canada published in  2007 found that women with triple-negative breast cancer were at higher  risk of having the cancer recur outside the breast--but only for the  first 3 years.   Other studies have reached similar conclusions.   As years go by, the risks of the triple-negative breast cancer  recurring become similar to those risk levels for other types of breast  cancer.   In 2013, the American Cancer Society Surveillance and Health Services  Institute estimated that 27,060 black women would be diagnosed with the  illness.   The rate of breast cancer is 10% lower in African American women than  white women--it is the type of breast cancer (Triple Negative) that  African American women contract that is alarming.   Because African American women are diagnosed in greater numbers with  Triple Negative Breast Cancer, we have a five year survival rate of 78%  after diagnosis as compared to 90% for white women.   The incidence rate of breast cancer among women under 45 is higher  for African American women compared to white women.   Triple Negative Breast Cancer: Accounts for between 13% and 25% of  all breast cancer in the United States; Onset is at a younger age; Is  more aggressive; and Is more likely to metastasize.   Currently, 70% of women with metastatic triple negative breast cancer  do not live more than five years after being diagnosed.   African American women are 3 times more likely to develop triple- negative breast cancer than White women.   African-American women have prevalence TNBC of 26% vs. 16% in non- African-Americans women   Five-year Survival Rates   The key to beating this cancer is not just early detection--but  detection period.   A 2007 study of more than 50,000 women with all stages of breast  cancer found that 77% of women with triple-negative breast cancer  survived at least 5 years, versus 93% of women with other types of  breast cancer.   Another study of more than 1,600 women published in 2007 found that  women with triple-negative breast cancer had a higher risk of death  within 5 years of diagnosis, but not after that time period. The recurrence and survival figures in these and other studies are  averages for all women with triple-negative breast cancer.   Factors such as the grade and stage of the breast cancer will  influence an individual woman's prognosis.   The higher the grade, the less the cancer cells resemble normal,  healthy breast cells in their appearance and growth patterns.   It can feel upsetting and even scary to find out that you have a form  of breast cancer that (1) is often more aggressive than other types and  (2) isn't a good candidate for treatments such as hormonal therapy and  Herceptin.   But triple-negative breast cancer can be treated with chemotherapy  and radiation therapy and new treatments--such as PARP inhibitors--are  showing promise.   Researchers are paying a great deal of attention to triple-negative  breast cancer and working to find new and better ways to treat it.   This is an exceptionally hot area of research in the breast cancer  field,'' says George Sledge, M.D., medical oncologist and  Breastcancer.org Professional Advisory Board member.   There is immense interest among drug developers, pharmaceutical  companies, and breast cancer laboratory researchers in finding targeted  therapies for these patients.   About 15-20 percent of breast cancers are triple negative.   Triple Negative tumors tend to occur more often in younger women and  African-American women.   In studies of U.S. and British women, triple negative breast cancer  appears to be more common among black women (especially before  menopause) compared to white women.   Triple negative breast cancer may also be more common among Hispanic  women compared to white women.   Although the reasons for racial/ ethnic differences in rates of  triple negative breast cancer are not clear, lifestyle factors may play  a role.   For example, some findings show African-American women tend to have  lower rates of breastfeeding compared to other women, which may  increase the chances of having triple negative breast cancer.   Certain reproductive and lifestyle factors may protect more against  ER-positive breast cancers than ER-negative breast cancers, including  triple negative breast cancers.   For example, African-American and Hispanic women are more likely than  white women: Have a younger age at first birth; and maybe be overweight  or obese before menopause.   Although these factors lower the risk of breast cancer, this be efit  may be limited to ER-positive breast cancers.   So, even though African-American and Hispanic women may be more  likely than white women to have these protective factors, the factors  may not lower the risk of triple negative breast cancers.   There is even some evidence these factors may increase the risk of  triple negative breast cancers.   For these and the tens of thousands of survivors and their daughters  this amendment is needed.   Jackson Lee Amendment 181 in the Rule provides authorization for $2.5  million increase in funding to combat post-traumatic stress disorder  (PTSD).   According to the NIH, an estimated 3.6% of U.S. adults had PTSD in  the past year.   PTSD was first brought to public attention in relation to war  veterans, but it can result from a variety of traumatic incidents, such  as torture, being kidnapped or held captive, bombings, or natural  disasters such as floods or earthquakes.   People with PTSD may startle easily, become emotionally numb  (especially in relation to people with whom they used to be close),  lose interest in things they used to enjoy, have trouble feeling  affectionate, be irritable, become more aggressive, or even become  violent.   They avoid situations that remind them of the original incident, and  anniversaries of the incident are often very difficult.   Most people with PTSD repeatedly relive the trauma in their thoughts  during the day and in nightmares when they sleep. These are called  flashbacks. A person having a flashback may lose touch with reality and  believe that the traumatic incident is happening all over again.   My amendment recognizes that these soldiers are first and, foremost,  human. They carry their experiences with them.   Ask a veteran of Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan about the frequency of  nightmares they experience, and one will realize that serving in the  Armed Forces leaves a lasting impression, whether good or bad.   My amendment will help ensure that ``no soldier is left behind'' by  addressing the urgent need for more outreach toward hard to reach  veterans suffering from PTSD, especially those who are homeless or  reside in underserved urban and rural areas of our country.   I urge my colleagues to support of these Jackson Lee Amendments.    Madam Speaker, I was unavoidably detained in my  district and I missed the rule vote on the NDAA. If I were present, I  would have voted ``aye.'' I missed the previous question on the NDAA.  If I were present, I would have voted ``aye.''                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, it was very difficult to come to  Washington, leaving my constituents behind, having engaged with them  for all of the moments that I have been in the district.   They are good people. The State of Texas is filled with good people.  The Nation is filled with good people.   How we got to 300,000 cases and thousands of deaths, 10,000 cases in  the last 24 hours in our jurisdictions of Harris County and Houston, is  tragic and baffling. We opened too early.   A number of Members of Congress have written our Governor and asked  him to return authority to our local communities, our county and our  city, to allow them to make determinations of a stay-at-home order-- painful, I know it is--in order to be able to do this by science and  medicine.   Let me be very clear. The headlines in my paper said today it is  difficult doing contact tracing. People are out and about. You don't  have good information. So I am asking the Governor to adhere to our  request.   But more importantly, I want my colleagues to work with me to restore  the National Guard that were stupendous in doing testing. We do not  have enough. And I look forward to working with Armed Services and  others to ensure the Texas National Guard can be back to do testing to  help save lives.   We have got to save lives, and we should not be a respecter of what  State. We are one State and one Nation.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 42 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, pursuant to section 4(b) of House  Resolution 967 and pursuant to House Resolution 1054, the House  adjourned until tomorrow, Tuesday, July 21, 2020, at 9 a.m., for  morning-hour debate and 10 a.m. for legislative business, as a further  mark of respect to the memory of the late Honorable John Lewis.                            ____________________
