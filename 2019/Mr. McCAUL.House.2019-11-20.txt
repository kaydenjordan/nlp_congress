 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for  yielding.   I rise in support of this bill to help end the inhumane practice of  shark finning. After a shark's fins are removed, these majestic  creatures are thrown into the ocean to die, and multiple species face  extinction.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, Congressman Sablan, for his  courageous leadership to introduce this bill, which I strongly support.   The United States banned shark finning. Now we must end the shark fin  trade. Major retailers, airliners, and shipping companies refuse to  ship or sell shark fin products. And 12 states, including my home State  of Texas have bans on shark fin trading. It is time for a Federal ban,  Mr. Speaker.   The United States led in ending the trade of trafficking ivory and  rhino horns, and now we must lead in the shark fin trade itself.   Mr. Speaker, I wanted to end and close with a personal thanks to my  wife, Linda, who is an oceanographer who spent many years serving our  country in Naval intelligence tracking Soviet submarines, and now she  tracks sharks by tagging sharks and following them around the world as  they exist.                                time  1415    As she told me when she returned from Guadeloupe Island, on the very  same boat that Peter Benchley went out on as he saw the majestic great  white shark, in his words, he says that the greatest regret of his life  was writing the book ``Jaws.''   I thank Delegate Sablan, and I thank my wife, Linda, for great  testimony before this committee. I stand in strong support, and I hope  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join us on this momentous  day.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise today in support of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy  Act. Two months ago I had the opportunity to join a press conference  with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Chairman Engel, my colleague, Chris Smith,  and Hong Kong prodemocracy activists Joshua Wong, Nathan Law, and  Denise Ho to denounce China's authoritarian brutality.   I said it then and I will say it again; today we stand here not as  Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans united in our strong support  for Hong Kong.   And I would like to take this opportunity to speak directly to the  people of Hong Kong, who I know are watching this right now. America  stands with you, and America will always support you. We hear you sing  our national anthem. We see you carrying our American flag. This is a  battle between democracy versus dictatorship, liberty versus tyranny,  and freedom versus oppression.   This bill sends a clear message to China that there will be  consequences to the ruthless and brutal actions. Congress, the United  States, and the world will not stand by idly as the Chinese Communist  Party fights for itself and not its own people.   Again, I want to thank the authors of this bill. I am proud to be a  part of this movement, this cause. And we have seen quite a bit of  response on social media on this bill coming directly from the people  of Hong Kong to the Members who are on this floor saying thank you for  standing up for us.   That is democracy in action. That is what this country stands for.  And it is a proud moment, I think, for both sides of the aisle as we  are going through this time in our history to be able to stand together  for democracy and such a great movement and cause for freedom.
