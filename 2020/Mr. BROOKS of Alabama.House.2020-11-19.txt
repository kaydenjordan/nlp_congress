 Mr. Speaker, this is my third speech in a  series. Earlier, I cited constitutional and Federal law mandating that  Congress, not the Supreme Court, determines whether to accept or reject  State electoral college votes, and Congress, not the Supreme Court, has  the final verdict on Presidential elections.   My remaining speeches describe voting system failures that threaten  our Republic.   For emphasis, all republics depend on election processes that give  candidates and citizens confidence that results accurately reflect  voter will. Unfortunately, America's election process has systemic  weaknesses that too often allow voter fraud and election theft, and  fail America.   Today, I share my personal experience as a voter fraud and election  theft target.   In 1982, Democrats dominated Alabama. All Alabama statewide elected  officials were Democrats. The legislature had 136 Democrats to only  four Republicans. Democrats held every single partisan elected office  in Alabama's Tennessee Valley, from Mississippi on the west to Georgia  on the east.   In 1982, I ran as a Republican in Alabama House District 18. On  election day morning, angry voters called me nonstop about voting  machines blocking them from voting for Mo Brooks.   At first, I blew these phone calls off as isolated problems, naively  trusting America's election system. That trust was soon shattered.   I am a former prosecutor. After the election, another attorney and I  investigated. We questioned witnesses, examined documents, and  inspected voting machines.   Our investigation revealed that 11 of 45 voting machines, 25 percent  of all voting machines in my district, were rigged to block votes for  Mo Brooks. In contrast, not a single machine blocked voting for my  opponent or any other candidate on the ballot.   At one voting precinct with five rigged voting machines, poll workers  told voters that to vote for Mo Brooks, they had to give up their  secret ballot right and sign a sheet on a wall for all to see.   After the election, Democrat officials declared the voting machine  problem was possibly caused by jostling in transit that somehow  affected me, but nobody else.   What bunk.   My hometown is the birthplace of America's space program. We know  math. Mathematically, if there are 26 candidates and a machine blocks  one candidate's votes, the odds of that candidate being blocked are 1  in 26. If there are two machines and each block only one candidate, the  odds of that candidate being blocked both times are 1 in 26 squared, or  1 chance out of 676 chances.                                time  1030    Similarly, if there are 11 machines and each block a single  candidate's votes, the odds that all 11 blocked out Mo Brooks and no  one else are a 1 chance in 26 to the 11th power, which equals 1 chance  out of 3.6 quadrillion chances. Hence, the probabilities that these 11  voting machines were rigged is an overwhelming 3.6 quadrillion to 1.   So the question becomes: Who rigged the voting machines?   In 1982, Democrats totally controlled Madison County voting machines.  I was in a hotly contested race to be the only Republican legislator  elected in the northern third of Alabama. I threatened Democrat  dominance. I was the potential breach of the Democrat Party dam.   Democrats had motive. Democrats had opportunity. Democrats had  control. Democrats rigged the voting machines. Fortunately, despite the  attempted election theft, we still won with 57 percent of the vote.   Mr. Speaker, every candidate and every American has an absolute right  to an election system that stops voter fraud, prevents election theft,  and accurately records only lawful votes cast by eligible American  citizens.   As this speech and ensuing speeches will reveal, Alabama's election  system is riddled with systemic problems that too often render our  official election results unreliable. Each of these election  deficiencies must be fixed and eliminated.                            ____________________
