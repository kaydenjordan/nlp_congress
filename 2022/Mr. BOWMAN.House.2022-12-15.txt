 Madam Speaker, today, I was proud to vote for the Puerto  Rico Status Act and supporting its passage in the House of  Representatives. Now, it is time for the Senate to do its job and free  the Puerto Rico community and the Puerto Rican island to chart its own  path toward self-determination.   Puerto Rico has been a U.S. territory since 1898 without proper  representation in the United States Government. That is unacceptable.   Now, finally, if the Senate does its job, the people of Puerto Rico  can chart their own path forward and decide for themselves what is best  for them.   I was proud to take that vote today in support of my constituents, as  well as my family, as I am married to a Puerto Rican woman and my  children are Puerto Rican, as well.   Let's continue to support the self-determination of the people on the  island and the self-determination of people all over the world.                            ____________________
