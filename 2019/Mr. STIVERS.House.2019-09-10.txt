 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2852, the Homebuyer Assistance  Act of 2019.   As my friend from Guam just explained, unfortunately, there are two  different standards between the regular government-sponsored  enterprises that finance homes and the Federal Housing Administration,  FHA. Today, FHA requires certified appraisers. This bill changes it to  certified or licensed appraisers, just like the other government- sponsored enterprises, to allow the entire pool of appraisers in a  given area to be allowed to be used to appraise homes. As my friend  from Guam explained, there are appraiser shortages in many areas around  the country, so this will, I think, be very helpful.   This bill also requires a minimum amount of training that is required  by The Appraisal Foundation or State licensing agencies in order to be  an appraiser that can appraise on FHA transactions.   These changes, I think, will help appraisers, and it will help make  sure that there is a quality pool of appraisers regardless of whether  somebody has a regular government-sponsored enterprise or an FHA loan.   Mr. Speaker, we are excited to support this. This is bipartisan. I  support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to close by thanking the  gentleman from California for a bipartisan bill. I thank the gentleman  from Wisconsin, Sean Duffy, from our side, the lead Republican on this  bill.   This is a bill that will get more appraisers in the pool to help  people who want to buy homes that are financed by the FHA.   Mr. Speaker, it is a win-win, and it is a bipartisan bill. We urge  its support, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3620, the Strategy and  Investment in Rural Housing Preservation Act of 2019. Statistics from  the U.S. Department of Agriculture show that 15 percent of our  population lives in rural areas, and in that area, rural renters  generally have significantly lower incomes than rural homeowners.   Nearly one-third of them live below the poverty level. In fact, the  average annual income of tenants in USDA Section 515 financed  properties is approximately $13,600, and the majority of those  residents are either senior citizens or people with disabilities.   Rural housing makes up about 28.4 percent of rural and small-town  housing stock, a significant part of the rural housing market. It is  clear that the challenges of rural America are multifaceted. This bill  would help address some of those, and it would help make sure that  outcomes currently experienced as a result of the interaction of RHS'  owner assistance programs and the tenant rental assistance programs not  working well together.   The program is structured in a way that the departure of properties  from the programs, when an owner's loans either mature or are prepaid,  negatively impacts the availability of rental assistance for tenants. I  think it is safe to say that the system currently does not make much  sense, and there is a need for greater reform and consolidation.   H.R. 3620 is a step in the right direction. I would like to thank the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay), my colleague, for his work on this  very important and long-neglected issue of rural housing.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I rise in support of H.R. 3620. I  want to commend the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay) for his  incredible work on rural housing.   As a congressman from a rural district, over 50 percent of my  district is rural. This is going to help people all around the country.  I thank Congressman Clay. We have a lot more work to do on rural  housing, but this is a good start.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge adoption, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as my friend from Guam just explained, the Federal  Reserve Bank has had a very long history--130 presidents of Regional  Federal Reserve Banks--and it took from 1913 to 2013--100 years--for  the first African American to become president of one of those regional  banks.   Additionally, only 8 of the 12 regional banks have ever had a woman  president. These demographics are not reflective of the people the  Federal Reserve serves.   The National Football League had a similar track record when it came  to head coaches in the past. In 2003, the league adopted the so-called  Rooney Rule, which required every team with a head coaching vacancy to  interview at least one or more diverse candidates.   In 2009, the Rooney Rule had expanded to include general manager  jobs, and in 2016, the requirement was updated to require every team to  interview at least one woman during the hiring process for executive  positions.   When the Rooney Rule went into effect, there were only two head  coaches of color in the National Football League. The following year  there were three, and those numbers have continued to grow. Last  season, there was a record eight coaches of color in the NFL, the  highest number in league history.   H.R. 281 does not create a quota or hiring mandate. It simply pledges  opportunities for women and minorities,  [[Page H7578]]  as the Rooney Rule did for coaches of color in the NFL and for women in  the executive ranks of the NFL.   At four hearings this year, the Committee on Financial Services heard  from numerous witnesses that the effort to increase diversity  throughout the financial services sector relies on expanding the pool  of candidates to include more women and minorities.   We heard from witnesses how diverse perspectives among the firm's  leadership lead to better decisionmaking and better outcomes.   H.R. 281 applies these principles to the Federal Reserve banking  system. The bill directs the Federal Reserve Regional Banks to  interview at least one individual reflective of gender and racial or  ethnic diversity when appointing a Federal Reserve president.   The Rooney Rule has been adopted across the private sector and is  considered an industry best practice for firms trying to increase  diversity in their senior leadership. We have an opportunity now to  expand that concept to the Federal Reserve Bank.   I am proud to have been a cosponsor of this bill with the gentlewoman  from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), chairwoman, my friend and colleague. I thank  her as the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion  for bringing forward such a commonsense idea with a proven track record  that is seen as the best practice across the industry.   This legislation will diversify the applicant pool and increase  opportunities for women and minority leaders at the Federal Reserve  Bank.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Gonzalez), who is the vice ranking member of the Financial  Services Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion and who knows the  Rooney Rule firsthand since he was a standout wide receiver for the  NFL's Indianapolis Colts.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 281 is just common sense. It is a best  practice in the industry. It has shown that it will increase the  diversity of the staff, and we hope that it will work for the Federal  Reserve banks.   The Federal Reserve banks' record on diversity needs to be improved.  I believe this is a great first step.   I congratulate my colleague Joyce Beatty from Ohio and my colleague  Anthony Gonzalez from Ohio for their incredible efforts on this. I am  happy to be a cosponsor and urge adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 241, the Bank Service Company  Examination Coordination Act of 2019.   This bill amends the Bank Service Company Act to enhance State and  Federal regulators' ability to coordinate examinations and share  information with a bank's technology vendors and partners.   State and Federal regulatory authorities are rightfully frustrated by  the inability to share information as a result of constraints resulting  from the Bank Service Company Act, specifically the duplicative  examination processes that are in no way uniform or collaborative.  Their inability to share exam information between Federal and State  regulators creates vulnerabilities in the financial system.   The commonsense changes contained in H.R. 241 reduce the regulatory  burden for institutions that are already struggling to comply with the  current regulatory regime.   H.R. 241 also helps enhance the safety and soundness of our financial  system by allowing regulators to coordinate their activities.   Sharing exam results among agencies allows risks and weaknesses of  individual institutions, as well as the overall financial system, to be  revealed more effectively. It also allows Federal and State financial  agencies to more effectively expend limited resources and avoid  duplicative examinations, strengthen communications among regulators,  and ensure the appropriate level of oversight for risk to the financial  system is maintained.   To put it in perspective, the Bank Service Company Act was enacted in  1962. That is 1 year before ZIP Codes were introduced and the first  push-button telephone was made available to the American consumer. A  lot has changed since 1962. The Bank Service Company Act fails to take  into consideration the advancements in technology and the implications  for nearly half a century of consumer data.   The statute needs modernization. In 2017, the Financial Stability  Oversight Council recommended congressional action to encourage better  coordination between Federal and State regulators as it relates to  overseeing financial institutions and periodically as it relates to  their relationships with third-party and technology service providers.  Two years later, legislation that would encourage coordination is still  needed.   I commend the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams) for being the  sponsor and champion of this issue over several years, as well as the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks), who has been a strong advocate for  modernization.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 241,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1400     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams), who is a great entrepreneur, a  great businessman, and a supporter of the free market system.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 241 will help reduce duplicative examinations and better  coordinate the exams that State and Federal agencies give to our  financial system to better identify vulnerabilities of individual  institutions in the overall system. It is a bipartisan act that will do  great things for our financial services system. I would urge its  adoption.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 1690, the Carbon Monoxide ALERTS Act of  2019, by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Garcia).   Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas emitted from household  items like stoves, furnaces, fireplaces, and portable generators that  can cause sudden illness or death when it is inhaled.   The Centers for Disease Control, CDC, reports that each year more  than 400 Americans die from unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning,  and more than 4,000 people are hospitalized.   The good news is that carbon monoxide poisoning is easily detectable  and preventable through the installation of relatively inexpensive,  battery-operated carbon monoxide detectors.   But, unlike fire alarms, Federal law doesn't currently require  federally assisted housing properties to have carbon monoxide  detectors. H.R. 1690 would address that by requiring that properties in  Section 8 public housing, Section 202 for elderly folks, and Section  811 for disabled people have at least one carbon monoxide detector per  floor installed.   This bill builds on the proactive work of HUD Secretary Ben Carson.  In April, Secretary Carson issued a notice to all properties in the  programs encouraging them to do just that and followed up with a  release of $5 million in funding for the installation of these  detectors in public housing. I commend Secretary Carson for taking that  action and issuing that guidance.   I also want to thank Representative Garcia for this legislation, and  I want to thank Senator Scott for his work on similar legislation in  the United States Senate. This is a bill that will save lives and will  help make us all safer.   Again, I want to commend Representative Garcia for his great work on  this. I would urge its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr.  Speaker, again, I rise in support of H.R. 1690, the CO ALERTS Act. I  want to thank my colleague from Illinois (Mr. Garcia). I also want to  recognize Senator Tim Scott from South Carolina, who was the Senate  sponsor of the bill, and we want to help make this into law. I rise in  support of this legislation and would urge all my colleagues to support  this great legislation from Mr. Garcia and Senator Scott.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
