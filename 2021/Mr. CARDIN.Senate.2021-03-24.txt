 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to urge swift passage of the  PPP Extension Act, which will extend the March 31 deadline for the  Paycheck Protection Program 2 months, to May 31, and give the SBA an  additional month, through June 30, to process any backlogged  applications.   This Saturday, March 27, will be the 1-year date since the CARES Act  was enacted. In that time, SBA has approved 8.2 million PPP loans worth  more than $715 billion.   These loans have saved small businesses throughout our Nation. They  would not be here today but for this program. It also saved the stress  on our unemployment insurance system by keeping small business  employees on the payroll. And as I am sure the Presiding Officer knows,  for a small business, it is difficult to find a workforce and to keep a  workforce, and the Paycheck Protection Program allowed small businesses  to maintain their workforce so that when the pandemic is over, they are  going to be ready for our growing economy.   The world feels a little different today than it did a year ago. The  American people are finally beginning to see a light at the end of the  tunnel. More than 124 million vaccine doses have been administered, and  public health officials nationwide are beginning to ease restrictions  on public gatherings.   We can see a light at the end of the tunnel, but we are not there  yet. Small businesses are struggling, but in spite of those struggles,  small businesses are still showing up for our communities.   The Baltimore Sun recently published a story about a restaurant in my  hometown of Baltimore that captured the essence of the value that small  businesses bring to our communities.   Steve Chu and Ephrem Abebe, co-owners of the popular restaurant in  Baltimore named Ekiben, recently drove 6 hours from Baltimore to  Vermont to prepare a meal for a longtime customer who was on her  deathbed. They did this at their own cost because that is what small  business owners do. They are part of our community. Afterward, Mr. Chu  and Mr. Abebe called the decision a ``no-brainer'' and viewed their  trip as a way to say thank you to a customer who had supported them for  years.   That is what makes small businesses special. They are more than  places we go to buy products or enjoy a meal. They are vital pillars in  our community. That story and countless others like it are why we  passed the PPP program initially and why we must pass the PPP Extension  Act--so PPP can continue to be a lifeline for small businesses in the  coming months.   Congress and the Biden administration have implemented significant  improvements to the PPP in recent months that have made the program  more equitable and useful. So we must now extend the deadline to allow  small businesses and nonprofits to take full advantage and receive the  help that they need.   In December, Congress passed the bipartisan Economic Aid Act, which  provided an additional $284 billion to PPP and made second-round PPP  loans available to small businesses that had spent their initial PPP  loan and can demonstrate a 25-percent loss in revenue. The bill also  expanded eligibility of PPP to include certain local newspapers, TV  stations and radio stations, as well as 501(c)6 nonprofits.   I must remind my colleagues that while the SBA was beginning to  implement the improvements we made to the PPP in the Economic Aid Act,  the Agency was also undergoing a transition from the Trump  administration to the Biden administration. Transitions, even under the  best circumstances, can be disruptive to an Agency's work.   On February 22, the Biden administration took strong action to get  funding to small businesses that were either left out or underfunded  during prior rounds of PPP. The administration implemented a 14-day  exclusive window for small businesses with fewer than 20 employees. It  updated the maximum loan calculation formula for sole proprietors, and  it eliminated rules prohibiting small businesses owned by formerly  incarcerated individuals and individuals with delinquent Federal  student loans from securing a PPP loan.   It made it possible and much more worthwhile for small businesses to  apply for PPP loans, but it takes time. PPP is a forgivable loan, but  you have to have a financial institution to make that loan. It has to  be processed, it has to be approved, and it can't be done by the end of  this month.   During the exclusivity period, SBA approved PPP loans for more than  400,000 small businesses and nonprofits with fewer than 20 employees,  nearly half of which were first-time borrowers. We are reaching the  hard to serve, the most needy of the small businesses. They finally got  help.   Earlier this month, we passed the historic American Rescue Plan. The  plan expanded PPP eligibility even more, to include more nonprofits as  well as digital news platforms. The plan provides overdu aid to the  local chapters of large nonprofits, such as the YMCA and Goodwill,  which had not had prior access to PPP due to having multiple locations  totaling more than 500 employees. The plan makes these nonprofits  eligible for PPP loans worth up to $10 million, as long as each  location does not exceed the employee limit. That makes sense.    During a hearing examining PPP last week, the small business  community heard testimony from John Hoey, who leads the YMCA chapter  that serves the Baltimore region. John urged us to extend the PPP to  give nonprofit leaders more time to understand the program. He said:         I can tell you that colleagues of mine who run large Ys       around the country and large nonprofits in Baltimore are       still trying to understand the program and figure out if they       qualify. I think a 3-month extension is not only warranted       but owed to all of us after what we've been through this past       year.    We also heard testimony from Lisa Mensah, who leads the Opportunity  Finance Network, which is the national  [[Page S1732]]  association of CDFIs, our mission lenders. She warned us that  ``thousands of business owners will not receive access to PPP without  an extension.''   She told us about a CDFI in Jackson, MS, that estimates that 1,300  loans from small businesses that applied for PPP will not receive funds  if we do not extend the deadline. Of these 1,300 applicants, 98 percent  are businesses with fewer than 20 employees, 95 percent are minority- owned, and nearly 100 of them are veteran- or veteran-spouse-owned  small businesses.   This is only one CDFI out of hundreds nationwide. The story will be  repeated--those that have been left out. The committee has also been  urged to extend the deadline by the business community. On March 15,  more than 90 chambers of commerce, trade groups, and business  organizations sent a letter urging extension, and they said:         Nearly one year into the COVID-19 pandemic, the continued       liquidity challenges of the small business sector are acute.    It is clear that there is still an overwhelming need for PPP loans,  which is why the PPP Extension Act passed the House of Representatives  by a 415-to-3 vote. This is bipartisan. The bill that we are talking  about is sponsored by Senator Collins. Senator Shaheen and I are also  on that bill.   The good news is that the resources are there. We have been informed  by the SBA that the extension of the deadline can work within the funds  that have already been made available by Congress. The money is there.   This is not the first time we have done this. I must remind my  colleagues that, last year, as PPP was approaching its deadline, I  brought a bill to the floor of the Senate and worked with Senator Rubio  to give small businesses more time to get their applications filed. I  must also remind my colleagues that we passed that extension to  preserve access to PPP while we continued negotiating on broader  changes to the program. We need to do the same thing again.   I know that there are other modifications to the program that we will  have an opportunity to discuss, and I am committed to conducting those  discussions in the same bipartisan manner that I have approached the  development of these programs. In fact, later today, in just 45  minutes, there will be a hearing of the Small Business Committee where  we will be doing oversight on the programs that we made available  during COVID-19, and we will have representatives from government  responsible for those programs, including the SBA.   But the bottom line: We first need to extend the program. We have got  to make sure it doesn't expire next week. We must get this done. The  need is there, and the funds are there.    Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate Irish-American  Heritage Month and the many contributions of Irish immigrants to the  United States of America. The Irish have been a part of our country  since its foundation. Donegal-born Richard Montgomery was the first  American general to lose his life in the Revolutionary War. Especially  during the 19th and early 20th centuries, many Irish immigrants came to  America to escape religious persecution, famine, and economic hardship,  and to seek new opportunities for themselves and their families.   Maryland's long tradition of religious tolerance provided safe haven  for many Irish Catholics fleeing religious persecution as early as the  17th century. Maryland again became a leading destination for the Irish  during the Great Hunger in the early 19th century. The Irish helped  build and defend our country. They became farmers, soldiers,  firefighters, police officers, factory workers, labor organizers, and  politicians. Many Irish immigrants settled in southwest Baltimore and  contributed great numbers to the workforce that built America's first  railroad, the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad.   Irish Marylanders have made notable contributions to both our Nation  and our State in politics, science, and education. Marylander Charles  Carroll of Carrollton, a third-generation Irish American, signed the  Declaration of Independence, was a Founding Father, and served as the  first U.S. Senator for Maryland. Medical trailblazer John Crawford  emigrated from Ireland to Maryland and became famous for his  contributions to eradicating smallpox, helping to identify transmission  pathways, and improving vaccine distribution. Maryland has been home to  numerous Irish Catholic bishops including John Carroll, James Gibbons,  and Michael Curley. Bishop Carroll founded two universities, including  St. Mary's College and Seminary. Bishop Gibbons advocated for the  protection of exploited laborers during industrial expansion. Bishop  Curley expanded education opportunities throughout Maryland.  Descendants of Irish immigrants have also left their mark on America  and on Maryland. Famous Marylanders with Irish ancestry include Edgar  Allen Poe and Michael Phelps.   When the Irish came to America, they brought a tremendous sense of  pride and grit. The resiliency of Irish Americans has helped pull our  Nation through difficult times. Irish Americans, despite facing trials  and persecution, have persevered and have left a lasting, beneficial  impact on our Nation; Yet they also maintain a strong and unique sense  of identity and love for the Emerald Isle, enriching the diversity of  our lives and communities. So, this month, in addition to donning your  green and enjoying a pint of Guinness, I call on all Americans to  remember and appreciate the many contributions of the Irish here in  America.                            ____________________
