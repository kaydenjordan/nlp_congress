 Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of  support from Jewish Women International.                                     Jewish Women International,                                  Washington, DC, October 8th, 2021.      Rep. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Rep. Bobby Scott,      Chairman, House Committee on Education & Labor, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Rep. Steny Hoyer,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Rep. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Chairman Scott,       and Republican Leader McCarthy: Jewish Women International       JWI) writes to urge the House to vote yes on the final       passage of the Family Violence Prevention and Services       Improvements Act (FVPSA), H.R. 2119 which provides essential       support for domestic violence shelters and programs.        The core funding provided by FVPSA supports more than 1,500       local public, private, nonprofit, and faithbased       organizations and programs and over 240 Tribes and Tribal       organizations in their response to the urgent needs of over       1.3 million domestic violence victims and their children.       This act also creates a new underserved populations grant       program which will enable these groups to receive services       from culturally specific programs that they are more likely       to seek assistance from and that can better meet their needs.        JWI understands that FVSPA (H.R. 2119) clarifies that       discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity       is prohibited under the law. This is in line with existing       law. JWI strongly and urgently is in support of the non-      discrimination clarification included in H.R. 2119.        JWl's work focuses on the nexus of faith and domestic       violence. As the convener of the National Collaborative of       Jewish Domestic Violence Programs, the Clergy Taskforce on       Domestic Abuse in the Jewish Community, and the Interfaith       Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence, JWI is well       aware of the critical supports provided by faith communities       to survivors and their children. Our 2021 National Needs       Assessment on Domestic Abuse in the Jewish Community confirms       that survivors seek domestic violence services that are       inclusive of their religious traditions and that maintain       their connection to their existing religious community.        JWI understands that FVSPA (H.R. 2119) clarifies that       discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity       is prohibited under the law. This is in line with existing       law. JWI strongly and urgently is in support of the non-      discrimination clarification included in H.R. 2119. Our       deeply held religious values mandate treating all people with       dignity and respect and providing all survivors with the       services they require.        We urge the House to pass the full FVPSA to avoid failing       the more than a million survivors and children who rely on       these programs and ensure their needs are met.            Sincerely,                                              Meredith Jacobs, CEO,                                        Jewish Women International.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support  for the reauthorization of the Family Violence Prevention and Services  Improvement Act. This act was the first Federal law to provide  resources for survivors of domestic violence and remains the primary  source of funding for shelters.   This critical legislation hasn't been reauthorized since 2010,  leaving vital programs like crisis counseling and safety planning  underfunded and outdated. In North Carolina, a staggering 35 percent of  women and 30 percent of men experience intimate partner violence or  stalking. COVID-19 has only further increased intimate partner violence  rates and has put a strain on services survivors urgently need.   No individual should have to endure the trauma of domestic violence.  We must ensure victims have access to the support and resources  necessary for their safety and well-being. We cannot turn our backs on  our neighbors in need. During this Domestic Violence Awareness Month, I  urge my colleagues to join me in reauthorizing this important act.
