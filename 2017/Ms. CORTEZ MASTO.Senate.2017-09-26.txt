 Mr. President, I thank Senator Udall, the ranking  member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. I am honored to be  working with him on that committee in a bipartisan way, as he talked  about.   I am also very honored to represent the great State of Nevada, a  State that is home to civically active Tribes. Nevada's Tribal  communities deal with many of the same challenges that plague Native  communities throughout the United States. Indigenous people suffer from  higher rates of poverty, illness, and substance abuse than the general  population.   I recently received this communication from the Walker River Paiute  chairman, Amber Torres, about the importance of the Medicaid expansion  for her community. Chairman Torres wrote:         I feel that the impacts on cutting Medicaid expansion for       Nevada would be detrimental to the people. With this coverage       we have been able to obtain services for our male and       childless adult population. Our people have been able to       obtain services that have not been approved or do not qualify       through Indian Health Services.    She then goes on to say:         A large portion of our reservation is covered by the       expansion and have seen their health ailments being addressed       in a timely manner due to alternative means of coverage.    She said:         We have seen our covered recipients percentage go from 20       percent to 45 percent, with our numbers continuing to rise       daily. If Medicaid expansion is repealed, what is the       alternative for these people . . . ?        Historically Indian Health Services has only been at a       Medical Level Priority 1 for our service delivery area, which       means bleeding, blind, broken or dying. Is this what we need       to look forward to going back to?    Chairman Torres's question is one a lot of Native Americans are  asking right now and a question I wish to pose to Ranking Member Udall.   The Federal Government has a sacred trust and responsibility to the  Native communities of Nevada and throughout the country. I ask the vice  chairman, would rolling back Medicaid expansion in Nevada and other  States like mine result in pre-ACA Indian Health Service coverage and  care, as Chairman Torres discussed?    I thank the vice chair.   It is true that Indian Country made significant gains under the  Affordable Care Act. Before the ACA, the Indian Health Service  regularly denied Tribal members' claims for basic care and preventive  services, such as mammograms, women's health screenings, or diabetes  management care.   Because of the chaos the Trump administration has created in the  healthcare markets, this problem is not being confronted, it is being  exacerbated across the country. We have seen it in Nevada. Insurers are  pulling out of the ACA exchanges in rural areas, thanks to the  uncertainty these continued efforts to repeal the ACA, such as Graham- Cassidy, are creating in the healthcare market.   Democrats are ready to work with Republicans to fix the problems with  the Affordable Care Act. We want to provide certainty that brings  insurers back into the health insurance marketplaces, lower premiums  and prescription drug prices, and improve healthcare. We can't kick  millions of people--including the members of the Walker River Paiute  Tribe and the 27 other Tribes and community organizations in the State  of Nevada--off of their healthcare.   No one in this country should be forced to choose between paying  their medical bills and putting food on their table. All too often, our  Tribal members are confronted with that very choice.   I will not stop fighting to oppose these efforts to take away the  healthcare of Native communities in Nevada and millions more Americans  throughout our country. It is time we work together.   I thank the vice chair.   I yield the floor back.
