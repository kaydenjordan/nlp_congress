 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.   I applaud my colleague Congresswoman Ann Wagner for reintroducing  this bill, and I am proud to be a cosponsor.   This bill penalizes the intentional killing of a child who is born  alive. To be clear, I cannot believe I even have to state those words.  [[Page H1468]]    Mr. Speaker, we have seen horrific actions in New York and Virginia  to allow late-term abortion. This is essentially the execution of a  defenseless child after birth. It is unconscionable.   The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would require a  child who is born after an attempted abortion to receive treatment and  be transferred to a hospital.   Mr. Speaker, this is a sad day in America when we have to discuss  such a reprehensible act.   Any doctor who would leave a child to die should face the full extent  of the law. This bill would ensure that.   We must protect the most vulnerable, and I urge the House to take  action on this bill.                            ____________________
