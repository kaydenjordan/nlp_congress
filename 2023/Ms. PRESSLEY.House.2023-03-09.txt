 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and my dear friend  from Pennsylvania for making this Special Order hour a priority. I know  your constituents and the people of this country appreciate it.   I rise today on behalf of the people across our Nation seeking access  to abortion care. While there are many forces and people at work who  seek to spread lies and misinformation, let me set the record straight.  Abortion care is routine medical care. Abortion care is safe. Abortion  care is a fundamental human right. Abortion care is healthcare.   One in four women in this country seek abortion, women that you know,  love, work, and worship with. Right now, a pending court case in Texas  aims to restrict access to medication abortion across the entire  Nation.   Over 40 percent of abortion care in this Nation is medication  abortion, a simple and safe protocol where patients are prescribed two  medications to end a pregnancy.   A single man--a far right Trump-appointed judge in Texas--stands to  make a decision that could strike down the FDA's approval of one of  these drugs and restrict access to care to millions; a frightening  precedent.   Imagine for a moment if a judge was poised to strike down access to  another safe and effective drug routinely used as part of medical care  like Tylenol or Advil. We would call it out for exactly what it is:  inappropriate overreach, overreach that will cause harm.   Mifepristone was first approved by the FDA more than 20 years ago and  has since been used by more than 5 million people to safely end their  pregnancies both in their homes and at health centers.   Earlier this year, following dedicated advocacy by myself, my  colleagues, and advocates across our Nation, the Biden administration  permanently lifted in-person dispensing requirements for mifepristone,  allowing retail pharmacies to stock the medication and further expand  access to medication abortion.   This medication is safe and necessary. Not only should abortion care  be available, but what type of abortion care a patient receives should  be decided between a patient and their doctor, not some partisan court.   At a time when abortion access is already out of reach for millions  after the fall of Roe, taking mifepristone off the market would further  compromise abortion access across the country, including in States  where the right to an abortion is protected, like my home State of  Massachusetts.   This case is another emboldened rightwing judge trying to take away  our bodily autonomy. Again, mifepristone is safe, it is effective.   For people across our Nation who are seeking care, you can go to  [[Page H1237]]  AbortionFinder.org to navigate how to get the medical care which you  seek.   This is a deeply volatile and hostile time to be a person in America  in need of reproductive healthcare.   I will never stop pressing for our full humanity and bodily autonomy.  My body, my choice. Your body, your choice.                                time  1730    Mr. Speaker, I thank, once again, my dear colleague, Summer Lee of  Pennsylvania. We are so glad you are here in Congress. Again, I am  grateful for this Special Order hour.   Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of over 40 million people from all  walks of life burdened by our unjust student debt crisis--the  grandparents, the Black and Brown folks, women, students, members of  the LGBTQ community, workers, parents, teachers, young people, and  more, everyone who organized, mobilized, and shared their stories to  make the case for national student debt cancellation.   After years of advocacy, President Biden heeded our calls. With the  stroke of a pen and clear legal authority, he canceled student debt and  opened a path for millions to get ahead, make ends meet, build  generational wealth, grow their families, purchase homes, and narrow  our shameful and growing racial wealth gap.   But callous and spiteful Republican officials and their allies on the  courts are, once again, poised to stand in the way of progress. They  see the transformative power of canceling student debt. They see how  sorely needed it is. They see how powerful it is. So, they are choosing  obstruction, even for their own constituents.   While this far-right Supreme Court deliberates and continues to leave  our borrowers in limbo, let me make it plain: Student debt cancellation  will change and save lives. While there are those who seek to play with  your life, Democrats are here fighting to change and save lives with  policies that go as far and as deep as the hurt is.   The President's authority to cancel student debt is clear. The  administration's legal case is sound. The only question is, will the  Supreme Court uphold the law? It must.   Mr. Speaker, 40 million people stand to benefit from this  transformative plan, including over 100,000 people in my district, the  Massachusetts Seventh. We can't stop and we won't stop fighting to  deliver this critical relief the President promised.
