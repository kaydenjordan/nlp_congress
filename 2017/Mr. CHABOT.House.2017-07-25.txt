 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Gibbs for organizing  this Special Order here this evening in which we are honoring Ralph  Regula, our former colleague.   I had the pleasure of serving with Congressman Regula for 14 years  here in this great institution.   Ralph Regula was truly a gentleman in the truest sense of the word.  He served Ohio and our Nation with a dignity and grace that few will  ever match. When I think of the phrase ``disagreeing without being  disagreeable,'' I think of Ralph Regula.                                time  1945    Ralph was a lot of things. He was an attorney, a teacher, a school  principal, a veteran, a farmer, and a loving husband, father, and  grandfather. But perhaps most of all, he was dedicated to serving the  people of the 16th Congressional District and his country.   He was born in Beach City, Ohio, in 1924--the same year my mom was  born, by the way. Ralph first served his country, as my father did, in  World War II. My dad was in the Army and served in Europe. Ralph was in  the Navy from 1942 to 1946 during World War II.   Ralph then graduated from Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio,  where he met his wife, Mary, and later obtained his law degree from  William McKinley School of Law in Canton.   Ralph had a passion for education. Before getting into politics, he  served his community as a schoolteacher, as I also did. He was then a  principal and even ran for the Ohio Board of Education.   As a former teacher myself, as I mentioned, I know the time you spend  with students helps shape the way you view the world. Ralph was no  different. He brought those experiences with him here to Washington,  D.C., and put his  [[Page H6295]]  passion to work on the Appropriations Committee.   Prior to being elected to Congress, Ralph got his start in politics  as a member of the Ohio House of Representatives and, later, the Ohio  Senate. In 1972, he ran for Congress and won, beginning a long and  impressive congressional tenure.   Ralph served 18 terms, 36 years, and he was a leader on the  Appropriations Committee. In that role, he helped to shape the country,  but he never forgot where he came from: Stark County, Ohio.   Back in 1998, Ralph and his wife, Mary, were instrumental in the  establishment of the National First Ladies' Library in Canton, and they  both remained very involved in the library's operations over the years.   Many Ohioans and Cantonians remember him for his staunch support of  Stark County's park system, the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, and the  Towpath Trail.   While many around the Nation will remember Ralph Regula as an  important figure on the Appropriations Committee, a role he served in  for many, many years, I will remember him as a respected colleague and  someone I was proud to call a friend.   Ralph was a soft-spoken, old-school gentleman. By the time I was  elected to Congress back in 1994, Ralph Regula was the dean of the Ohio  delegation. A few years after Congressman Regula retired, I became the  dean of the Ohio Republican delegation, and I tried to model my  approach to the role that he set. He set a great example for all of us  who serve here in the House because he truly was a gentleman.   Tonight, as we remember our former dean, I hope that we also remember  his ability to work across the aisle. Ralph always treated everyone  with respect and genuinely listened to the viewpoints of others. He  believed that bipartisanship was a virtue and would work tirelessly to  find common ground. I think we can all learn from his example.   I would note that Marcy Kaptur, who is one of our more respected  Democratic colleagues in the House, is here this evening. I think it is  a tribute to the bipartisanship that Ralph Regula showed over the  years. I know that she worked not only with him, but with many of us in  a bipartisan manner. That is just the way that Ralph Regula operated.   Mr. Speaker, Ralph Regula was a decent, hardworking family man who  was dedicated to Ohio, and particularly the 16th Congressional District  and the people of Stark County. He was a public servant and a role  model. He will be deeply missed.   To Ralph's wife, Mary; his daughter, Martha; his sons, David and  Richard; and the entire Regula family, please know that we are saddened  by your loss. We share that loss. We appreciate the time that you  allowed Ralph to serve our Nation. You are in our thoughts and our  prayers. God bless you all.
