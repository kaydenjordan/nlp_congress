 Mr. Speaker, this week, communities across the  country honored law enforcement officers in recognition of National  Police Week.   Police officers put their lives on the line every day to protect our  loved ones and neighbors. These brave men and women experience daily  trauma and injury. In fact, the stress endured by our police officers  contributes to a suicide rate that is 50 percent higher than the  national average.   That is why I introduced the STOIC Act with my Democratic colleague  from Pennsylvania, Madeleine Dean. This is a bipartisan bill to better  address the mental health needs of our law enforcement officers.   I think that Republicans and Democrats should all be able to get  together to fight against suicide and for the worthy cause of suicide  prevention. Just yesterday, the Senate passed their version of STOIC  with unanimous consent.   I want us to work together to unite our country, and I hope we can  vote on this legislation that has strong bipartisan support. I hope  that my colleagues from across the aisle will work with us to address  the mental health needs of our Nation's law enforcement.                            ____________________
