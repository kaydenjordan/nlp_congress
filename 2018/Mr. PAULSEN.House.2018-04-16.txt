 Mr. Speaker, I want to draw attention to April as  National Sexual Assault Awareness Month.  [[Page H3330]]    We know this is a problem across the country. In Minnesota alone,  more than 60,000 Minnesotans are victimized by sexual violence each  year, and of this number, 80 percent were women and nearly a third were  under the age of 18.   It is a time to educate the public about sexual violence and help  communities more effectively prevent it.   It is also important, though, to recognize the victims' rights  groups, social workers, healthcare providers, and law enforcement  personnel, who are working one-on-one with the victims of sexual  violence, helping them seek justice and repair their lives. Important  organizations like Breaking Free are helping women escape trafficking,  prostitution, and sexual exploitation. And Cornerstone, which is  running domestic violence crisis hotlines, is helping victims get the  assistance that they need to get back on their feet.   Mr. Speaker, these are some of the organizations we have in Minnesota  that are providing invaluable services to the victims at a time when  they need it most.                            ____________________
