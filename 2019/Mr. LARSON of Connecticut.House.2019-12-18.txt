 Madam Speaker, this year, our nation finds  itself in the midst of historic turmoil. President Donald J. Trump's  defiance of the Constitution and disregard for the rule of law have  given Congress no other choice but to proceed with impeachment. The  President has brought this on himself through his actions. As  instructed by H. Res. 660, on November 19, 2019, the House Permanent  Select Intelligence Committee began conducting open public hearings to  ensure the American people were able to hear directly from witnesses as  the committee collects and examines evidence in a fair and professional  manner. This was followed by public hearings in the House Committee on  the Judiciary, which allowed for an examination of the constitutional  grounds for impeachment and an airing of evidence against the  President.   After weeks of depositions, public hearings and a thorough review of  evidence, the House Judiciary Committee concluded that President Trump  violated his oath of office and, on December 11th, 2019, approved H.  Res. 755, which set forth two articles of impeachment: Abuse of Power  and Obstruction of Congress. As the House today deliberates and decides  on these articles, it is important to lay the full scope of the  President's misconduct before the American people.   My constituent and authentic American leader, Ralph Nader, a consumer  advocate, renowned attorney, author, and a respected voice in American  politics and good governance, has partnered with constitutional  scholars, Bruce Fein and Louis Fisher, to assess the President's  misconduct and whether it meets the Constitutional standard for ``. . .  Bribery, or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors.''   I include in the Record his thinking and those of others in our  nation, in the hopes that it will help the public further understand  the significance of this vote.                           ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT               (By Ralph Nader, Bruce Fein, and Louis Fisher)                           Article of Impeachment         Resolved. That Donald J. Trump, President of the United       States, is impeached for bribery and high crimes and       misdemeanors in violation of his constitutional oath of       office and that the following article of impeachment be       exhibited to the Senate:        Article of Impeachment Exhibited by the House of       Representatives of the United States of America and of All       the People of the United States of America, Against Donald J.       Trump, President of the United States of America, in       Maintenance and Support of its Impeachment Against Him for       Bribery and High Crimes and Misdemeanors in Violation of his       Constitutional Oath of Office To Preserve, Protect and Defend       the Constitution of the United States.                                  Article 1         In his conduct of the office of President of the United       States, Donald J. Trump, in violation of his constitutional       duty faithfully to execute the office of the President of the       United States, and, to the best of his ability, preserve,       protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,       Article 1, section 1, clause 6, and, contrary to his public       trust, has systematically scorned the letter and spirit of       the Constitution on a scale vastly beyond any previous       occupant of the White House in doing the following:         1. CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS. President Trump has notoriously       boasted, ``Then I have Article II, where I have the right to       do whatever I want as President.'' He has chronically acted       in violation the Constitution accordingly.        The informing or oversight powers of Congress are even more       important than its legislative prerogatives. The United       States Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed the plenary       authority of Congress to investigate the executive branch for       abuses, irregularities, illegalities or the need for new       laws. Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis famously       lectured, sunshine is said to be the best of disinfectants;       electric light the most efficient policeman. The House       Judiciary Committee voted an article of impeachment against       President Richard M. Nixon for defying a congressional       subpoena that compromised the ability of Congress to       investigate impeachable offenses.        President Trump has repeatedly and unconstitutionally       systematically undermined the congressional oversight power,       including the ongoing congressional impeachment inquiry of       the President himself, by instructing numerous current and       former White House staff and members of the executive branch       to defy congressional subpoenas on an unprecedented scale far       beyond any previous President. Without congressional       authority, he has secretly deployed special forces abroad and       employed secret guidelines for targeted killings, including       American citizens, based on secret unsubstantiated       information. He has unconstitutionally endeavored to block       private persons or entities from responding to congressional       requests or subpoenas for information, e.g., Deutsche Bank.       He has refused to provide Congress information about       nepotistic or other security clearances he granted in       opposition to his own FBI security experts. He has refused to       disclose his tax returns to the Chairman of the Ways and       Means Committee contrary to a 1924 law, 26 U.S.C. 6103(f).        The informing or oversight powers of Congress are even more       bedrock than legislation. Without information, Congress       cannot enact informed legislative bills, repeal inadequate       laws, or prevent maladministration of good ones. The Supreme       Court of the United States has repeatedly affirmed the       authority of Congress to investigate the executive branch for       abuses, irregularities, illegalities or the need for new       laws. Transparency, not secrecy, is the coin of the realm.        Congress possesses plenary authority independent of the       federal judiciary to determine whether presidential defiance       or obstruction of a congressional subpoena warrants       impeachment for destroying the rule of law in favor of raw       presidential power. A court order is unnecessary. Under the       Constitution, the Supreme Court held impeachment questions       are assigned to the House and Senate to the exclusion of       federal courts in Nixon v. United States, 506 U.S. 224       (1993).         2. ABUSE OF THE POWERS OF THE PRESIDENT AND ABUSE OF       PUBLIC TRUST. President Abraham Lincoln famously declared       that, ``A house divided against itself cannot stand.'' The       nation's motto is E Pluribus Unum. President Trump, however,       has fostered combustible division and rancor among ``We the       people of the United States'' by inciting violence and       threatening civil war if removed from office. Unlike prior       presidents, he has made presidential lies as routine as the       rising and setting of the sun, confounding civil discourse,       truth and public trust. He has disrespected, belittled, and       serially preyed upon women, mocked the disabled, incited       violence against the mainstream media and critics, and       encouraged and displayed bigotry towards minorities and       minority Members of Congress, including intercession with       Israel in serious violation of the Speech or Debate Clause,       Article I, section 6, clause 1, to deny two Members visitor       visas.        Mr. Trump has failed to superintend or check the chronic       lawlessness of his subordinates, a dereliction of duty which       James Madison characterized as an impeachable offense. In the       very first Congress, Mr. Madison elaborated:        ``I think it absolutely necessary that the President should       have the power of removing his subordinates from office; it       will make him, in a peculiar manner, responsible for their       conduct, and subject him to impeachment himself, if he       suffers them to perpetrate with impunity high crimes or       misdemeanors against the United States, or neglects to       superintend their conduct, so as to check their excesses.''        George Washington when presiding over the constitutional       convention instructed, ``Let us raise a standard to which the       wise and honest can repair.'' Mr. Trump has so disrespected       that standard.        No other President has so consistently voiced extremist and       inflammatory views across the board and so grossly neglected       the duties of the Oval Office.         3. APPROPRIATIONS CLAUSE, REVENUE CLAUSE. Article I,       section 9, clause 7 prohibits federal government expenditures       ``but in consequence of appropriations made by law.''       Congress has consistently voted much less money than       President Trump requested to build an extensive,       multibillion-dollar wall with Mexico. In violation of the       Clause and the criminal prohibition of the Anti-Deficiency       Act, President Trump has committed to spending billions of       dollars far in excess of what Congress has appropriated for       the wall. The congressional power of the purse is a       cornerstone of the Constitution's separation of powers. James       Madison in Federalist 58 explained, ``This power over the       purse may . . . be regarded as the most complete and       effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the       immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining       redress of every grievance, and to carrying into effect every       just and salutary measure.''        Article I, section 7, clause 1 requires all revenue       measures to originate in the House of Representatives. In       violation of the Clause, President Trump has raised tens of       billions of dollars by unilaterally imposing tariffs with       limitless discretion under section 232 of the Trade Expansion       Act of 1962. He has become a Foreign Trade Czar in imposing       tariffs or quotas or granting exemptions from his trade       restrictions in his unbridled discretion to assist political       friends and punish political enemies. Literally trillions of       dollars in international trade have been affected. Riches are       made and livelihoods destroyed overnight with the capricious       stroke of President Trump's pen.         4. EMOLUMENTS CLAUSE. Article I, section 9, clause 8       prohibits the President (and other federal officers), without       the consent of Congress, from accepting any ``present,       emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatsoever, from any       King, Prince, or foreign state.'' The President should be       above suspicion. The clause aims to prohibit dual loyalties       or its appearance because of financial conflicts of       interests. President Trump has notoriously refused to place       his assets in a blind trust. Instead, he continues to profit       from opulent hotels heavily patronized by foreign       governments. He has permitted his family to commercialize the       White House.  [[Page H12198]]       He has compromised the national interest to enrich family       wealth on a scale unprecedented in the history of the       presidency.         5. TREATY CLAUSE. Article II, section 2, clause 2 requires       Senate ratification of treaties by two-thirds majorities. The       text is silent as to whether treaty termination requires       Senate ratification, and the Supreme Court held the issue was       a nonjusticiable political question in Goldwater v. Carter,       444 U.S. 996 (1979). But the Treaty Clause purpose indicates       Senate approval of treaty terminations. Alexander Hamilton       explained in Federalist 75 that the President would be an       untrustworthy steward of the national interest in the conduct       of international affairs because of the enormous temptation       to betray the country to advance personal ambitions. That       suspicion of presidential motives is equally implicated in       treaty terminations and points to requiring Senate       ratification. President Trump flouted the Treaty Clause in       terminating the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty       (INF) with Russia unilaterally. The treaty assigned the       termination decision to the ``United States.'' The       President alone is not the United States under the Treaty       Clause.         6. DECLARE WAR CLAUSE. Article I, section 8, clause 11       empowers Congress alone to take the nation from a state of       peace to a state of war. That power is non-delegable. The       Declare War Clause authors distrusted the President to       preserve the peace because of the temptation to war to       aggrandize executive power and earn a place in history. In       violation of the Declare War Clause, President Trump has       continued to wage or has initiated presidential wars in       Libya, Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, and       Pakistan, and has used special forces offensively in several       African nations. President Trump has claimed authority to       initiate war against any nation or non-state actor in the       world--not in self-defense-on his say-so alone, including war       against North Korea, Iran, or Venezuela.         7. TAKE CARE CLAUSE; PRESENTMENT CLAUSE. Article II,       section 3 obligates the President to ``take care that the       laws be faithfully executed.'' In violation of that trust,       President Donald J. Trump deliberately attempted to frustrate       special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of       collaboration between the Trump 2016 campaign and Russia to       influence the presidential election. Among other things, the       President refused to answer specific questions relating to       his presidential conduct; endeavored to fire the special       counsel; dangled pardons for non-cooperating witnesses; and,       urged Attorney General Jeff Sessions to reverse his recusal       decision to better protect his presidency. In all these       respects, the President was attempting to obstruct justice.        President Trump has also systematically declined to enforce       statutory mandates of Congress by arbitrarily and       capriciously revoking scores of agency rules ranging from       immigration to the Consumer Financial Protection Board to the       Environmental Protection Agency in violation of the       Administrative Procedure Act or otherwise. He has routinely       legislated by executive order in lieu of following       constitutionally prescribed processes for legislation.        In violation of his constitutional duty to take care that       the laws be faithfully executed, Mr. Trump has dismantled and       disabled scores of preventive measures to save lives, avoid       injuries or disease, help families, consumers, and workers,       and detect, deter, and punish tens of billions of dollars of       corporate fraud. He has disputed climate disruption as a       ``Chinese hoax,'' compounded the climate crisis by overt       actions that expand greenhouse gas emissions and pollution,       and excluded or marginalized the influence of civil service       scientists.        Article I, section 7, clause 2, as President George       Washington explained, requires the President either to sign       or veto a bill passed by Congress in toto. The President may       not exercise a line-item veto, as the United States Supreme       Court held in Clinton v. New York, 524 U.S. 417 (1998).       President Trump, however, like several of his predecessors       commonly exercises the equivalent of unconstitutional line-      item vetoes through signing statements declaring his intent       to leave unexecuted provisions he decrees are       unconstitutional without a court test. Presidential signing       statements weaken legislative power by disarming Congress       from bundling in a single bill provisions both liked and       disliked by the President and forcing the White House to       choose between all or none. During the administration of       President George W. Bush, an American Bar Association Task       Force issued a report condemning signing statements as       unconstitutional sent to the President himself. ABA Task       Force on Presidential Signing Statements and the Separation       of Powers Doctrine, August 2006.         8. DUE PROCESS CLAUSE. The Fifth Amendment provides that       no person shall ``be deprived of life . . . without due       process of law.'' In violation of due process, President       Trump claims power, like his immediate two predecessors, to       act as prosecutor, judge, jury, and executioner to kill       American citizens or non-citizens alike, on or off a       battlefield, whether or not engaged in hostilities, whether       or not accused of crime, and whether or not posing an       imminent threat of harm that would trigger a right of       preemptive self-defense. This combination of powers are       euphemistically referenced as ``targeted killings,'' but they       define tyranny.         9. APPOINTMENTS CLAUSE. President Trump has repeatedly       appointed principal officers of the United States, including       the National Security Advisor and Cabinet officials, who have       not been confirmed by the Senate in violation of the       Appointments Clause, Article II, section 2, clause 2. On a       scale never practiced by prior presidents, Mr. Trump has       filled as many as half of Cabinet posts with ``Acting       Secretaries'' who have never been confirmed by the Senate.         10. SOLICITING A FOREIGN CONTRIBUTION FOR THE 2020       PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AND BRIBERY. President Trump has       endeavored to corrupt the 2020 presidential campaign by       soliciting the President of Ukraine to contribute something       of value to diminish the popularity of potential rival Joe       Biden, i.e., a Ukrainian investigation of Mr. Biden and his       son Hunter relating to potential corrupt practices of       Burisma, which compensated Hunter handsomely ($50,000 per       month). In so doing, Mr. Trump violated the criminal campaign       finance prohibition set forth in 52 U.S.C. 30121.        President Trump solicited a bribe for himself in violation       of 18 U.S.C. 201 in seeking something of personal value,       i.e., discrediting Joe Biden's 2020 presidential campaign       with the help of the President of Ukraine to influence Mr.       Trump's official decision to release approximately $400       million in military and related assistance.         11. VIOLATING CITIZEN PRIVACY. The Fourth Amendment       protects the right to be let alone from government snooping,       the most cherished right among civilized people as Justice       Brandeis elaborated in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.W.       438 (1928) (dissenting opinion). Government spying on       Americans ordinarily requires a warrant issued by a neutral       magistrate based on probable cause to believe crime is afoot.       President Trump, however, routinely violates the Fourth       Amendment with suspicionless surveillance of Americans for       non-criminal, foreign intelligence purposes under Executive       Order 12333 and aggressive interpretations of the Foreign       Intelligence Surveillance Act.         12. SUPPRESSION OF FREE SPEECH. The major purpose of a       free press protected by the First Amendment is to expose       government lies or illegalities--to shine light on the dark       side. Justice Hugo Black elaborated in New York Times v.       United States, 403 US. 713 (1971) in protecting publication       of the classified Pentagon Papers from suppression:        ``The Government's power to censor the press was abolished       so that the press would remain forever free to censure the       Government. The press was protected so that it could bare the       secrets of government and inform the people. Only a free and       unrestrained press can effectively expose deception in       government. And paramount among the responsibilities of a       free press is the duty to prevent any part of the government       from deceiving the people and sending them off to distant       lands to die of foreign fevers and foreign shot and shell.''        President Trump is violating the First Amendment in       stretching the Espionage Act to prosecute publication of       leaked classified information that are instrumental to       exposing government lies and deterring government wrongdoing       or misadventures, including the outstanding indictment       against Julian Assange for publishing information which was       republished by the New York Times and The Washington Post       with impunity. The United States Supreme Court upheld the       First Amendment rights of the New York Times and The       Washington Post to publish the classified Pentagon Papers,       which accelerated the conclusion of the disastrous Vietnam       War, in New York Times v. United States.        In all of this, Donald J. Trump, since the day of his       inauguration, has conducted the office of the President       contrary to his oath of office to destroy constitutional       government to the great prejudice of the cause of law and       justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the       United States.        Wherefore Donald J. Trump warrants impeachment and trial,       and removal from office.    Madam Speaker, as we vote today, I think  it is instructive that Americans reflect on how we got to this point.  The impeachment of Donald J. Trump has largely been brought on by the  President himself.   The President took two specific actions: he directly solicited a  foreign government to gather information on his political opponent. He  then further sought to promote a false narrative that it was Ukraine,  and not Russia, who interfered with the elections in 2016. With the  ability to correct the record, clear his name, or offer explanation for  his actions, he chose instead to obstruct a co-equal branch of  government from performing its Constitutional responsibilities of  oversight and review. He did this by refusing testimony, ignoring  Congressional subpoenas, and not providing Congress with any pertinent  information or data.   Today we're putting Russia and other adversaries on notice, don't  interfere with our elections. Russia tried to divide the country in  2016, but they only succeed if America turns away from the rule of law.   Some Republicans have excused the President's behavior by saying,  ``Donald Trump isn't a politician, he's a businessman. This is Trump  being Trump, this how he's used to doing business.''   That very well may be true, but in a constitutional democracy, no  one, including Donald Trump, is above the law.   I realize there are people who feel strongly and differently than I  do, but to do nothing, to  [[Page H12199]]  take no vote, is in essence condoning this behavior that disregards our  Constitution. Republicans may see today differently, but as we look  forward, we must stand united as a Congress in defending our democracy.   For a democracy to work in a system of check and balances, no one is  above the law. The President takes an oath of allegiance to the United  States Constitution; there are no exceptions for the art of the deal.
