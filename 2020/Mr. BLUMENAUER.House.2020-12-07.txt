 Mr. Speaker, it was sad that my Republican colleagues  were unable to understand why we voted to reform our failed prohibition  of cannabis. They don't care about honoring the will of the people and  they are unable to grasp the enormity of the racial injustice and  damage by selective enforcement against young Black and Brown  Americans.   But the CBO score may have some other reasons for them. It shows that  the MORE Act would reduce 73,000 person-years of prison time, saving $1  billion. It would increase revenues by $13.7 billion. It would provide  $3 billion for job training and legal aid to people harmed by the war  on drugs.   While doing all of this, it would reduce the Federal deficit by  $7.344 billion.   Even if you don't care about reducing the damage to Black and Brown  Americans or honoring the will of the people, the economics make it  clear: Once again, the people are right, and the policy deserves strong  congressional support.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I have been honored to know and work  around Greg Walden for 40 years. It is kind of scary to think about  that.   He came to public service honestly.   I was privileged to serve with his father in the Oregon State  Legislature when Greg started as a staff member in the State senate. He  was bright, capable, and committed to the people of the Second  Congressional District, a special place in Oregon, and Greg was  quick to always represent it forcefully, clearly, and effectively.    We have shared some highlights over the years. I remember floating in  the Dead Sea early in our congressional career. I was able to work with  him in a small way on something that he is very proud of, the Steens  Mountain Wilderness, almost 100,000 acres of cow-free wilderness. Now,  some of us would have done it a little differently, but knowing where  Greg came from in his district, that was a signal accomplishment. And  we were able to work together in the Clinton administration.   I was pleased to have one of the best field hearings I ever had in  public service as Greg and I, and his wife, Mylene, and his son,  Anthony, and our staff members did a 43-mile, 3-day hike around Mount  Hood, that magnificent mountain that we share in our districts.   We were able to meet with various interest groups and work together  to lay the foundation for significant wilderness legislation that was  signed into law by President Obama but that we worked together on a  bipartisan basis to make possible.   Recently, we were able to work on legislation that almost nobody paid  any attention to. It dealt with a significant change to enhance the  ability of physicians, particularly in emergency rooms, to know the  family history of people there who suffered from opioid addiction.   Again, not many people know about it, and it was several years and  harder than I thought, but it will make a difference to be able to make  sure that those emergency room personnel will be able to treat the  whole person. It solved a problem that maybe shouldn't have been, but  it is part of that nagging problem that we have, in terms of trying to  work through the legislative process. And Greg was a master at that.   I didn't always agree with Greg. Occasionally, we had some  differences. But we often were able to find common ground to represent  the people of our State in a way that they wanted us to.                                time  1730    It is an honor. I will say, even though we didn't always agree, I  always respected Greg in terms of his commitment, his intellect, and  his sense of humor.   It has been an honor, Greg, to serve with you 22 years--really?   You have escaped, and I can't wait to find out what the next chapters  in your career bring.   I wish the very best to you, Mylene, and Anthony, and a long and  prosperous next step.
