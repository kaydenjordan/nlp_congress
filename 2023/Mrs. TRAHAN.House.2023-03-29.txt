 Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart and a  level of anger shared by millions of Americans, millions of parents.   On Monday, three 9-year-old children and three adults were gunned  down at the Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee. The shooter, armed  with not one but two assault weapons, broke into the school and stole  the lives of innocent people simply going about their day.   For my colleagues across the aisle not keeping track, the massacre  was the 130th mass shooting of the year. It was the 13th school  shooting of 2023, and that is only if you count the time someone was  injured or killed when a gun went off on school grounds.   Thirteen times over the past 3 months, parents have dropped their  children at the bus stop or at school. They told them they loved them,  to have a great day, and that they would see them when they got home.  Then, they got the call that every parent fears, the one that wakes us  up in the middle of the night.   Thirteen times this year, parents in a city or town hung up that  phone or turned off their TV and raced to their children's school.   Thirteen times parents waited behind police tape, hoping to hear  something about their son or daughter.   Madam Speaker, how many more times are we going to let this happen?   How many more times can my colleagues across the aisle tweet their  thoughts and prayers but say that their hands are tied on gun safety  legislation?   How many more Christmas cards of Members of Congress holding AR-15s  do we need to see while students in their classrooms practice active  shooter drills?   School shooting after school shooting, Congress has had the  opportunity to act.   We have the legislation to ban assault weapons, like the rifles used  in Nashville on Monday.   We have legislation to require background checks on every gun  purchase so firearms aren't falling into the hands of people who  shouldn't have them.   We have legislation to prevent someone convicted of a hate crime from  being able to purchase a gun.   What this Chamber doesn't have enough of is willpower. It doesn't  have enough courage to act. This inaction is shameful, and as a parent,  it is disgusting.   Apparently, the Republican leadership in the House thinks that the  biggest issue facing our children today is the books in their library  because while we have yet to take up a bill to stop school shootings,  the number one killer of our children in America, this Chamber passed a  bill last week to politicize our kids' education--a bill, by the way,  that they didn't even have unanimous Republican support for.   I mean, what are we doing here?   I have to go home tomorrow and look my 8-year-old daughter in her  eyes, 1 week before she turns 9, and tell her that three more kids were  shot and killed in their classroom, but mama can't get half of her  colleagues in the Congress to care enough to do anything about it.   How can anyone in this Chamber be okay with telling their kids or  their grandkids that?   How can you see the kids who are taking pictures right outside on the  Capitol steps and do nothing to prevent their school from being next?   How can we call ourselves the greatest country in the world when its  elected leaders sit on their hands while children are murdered hiding  beneath their desks?   We can't, and to those of you deflecting or giving up, you should be  ashamed.   Madam Speaker, I implore you to go back to your party's leadership,  go back to Speaker McCarthy and tell him that we need to end the gun  violence epidemic that is plaguing our children. Do it before it is too  late for another school, for another family.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, Republicans' polluters over people act is a  disaster of a bill. Not only does this legislation prioritize massive  giveaways to Big Oil, gas corporations, and mining companies, but it  sells out hardworking families who want nothing more than to breathe  clean air and drink clean water.   If Republicans are successful in making this legislation law, those  corporate polluters will deplete our natural resources and destroy  millions of acres of wildlife, and they will do it for pennies on the  dollar. New pipelines will be constructed without the input of critical  Federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency.   These massive corporations could be exempt from lawsuits when they  spill toxic chemicals or contaminate our drinking water supplies.   This bill has the fingerprints of Big Oil lobbyists all over it.   Perhaps the most embarrassing part of this bill is how good of a  return on investment it is for fossil fuel companies.   Last year, a Big Oil CEO admitted during an Energy and Commerce  hearing to cashing in on stock he owned in his own company at a time  when people were feeling maximum pain at the pump. He told me he did it  at a 9 percent markup. That predatory behavior clearly hasn't swayed  the authors of H.R. 1.   I would imagine that is because the same Big Oil corporations that  stand to benefit most from this bill have donated millions to  Republican politicians over the years. They will make that money back  in a matter of minutes if this legislation becomes law.   Mr. Chair, Congress' job is to serve the hardworking folks that we  represent, not pad the profits of oil barons who run ExxonMobil or  Shell.   Mr. Chair, our constituents deserve better, and I urge my colleagues  to vote ``no.''
