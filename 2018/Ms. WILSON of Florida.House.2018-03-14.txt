 Mr. Speaker, I was not present for the  following votes because I chose to remain in my congressional district  in Miami because of health reasons. Had I been present, I would have  voted ``no'' on rollcall Vote No. 104; ``no'' on rollcall Vote No. 105;  ``yes'' on rollcall Vote No. 106; ``yes'' on rollcall Vote No. 107; and  ``no'' on rollcall Vote No. 108.                            ____________________
