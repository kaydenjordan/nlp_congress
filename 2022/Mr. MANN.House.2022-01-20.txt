 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my reasoning for voting  to protect unborn American citizens. I believe that life begins at  conception which is why I support adoptions, foster care, and crisis  pregnancy centers that work tirelessly to care for mothers and babies.   Kansans are leading the way in protecting the right to life by  placing the Value Them Both amendment on the ballot, this year's  response to the Kansas Supreme Court's unthinkable ruling that abortion  is a constitutional right. For my part, I have cosponsored pro-life  legislation including H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion  Act, permanently prohibiting Federal funding for abortions and abortion  services. I have introduced my own H.R. 714 which would require the  executive branch to notify Congress and the American public before  issuing any new executive order pertaining to pro-life provisions.   Mr. Speaker, abortion has desensitized our Nation. I pray we wake up  soon and repent for the horrors we have visited upon America's most  vulnerable, the unborn. Imagine what this country would look like  economically, culturally, socially, and spiritually if abortion hadn't  wiped out an entire generation of Americans, 63.4 million people over  the last 50 years.   Mr. Speaker, I say thank you to all of you who have joined together  in this fight. Thank you for using your voices to defend the voiceless.
