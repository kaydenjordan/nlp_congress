 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation  that will address one of the most pressing immigration problems facing  our nation.   For the past decade, thousands of families have fled violence and  poverty to seek asylum in the United States. These families include  vulnerable children who must be kept safe once they arrive in the  United States. However, since the beginning of the Trump  Administration, several new policies have been implemented.   Most disconcerting is the Trump policy to separate young children,  even babies, from their mothers and fathers. Dozens of these children  spent days and weeks in cages with nothing but thin mats and aluminum  blankets.   We have also learned that the Trump Administration then deported many  of these parents, leaving the children to be orphaned in this country.  In fact, hundreds of children who were separated under this policy have  now been apart from their parents for many months, without any  immediate prospects for reunification. These children continue to  experience extreme stress that leaves them vulnerable to serious,  lifelong mental and physical health problems.   Even when families are reunified after months apart, some children no  longer recognize the mothers and fathers. This is unconscionable. Today  I am introducing the Protecting Immigrant Families and Improving  Immigration Procedures Act, a bill that will not only end the practice  of separating families at the border, but also put in place other  safeguards to protect these at-risk groups.   The first component of the bill I am introducing today is the full  text of the Keep Families Together Act, a bill I introduced earlier  this year to halt the separation of families and which currently has  more than 40 cosponsors. The President claimed to end his policy of  separation in June 2018. However, we have since learned that the  practice of separating families continues today.   In fact, the Inspector General for Health and Human Services found  that thousands more children were separated than the administration  initially revealed in June. Parents who try to protect their children  from violence and poverty abroad should not be punished by having those  children ripped from their arms. Children should not be subjected to  severe trauma in the interest of deterring migration.   Instead, families should be kept together and given an opportunity to  present their cases for asylum as has been done for the past seven  decades.   The second part of the bill I'm introducing today ensures that  families with children are not forced into prolonged, indefinite family  detention in order to remain together. Child welfare experts, including  the American Academy of Pediatrics and the United Nations, have found  that detention of this sort has tremendous negative effects on  children's health and welfare. This bill guarantees that the Trump  Administration cannot reverse the crucial protections that are  currently in place under the Flores settlement agreement.   The third piece of this bill would help address the backlog in our  immigration courts while protecting the basic rights of children. This  part of the bill contains provisions to provide adequate resources to  our immigration court system. By adding additional judges and staff,  courts will be able to reduce the crushing backlog of over a million  pending deportation cases.   The fourth component of this legislation is Senator Hirono's bill,  the Fair Day in Court for Kids Act, that provides counsel for  unaccompanied children. This is meant to ensure that these children  receive a meaningful opportunity to present their cases in immigration  court. This is important because young children, including toddlers,  have been forced to represent themselves in immigration court in recent  years. It is simply impossible for children to understand their legal  immigration status or rights, let alone explain it to a judge.   This bill protects the most vulnerable children in by providing  counsel when there is no parent or legal guardian available. The final  part of the bill will ensure that immigration judges can manage their  caseloads and prioritize the cases as needed. Currently, individuals in  deportation proceedings who have been victims of human trafficking or  have assisted with criminal prosecutions are often eligible for visas  that would protect them from deportation. This bill would allow  immigration judges to close these deportation cases quickly to protect  these vulnerable individuals and conserve scarce courtroom time. This  will be a crucial step in clearing the backlog of pending immigration  cases.   By taking these steps, we will help put our immigration system on a  pathway to respect the basic rights of children, particularly those who  are fleeing violence and poverty abroad. These children are some of the  most vulnerable people in the world, and it is absolutely essential  that our legal system should treat them with fairness and respect.   These are goals that should be appealing to Democrats and Republicans  alike. I hope my colleagues will join me in passing the Protecting  Immigrant Families and Improving Immigration Procedures Act.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text  of the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1733         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Families and       Improving Immigration Procedures Act''.       SEC. 2. ENSURING THAT FAMILIES REMAIN TOGETHER.         (a) Limitation on the Separation of Families.--        (1) In general.--An agent or officer of a designated agency       shall not remove a child from his or her parent or legal       guardian at or near the port of entry or within 100 miles of       the border of the United States unless 1 of the following       situations has occurred:        (A) A State court, authorized under State law--        (i) terminates the rights of a parent or legal guardian;        (ii) determines that it is in the best interests of the       child to be removed from his or her parent or legal guardian,       in accordance with the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997       (Public Law 105-89); or        (iii) makes any similar determination that is legally       authorized under State law.        (B) An official from the State or county child welfare       agency with expertise in child trauma and development       determines that it is in the best interests of the child to       be removed from his or her parent or legal guardian because       the child--        (i) is in danger of abuse or neglect at the hands of the       parent or legal guardian; or        (ii) is a danger to himself or herself or to others.        (C) The Chief Patrol Agent or the Area Port Director, in       his or her official and undelegated capacity, authorizes       separation, upon the recommendation by an agent or officer,       based on a finding that--        (i) the child is a victim of trafficking or is at       significant risk of becoming a victim of trafficking;        (ii) there is a strong likelihood that the adult is not the       parent or legal guardian of the child; or        (iii) the child is in danger of abuse or neglect at the       hands of the parent or legal guardian, or is a danger to       himself or herself or to others.        (2) Prohibition on separation.--An agency may not remove a       child from a parent or legal guardian solely for the policy       goal of deterring individuals from migrating to the United       States or for the policy goal of promoting compliance with       civil immigration laws.        (3) Documentation required.--The Secretary shall ensure       that a separation based upon a situation described in       paragraph (1)(C)--        (A) is documented in writing; and        (B) includes the reason for such separation and the stated       evidence for such separation.

(2) Siblings.--To the maximum extent practicable, the       Secretary shall ensure that sibling groups remain intact.        (3) Detention.--There is a presumption that detention is       not in the best interests of families and children.

In developing the public       guidance, the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of       Health and Human Services, immigrant advocacy organizations,       child welfare organizations, and State child welfare       agencies.

(c) Notice.--Not later than 72 hours after an unaccompanied       alien child is taken into Federal custody, the child shall be       notified that he or she will be provided with legal counsel       in accordance with this section.        (d) Within Detention Facilities.--The Secretary shall       ensure that unaccompanied alien children have access to       counsel inside all detention, holding, and border facilities.        (e) Pro Bono Representation.--        (1) In general.--To the maximum extent practicable, the       Attorney General should make every effort to utilize the       services of competent counsel who agree to provide       representation to such children under this section without       charge.

A bill to amend the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 to  allow the District of Columbia to receive Federal funding under such  Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and  Transportation.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation  that will address one of the most pressing immigration problems facing  our nation.   For the past decade, thousands of families have fled violence and  poverty to seek asylum in the United States. These families include  vulnerable children who must be kept safe once they arrive in the  United States. However, since the beginning of the Trump  Administration, several new policies have been implemented.   Most disconcerting is the Trump policy to separate young children,  even babies, from their mothers and fathers. Dozens of these children  spent days and weeks in cages with nothing but thin mats and aluminum  blankets.   We have also learned that the Trump Administration then deported many  of these parents, leaving the children to be orphaned in this country.  In fact, hundreds of children who were separated under this policy have  now been apart from their parents for many months, without any  immediate prospects for reunification. These children continue to  experience extreme stress that leaves them vulnerable to serious,  lifelong mental and physical health problems.   Even when families are reunified after months apart, some children no  longer recognize the mothers and fathers. This is unconscionable. Today  I am introducing the Protecting Immigrant Families and Improving  Immigration Procedures Act, a bill that will not only end the practice  of separating families at the border, but also put in place other  safeguards to protect these at-risk groups.   The first component of the bill I am introducing today is the full  text of the Keep Families Together Act, a bill I introduced earlier  this year to halt the separation of families and which currently has  more than 40 cosponsors. The President claimed to end his policy of  separation in June 2018. However, we have since learned that the  practice of separating families continues today.   In fact, the Inspector General for Health and Human Services found  that thousands more children were separated than the administration  initially revealed in June. Parents who try to protect their children  from violence and poverty abroad should not be punished by having those  children ripped from their arms. Children should not be subjected to  severe trauma in the interest of deterring migration.   Instead, families should be kept together and given an opportunity to  present their cases for asylum as has been done for the past seven  decades.   The second part of the bill I'm introducing today ensures that  families with children are not forced into prolonged, indefinite family  detention in order to remain together. Child welfare experts, including  the American Academy of Pediatrics and the United Nations, have found  that detention of this sort has tremendous negative effects on  children's health and welfare. This bill guarantees that the Trump  Administration cannot reverse the crucial protections that are  currently in place under the Flores settlement agreement.   The third piece of this bill would help address the backlog in our  immigration courts while protecting the basic rights of children. This  part of the bill contains provisions to provide adequate resources to  our immigration court system. By adding additional judges and staff,  courts will be able to reduce the crushing backlog of over a million  pending deportation cases.   The fourth component of this legislation is Senator Hirono's bill,  the Fair Day in Court for Kids Act, that provides counsel for  unaccompanied children. This is meant to ensure that these children  receive a meaningful opportunity to present their cases in immigration  court. This is important because young children, including toddlers,  have been forced to represent themselves in immigration court in recent  years. It is simply impossible for children to understand their legal  immigration status or rights, let alone explain it to a judge.   This bill protects the most vulnerable children in by providing  counsel when there is no parent or legal guardian available. The final  part of the bill will ensure that immigration judges can manage their  caseloads and prioritize the cases as needed. Currently, individuals in  deportation proceedings who have been victims of human trafficking or  have assisted with criminal prosecutions are often eligible for visas  that would protect them from deportation. This bill would allow  immigration judges to close these deportation cases quickly to protect  these vulnerable individuals and conserve scarce courtroom time. This  will be a crucial step in clearing the backlog of pending immigration  cases.   By taking these steps, we will help put our immigration system on a  pathway to respect the basic rights of children, particularly those who  are fleeing violence and poverty abroad. These children are some of the  most vulnerable people in the world, and it is absolutely essential  that our legal system should treat them with fairness and respect.   These are goals that should be appealing to Democrats and Republicans  alike. I hope my colleagues will join me in passing the Protecting  Immigrant Families and Improving Immigration Procedures Act.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text  of the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1733         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Families and       Improving Immigration Procedures Act''.       SEC. 2. ENSURING THAT FAMILIES REMAIN TOGETHER.         (a) Limitation on the Separation of Families.--        (1) In general.--An agent or officer of a designated agency       shall not remove a child from his or her parent or legal       guardian at or near the port of entry or within 100 miles of       the border of the United States unless 1 of the following       situations has occurred:        (A) A State court, authorized under State law--        (i) terminates the rights of a parent or legal guardian;        (ii) determines that it is in the best interests of the       child to be removed from his or her parent or legal guardian,       in accordance with the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997       (Public Law 105-89); or        (iii) makes any similar determination that is legally       authorized under State law.        (B) An official from the State or county child welfare       agency with expertise in child trauma and development       determines that it is in the best interests of the child to       be removed from his or her parent or legal guardian because       the child--        (i) is in danger of abuse or neglect at the hands of the       parent or legal guardian; or        (ii) is a danger to himself or herself or to others.        (C) The Chief Patrol Agent or the Area Port Director, in       his or her official and undelegated capacity, authorizes       separation, upon the recommendation by an agent or officer,       based on a finding that--        (i) the child is a victim of trafficking or is at       significant risk of becoming a victim of trafficking;        (ii) there is a strong likelihood that the adult is not the       parent or legal guardian of the child; or        (iii) the child is in danger of abuse or neglect at the       hands of the parent or legal guardian, or is a danger to       himself or herself or to others.        (2) Prohibition on separation.--An agency may not remove a       child from a parent or legal guardian solely for the policy       goal of deterring individuals from migrating to the United       States or for the policy goal of promoting compliance with       civil immigration laws.        (3) Documentation required.--The Secretary shall ensure       that a separation based upon a situation described in       paragraph (1)(C)--        (A) is documented in writing; and        (B) includes the reason for such separation and the stated       evidence for such separation.

(2) Annual review.--Not less frequently than annually, the       Secretary of Health and Human Services shall--        (A) review the guidance developed under paragraph (1); and        (B) make recommendations to the Secretary to ensure that       such guidance conforms to current evidence and best practices       in child welfare, child development, and childhood trauma.

(2) Siblings.--To the maximum extent practicable, the       Secretary shall ensure that sibling groups remain intact.        (3) Detention.--There is a presumption that detention is       not in the best interests of families and children.        (d) Required Policy for Locating Separated Children.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the after       the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall       publish final public guidance that describes, with       specificity, the manner in which a parent or legal guardian       may locate a child who was separated from the parent or legal       guardian under subsection (a)(1). In developing the public       guidance, the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of       Health and Human Services, immigrant advocacy organizations,       child welfare organizations, and State child welfare       agencies.

(e) Required Information for Separated Families.--Not less       frequently than monthly, the Secretary shall provide the       parent or legal guardian of a child who was separated--        (1) a status report on the monthly activities of the child;        (2) information about the education and health of the       child, including any medical treatment provided to the child       or medical treatment recommended for the child;        (3) information about changes to the child's immigration       status; and        (4) other information about the child, designed to promote       and maintain family reunification, as the Secretary       determines in his or her discretion.        (f) Annual Report on Family Separation.--Not later than 1       year after the date of the enactment of this Act, and       annually thereafter, the Secretary shall submit a report to       the committees of jurisdiction that describes each instance       in which a child was separated from a parent or legal       guardian and includes, for each such instance--        (1) the relationship of the adult and the child;        (2) the age and gender of the adult and child;        (3) the length of separation;        (4) whether the adult was charged with a crime, and if the       adult was charged with a crime, the type of crime;        (5) whether the adult made a claim for asylum, expressed a       fear to return, or applied for other immigration relief;        (6) whether the adult was prosecuted if charged with a       crime and the associated outcome of such charges;        (7) the stated reason for, and evidence in support of, the       separation;        (8) if the child was part of a sibling group at the time of       separation, whether the sibling group has had physical       contact and visitation;        (9) whether the child was rendered an unaccompanied alien       child; and        (10) other information in the Secretary's discretion.        (g) Clarification of Parental Rights.--If a child is       separated from a parent or legal guardian, and a State court       has not made a determination that the parental rights have       been terminated, there is a presumption that--        (1) the parental rights remain intact; and        (2) the separation does not constitute an affirmative       determination of abuse or neglect under Federal or State law.        (h) Clarification of Existing Law.--        (1) Federal law.--Nothing in this section may be       interpreted to supersede or modify Federal child welfare law,       where applicable, including the Adoption and Safe Families       Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-89).
