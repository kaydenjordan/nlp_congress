 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Georgia.    I send a question to the desk for the President's counsel  on behalf of myself, Senator Ernst, and Senator Barrasso.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senators Perdue, Ernst, and Barrasso for counsel  for the President is as follows:         Please summarize the House of Representatives' three-stage       investigation and how the President was denied due process in       each stage. Combined with Manager Schiff's repeated leaks       during the House's investigation, do these due-process       violations make this impeachment the fruit of the poisonous       tree?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for that  question. The short answer, as I think I have indicated a couple of the  times I have been up here, is, yes, this entire proceeding here is now  the fruit of the poisonous tree. It is the fruit of a proceeding that  was fatally deficient in due process from the start to the beginning.  As a result of that, it produced a record that is totally unreliable,  can't be relied on here for any conclusion other than acquitting the  President.   Let me detail the three phases.   The first error was the House began the proceeding in a totally  unconstitutional, unlawful, and illegitimate manner that started with  an impeachment inquiry without any vote of the House to authorize that  inquiry. I want to spend a second on this because the House managers  have spent a lot of time today trying to go back and argue about why  their proceeding was all right, but they are not actually engaging the  real issues.   In order for the House to exercise the power of impeachment, there  has to be a delegation of that authority to a committee. That is just a  fundamental principle that the Constitution gives power to the House  itself, not to individual Members of the House, not to the Speaker.  Just as here in the Senate you wouldn't think that the majority leader  could say--if an impeachment arrived, the majority leader could say:  Guess what. We are not going to do a trial with the whole Senate. I,  the majority leader, will decide I will have one committee hear the  evidence, provide a summary, and then you all can vote.   The majority leader doesn't have the authority on his own to do that.  The Speaker doesn't have the authority in the House to give the power  of impeachment to any committee to start pursuing an inquiry, and this  is the key. There is no rule giving any committee in the House the  authority to use the power of impeachment. Rule X speaks of legislative  authority, not power of impeachment, and all the subpoenas that were  issued came with letters saying on them: Pursuant to the House's  impeachment inquiry. They purported to be using a power that hadn't  actually been delegated to the committee. That is the first flaw-- illegitimate, unlawful proceeding from the start.   Then there are the due process laws. Three stages of the hearings:  One, secret hearings in the basement bunker; the President is locked  out. No opportunity to cross-examine witnesses, to see the evidence, to  present evidence.   And then, they go from that to the public hearings, what was really  just a public show trial, because the President is still cut out,  totally unprecedented in any Presidential impeachment--that there would  be that second phase of public hearings where the President is still  cut out, can't present evidence. The minority Members don't have equal  subpoena authority.   In the third phase in front of the House Judiciary Committee, they  purport to have offered rights, but I have explained that. It was  illusory because they had already decided. Before the President was  even supposed to respond to what rights he would like to exercise, the  Speaker had announced the result that there were going to be Articles  of Impeachment. The Judiciary Committee decided they weren't going to  hear from any fact witnesses. They had no plans for hearings. It was  all a foregone conclusion because they had to get it done by Christmas.   And the third error: Chairman Schiff was in charge of all the fact- finding and he had an interest, because of the interactions of his  office with the whistleblower that we still don't know about, to shut  down questioning about  [[Page S706]]  the motives, the bias, the reasons that the whistleblower--how this all  came about.   All three of those errors affected this process from the very  beginning. They resulted in a one-sided, slanted fact-finding that was  rushed by a person controlling the fact-finding who had a motive to  limit what facts would be allowed to get into the proceedings and  produced a record that cannot possibly be relied on here. We said many  times that the Supreme Court has made clear that cross-examination is  the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth. And  they didn't permit the President the opportunity to cross-examine  anyone. And that is an indication that the goal was not a search for  the truth. It was a partisan charade intended to justify a preordained  result and to get it done by Christmas, and it is not a record that can  be relied on here.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Illinois.
