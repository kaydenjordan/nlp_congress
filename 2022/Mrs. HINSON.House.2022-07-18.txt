 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Newsradio 600  WMT on the upcoming 100th anniversary of the station being on the air.  [[Page H6686]]    WMT is a local news staple. The team provides informative coverage on  local and national news, as well as insightful and witty on-air shows.   Over the years, WMT has brought on diverse guests from around the  country, amplified the voices of Iowans, and shared countless stories  with their listeners.   So thank you to the entire team at WMT for all you do to keep Iowans  updated, entertained, and in the know.   Congratulations again, and I look forward to WMT's next 100 years on  the air.                            ____________________
