 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 5 of the House  Resolution 1028, I offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of these en bloc amendments which  provides consideration of 27 amendments sponsored by Members on both  sides of the aisle.   The amendments contained in this en bloc amend various divisions of  the bill, and affect highways, transit, rail, safety, water, natural  resources, and energy policy in the base bill. Some of these amendments  include:   A designation of a route through Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi,  Alabama, and Georgia as a future Interstate 14, and designation of a  route through Texas and New Mexico as future Interstate 27;   Directing a study on the effectiveness of suicide barriers on  physical structures other than bridges;   Clarifying that replacement of functionally obsolete warning devices  are eligible under the railway grade crossing program;   Clarifying that transportation demand data and modeling directed by  the bill must include an analysis of the level of accuracy of existing  modeling tools;   Granting Puerto Rico the authority to begin issuing commercial  drivers' licenses, as all States have the authority to do;   Allowing certain Surface Transportation Program funds to be used on  local roads, including farm-to-market roads, in rural areas. There is a  strong emphasis in this bill on rural areas;   Making grant funds available to States who ban any non-navigational  viewing of cellphones while driving;   Requiring the Secretary of Transportation, within 2 years of  enactment, to issue a motor vehicle safety standard for newly  manufactured commercial motor vehicles to be equipped with a universal  electronic vehicle identifier to identify the vehicle for the purposes  of roadside inspections and enforcement;   Requiring States that collect data on traffic stops as part of the  racial profiling grant program to include the data on the mode of  transportation associated with the stop.   These are just a few. I look forward to hearing further discussion on  these amendments from the various sponsors.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for  offering these amendments to improve the Moving Forward Act. I urge  adoption of the amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would point out that all of these amendments are  bipartisan and two of them are solely Republican. So, you know, the  gentleman may have general objections to the bill for other reasons, as  we discussed yesterday, the emphasis on climate change, and other  provisions of the bill for safe drinking water, a substantial increase  in wastewater, and all that, but this en bloc should be virtually non- controversial.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Suozzi).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Cuellar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Garcia), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider).                                time  1100     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Schrier).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ruiz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on my side, and  I am prepared to close if the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Graves) is  ready to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In response to that, I will revisit a little bit of yesterday's  debate.   President Trump ran on the issue of infrastructure. President Trump  met with us a year ago in March. We started out saying we needed $1  trillion to $1.3 trillion for infrastructure. He went to $1.9 trillion,  and then he ended up at $2 trillion.   We discussed and agreed on what would be in an infrastructure bill:  roads, bridges, highways, transit, wastewater, drinking water, rail,  and broadband. All of those are part of this package.   The total package is less than what the President requested a year  ago March. He said $2 trillion. This is close to $1.5 trillion. Those  components of the bill are about $1 trillion. So, that would be very  close to what he wanted.                                time  1115    The other components have become necessary because of COVID.   I was talking to the chairman of Education and Labor, and it has  become clear that 50 percent of the schools in America do not have HVAC  systems that can handle COVID--50 percent. A lot of these schools are  pretty darn decrepit. So we are investing a bunch of money to safely  educate our kids.   Mr. Speaker, my hometown, Springfield, Oregon, a great place, people  have a great public spirit. We have voted to bond ourselves several  times for new schools. We have a fabulous new middle school, absolutely  incredible. It has a very big trades department, because not all kids  are going on the high school track, and we need more trades. We are  going to need trades to implement our infrastructure bills. So we need  to help.   I remember I went to a post-World War II, brand-new elementary  school. That school is still sitting there, and a lot of these schools  are not suitable for children at this pandemic time.   It also includes money for housing. We have a housing crisis in most  of America. Certainly, on the coast; although, of course, this  administration cares nothing for the people who live on the coast. But  even in some of the middle of the country, there is a housing crisis.  This bill begins to deal with that.  [[Page H3010]]    It also begins to deal with our absolutely decrepit public housing.  That is Federal public housing, much of which is 50, 60 years old when  the Federal Government did things like this, and it needs  rehabilitation.   So, yes, we have added a couple of elements to this bill that weren't  discussed with the President, but they became necessary because of  COVID.   And also the Postal Service, which is more essential today than ever.  Trump hates it because Jeff Bezos has Amazon, and he thinks Amazon is  getting subsidized by the Postal Service. Actually, no, the Postal  Service makes a bunch of money by delivering Amazon packages, but it is  difficult to penetrate.   So he wants to destroy the Postal Service, which will actually  disproportionately affect the people who voted for him in red States,  and particularly rural areas. They are getting their prescriptions and  other things delivered by the USPS.   Now, rain, shine, night, day, COVID or not, the Postal Service is  doing it, doing it in 35-year-old delivery vehicles. They are decrepit  and incredibly expensive to maintain. This bill would help them buy a  new fleet and would help them to get through this crisis.   So, yes, there are some other things in this that were not in a  traditional infrastructure bill.   As far as the portion of the bill that comes from our committee, the  President had seven infrastructure weeks, and we were promised numerous  times that they were imminently going to propose a bill. The only bill  they ever proposed would have shifted the entire burden to the States  and said: Oh, and the private sector will take care of the rest of it.   There wasn't a Republican I am aware of who even supported that  stupid proposal. That is it.   But now we are told: Oh, they are on the cusp again, $2 trillion  coming soon.   Well, we are trying to help them deliver here.   We heard: Oh, Presidents don't propose these things. They don't do  these things.   We are here on the anniversary of JFK putting transit into  transportation. We are here the day after the anniversary of a  Republican President, Dwight David Eisenhower, signing the National  Interstate and Defense Highways Act and funding it with a trust fund,  which hasn't been supplemented since 1993 because the Republicans have  been in charge most of that time, and they won't raise the user fee.   Their alternative bill, by the way, doesn't raise the user fee. So  they are about $120 billion out of whack with a bill that only  increases highways by 10 percent, zeros out any increase in transit,  and does nothing for rail.   So, yes, this is a different product. But this amendment--and I  misspoke earlier. Eight of the amendments in this package are fully  Republican amendments; the others are bipartisan amendments.   So you can raise concerns about the overall process and the overall  bill, but this part is solid, and it should be approved by a large  majority in the House.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this en bloc, which provides for  the consideration of eight amendments. The amendments contained in this  en bloc amend various divisions of the bill. I will speak to a few that  fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure.   The gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost) would bar the use of eminent  domain only for pedestrian and bicycle projects. Oh, by the way, he  still supports eminent domain for pipeline projects, a very disruptive  one proposed in my district and here on the East Coast and maybe even  where he lives. He isn't dealing with that kind of eminent domain, not  dealing with highway eminent domain, not dealing with transit eminent  domain. He just doesn't like alternate modes.   Well, these would only take place under the Uniform Relocation  Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Act, which provides strong  protection to landowners to ensure that any involuntary land  acquisitions are fair, striking the right balance of protecting  landowner rights, and construct necessary infrastructure.   Generally, this has been used on rail-to-trail projects or bike  projects when there is one reluctant landowner who thinks that nasty  people are going to be riding their bikes by the fringe of their  property.   In my largest city, Eugene, it took several years to get one  landowner to finally allow a circular bike path to transit around the  river. One landowner held it up for 3 years because of the concerns  about the kind of people who would be riding bikes. Ultimately, a large  fence was erected there with the barriers and all that to keep those  people out. The path was done, but it shouldn't have taken 3 years.  That all could have been set earlier under the Uniform Relocation Act.   Mr. Speaker, we are reemphasizing transportation alternatives. They  were pretty much done away with during the FAST Act and MAP-21. That  means cycling, pedestrians, scooters, and other modes now, which have  proved very viable in the time of corona, when people are a little  reluctant to get into taxicabs or even Ubers or whatever, if they don't  have their own single-occupancy vehicle.   We can realize a lot more safe commuting. We also have had a  disturbing increase in pedestrian cycling deaths. This bill would help  with that.   There are also two amendments by the gentleman from West Virginia  (Mr. McKinley) that preempt State authority to protect waters within  that State.   Now, I understand. Yes, if you are from West Virginia, mountaintop  mining removal, dumping in the streams, all that. Great. We wouldn't  want to protect the waters. The water is doing just fine underneath all  of that toxic mining waste. And then, well, we did have a little  poisoning incident right near the State capital, as I remember, where  people couldn't use the water for quite a while. But, hey, States  should not be able to protect their drinking water or recreational  waters or any waters within that State.   Then a wonderful one from Mr. Stauber that would deem--deem, meaning  no process necessary--the permits for dredge-and-fill activities, no  oversight. That would, of course, overturn the precedents set by the  Clean Water Act since 1987. But he is providing backup support to  Trump, who is pretty much decimating the Clean Water Act with his dirty  water rule.   Then, Mr. LaMalfa says that he wants to make it harder to get a  railroad rehabilitation improvement fund grant. Well, he is upset about  California's high-speed rail. Unfortunately, he would make it virtually  impossible for the Texas high-speed rail, which, by the way, is a  private project and, I believe, supported by many Republicans in this  House from Texas. He would make it impossible for them to get a RRIF  loan if his amendment should pass. But, hey, he doesn't like the  California high-speed rail, so tough luck to the people from Texas and  elsewhere who want high-speed rail.   Mr. Speaker, right now, a lot of the RRIF money remains unused, so we  are trying to help expedite that in this bill. He would make it, again,  nearly impossible and harder.   Then, Mr. Crawford would take away the 50 percent set-aside for large  projects, over $100 million in the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and  Safety Improvement grant program.                                time  1200    And outside my jurisdiction, Mr. Hice would strike the $25 billion to  the United States Postal Service.   I mentioned this earlier. Trump hates the Postal Service because he  thinks that they are subsidizing Amazon. Actually, Amazon is  subsidizing the post office, but, hey, we don't deal with facts  downtown here very much anymore--or he doesn't.  [[Page H3025]]    And it would also strike the money that they could use to buy a new  fleet of vehicles. They should keep driving around in those crappy 35- year-old vehicles which require massive amounts of maintenance and are,  of course, polluting.   So I would also oppose that amendment, even though it is not within  my jurisdiction.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the chair of the Committee on  Oversight and Reform with jurisdiction over the post office.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Slotkin.)    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans).                                time  1215     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I would just take this time to thank a few folks for  this epic legislation, the transformative 21st century transportation  bill and, of course, for things from other committees that we have  explained during the debate: Helena Zyblikewycz, my chief counsel on  highways and transit, incredible yeoman's work; Auke Mahar-Piersma, who  took over rail; Garrett Gee; Jackie Schmitz; Brittany Lundberg, from my  hometown; Chris Bell; Andrea Wohleber; Katherine Ambrose; Alice Koethe;  Kathy Dedrick; Mohsin Syed, our committee counsel; Jill Harrelson;  Maddy Pike; Edward McGlone; Michael Hudspith; Jamie Harrell; and many  more on other subcommittees.   I am just going to return to Kathy Dedrick for a moment. I do this  sometimes; it always embarrasses her. We used to have a program here  called the page program. I thought it was a great thing. A lot of pages  went on, a number, to becomes Members of Congress or to come back and  work in government service.   Kathy was my first congressional page, obviously, a few years ago.  She is from Lebanon, Oregon. She came back later and worked for me when  we did the SAFETEA-LU bill, a few years ago, as my designated person  when I chaired the Highways Subcommittee--I mean, when I was ranking  member on the Highways Subcommittee. She worked for Al Gore. She worked  downtown. At a very auspicious and appropriate time, she came back to  be my chief of staff on the committee and has just done absolutely  incredible work.   Hopefully, I won't have to be disturbing her at all hours of the day  and night and on weekends too much in the near future, and the same to  many of my other staff who I have been bothering a lot as we worked  through this process and other legislation in these very difficult  times.   Madam Speaker, I thank everyone who helped, and I thank those from  other committees who contributed so much to the bill.   Madam Speaker, I thank the Republican side. Paul Sass, Jack Ruddy--I  am sure that Sam is going to do this, but I am going to do it anyway-- Corey Cooke, Michael Falencki, a dozen committees. I said all the other  committees.   Office of Legislative Counsel, they have been troopers in putting all  this together: Wade Ballou, Karen Anderson, Robert Casturo, and Kakuti  Lin.   The Congressional Research Service, Christopher Davis sat in on our  epic 24-hour markup and provided invaluable advice when we threatened  to fall into the parliamentary black hole a couple of times. He kept us  out of it.   And then the floor staff and, of course, the Office of the  Parliamentarian for their work as we determined jurisdictions and  appropriateness of amendments.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I am not quite certain what the gentlewoman is objecting to. Now, I  realize her State has a $7.25 an hour minimum wage. Great, work 40  hours a week, live in abject poverty. Okay.   So the wages for Davis-Bacon projects in her State aren't much  better. These aren't living wages. They aren't family wages. They  aren't wages where you can go home to your family, not have to hold a  second job, raise your kids, clothe them, send them to school, give  them a good education, maybe help them pay for postsecondary education.   No, she is complaining about carpenters under Davis-Bacon in her  State, they earn $25,000 a year under Davis-Bacon. Wow. Wow. 25,000  bucks a year. That is outrageous. If they worked for the State minimum  wage, we could get that down to less than $20,000 a year. That is  great. What kind of carpenter are you going to get for that wage? I  don't think you are going to find any living in your State anymore.   Ironworkers, well, they get a bit more, kind of up there on the  heights and all that. They get up to almost $28,000 a year. $28,000 a  year for an ironworker? Amazing.   Oh, and then truck drivers. The heavy truck drivers who work on  construction, they get $13.50 an hour. So she is alarmed at these  outrageous wages that are being paid to these people and how it is  impinging upon projects in her State. Why, they could get lots of  people to do that for $7.25 an hour. Of course, they wouldn't have any  skills, but what the heck.   So, you know, what we have found, first off, these aren't union  negotiated, these are done by locale because, yes, these wages would be  much higher in other areas. Apparently, in her State you can buy a  house for 15 or $20,000 down there or rent a nice apartment for 400,  300 bucks a month, so you can live on those kinds of wages. But other  places it is not so inexpensive.   And what we are trying to prevent is history. Low-bid contractors  that often come in from out of State provide shoddy workmanship, but,  yes, it was cheaper, it is cheaper. If you want a crappy job, hire  somebody who is the low-bid contractor, who has unskilled people  working for them.   We are setting a standard here. Studies show that the most in any  region around the country, because these are done in very discrete  regions--there are quite a number of regions in her State, I was using  the averages here; some of them are even lower, a few are higher. But  the average, under a dispassionate analysis by the EPI, would be it  could raise wages by as much as 10 percent. Wages are one-quarter of  the job cost. So 10 percent of one-quarter would mean you would add  2\1/2\ percent to the job so people could have a decent living wage,  decent benefits and raise a family, maybe even own a home, car. Wow.   Of course, they couldn't take transit to work if the Republicans were  successful in their version of this bill.   You know, we found higher productivity that comes from this. This is  a fight we have had many times on this floor, and I am afraid that  there will be a number of Republicans who oppose her amendment. I  certainly will be asking for a recorded vote.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I certainly did not mean to have her interpret I am disparaging her  State. It is a beautiful State. I visited there. You have some fabulous  breweries based there, one from Colorado and one from San Francisco  because you have clean water.   Of course, if one of these other amendments earlier is adopted, you  would not have clean water and the breweries might go away, but that is  okay, that is just a Republican philosophical talking point.   The gentlewoman said the average wage is $20 an hour, so I don't know  what she is concerned about. I have two pages of Davis-Bacon prevailing  wages in North Carolina, and I only see one of about 50 entries that is  $20.92 an hour, so it doesn't seem there is much purpose to her  amendment.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Jeffries), the Chair of the Democratic Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I would like to inquire as to the time  left on either side.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   I stand corrected. There are three categories out of 50 that get more  than $20 an hour. Blaster. Do you want a blaster that earns $7.25 an  hour? I don't think so. That might not be too good. A crane rough, all  terrain up there, they earn $21.25 an hour in North Carolina. And a  slipform machine, laying concrete. So there are three categories who  could have their wages reduced or all of these people could have their  wages reduced because many are at $14, $15, $16, $12 an hour even.   And under her amendment, those protections go away. We can have a  rush to the bottom. And she somehow is implying that minority  contractors want to pay people less or will pay people less or can't  afford to pay people. We have very strong disadvantaged business  enterprise provisions in this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa (Ms.  Finkenauer).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining  on either side.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds.   The gentlewoman says, save taxpayer dollars. What she wants to do is  reduce the pay of skilled workers in America. That is not saving. They  are taxpayers, by the way.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Rose).    The gentlewoman has the right to close, so I am going to  yield the balance of my time to my esteemed colleague from Michigan  (Mr. Kildee).    Madam Speaker, I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  motion to recommit.    Madam Speaker, if only we had a President who would take  meaningful action against China. It has recently been revealed that the  President--regular order, Madam Chair, I hear some kind of wiggling on  that side--whining, whining. Okay.   Yeah, we just recently found out that he begged Premier Xi Jinping to  buy more farm products to help his reelection.    And, by the way, he said he liked the prison camps, he thought they  were a good idea. He actually said that.   So, you know, if we had a President who would act against dictators.  Putin murdering U.S. troops, while he is still cozying up to Putin.   So, you know, anything with China is a result of the MFN for China,  which granted, came under President Bill Clinton. I voted against it. A  large majority of Republicans voted for it. Perhaps we have a different  group of Republicans here now who wouldn't have voted for MFN for  China, or would support my resolution to withdraw from the WTO because  of the WTO and the dominance of China and its lack of effectiveness.  And I hope to have that vote later this year, although it was precluded  during this time period by the Rules Committee.   So we have the most stringent Buy America requirements of any part of  the government in the Transportation and Infrastructure sections of  this bill. Most stringent. We closed the last loopholes for transit and  rail being used by Communist government-owned or controlled  corporations in China. We have done that.   And, you know, it is time to bring things back to the United States  of America. Bring back pharmaceutical production. Let's stop being  driven by the pharmaceutical industry here.   I still remember the Medicaid part D vote, the Republican bill, it  prohibited the government from negotiating lower drug prices because  Big Pharma runs this place on that side of the aisle.   And now here we have--all of a sudden we developed a concern about  human rights and China. Well, you have been pretty absent for the last,  oh, let's see, when you were in the majority until very recently--60  percent of my career has been in the minority. So the last time you  held the majority for 10 years or so, you didn't do anything on any of  these things. You had President Bush, he didn't do anything on these  things. You have President Trump who is cozying up to the dictator of  China. And now you come here, and say, Oh, we are going to fix all this  with this vote.   We have taken the strongest, strongest stand in the infrastructure  sections of this bill, and it is fully within the rights of the  President to take further action to punish China for these sorts of  things.   Madam Speaker, I recommend a ``no'' vote on this motion to recommit.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            Parliamentary Inquiry     Madam Speaker, pursuant to instructions of the House in  the motion to recommit, I report the bill, H.R. 2, back to the House in  its entirety with an amendment.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that in the  engrossment of H.R. 2, the Clerk be authorized to correct section  numbers, punctuation, spelling, and cross-references and to make such  other technical conforming changes as may be necessary to accurately  reflect the actions of the House.
