 Madam Speaker, I hope what I am getting ready to say, it  turns out to be redundant, that we are going to hear it in the closings  of both the gentlewoman from Florida and the gentleman from Texas.  [[Page H3517]]    We talk about this preexisting conditions' bill today as if it is  going to help with preexisting conditions. As we have discussed  already, it is not.   But the preexisting conditions issue is a very real issue. It is a  very real issue for families all across the country, and it has been  for a long time.   And undeniably, elections were won and lost this past cycle over a  preexisting conditions issue based on the misinformation around it.   I don't know how we are advantaged as a community by continuing to  perpetuate the misinformation. When we first tackled preexisting  conditions in a serious way, we did it together in this institution.    I know, because it was a gentleman from my State, Madam Speaker,  Speaker Newt Gingrich, who was sitting in that chair at the time.   It was 1996. Bill Clinton was sitting in the White House. Newt  Gingrich was sitting here leading the United States House, and we came  together, Republicans and Democrats, we passed the Health Insurance  Affordability and Accountability Act that abolished preexisting  condition worries for every single family with an ERISA-based plan.  Those are the plans that the Federal Government controls.   So what I mean, Madam Speaker, is that for every single plan the  Federal Government had dominion over, we eliminated preexisting  conditions.   Medicare, no preexisting conditions.   Medicaid, no preexisting conditions.   ERISA plans, no preexisting conditions.   Collectively, that is about 250 million Americans.   What we didn't do was go into the area where the Federal Government  had no dominion, which were State-regulated plans, and we said States  should have the ability to regulate their own plans.   Now President Obama said, no, States had been moving too slow to help  their constituency.   He ran on the platform of taking those plans away from State control;  he won that debate. The Affordable Care Act implemented those  conditions. And the bill today says, if states have an idea about how  to protect families from preexisting conditions that is better than the  one in the Affordable Care Act, we don't want to hear it.                                time  1315    There is one solution for preexisting conditions and it is the one  that President Obama has implemented, no other. I think that is wrong.   Dr. Burgess knows more about medicine than I will ever hope to know.  He knows more about serving patients than I will ever hope to know.   Ms. Shalala, as Secretary of Health and Human Services, knows more  about healthcare than I will ever hope to know. I trust these folks to  find solutions differently in Florida, and differently in Texas than we  do in Georgia.   This bill does one thing and one thing only. It continues the debate  from 1996, not about whether to help people with preexisting  conditions, but about whether States have anything to add to the  discussion. I am certain the State of Georgia does. I believe the State  of Florida does. I know the State of Texas does.   If we defeat this rule and defeat this bill, it will allow those very  best ideas to come out and not ideas about how to keep people down,  Madam Speaker, but ideas about how to lift families up.   We have come together on those issues before, Madam Speaker, and we  can do it again.
