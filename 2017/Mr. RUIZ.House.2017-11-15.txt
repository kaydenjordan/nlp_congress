 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Neal for the  opportunity to speak on this bill.   The fact is I do want to simplify our Tax Code and I do want tax  reform, a tax reform that relieves the burden on our middle class, our  seniors, our veterans, and our students. But let's just see how this  bill fares with the middle class, seniors, veterans, and students.   My middle class constituents in California will be double-taxed on  their income, but big corporations will get tax relief.   Veterans in my district will find it harder to find work or a home  because this bill eliminates tax credits for hiring veterans and harms  efforts to end veterans' homelessness.   Middle class homeowners across California will see the value of their  homes decrease by as much as 10 percent.   Students will get hit with the largest relative tax increase in this  bill.   Seniors will see a Medicare cut by $25 billion a year. That is over  $100 billion of Medicare cuts over the next 4 years.   And 38 million middle class families will see their taxes increase.  They always point to this family of four earning $59,000 getting a  certain amount of tax cuts, but 38 million middle class families will  see their taxes increase, all this while giving tax breaks to  millionaires, billionaires, and corporations who ship jobs overseas and  raise the deficit by $1.44 trillion within 10 years. In fact, nearly 80  percent of the tax cuts in this bill go to millionaires, billionaires,  and multinational corporations that ship jobs overseas.    The bottom line is this bill raises taxes on the middle class and  gives tax breaks to billionaires. This is irresponsible and  unacceptable.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and protect  Medicare, protect the middle class, protect seniors, protect veterans,  and protect students.
