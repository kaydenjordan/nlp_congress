 Mr. President, I want to thank my esteemed colleague from  Wyoming, Senator Barrasso, for his comments. He shared many of the same  views I have.   As I think about the job I do as a Senator--perhaps one of the most  important jobs we have as Senators is approving a Supreme Court  Justice. An Associate Justice of the Supreme Court can serve an average  of 27 years. We think about Justice Scalia; he served 30 years. Neil  Gorsuch is 49 years old. God willing, he probably will serve 30 years  or more, perhaps. Think about that. My wife and I have four children.  They are going through the college years and so forth. They are in  their early and midtwenties. They will likely be grandparents when  Judge Gorsuch wraps up his career on the Supreme Court, assuming he is  approved. That is why a decision like this about whom to vote for, whom  to stand behind, whom to stand with is so important. It is not just for  today, it is for our children and our grandchildren.   The people want a Supreme Court Justice who does not legislate from  the bench. The people want a Supreme Court Justice who upholds the rule  of law and follows the Constitution. The people want a Supreme Court  Justice with a record of constitutional jurisprudence and legal  restraint to match what we saw from Justice Antonin Scalia. The people  want a Supreme Court Justice with the academic credentials, who is well  prepared to serve the American people on our highest Court, to wrestle  with some of the most complicated issues that the High Court wrestles  with.   When President Trump announced that he was appointing Judge Neil  Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court, the American people knew he was  truly a supreme pick. He has a brilliant legal mind. He understands the  role a judge plays in our judicial system--to interpret the law and not  to legislate from the bench. In fact, on the night he was announced,  when President Trump revealed his pick, I was at the White House, and I  heard Judge Gorsuch say: ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches  is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather  than those the law demands.'' That is the humility of a great judge.   Judge Gorsuch has impeccable legal qualifications that demonstrate he  will be the type of Justice every American deserves to have on the  highest Court. He graduated from Harvard Law School. He was a Harry  Truman Scholar, graduated with honors in 1991. He earned his law degree  and then attended Oxford University as a Marshall Scholar and received  his doctorate degree in 2004 from Oxford.   As we say out West, and as a Montanan, I have to say I am thrilled to  see somebody from Colorado be nominated for the Supreme Court. We say  out West: Go get a good education and then get over it. And he brings  that kind of humility to the bench. He understands that he is beneath  the law, he is subject to the law. He is there to interpret the law,  not to make the law.   He clerked for Justice Byron White. He clerked for Justice Kennedy of  the Supreme Court of the United States. In fact, in 2006, Judge Gorsuch  was nominated by then-President Bush to the Tenth Circuit in Denver,  CO. He was confirmed without any opposition, including the support of  11 current Democratic Senators. In fact, some of those Democrats  included Harvard Law classmate Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden,  and the current minority leader, Chuck Schumer. During his time as a  judge on the Tenth Circuit, he has built a solid reputation as a  respected jurist with a very distinguished record.   One thing about serving on the Tenth Circuit Court for 10 years: You  can run, but you can't hide. He has left a track record. It is an  impressive track record. It is a consistent record of defending the  Constitution, including respecting the separation of powers and  respecting federalism and the Bill of Rights to protect every American  from government overreach and government abuse.   When I had the opportunity to sit down with Judge Gorsuch, it was  back in early February. We spoke about the role of government and  federalism. We spoke about the Second Amendment. We spoke about  protecting life and upholding our civil liberties. We spoke about our  shared western values, mine as a native Montanan, his as a native  Coloradan, both of us westerners. I know he understands our way of  life. He understands Montana values. In fact, his face lit up as we  talked about the love of the outdoors and his passion for hiking and  fishing.   As chairman of the Western Caucus, it is important to me to have  someone who understands western values, someone who understands the  impact the law and his decisions will have on the West.   As westerners, we fight to protect our Fourth Amendment rights. We  champion federalism so that power not expressly given to the Federal  Government in the Constitution is returned back to the States and to  the people. We will tirelessly fight to protect the Second Amendment.  These are western values.   By the way, the Second Amendment is not primarily about hunting. Our  Founding Fathers were not thinking about deer hunting or elk hunting  when they were discussing the Second Amendment. It was about liberty.  It was about freedom. These are western values. Judge Gorsuch's  background and record strongly suggest that he recognizes and adheres  to these values. He will uphold the law. He will rightfully check the  administration and Congress when their actions are not done under the  law, like President Obama's EPA power plan or the WOTUS rule. These are  actions that cripple western economies, and they are politically  charged.   I would also like to mention that Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado  and I were just at the White House meeting, just an hour ago. We were  at the White House meeting with over a dozen Tribes who represent  hundreds of other Tribes. We were there to discuss our support for Neil  Gorsuch to be a Supreme Court Justice. I can tell you, it was great to  be there with one of my hometown Tribes from Montana, the CSKT. They  have endorsed Neil Gorsuch. They understand that we need a mainstream,  commonsense westerner on the Supreme Court.   By the way, when you look at Neil Gorsuch's record on Indian Country  issues, as a member of the Tenth Circuit Court for 10 years, he has a  track record of ruling on some very complicated issues that face Indian  Country. He understands sovereignty. That is very important. That is  why you are seeing Tribes endorsing Judge Gorsuch.   More importantly, the American people deserve nine members on the  Supreme Court. Neil Gorsuch is the mainstream judge the American people  want and deserve to fill out the Court.   I am looking forward to what will happen next week in those hearings.  You are going to see a very, very bright, a very, very thoughtful, a  very, very kind, and a very, very humble jurist who understands and  upholds the rule of law. I am excited for our country that we have such  a phenomenal nominee. I look forward to casting my vote to confirm him  to the highest Court in our great country.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct  honor of recognizing Rocky Erickson for his long run as the voice of  Montana sports. When traveling along the many roads in Big Sky Country  or stopping in at a local watering hole for a bite to eat, if you are  in earshot of a radio and that radio is tuned to local sports, there is  a good chance that Rocky is on the other end of the broadcast.   Rocky grew up on his family's wheat farm in the small McCone County  community of Vida. After high school, he studied telecommunications at  Liberty University in Lynchburg, VA. Shortly after completing his  degree, Rocky returned to eastern Montana and began to provide Montana  sports fans with high quality commentary. Rocky's distinguished  broadcasting career began in the early 1980s and continues today. This  past weekend, he was calling the play by play for the Montana High  School State Basketball Championship tournament games. Rocky's Montana  sports program is broadcast daily on 40 stations, and he has been  recognized by his peers as the ``Montana Sportscaster of the Year'' on  nine separate occasions. The native son of Vida, population 70, has  gone on to do great things within his industry. His broadcasts are  sincerely appreciated by sports fans across Montana.   Attending a Montana sporting event helps one appreciate how valued  and unifying local sports can be to our communities. Rocky has shared  these treasured experiences with many Montanans by giving his audience  a rich texture and personal touch in each broadcast. Thank you, Rocky,  for your outstanding work, and I hope to hear you again soon.                            ____________________
