 Madame President, today I wish to honor a Montanan  and an astronaut who, 50 years ago, set off on a journey that took him  further from home than any man had been before.   On December 21, 1968, Commander Frank Borman, and his crew Jim Lovell  and Bill Anders, sat atop a Saturn V rocket and were blasted into  space, destined to become the first men to orbit the moon and return  safely back to Earth.   Apollo 8 flew a dangerous mission at a perilous time for both the  space program and our Nation which, much like today, was struggling to  heal itself after a year of discord and division.   In late December, those differences were put aside as 1 billion souls  turned their eyes towards the cosmos and watched as grainy images of  the lunar surface were transmitted back to Earth. The magnitude of the  moment was undeniable: When we work together, humanity is capable of  greatness.   That was Commander Borman's last time in space. He now lives in  Billings; he and his wife Susan have called Montana home for the past  20 years.   As we remember Commander Borman's history-making flight, we must also  remember the sense of optimism and pride that it inspired and strive to  find it once again.                            ____________________
