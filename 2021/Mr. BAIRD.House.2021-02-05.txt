 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Purdue University  professor Dr. Larry DeBoer. I had the opportunity to work with Dr.  DeBoer as a member of Purdue Extension Service as an Indiana State  representative and as a farmer.   Dr. DeBoer recently retired from Purdue after 36 years of teaching  economics. His tenure at Purdue is distinguished and worthy of  recognition. Every semester, he taught 200 to 400 students  macroeconomics. In addition to that, he has authored macroeconomics  textbooks for universities.   Dr. DeBoer was recognized for his outstanding teaching with numerous  awards, like the Charles B. Murphy Outstanding Undergraduate Teaching  Award in 2015 and the Richard L. Kohls Outstanding Undergraduate  Teacher Award in 2014.   In addition to being a professor, Dr. DeBoer has advised and worked  with the Indiana Legislative Services Agency on tax and finance issues,  and has worked on former Governor Mitch Daniels' Commission on Local  Government Reform.   The State of Indiana has benefited greatly from his deep knowledge  and expertise in the State's economic affairs. I want to wish Dr.  DeBoer the very best in his retirement.                            ____________________
