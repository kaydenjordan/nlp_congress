 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today in support of my  amendment, amendment No. 36. This  [[Page H5506]]  amendment highlights the importance of the Department of Housing and  Urban Development's Pathways to Removing Obstacles to Housing,  otherwise known as the PRO Housing grant program and land-use reform  policies, which were shortsightedly omitted entirely from this partisan  bill that we are reconsidering tonight, H.R. 4820.   This grant program, funded for the first time in fiscal year 2023, is  based on broadly supported bipartisan bills, including my Housing  Supply and Affordability Act and the Yes in My Backyard Act.   The program incentivizes reform of local land-use policies that  hinder the expansion of an affordable housing supply.   Our Nation is facing an affordable housing crisis. We have a shortage  of as many as 7 million affordable homes.   This drastic underproduction hurts American families. It hurts  communities, businesses, and costs the economy about $2 trillion per  year in lower productivity and wages.   The lack of affordable housing also increases the strain on the labor  market with about 9.6 million job openings in the U.S.   From food service to cybersecurity, employers in nearly every  industry are struggling to find and retain workers. The bottom line is  to take a job, you need to be able to afford to live near that job.   I hear about this problem in almost every meeting that I attend up  and down my State. It is a problem that impacts people in Delaware,  from our beaches to the cities to the rural communities, and I know it  is impacting Americans across this country.   I urge my colleagues to think about the human impact of the lack of  affordable housing; extreme stress, homelessness, increased workforce  shortages, and poorer health outcomes. It is clear that housing is  foundational to our well-being.   Strict land-use policies create artificial restrictions that drive up  costs and delay production. In many cases, they are horrific vestiges  from the past, where discriminatory redlining broke up communities and  prevented all Americans from having access to the American Dream.                                time  1630    Unfortunately, the bill that we are voting on today will squander  another opportunity to right those wrongs of the past.   We know the bill in its current form has no chance of becoming law.  The lack of meaningful housing reform and support, like the PRO Housing  program and land reform policies, are examples of the many fatal flaws  with this bill.   The adoption of my amendment will at least signal to the Senate and  our appropriations leaders that we need to include the PRO Housing  program and land use policy reforms in a final appropriations bill.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Washington (Mr. Kilmer), a member of the Committee on  Appropriations.    Madam Chair, I yield the balance of my time to  the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Quigley), the distinguished ranking  member of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and  Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
