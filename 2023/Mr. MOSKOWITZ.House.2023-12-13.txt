 Mr. Speaker, we are about to begin the impeachment  inquiry debate, and my Republican colleagues are going to show you how  important it is to them.   They are going to show you how much evidence they have supposedly  uncovered. They are going to show you how serious of an issue they  think this is.   Do you want to know why? Because as soon as we take this vote today,  you know what they are going to do? They are going to break for 3  weeks. They are going to run out of this place and leave for 3 weeks,  even though it is so important and it is so overwhelming and the Nation  must be focused on this, that they are going to run away and leave  Washington for 3 weeks.   It is because there is no evidence on Joe Biden. The only thing they  have uncovered is that Joe Biden is the father of Hunter Biden.   That is it.                            ____________________
