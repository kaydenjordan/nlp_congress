 Mr. Speaker, it has come to this: considering  hopelessly flawed legislation that the Republicans have had 7 years to  prepare for and still couldn't do it right. It may still pass, but it  is never going to be enacted because most people are figuring it out.  They don't like it and they are being heard. That is why this bill has  been stalled and the Republicans have been forced to twist the  legislation in this fashion.   But the bottom line remains: TrumpCare will cost more for people who  need it the most. It will hurt older and lower-income people in order  to create tax cuts for people who need them the least. TrumpCare will  destabilize health insurance and will slowly but surely destroy  Medicaid.   It didn't have to be that way, but as long as people continue  speaking out and fighting back with us, it won't be in the future, and  we can have a new era in health care and in politics.   With their help, it will be.
