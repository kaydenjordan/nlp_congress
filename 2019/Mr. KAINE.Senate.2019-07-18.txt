 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today to talk about an experience  that I had on Sunday. Sunday was the day, July 14, that President Trump  had preannounced that massive deportation and immigration raids were  about to begin. It looks like those raids maybe didn't start on Sunday,  but the communities of immigrants in Virginia and elsewhere, who have  been experiencing tremendous fear, had that fear dramatically  accelerated by the announcement.   On Sunday, my wife and I, who live in Richmond, went to a town called  Kilmarnock, about an hour and 10 minutes away from us, where my wife's  parents are in a nursing home. They are 95 and 93 years old. We went  down to spend the day with my in-laws and to take my mother-in-law to  church at the local Episcopal church where she has long been a member.   I was struck by the readings. It was a day of fear for many immigrant  communities, and the readings that occurred in the Episcopal church,  which are readings that are delivered in Catholic and Presbyterian and  other churches on a set schedule, struck me as I was thinking about the  fear in these communities.   For the Old Testament reading, normally, in most churches around the  globe, Catholics and Episcopals read from Deuteronomy, but for some  reason, the pastor of this church--it was his goodbye ceremony, and he  was leaving after serving for an interim--had switched the Old  Testament reading and instead put in a reading from the Old Testament  Book of Amos, Chapter 7, verses 7 through 9.         This is what he showed me: The Lord was standing by a wall       that had been built true to plumb, with a plumbline in his       hand. And the Lord asked me, ``What do you see, Amos?''        ``A plumbline,'' I replied.        Then the Lord said, ``Look, I am setting a plumbline among       my people Israel; I will spare them no longer.''    A plumbline is a device used when you are constructing something. It  is just a weight on a string, nonmagnetized, and it will show up and  down so that you can build something that is square and that has a  solid foundation.   It is a reading about principles and values and what is a solid  foundation.   The Gospel reading that we heard in our tiny church in Kilmarnock and  around the world was the Good Samaritan story. Jesus is being pestered  by a lawyer: What do I do to inherit eternal life?   And Jesus said: You know the answer. Tell me the answer.   And the lawyer does. He is smart.   Love God and love your neighbor as yourself.   Jesus says: Fine. You know the answer. Just live that way.   But the lawyer, either to trap Jesus or because he was confused or he  was trying to figure it out, says: But who is my neighbor?   And then Jesus tells the story of a person beaten on the road to  Jericho and lying at the side of the road. Some passed by pretending  not to notice, though they do notice. Some noticed and sort of half go  over to help but don't do anything. But one person, a Samaritan--and in  the Bible, Samaritans were despised minorities because they didn't  worship like other people did--actually is the one who actually goes  and helps.   As everyone knows, in the story he takes care of the person who is  beaten. He takes him to an inn and pays the innkeeper and says: I will  even pay you more. I will settle up. Make sure that you nurse him back  to health.   This Samaritan was the one who was the neighbor. When Jesus then goes  back to the lawyer and says: Which was the one who was the neighbor to  the person who was beaten, the lawyer was so infected by the prejudice  of his day that he can't even say ``the Samaritan.'' Again, Samaritans  were despised people, much like refugees or migrants or migrant kids  seem today to be despised people. The lawyer couldn't even make his  lips say the word ``Samaritan.'' Who is the neighbor to the person who  was beaten? He can't even answer the question--the Samaritan. But he  does know the answer, and instead he says: The one who showed him  mercy.   Those were the readings that we heard--that the Lord will set a  plumbline to try to determine whether the nation--in that instance,  Israel--was behaving properly or not, and in terms of what the  plumbline is, what is the moral standard. The Lord is encouraging us to  be neighbors, and not just to the people like us, not just to the  people who are our next-door neighbors but even to people who are down  on their luck, beaten, despised, and hurting.   Sunday was also another day. It was Woody Guthrie's birthday. Woody  Guthrie was a great American songwriter known for ``This Land is Your  Land'' and so many other songs that are part of who we are as a people.   Woody Guthrie wrote a song in 1948 called ``Plane Wreck at Los  Gatos,'' and the song is more commonly known by the name ``Deportee.''  We lived this history before.   In 1948 in California, there was an effort to deport so many people.  There are times when we desperately want immigrants here to do the  work, and then there are phases where they get deported.   Woody Guthrie was listening to the radio. This is a man born on July  14, the day that the President announced that the deportation raids  would start. Woody Guthrie was listening to the radio in January of  1948, and he heard a story about a plane that was taking deportees back  to Mexico. The plane crashed in Los Gatos Canyon, near L.A., and the  pilot and some others were killed, and 32 deportees were killed.   Woody Guthrie was struck that when the story was told on the radio,  they mentioned the names of the pilot and the copilot and the others  who were working on the plane, but as for the 32 deportees who were  killed, their names weren't mentioned. They were ``just deportees.''   Here are the lyrics to the Woody Guthrie song written based on an  incident in January 1948, but our history repeats itself.       The crops are all in and the peaches are rott'ning,      The oranges piled in their creosote dumps;      They're flying `em back to the Mexican border      To pay all their money to wade back again      Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye, Rosalita,      Adios mis amigos, Jesus y Maria;      You won't have your names when you ride the big airplane,      All they will call you will be ``deportees''      My father's own father, he waded that river,      They took all the money he made in his life;      My brothers and sisters come working the fruit trees,      And they rode the truck till they took down and died.      Some of us are illegal, and some are not wanted,  [[Page S4928]]       Our work contract's out and we have to move on;      Six hundred miles to that Mexican border.      They chase us like outlaws, like rustlers, like thieves.      We died in your hills, we died in your deserts,      We died in your valleys and died on your plains.      We died `neath your trees and we died in your bushes,      Both sides of the river, we died just the same.      The sky plane caught fire over Los Gatos Canyon,      A fireball of lightning, and shook all our hills,      Who are all these friends, all scattered like dry leaves,      The radio says, ``They are just deportees.''      Is this the best way we can grow our big orchards?      Is this the best way we can grow our good fruit?      To fall like dry leaves to rot on my topsoil      And be called by no name except ``deportees''?    Along with several other colleagues earlier this week, I filed a bill  called the Stop Cruelty to Migrant Children Act. It is a bill that has  40-plus cosponsors. It would do a number of things. It would set  safety, health, and nutrition standards in these facilities whose  pictures we are seeing--pictures that set an embarrassing example of a  nation that should want to set a good example.   It would set minimum standards for food, nutrition, and healthcare.  It would guarantee that children in these facilities would receive  three meals a day and that the meals would be of adequate nutritional  value. It would end the practice of family separation, unless ordered  by a court, so the presumption would be that families could not be  separated. It would provide additional resources for lawyers so that  people can follow the rule of law and present evidence and present a  case for asylum or refugee status, if there is a case to be presented.  It would allow the restart of programs like the Family Case Management  Program, which was a successful program that enabled people to be  placed in community settings, not cages or jails or institutions, and  have management to make sure that they then come to court dates on  time.   The bill has a number of provisions that I think are worthy, but the  thing that is the most important about the bill to me and why I agreed  to cosponsor it is that I just think it puts our country in a position  where we are setting the right example, not the wrong example. It puts  our country in a position where if the plumbline of right and wrong is  applied to us, we are on the right side of that judgment. It puts us in  a position where as we are being directed to be good neighbors-- including to people who are hurting, including to people who are  suffering--we would be able to look ourselves in the mirror and look  the world in the eye and say: The United States believes that we are  good neighbors, and we are behaving in a neighborly way toward people.   These issues are of massive importance to the individuals involved.  There was a story earlier this week about a border agent inquiring of a  young girl: You are going to be separated. Your parents are going to be  separated, and you have to decide whether you go with your mother or  your father.   Why make a child of tender years make that choice? The young girl's  name was Sofia. Many of us know the Virginia author, William Styron,  and his book ``Sophie's Choice.'' Sophie is forced to make an  existential choice between her children in a concentration camp in  Poland during World War II. That is the choice. That is the existential  choice in the heart of that novel.   When tiny Sofia is being told: We are separating your mother and  father, and you have to choose between them, should a child have to do  that? None of us would tolerate that for our own family members. None  of us would tolerate that for a member of our community. So is it fair  to do that to a child of tender years because she happens to be  somebody who has come from Central America?   These issues are of immense importance to those involved, to the  Sophies, to the father and daughter who tried to get across a river a  few weeks ago and drowned as they were trying to do it. They had come  thousands of miles, and they were so close. All they wanted to do was  apply for asylum legally: Can you accept my application? We are not  trying to sneak across. We want to apply legally and have the laws of  your country apply to us if we can justify that we should come. Please  do that.   When they reached the border, we are taking so few applications now  that they waited and they waited and they waited, and they eventually  tried to cross a river and were drowned in the process--that  heartbreaking picture of them having come so far and being so close  that they could touch the bank. They almost got to touch the bank of  this Nation they had dreamed might offer them a better life.   Their case, had they been able to apply, may or may not have been  accepted. There is no guarantee they would have met the standards, but  all they wanted was the opportunity to apply to enter this greatest  Nation on Earth.   So I will just conclude and say I hope, in the days ahead--and I know  there are discussions going on between Members of this body and between  Members of this body and the White House about what we might do. I just  want us to do something we can look in the mirror and be proud of. I  want us to do something that we can use as an example for ourselves and  for others. I want the plumbline that separates good and bad behavior  and foundations that are morally strong versus those that are shaky and  weak to judge us fairly. I want us to be neighborly. I want us to be  neighborly in the best traditions of whom we have always been.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
