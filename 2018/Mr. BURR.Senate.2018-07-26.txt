 Mr. President, I thank my colleague, and I rise in support  of his amendment.   The Land and Water Conservation Fund--you may remember, last month  when I tried to get a vote on its reauthorization, I had just come from  a press conference marking 100 days until it expires. We have been here  before. I am sort of shocked sometimes how hardheaded we are in this  institution.   This program has now reached a point where it is 66 days away from  expiration. In the 115th Congress, we actually let it expire. The  reason Congress passed legislation to reauthorize it was the pressure  of the American people.   Let me say at the start that I have unbelievable respect for the  chairmen of the committees whose bills make up this package, and I have  deep respect for the ranking members. I hold in high esteem the  chairman and the ranking member of the full committee. This is no beef  with them. This is a beef with what we have set up as the process for  the very choreographed movement of a piece of legislation--in this  particular case, the appropriations bill.   Some have told me this is just not germane to this bill. The only way  it wouldn't be germane, in my book, is that we are debating legislation  on the use of taxpayer money to fund government, and the Land and Water  Conservation Fund uses zero dollars of taxpayer money. You see, it was  created to take a percentage off the royalties of exploration by  visionaries who said: We want a perpetual fund that taxpayers aren't  obligated to--that is self-generating off of the resources we take out  of the land--to be pumped back in to protect the treasures for  generations yet to come. Masterful. Absolutely masterful. As a matter  of fact, it was so smart that over 60 Members of the Senate--if we  called for a vote right now, up or down, with nobody objecting or  making a motion, it would pass. It would meet the highest threshold in  the Senate to actually move out of this body. With over 240 cosponsors  in the House of Representatives, it would pass in the House. The  President would sign it into law, and this would be behind us.   We would set the example for the next generation, as parents and as  leaders, that there are some things you have to save for generations  who need an opportunity to be exposed to them. It is not as much about  what we get out of it; it is about the example we set on how we get  there. That is why it troubles me.   I look at this as a tremendous opportunity. Although by standards, it  is not germane, it is germane because we are not using taxpayer money.  We are actually protecting treasures for generations to come, which is  our responsibility as adults.   As I said, it is likely that there will be an objection. I hold no  personal disrespect for those who are forced to object to it. If we  were to table this amendment--I have already conceded to the chairman  that they would probably win, not because a majority of the body isn't  for it but because of the pressures that come with that vote; that  actual sponsors of the legislation--people who would vote for it--might  actually vote to table this for another day.   I have tried since the beginning of this Congress to bring up this  legislation. I only ask for an up-or-down vote at a 60-vote threshold.  I am not trying to short the process in the Senate by one vote. I am  not trying to piggyback and hide behind something. I just want the  Members of the Senate to actually have an opportunity to debate this  and to have a vote.   At the end of the day, I think what we would find is that a majority  of Senators--I think over 60--would support it and a majority of House  Members would support it.   There is one assurance I can give my colleagues: A majority of  America agrees with us. They believe we should pass this. We can have a  debate as to whether we change it. We are the U.S. Congress; we can  change a program at any time. But why would we not provide the  certainty that the program is going to be extended?   Many that remember the creation of the Land and Water Conservation  Fund--it was authorized and capped at $900 million a year. It has never  received $900 million a year because every dime that we get off of  royalties is funneled through the same appropriations process in which  we are currently engaged.   Another reason I would claim that common sense would say this is  germane to what we are doing is because it is money that is controlled  by the Appropriations Committee, and for whatever reason--and I am not  questioning it--they never appropriated it at $900 million. No  administration ever requested $900 million. But nobody can prove to me  that there is not $900 million worth of worthy projects out there.   Much of this land ends up back in the inventory of States' parks, and  the residents of those States get to enjoy hunting, fishing, and  recreation on that land. They are not relying on their ability to buy a  piece of property that they can do it on; they share it with others in  their State.   In my State of North Carolina, we have some national treasures that,  thank goodness, founders before me recognized and protected. One of  them is called the Blue Ridge Parkway, the most traveled piece of  Federal road structure that we have in this country. When we cut it  through the mountains from Virginia to North Carolina in the 1950s--and  we created the greatest jobs program at the time; that is what it was  designed for--there were private landowners who had property adjacent  to that road. What is the prudent thing? The prudent thing is to  occasionally buy a piece of property that is not adjacent to the road  and trade with the landowner who is on the road so that we can protect  the roadway. That is the type of project that Land and Water  Conservation Fund money goes to. It is not to create a bigger Great  Smoky Mountains National Park, which is also in my State. It is the  most visited park in the United States. I am not asking to enlarge it.  I am asking for us to provide these funds so that great decisions can  be made in coordination with local officials about what treasures  should exist down the road for our children and our grandchildren.   We are not going to have an opportunity to acknowledge today that we  are going to move this legislation. I believe that is incredibly  unfortunate. I think it is tough because I think there are a lot of  people who would be supportive who sound a little bit like crickets  today.   Here is the only promise I can make to my colleagues today: You are  going to have an opportunity to vote on this time and again. As long as  the Senate goes into session, if we intend to move legislation, you  will have an opportunity to vote on the Land and Water Conservation  Fund reauthorization. When this floor opens in the morning, on a  regular basis, I will come down here, and I will not encumber the  Appropriations chairman in every case; I will probably pull every  chairman into this. And I won't just rely on chairmen's vehicles of  legislation that they are very passionate on. I have an Intel  authorization bill that I can't even get to the floor for  authorization, and I can't think of anything that is more important. I  think the chair and the ranking member of the full Appropriations  Committee both served on the committee in the past, and they know the  importance of the Intel authorization bill. I can't get it up because  sometimes we get more hung up on the power of one person in this  institution than we do on the importance of what it is we are doing.   Well, if that is what we want to do, I will come down as one person,  and I will ask unanimous consent that we consider the reauthorization.  I am sure somebody will stand up and object.  [[Page S5402]]  They always do. They are objecting to what the American people want us  to do. They are objecting to a program that has a proven track record  of success and requires zero--nada, not a dime--of taxpayer money. If  there has ever been a thing that we have presented to the American  people that we should be applauded on--and that doesn't happen often-- this has been one of them.    Yet, because we have chosen convenience over debate, because we are  trying to fit this in a really small box, let me suggest to my  colleagues that we are making a foolish mistake for the long term in  this institution. This is an institution that was created for this  moment. It is an institution that was created so that we could come to  this floor and debate, so that we could come in and believe one thing,  hear the debate, and actually go out and say: It changed my mind.   Maybe some people will listen who are now supporters, and maybe some  supporters will listen to what I have said and will now vote against  me. Here is the troubling thing: They will not have the opportunity.  With the promise I will make to them, they will get that opportunity.  So watch what you say because before I leave this institution, you will  be given the opportunity to vote time and time and again if, in fact,  procedurally, we are blocked from letting the American people's voices  be heard with a vote in the Senate.   I yield back to my colleague.    Madam President, I rise today to honor and celebrate the  life of C.D. ``Dick'' Spangler, a great North Carolinian who passed  away earlier this week.   The true mark of a great man, a great contributor to our society is  the fact that there are several acts in that individual's life, there  is no one single attribute to which to ascribe that contribution, and  Dick Spangler was such a man.   In that first act, Dick built an impressive wealth, at the time  making him one of the wealthiest individuals in this country in the  family construction and real estate business. The son of a Charlotte  contractor and real estate investor, Dick attended Woodberry Forest  School, then the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and  Harvard Business School. After serving 2 years in the Army, he moved  back to his native North Carolina to work in the family business, C.D.  Spangler Construction.   In 1973, while continuing to serve in the family's construction  company, Dick became chairman of a little bank at the time, the Bank of  North Carolina, and was subsequently elected director of NCNB, which  would eventually be sold to Bank of America.   Although he was a brilliant businessman, in my mind Dick Spangler  will best be remembered in our State for his commitment to education  and what it means for lifting individuals out of poverty, giving them a  path for learning, and expressing their individuality. He did this by  advocating for a return to an emphasis on teaching the basics, higher  salaries for teachers, and programs for training high school principals  for a very challenging job. That second act and the energies and  personal contributions he made to it are what made Dick the remarkable  man he was.   During his time as president of the University of North Carolina  System, a position he held for over a decade, Dick was laser-focused on  keeping North Carolina's public university system affordable and low- cost for all seeking postsecondary education. It is because of his  dedication so many years ago to low-cost tuition in the UNC System--a  mission he pursued without a paycheck during his time as president-- that current North Carolinians today receive an affordable, great  university education. Dick Spangler once said:         Low tuition is not a gift. It's an investment in these       students. They go to work and pay that back over a lifetime.    The number of individuals who have chosen to do just that by making  North Carolina their home after graduating from one of the UNC System's  great schools is a testament to that effort.   He viewed leading the UNC System as one of the truly great jobs  anyone could have. On the eve of his departure, he said, when talking  about the UNC System:         We're on the side of angels. Spending time with our       students--to be with them is one of the great joys a person       could experience. . . . I live in a community that is       vibrant--not asleep. It's wide awake and there's always       turmoil because people are bright with viewpoints sometimes       in conflict.    But for those who know the Spangler family and Dick's commitment to  the State, I will always remember Dick for his philanthropy and the  commitment to bettering our State through his personal efforts and his  personal giving.   The C.D. Spangler Foundation dedicated hundreds of millions of  dollars over the past several decades to better public education in our  State. Through this work, over 120 distinguished professorships,  purposed toward improving instruction in our public education, were  funded, providing generations of North Carolinians with the benefits of  a quality education.   For those unfamiliar with the racial history of North Carolina's  schools, Dick Spangler was prompted by Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg  Board of Education, that seminal Supreme Court decision which said it  wasn't enough to simply say desegregation of public schools was the law  of the land; towns needed to commit to it and follow through on  educating minorities next to their White peers. It is no exaggeration  to say that without Dick's leadership in Charlotte during the 1970s and  1980s, racial desegregation of Charlotte's schools might not have  happened the way it did, serving as a national model for other  communities grappling with racial tensions in their schools.   Dick was so adamant about this fact, he decided not just to put his  tremendous personal wealth to work, but to put his time on Earth to  work as well. So he ran to become vice chairman of the Charlotte- Mecklenburg Schools in an effort to ease the racial tensions that  existed at the time in Charlotte, NC. Although he could have afforded  to send his children to private school, he chose to lead by example,  and he sent them to the Charlotte public schools to prove what is  obvious to us now but was seemingly so controversial at the time.   When I hear Dick Spangler's name, there are words I think of:   ``Honest.'' He was never questioned about his honesty.   ``Passionate.'' Dick Spangler was committed to every effort that he  joined into, and he never sold it short.   ``Opinionated.'' He made you listen, whether you wanted to hear it or  not.   ``Fair.'' He never let his wealth influence his outcome.   ``Daring.'' He took on things that other people ran the opposite way  from.   ``Demanding.'' I am not sure I have been in many meetings with an  individual who controlled attention the way Dick Spangler did. He saw  time as a precious thing, and he knew we were limited on the amount  that we would be here to use it. Dick Spangler used every minute of his  life to make our State and this country better.   Last one, Dick Spangler was committed. He was committed to this  country. He was committed to this State. He loved his UNC Tar Heels.  More importantly, he loved his family.   His leading by example rather than simply words will remain in my  mind as we mourn and we celebrate the loss of a great man. Today, I  wish to extend my condolences and deep appreciation to his wife of 58  years, Meredith, to Abigail, to Hannah, to Tom, and to the extended  family. Their loss is not only our State's loss but our country's loss.   I can feel confident, as I think Dick Spangler does today in Heaven,  that Dick did everything he could to set the example for every  generation to come; that you have to invest something to get something.  I, for one, am moved, inspired, and committed to live on that  commitment.   I yield to my good friend from North Carolina.
