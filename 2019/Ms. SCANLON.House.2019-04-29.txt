 Mr. Speaker, in Pennsylvania, volunteer fire departments  have long played a central role in the life of our towns and boroughs.  In recent years, changing demographics and funding issues have  seriously impacted the volunteer fire company tradition. However, it  has also had one benefit of spurring recruitment of first responders  from nontraditional quarters.   I want to take a minute to acknowledge the history made by two  volunteers at the South Media Fire Company just last week. When an  emergency call from a local middle school came in at 7:30 a.m.  Wednesday morning, Ellen Yarborough, a schoolteacher, and Dora  Giannakarios Preston, a local business woman, put their day jobs on  hold to answer the call, unaware that they were making history. This  was the first time in the 100-year history of the firehouse that an  all-female crew had handled an emergency call.   To Ellen, Dora, the South Media Fire Company, and all of our  volunteer firefighters, thank you for your service and for answering  the call of duty to keep us safe.                            ____________________
