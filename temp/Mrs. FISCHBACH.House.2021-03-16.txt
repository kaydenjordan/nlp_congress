 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from the Rules  Committee, the Representative from California, for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule, a continuation of  the Democrats' weeks-long partisan push to fulfill their partisan wish  list.   First up is H.R. 1620, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization  Act, which is a highly divisive distortion of the original Violence  Against Women Act, that will jeopardize the safety of women.   By extending services to men who identify as women and allowing them  to utilize programs that were designed to protect vulnerable women, the  bill puts the safety of women at risk. The bill expands the definition  of domestic violence to include economic and emotional duress, driving  needed resources away from combatting violent crimes against women and  promoting an unproven restorative justice approach instead.   Democrats have told us again and again that it is time to rethink our  approach to law enforcement. But the same Democrats who want to defund  the police are now pushing this unfunded mandate, to the tune of  hundreds of millions of dollars, upon law enforcement. That doesn't  help anyone.   Next is H.J. Res. 17, which removes the established deadline for the  ratification of the equal rights amendment. As the deadline for States  to ratify the ERA has long passed, the constitutionality of this  legislation is suspect, at best. Congress does not have the authority  to simply extend the deadline some four decades later.   I also have concerns about this amendment radicalizing gender to  enshrine pro-abortion rights in the Constitution. I do not need a  constitutional amendment to tell me I am equal. The Constitution and  Federal law already require equal protection for all Americans.   If my colleagues on the other side were serious about the equal  rights amendment, they would ensure that the process for adoption was  done entirely by the book, rather than saying ``good enough,'' as they  move forward in this questionable manner.   Next, H.R. 6, the American Dream and Promise Act of 2021, will  provide amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants, incentivize illegal  border crossings, and worsen the surge of illegal immigration we are  currently seeing. The bill will provide green cards to criminal aliens  at a time when the southern border is already overwhelmed, costing  taxpayers hundreds of billions more.   H.R. 1868 addresses the very real budgetary consequences of last  week's massive partisan spending package being signed into law. While  we can all agree that we should avoid cuts to mandatory spending that  have been automatically triggered by this level of spending, there was  an opportunity to work across the aisle on a bipartisan solution. It is  unfortunate that the majority has chosen, once again, to forge ahead on  their own with highly partisan policies.   For these reasons, Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to think twice  before supporting this rule. We can do better for the American people.   Finally, I want to address H.R. 1603, the Farm Workforce  Modernization Act, a bipartisan effort to reform our agricultural  worker programs to address the workforce needs of our agricultural  community.   While I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues, including my  colleague from the State of Washington, Congressman Newhouse, and  others on both sides of the aisle to negotiate in good faith on this  legislation, I will point out that this bill is not without its flaws.  It does not address the already high cost of the H-2A program to make  it a more economical solution to producers.   It introduces a new private right of action against employers that  risks costly litigation that our producers cannot afford. These types  of issues are why stakeholders, such as the American Farm Bureau, have  concerns with this legislation. Make no mistake, a viable workforce for  our agriculture industry is a national security issue. However, I would  like my colleagues to recognize that, with the current language, this  bill is not the end-all and be-all solution for our farmers and  ranchers. While this legislation may pass the full floor this week as  it stands, I hope our counterparts in the other body improve the bill  before it is sent to the President.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to this rule, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  1700     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), the ranking member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Reschenthaler), my good friend and  another colleague from the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Smith).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to provide for consideration of Congresswoman Miller-Meeks' H.R.  1897, the REACT Act.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks) to speak further on the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Katko).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from New Mexico (Ms. Herrell).    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, in closing, there is a crisis at our border. Whether  the Democrats acknowledge it or not, our border patrol agents are  overwhelmed, detention facilities are way over capacity, and COVID-19  is spreading unchecked throughout. This puts the health of both  individuals detained and the border agents at risk.   We currently require a negative COVID test to travel in the U.S. So  why should the southern border be any different?   The border crisis is a direct result of the administration's lax  immigration policy, and it is putting our communities at further risk  of contracting COVID-19.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, and a  ``no'' vote on the underlying measure.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
