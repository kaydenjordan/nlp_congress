 If the gentleman would like to finish his remarks, I  would be glad to yield for a few minutes.    Madam President, I wasn't going to come over here  today--I just got off an airplane a little while ago--but I am here  because of what I have been hearing.   What I have been hearing is that we need to be talking about the  shutdown and not other subjects. When I met with the TSA agents on my  plane flying up here, they said: Why don't you get our work back for  us?   We are not even talking about TSA. We are not even talking about the  shutdown. We are talking about different opinions at different times  and different things that don't really matter in the scheme of things.   I appreciate what the distinguished ranking member of the Foreign  Relations Committee just said, but quite frankly, last week he was  talking about how important it was for us to stay on the shutdown and  not do anything else. Now the leader on the minority side says it is  important for us to get this Russian gentleman or oligarch--whatever  that is--whom we are already punishing, and then we will go back to the  shutdown.   My point is this: There is only one thing we need to be doing-- restoring the confidence of the American people in the Senate and the  House. They don't have it right now. We haven't given them anything to  hang their hat on--not a single thing.   We have been shut down for 23, 24 days. I am not a Johnny-come- lately--pardon the reference--to the issue of shutdowns. I have been in  the Senate and House for 20 years. I voted against five shutdowns-- every one I had a chance to. Shutdowns cost the government more money;  they don't save the government any money. They don't solve any single  problem whatsoever, even when you mask them by only shutting down a  little bit of the government, like we are right now. Not much of the  government is really shut down--just the part that hurts the smallest  income earners from our government. We are doing the wrong thing,  punishing the wrong people, and that is just not right.   All the speeches you are going to hear today, including mine, don't  matter at all unless we, first of all, get on the shutdown, correct the  problem, and find a way to bridge the gap. The President is not moving.  The Democrats aren't moving. The majority leader is not moving. We are  not doing much. That doesn't solve anything. Somewhere along the line,  we have to agree to find a way to do something different that may not  be the end deal but the bridge to do an end deal, or else we are all  going to look silly.   The truth is, everybody in this negotiation right now is sitting in  their office or sitting and talking to some people, having a beer or  doing whatever, and saying: How are we going to stick them--meaning the  other party--and get this shutdown over before our people drive us  crazy?   We are caught in our own trap. Things like what we are debating this  afternoon just emanate that.   This oligarch, who has a huge investment in the largest aluminum  company in Russia, is being divested of his interest down from 75  percent, I think, to 45 percent.   My home country of Sweden--one of the largest consumers of their  product of aluminum and one of the biggest sellers of aluminum to the  United States of America--has called me and said: You all are killing  us.   We have driven him down from 75 to 45, and we have some more things  to do. They are losing their vote. I think their vote is now down to  about 25 percent of the board. They have restricted  [[Page S200]]  him every way they can. I am a businessman; I know how you restrict  people and tie them down. This deal does that. It doesn't give them  anything they don't want--it gives them a lot of what they don't want  to have.   So I just want to appeal to everybody listening to this, all of my  colleagues--I love all of you. We all play political jokes. We can talk  about how the Democrats did this and the Republicans did that. But the  fact is, we are not doing a damn thing while the American people are  suffering. The TSA agents I talked to in Atlanta today were doing it  out of the goodness of their hearts. A lot of the guys and ladies are  not showing up for work, and there are going to be more of them.    We have the Superbowl coming to Atlanta, GA, in about 3 weeks--the  biggest tourism event in the world this year. What if the largest  airport in the world that is going to bring all the people to the  largest football game in the world goes out of business because of the  TSA strike? You will have just cost millions of dollars for the United  States of America, for my home city--the city of Atlanta--and others.  There are thousands of examples just like this.   I have had three people from my State call me. A convention is coming  up in one of our cities, and this shutdown is going to hurt the ability  to bring that here. We are going to lose the revenue we would normally  get from that. So we need to think about what we are doing. We are not  winning any points with anything.   A lady who was waiting with me to get on the plane just laughed when  I gave my answer to the TSA agent. I turned to her and almost asked:  Why are you laughing? I said: You know, I understand why you are  laughing because I can't explain it either.   We need to understand what we are doing and why we are doing it. What  we are doing doesn't make any sense. What does make sense is resolving  to go out and solve the problem. Senator Schumer, Senator McConnell,  Senator Crapo, and I--and all of us--should get together in a room and  give the press something to really write about--of our having a meeting  of 100 people who caused the problem and saying: Let's find a way to  solve the problem or to at least agree to get us back to business, to  at least agree to not affect the lowest income people on our payroll,  because the higher income people aren't suffering. Let's get the work  done. Let's get it worked out. Let's not call it a Republican shutdown  or a Democratic shutdown. It is an American shutdown.   I see that Senator Schumer is coming. I don't usually get this riled  up, Chuck. I apologize because I am riled up a little bit.   It is just silly. I used to be able to explain anything. I was a  pretty good real estate salesman for a long time. I could close a deal.  I can't close this one. I had to three or four times on that Delta  plane today, as I came up here, and I couldn't do it. When I listened  to the answers I was giving these people--good, old American citizens-- as to why we can't get the government open, I thought, if I were they,  I would not vote for me either.   So let's get to work. Let's stop blaming everybody else. Let's put  the blame where it belongs--on all of our shoulders collectively. Let's  do what we elected officials were elected to do, and let's make a deal.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I will follow up on the Senator's  points.   We need to do what we did last year when Republicans and Democrats  stayed up here for 2 weeks while the government was shut down. We  worked out an immigration agreement, and we got the DACA situation  fixed. The President came out for a large number of DACA improvements.  We almost got there. We fell short, I think, by six votes. The leader  and I were on the same side, and a lot of us in here, from both  parties, were on the same side. Those are the types of answers we need.  We need to push to get that done.    Madam President, today I am honored to recognize  in the Record Albert M. Hodge, Jr., of Rome, GA.   Al Hodge is an economic development leader whom I have known for more  than three decades, dating back to his work as chief executive officer  of the Charleston Metro Chamber of Commerce in South Carolina in the  1980s. We have worked together in business, when I was in the State  legislature and chairman of the State board of education, and still  today in our current roles.   Al is a fellow University of Georgia bulldog, who led the Charleston  chamber for 8 years, the Augusta chamber in Georgia for 8 years, and  now the Rome Floyd Chamber of Commerce in northwest Georgia for what  will be 21 years when he retires from the chamber business this April.   Al is not one to take credit, but his professional accomplishments  tell a lot of his story not only in these communities, but also across  multiple States and even internationally.   Al is the current vice chair of the Japan America Society of Georgia  and, along with me, a member of the Society of International Business  Fellows. He graduated from Leadership Georgia a few years after me, and  he has always remained active with the organization. Al also served as  a member and as vice chair of the Georgia Board of Education and  multiple other education-focused boards. He is a past chairman and a  current board member of the Georgia Department of Community Affairs. Al  has also served as chair of Georgia's economic development professional  association, the State's chamber of commerce professional association,  and he has taught economic development at the U.S. Army War College,  internationally with our alma mater, and other organizations.   Al is an expert in his field. He understands the countless factors  that play into successful economic development, he builds coalitions to  mount successful campaigns, and his work has paid off time and again.   Rome is a great community, with many leaders and good friends of  mine, but in large part thanks to Al's personal investment of time and  energy into his role, the community has gained more than $1.2 billion  in direct investments by primary employers and the creation and  retention of over 7,000 new primary jobs, not counting commercial,  service, and other jobs, during his time there.   Al was an instrumental member of the coalition that built State  Mutual Stadium and brought the Braves organization's Class-A ball club  to the community in 2003, the Rome Braves. Thanks to his leadership,  the community passed not only the Special Purpose Local Option Sales  Tax--SPLOST--but also more of these initiatives over the years to  benefit the community's schools, roads, airport and countless other  services. Most recently, he guided development of the Rome Tennis  Center at Berry College, the Nation's largest single-surface facility,  with 60 courts across 30 acres.   While Al has led the chamber, the community has seen the location of  major headquarters and manufacturing investments, including Pirelli  Tire North America, Suzuki Manufacturing of America, Neaton Auto  Products Manufacturing, and a major Lowe's distribution center.   In addition to my visits to Rome and seeing him in the State, I have  spent time with Al and the Rome chamber at least once a year in  Washington, and I have spent the last 15 years working with his  daughter as a member of my staff. Of all his professional  accomplishments, it is Al's family, friends, and colleagues whom he  truly cherishes and champions.   Al is a great guy, and I want to wish Al and his talented wife Cheryl  Riner Hodge--who has been a true partner to Al, in addition to her own  career as an artist--the very best as he retires from the chamber. I  also look forward to the Hodges' continued success in economic  development as they go on to launch the next phase of their lives and  careers. Many more will benefit from their continued efforts in this  field.                            ____________________
