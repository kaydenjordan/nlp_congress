 Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the  House. On Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2  p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m.  On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning  hour and noon for legislative business. On Friday, the House will meet  at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Last votes of the week are expected  no later than 3 p.m.   Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next  week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business  tomorrow.   Next week is National Police Week, so several bills will focus on  supporting the work done each day by our men and women in law  enforcement. That includes H.R. 5698, the Protect and Serve Act,  sponsored by Representative  John Rutherford. This bill would make  inflicting or attempting to inflict serious bodily harm on any police  officer a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison.   The House will also consider H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition  Act, sponsored by Representative Mike Conaway.   Ronald Reagan said, ``American farmers are the backbone of our  country,'' and both myself and the data would agree.   Food and ag industries drive more than 43 million jobs, over a  quarter of all American jobs, and U.S. farm exports generate more than  $300 billion in economic activity.   This important bill will reauthorize farm and nutrition assistance  programs for 5 years, while making reforms to modernize key programs  and better support rural America.   Since my friend often asks about items beyond the week to come, I  would like to make this a bonus colloquy for him, and preview several  items that are possible during this work period.   This includes H.R. 5674, the VA MISSION Act of 2018, sponsored by  Representative Phil Roe. This bill would fundamentally transform the VA  and the way American veterans receive care for the better.   I want to applaud Chairman Roe for his hard work on this legislation,  which recently passed his committee on a bipartisan vote of 20-2.   Next, H.R. 3, the Spending Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary Programs  Act. At $15.4 billion, the bill represents the largest single  rescissions request in history.   More importantly, this bill allows Congress to give our Federal  budget a much needed spring cleaning to the benefit of hardworking  taxpayers.   Third, H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act, sponsored  by Representative Mac Thornberry. This bill supports the historic  investments we have made to rebuild America's  [[Page H3914]]  military and ensures our brave men and women have the resources they  need to keep us safe.   Finally, the House may take further action on Dodd-Frank reform,  including potential action on the community bank regulatory relief bill  passed by the U.S. Senate.   I look forward to both Chambers taking additional policy actions in  this space in the coming weeks as we continue to improve access to  capital for American families and businesses.    As soon as our schedule is finalized, I will be sure to inform all  Members.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.    Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman has asked before and as  we have worked time and time again, the committee is working on a  budget, and as they get through, we will bring it to the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Even though I gave him a bonus colloquy beyond the week in front of  us, that does not mean if I don't mention something, that that item  would not come forward. So as the Budget Committee works, I will keep  the gentleman apprised of where they are and when the timing is for us  to bring it to the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those many  questions.   I have got good news for the gentleman. If his concern is the  contingency fund for the Children's Health Insurance Program, no need  to fear. In the life of the entire program, the most that has ever been  used, accumulated completely, is $300 million; that is why we set aside  $500 million.    Go beyond the long history of it. CBO tells us they don't expect any  of it to be used, but we want an insurance, just as we wanted this  program to survive; that is why it got extended more than 10 years.   Mr. Speaker, I don't have to remind my friend he voted against that.  But we care about the Children's Health Insurance Program; we care  about the taxpayers.   The good news is, in this rescission program, none of that money can  be spent. And if you are concerned about it and worried about maybe you  would make that vote, Mr. Speaker, the leader of the other side, she  voted to take that same amount from CHIP in the omnibus to spend  somewhere else, because you can't use the money, and we have already  extended it 10 years, and no child is going to be harmed by this. CBO  says it, all the way through, and we keep the contingency fund there.   But you won't rescind the money that you now have the authority to  even spend on the program to give back to the taxpayers? That is what  is interesting to me because I listened to you closely, and we have had  this discussion before about rescissions. It was just in our last  colloquy.   I remember when we talked about rescissions because that used to be  common practice. President Bill Clinton did it 111 times. President  Ronald Reagan did it 214 times. And both Presidents, Mr. Speaker, had  Congresses that were from other parties some time during their  administration.   So when you and I talked about it, because you had voted for  rescissions before, I wanted to make sure I got your input before ever  talking to the administration because I would like to have your help on  this. I think the American taxpayers would like to have everybody's  help on this.   So I asked you in that colloquy, I was hoping that you would support  this bill from our last one because you said, in our last colloquy: ``I  wouldn't irrationally oppose a rescission which said we've had money  laying in an account that has not been spent for 1, 2, or 3 years. We  shouldn't just have it sitting in that account.''   Because in our colloquy, Mr. Speaker, the concern on the other side  from my friend was we were going to break a trust; that we were going  to take money from that omnibus that he felt a lot of people negotiated  in, but, unfortunately, that trust he couldn't vote for.   You even interrupted me to say you believe that rescinding those  funds was a reasonable thing to do. I agree that it is a reasonable  thing to do.   So this administration, I think, may have listened to our colloquy,  Mr. Speaker, because if you look at this rescission package, the  largest one ever done, common practice from President Ford up until  Bill Clinton, you asked for funding that has sat for the last 1, 2, or  3 years. But even in this one, we identified programs that have sat  there for 7 years.   There has not been a loan in a program since 2011, and there is more  than $4 billion sitting there. Taking you at your word, you would jump  at this. I should have asked you to cosponsor it.   Now, I hope all Members will put the politics aside and be able to  support this because this is really what the taxpayer is looking for.  This is really what this House has a history of doing.   I know you have brought up a few other issues in there, and I know,  when you talk about the Children's Health Insurance Program, the CBO  has said that ``rescinding the unobligated balances would . . . not  affect outlays, or the number of individuals with insurance coverage.''   There are so many times I hear CBO quoted here, so I hope we would  quote it here as well. In other words, this will have no effect on the  CHIP program.   Mr. Speaker, as I noted earlier, in the omnibus, those who voted for  it, and the leader on the other side did, it did the exact same thing  with a higher number. So it was unobligated then and okay to do it. I  am just not sure why it wouldn't be now if you send it back to the  taxpayers.   Now, I do want to, also, Mr. Speaker, know because we have worked on  this CHIP program for quite some time. Now, the Republicans passed the  longest and most generous CHIP extension in the program's history.   Now, for the record, my friend did vote against it, not once, not  twice, but three times in this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to quote an AP article from Andy  Taylor, because you just can't make this stuff up.   ``Just weeks ago, Democrats supported almost $7 billion in cuts to  the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, eager to grab easy  budget savings to finance new spending at the Department of Health and  Human Services. But some Democrats howled over the Trump proposal  anyway.''   Let me get this straight. Is it okay to rescind the CHIP program, Mr.  Speaker, when Nancy Pelosi wants to spend more? But when President  Trump wants to save the taxpayers money, with no effect on the CHIP  program at all, is that what Armageddon is?   Now, I don't want to play politics, and I know you have mentioned a  lot, and you did mention the tax bill, and you did mention April. There  was more good news in America. It wasn't just that unemployment is at  3.9 percent. You know the last time--the whole time I have been elected  in Congress----    Yes, 18 years ago. Do you know that the claims for  unemployment are at the lowest point it has been in more than four  decades? That is more than 40 years.   Do you know, just in the last year, 2 million more people have jobs?  Did you realize the millions of people who actually got bonuses; or  just in one company, 1.2 million Americans have a longer maternity  leave?                                time  1200    And did you see the revenue into America's Government last month? It  was the largest surplus in the history. The most revenue coming in.   So all of those colloquies we had of the fear of this tax bill, the  one that allowed Americans to keep more of what they earned, the one  that we promised would create more jobs, the one that would bring more  prosperity, facts don't lie. America is in a very good place, and I am  thankful that we had that debate.   Now, I know, Mr. Speaker, the others on the other side, there wasn't  one of them who could agree with us. But I think today they can agree  with the numbers of what it says and what it means; that we know for  any American who has a child that is 18 years old and ready to go away  to college, they don't have the fear that they are going to have to  come back and live with their  [[Page H3916]]  parents. They are going to enter one of the strongest economies to find  a job, of course, in their lifetime, but maybe almost in one of the  best times we have seen in ours.   So, yes, I am excited about this. I am also excited about the idea of  bringing a tradition back that saves the taxpayers money, one that, Mr.  Speaker, my friend has voted for before, one that protects the CHIP  program by setting aside, on a contingency basis, more than what has  ever been asked for in the history of it, $500 million when only $300  million it has, and even though they say not one dollar would be  spared. So we have the reserve there for it.   I am excited that the administration listened to our colloquy, took  my friend's wisdom and advice that he would look at any accounts that  sat there 1, 2, and even 7 years that was unobligated, to be able to  save the taxpayer money. And I look forward to when that is on the  floor so that we can vote on it together and show the American public  that we are serious about saving taxpayers money.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman realize that there are 2 million more  people in the workforce in less than a year?   Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman understand that more than 5 million  people got a bonus that, Mr. Speaker, some people on the other side  thought was crumbs?   Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman understand that the 3.9 percent  unemployment rate, many Americans have not seen that in almost two  decades?   Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman understand that we just watched last  night our President at Andrews Air Force Base bring back three  Americans that were held in prison in North Korea, and for the first  time since that conflict has gone on there is an opportunity to end  that war?   So, yes, I think some of our best days are right now; but with the  potential of what we have not only with our tax bill, but, if we get  our farm bill moving where we help individuals to get into that  workforce, because that unemployment is so low, I do believe the best  days are in front of us.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I remember what the gentleman said. The gentleman is  very concerned about the trust that we would have because of the months  that went into the omnibus, that we would break this trust, even though  those who negotiated, still some did not vote for it. But in that  omnibus, because defense had been cut more than 20 percent, because  when I wake up this morning and I see rockets flying from Syria into  Israel, when we watch the world become unsafe, it is not 20 percent  safer. We made an investment into military.   The gentleman does not want any cuts to go into that process, but my  question to the gentleman, Mr. Speaker, is there any cut in the  rescission the gentleman supports, because I took him at his word.   I said to the administration: I just had a great conversation in a  colloquy that the gentleman on the other side said of course he would  look at anything that was 1, 2, 3, or further years that was  unobligated.   That is the only thing that is in the rescission. The easiest way not  to save taxpayers money is to find something that is not in the bill  that you just really need.   The gentleman laid out in a colloquy what he wanted in a rescission.  It did not deal with the omnibus because the gentleman is worried about  the trust. The gentleman said he would look at anything from 1, 2, 3,  or further. That is the only thing in here.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my friend: Is there anything in the rescission  bill that he could support by giving the taxpayers more money back?    Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman has any idea, because I  know he has served on the Appropriations Committee, please offer up,  like any Member can, what he would cut or what he wants to find as  savings. I will look in any department anywhere to find a savings.   Now, Mr. Speaker, can the gentleman show me where in the CHIP  program--because, one, you cannot use these funds; two, the contingency  base is more than what has ever been used in the history of it--show me  where the Children's Health Insurance Program, because no one is saying  it. No one can show that it is. Please point it out to us.   You do not have the authority to spend this money. We put a  contingency fund, set aside, and looked at the history of the program.  The most that was ever used was $300 million, so we keep $500 million  in reserve.  [[Page H3917]]    If the gentleman could explain to me why, then, for those who voted  for the omnibus on your side of the aisle, would you make a larger,  same amount, and the argument then to take that money in the omnibus  but not now, why is it different?   Why is it different when the taxpayers will save money into an  account you cannot spend, you don't have the legal authority to, and it  is just sitting there, and it goes to the criteria of what you laid  out, 1, 2, 3, or 4?   The great thing about a rescission, this doesn't have to be the only  one. So if you want to work with us and you find areas that you want to  find savings to the taxpayers, I will make myself available to have  those meetings.    Mr. Speaker, the answer is yes, because if you listened  to what I said earlier, it went to HHS.   But this is the point: Then the gentleman is acknowledging that you  could not use that money for the CHIP program, so it is still sitting  there. You do not have the authority for it. It is exactly what you  said to me in a colloquy, just our last, that you will look at any  account that is sitting there 1, 2, 3, all the way to 7 years.   Mr. Speaker, I don't understand the argument, if no child could be  harmed, if the Republicans put it for 10 years, the longest it has ever  been, you can't use the money, and we leave a contingency fund there.   If the gentleman wants to find a reason to get to ``no,'' I  understand that. But I am of the belief I want to find a way to save  money, and I don't know what points the gentleman tries to bring up and  say it is political. No.   The whole time I have been in this House, I have always held to the  belief: It doesn't matter; we can find in any program waste. But this  rescission program is about money that is sitting in accounts that you  laid out that you said you would be more than willing to look at, and  that is what we have done, and I hope you would be able to keep your  word and vote for it.    Mr. Speaker, I am sorry. Did the gentleman yield to me?  On what point?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me,  and I will answer any question he has or any other reason why he finds  a way you can't save taxpayers money, but let me answer your questions.   Since we don't touch FY18 funds, it does not affect FY19 baseline.   Secondly, I said earlier, the gentleman is a Member of this Congress.  Rescissions do not have to be a one-time offer. If you have any ability  or any ideas, I am more than willing to work with you. I am more than  willing to work in the future not just on that line, but others as  well.                                time  1215     That is great. Will the gentleman offer an amendment to  the bill?    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman used Congressman  Tom Cole's  name, saying that he would say something. Congressman  Tom Cole is a  cosponsor of the rescission bill.   He is an appropriator, just as Congresswoman Kay Granger, Congressman   Tom Graves. They are all on the Appropriations Committee, and they are  all cosponsors of this bill because they want to continue to look to  ways that you can save taxpayers money.   I know we have gone around and around here. The question really ends  to a philosophy. Can we find a place that we can save the taxpayers  money, or can we only find the time that we will take that money when  you can't spend it and spend it someplace else? I believe we could take  money that you cannot spend and give it back to the taxpayer.   The gentleman brings up other areas. My door is open. I don't want  this to be the only rescission. I look for any department, any area in  government that we could find savings that are left over, that are  sitting there. Or let's make it more accountable. Let's find savings in  the current process as well. I am all for that.   But the one thing, Mr. Speaker, I am opposed to is voting ``no.''  That is the easiest thing to do on this floor. I can always find a  reason why I am against a bill because something else was not in it.   What is in this bill today is what my friend said in the last  colloquy. His argument against having a rescission package was all  based upon the omnibus. So he laid this out. Then we meet that  criteria, and then he is going to lay another reason out.   You cannot point to anywhere, CBO or any other place, where it states  that the CHIP program is harmed. I am sure he was concerned about that,  Mr. Speaker, when he voted against it three times, when he extended for  10 years.   This isn't about CHIP. It has nothing to do with it, because the CBO  says it is all protected. We put a contingency  [[Page H3918]]  fund in there greater than what was ever used in the history of the  program.   Mr. Speaker, what the real story here is: Can you take money and give  it back to the taxpayers and save money, or do you always have to spend  more in Washington? I think when the bill comes to the floor, the  American people will get that answer.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The gentleman just said nickel-and-dime programs. This will be the  largest rescission in the history of this country. It is not nickels  and dimes. It is the taxpayers' money. If it is nickels and dimes to  the taxpayers, I want to save those, just the same. But this is  billions.    The gentleman tries to make an argument that doesn't hold. Mr.  Speaker, the gentleman argues that CHIP could be in jeopardy. The CBO  says that is not true. The press writes that it is not true. I cannot  find anywhere that this program would be harmed.   I listened to my friend on the other side explain why he voted  against CHIP three times. His explanation is because he said there was  a promise on the other side for some other bill to come to the floor. I  can take him at his word, but my only question back to him would be:  Then why does he vote for any bill? Shouldn't he vote ``no'' on every  bill that is on the floor then, if that is the protest?   I don't understand why he would take it out on the Children's Health  Insurance Program. I don't understand why, when we had the opportunity  and we were able to achieve it, he voted ``no'' to get the longest  extension in a decade.   Mr. Speaker, I know the American public will see through what is  politics and what is policy and what is opportunity. Yes, we did pass a  tax bill and, unfortunately, it was just one side that voted for it.   Yes, our unemployment is the lowest it has been in more than 18  years. Our unemployment claims are the lowest they have been in 44  years. Two million more people are now in the workforce.   If you go back, 9, 10 years, the participation rate in America was  over 65 percent. Unfortunately, just a few years ago, it got all the  way down to 62.7, the lowest it has been since 1978. But the good news  is, it is on its way back up.   The good news is, Mr. Speaker, millions of Americans got bonuses  where they could fix their car, maybe buy that new washing machine. The  better news is, Mr. Speaker, that the revenues into government are even  higher--part of what the argument was on passing the tax bill.   Mr. Speaker, it was even an excitement to watch President Trump  sitting at Andrews Air Force Base watching three Americans get off an  airplane that have been in prison in North Korea, released on the hopes  that the war and the battle of North Korea against South Korea can end,  and that the President has announced that he has a location and time  for that meeting.   Yes, the world looks brighter. But there are still places around the  world that are not safe. And, yes, we did make an investment into the  military that I am very proud of. I actually voted for that bill.  People will say a lot of people negotiated. Some that negotiated didn't  vote for it in the end.   So, Mr. Speaker, I try to listen to the other side and I take what  they say very seriously. When I heard in our last colloquy that a  rescission bill had to be made on those funds that have sat there for  1, 2, 3, and even 7 years, that is what we did. And I look forward to  working on further bills in any department that anyone in this body  would like to work on.
