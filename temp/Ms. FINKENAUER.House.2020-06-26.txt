 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution in  overriding the President's veto.   I want to talk about two Iowans who tried taking a step forward but  were knocked two steps back by a for-profit school looking for an easy  buck and taking advantage of the hopes and dreams of my constituents.   Julie, a mother from Iowa, was looking to boost her career, and Jeff,  an Army reservist and construction manager, was trying to continue his  education.   They bought into ITT Technical Institute's promises, worked hard for  new career opportunities, and took out loans to do it. Both had their  lives turned upside down when ITT Technical Institute suddenly closed.   A 2016 Federal rule forgave loans for folks like Julie and Jeff, who  were obviously taken advantage of.   Unfortunately, this administration decided to roll back the  commonsense rule, weakening protections for borrowers.   In our State, there are more than 1,000 borrowers who were taken  advantage of and who are still waiting for their cases to be resolved.   We must stand with them and override the President's veto of this  resolution.
