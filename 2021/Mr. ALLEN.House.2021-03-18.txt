 Mr. Speaker, there is an undeniable crisis along our  southern border, and the most recent numbers we have received are  alarming.   Last month, there were over 100,000 illegal immigrants encountered at  our border. That is a 173 percent increase from the same time last year  and the highest number of encounters in 7 years.   From January to February of this year, we saw a 163 percent increase  of family unit encounters, a 61 percent increase in unaccompanied  minors, and a 28 percent increase in encounters overall.   This surge is a direct result of the Biden administration's failure  to secure our border and enforce our immigration laws.   Now we face a humanitarian crisis. While the President refuses to  acknowledge this dire situation, my Democratic colleagues are turning a  deaf ear by advancing two bills this week to grant blanket amnesty to  millions of illegals. Are you kidding me?   This sends the wrong message that our borders are open and that our  laws don't matter, which will only incentivize more illegal  immigration. It is time to build a wall, end policies like catch and  release, and oppose mass amnesty. We must secure our border.                            ____________________
