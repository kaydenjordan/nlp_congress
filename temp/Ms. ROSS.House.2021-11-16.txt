 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Cartwright for yielding  and for his leadership.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the Infrastructure Investment  and Jobs Act that will bring America's aging infrastructure into the  21st century.   I was honored to join Madam Speaker and our other colleagues at the  White House as the President signed this historic legislation into law.   In Congress, I am extremely proud to represent Wake County, North  Carolina, one of the fastest growing counties in the United States. We  are a powerful economic engine for our State and for our region, but,  sadly, our infrastructure has not grown with our community. We need  seamless transportation networks to connect Wake County to the rest of  the Nation--modern infrastructure that can help us bring the innovation  that happens in the Research Triangle to the country and to the world.    This historic legislation will help us, our people, get to work and  school and products from our groundbreaking companies get to markets  across America and around the globe.   In North Carolina, there are about 1,500 bridges and more than 3,000  highways in poor condition. This bill will devote $110 billion to  upgrade roads and bridges and finance other major transportation  projects.   Over the next 20 years, North Carolina's drinking water  infrastructure will require billions in additional funding.   This bill provides funds to replace lead pipes in the country and  help ensure that all of our children can enjoy clean drinking water. It  will also address the toxic threat of PFAS contamination.   This bill modernizes our Nation's electric grid to protect against  storm damage and unlock the full potential of clean energy. It also  creates jobs in the clean energy manufacturing sector, a sector where  our State is positioned to lead the Nation.   In addition, it expands broadband connectivity in underserved  communities, helping to ensure that all of our  [[Page H6307]]  students and businesses can access dependable, affordable internet.   The jobs created by this infrastructure package are jobs that cannot  be outsourced. This package will boost all of our workers, from the  folks who pave the roads to the scientists and engineers who are  designing 21st century transportation networks, more efficient water  and sewer systems, and cutting edge electrical grids.   Thanks to this package, engineering graduates from schools like North  Carolina State and graduates from Wake Tech, Shaw, and St.  Augustine's--all in my district--will help build the bridges in our  communities that one day many years from now they will proudly show  their grandchildren.   We are delivering on the President's promise to pass legislation that  improves the lives of ordinary people and creates good-paying jobs.   This bill is a testament to what we can achieve when we give  bipartisanship a chance, when we set our differences aside and commit  to the hard work of finding common ground.   This is good for North Carolina and great for the country.                                time  1715
