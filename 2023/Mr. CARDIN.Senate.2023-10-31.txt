 Mr. President, I come to the floor today in support of  Jacob Lew to be our Ambassador to Israel. We will have a chance to vote  on that in a few moments, first on cloture and then, hopefully, on the  confirmation, with the cloture being imposed.   The attack by Hamas on Israel earlier this month was heinous. It was  evil. It was indescribably brutal.   I was just in Israel with 10 Senators--5 Democrats, 5 Republicans-- and saw firsthand the scars and devastation. I saw the grief and the  shock. We were there to make it clear that Israel has the right to  defend itself; it has the obligation to defend itself.   We recognize that the ground campaign has started to eliminate Hamas.  Hamas is evil. They are equivalent to ISIS and maybe, in some cases,  worse. Israel's security depends upon the demise of Hamas, as does the  Palestinians' future in Gaza depend upon Hamas being eliminated.   We have ongoing challenges. Two hundred-plus hostages are being held  by Hamas. Their safe return is one of our highest priorities. We are  all working very hard. President Biden has made it clear with the  positioning of U.S. assets, as well as his engagement in the Middle  East to prevent the escalation of this conflict. For those enemies of  the United States and Israel trying to take advantage of the combat in  Gaza to escalate the conflict, we have to make sure that does not  happen.   We have a real challenge with the humanitarian assistance to the  Palestinians in Gaza who are trying to escape the brutality of Hamas.  We are now fortunate that we are able to start getting humanitarian  trucks into Gaza. We hope to be at about 100 trucks a day through the  Rafah gate. More is needed. We need to provide for the medical needs  and safe passage for Palestinians trying to avoid the conflict. All of  this is made much more difficult because of Hamas.  [[Page S5241]]    These challenges require a U.S. partnership. We need a confirmed  ambassador. We need to work together on operations. We need to work  together on tactics. We need to work together on strategy with Israel.  It is so much more difficult for us to be able to do that without a  confirmed ambassador in Jerusalem.   How are we going to diplomatically engage at the highest levels in  the region if we don't have a confirmed ambassador? It makes it much  more difficult. Who is going to lead our mission to help the more than  half a million American citizens who live in Israel? It is made much  more difficult without a confirmed ambassador.   I want to make it clear that our Charge d'Affaires in Jerusalem,  Stephanie Hallett, is doing a phenomenal job, as are the men and women  of our mission in Jerusalem. And they deserve our thanks, our  appreciation for being on the frontline to represent America's  interest. There is no question about their loyalty and their dedication  to the mission. The U.S. team at Mission Israel is the best in the  field, but that is no substitute for a confirmed ambassador.   Jacob Lew is eminently qualified to serve in this post. He has  extensive experience. He has the political acumen that we need for our  Ambassador at this time. He has the respect of the Israeli officials.   The Foreign Minister tweeted that they look forward to working with  Jack Lew in ``the spirit of our close cooperation and alliance.''   The Jerusalem Post said:         Jack Lew is a worthy nominee and a mensch.    Support for his nomination ranges from the Orthodox Union Advocacy  Center to the Anti-Defamation League.   Last week, he advanced out of the Foreign Relations Committee on a  bipartisan vote. I want to thank my colleagues who worked so hard to  get him through the committee.   Of course, this would not be the first time that Secretary Lew has  had the support of the Senate. He has been nominated for a number of  positions, and this body has confirmed him with overwhelming support in  the past.   Now, with Israel at war, with Hamas holding hostages in their tunnels  in Gaza, with the entire world watching, given the stakes of the  situation, given that Israel is fighting to defend itself, given that  American lives are at risk, we cannot afford any delay. Israel cannot  afford a delay.   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support cloture on Jack Lew's  nomination so we can get the confirmation vote without delay. I hope  that you will support these efforts.   I yield the floor.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, for the information of the Senate, when  the Senate resumes consideration of H.R. 4366, the following amendments  are expected to be made pending, as provided under the order of October  24: Hawley No. 1200, Cruz No. 1296, Blackburn-Warner No. 1349, and Budd  No. 1243.   I further ask unanimous consent that there be up to 10 minutes  debate, equally divided, prior to the vote on amendment No. 1296, with  all previous provisions remaining in effect.    Mr. President, for the information of the Senate,  Senators should expect four rollcall votes beginning at 2:30 p.m.  today.   I ask unanimous consent that the vote scheduled for 11:30 begin  immediately.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, a little over a week ago, I was in Israel  with 10 U.S. Senators meeting with the Israeli leadership. I must tell  you, they are very much looking forward to having a confirmed  ambassador from the United States in Jerusalem to help in regard to the  challenges they are now facing as a result of Hamas's terrorist attack  in Israel. And they are very much looking forward to Jack Lew being  that ambassador. We heard that directly.   His nomination has been welcomed by the Israelis, including Israel's  Foreign Minister, who said he looks forward to working with him. The  former Israeli Ambassador to the United States wrote that Lew is ``a  true statesman, a passionate Jew and a mensch in every sense of the  word.'' He has the support of the Jerusalem Post, the Orthodox Union  Advocacy Center, the Anti-Defamation League. The list goes on and on  and on. Why? Because he is so well qualified for this position. He has  been confirmed by the Senate as a former Secretary of Treasury, as a  Deputy Secretary of State, as an OMB Director. And the list goes on and  on and on. He was confirmed by an overwhelming majority. It gives us  the person as our representative to Israel who has the gravitas to  stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel as the United States partners in  the challenges that they are facing today.   So there is, to me, no question about his qualifications, no question  about his presence being welcomed by our Israeli friends, no question  about his knowledge and commitment to these issues. He has worked  almost his entire life, in part, to strengthen the U.S.-Israel  partnership. He knows the values. He testified to that during this  confirmation hearing. And he testified in regard to the issues that my  Republican friends are raising, the issues of whether he was forthright  with Congress--and he was.   He pointed out that in regard to opening up the banking for Iran, it  was to comply with the JCPOA that was negotiated by the Obama  administration and which the Republicans were opposed to. And I opposed  that agreement.   I helped work with Senator Corker, then chairman of the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee--I was ranking Democrat at the time--to  develop a process where we would not be surprised by these negotiations  and that we would have input into these negotiations. That process  passed the Senate by a near-unanimous vote.   As part of that process, we had indepth discussions with the Obama  administration, including Secretary Lew, including Secretary Moniz, and  others, who shared with us exactly what was being negotiated. We knew  that there was going to be a transfer of funds in regards to the JCPOA.  We recognized that the banking system would be open for that limited  purpose.   That is not misleading us. It is telling us exactly what we knew was  going to happen before we took it up under the review statute. It is  just not right to say he misled us. He did not. The report they are  referring to was a partisan report issued by the Republicans. There is  a reason why it was not bipartisan. They were just trying to double  down on their opposition to the JCPOA.   Israel needs a strong U.S. Ambassador who will represent America and  be their partner in taking on one of the greatest struggles in their  history--the terrorist attack by Hamas that they did on October 7. We  need a confirmed ambassador who is knowledgeable as to how they could  represent over half a  [[Page S5244]]  million Americans who are currently in Israel. We need Jack Lew's  expertise to help us get the hostages back safely on the ground in  Israel.   I want to thank Secretary Lew for being willing at this time, at this  critical moment, to serve his country in this critically important  position, and I would hope my colleagues would vote for his  confirmation, recognizing that we could not have a more qualified  individual to represent America as our Ambassador to Israel.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I oppose the Ernst telework amendment  because, in general, it imposes an overly burdensome reporting  requirement for Agencies--without providing additional resources--both  because of the very short time allotted--30 days--and the vague  language used to outline the reporting requirements. The amendment  includes multiple, undefined terms, some of which do not appear in  title 5--for example, ``majority of work hours''. Further, there are no  parameters outlining the period of time that should be represented in  the data being reported. As such, Agencies would have significant  challenges defining and providing what data is actually being sought.   This reporting requirement also does not take into consideration the  state of the workforce as some Agencies have a substantial number of  staff that do not report to a ``building'' on a routine basis because  of the nature of their mission, such as some law enforcement officers  and those who work in disaster relief. Again, per the above comment,  many employees legitimately reporting to and performing routine work  will not be captured, skewing data, and generating lower counts.  Additionally, there are more technical challenges with the amendment  language. For example, subsection (b)(8) does not describe an Agency's  authority in 5 CFR 531.605(d)(2) correctly.   To summarize, the vague nature of this language and the lack of  context and consideration for the varying nature of positions across  the workforce would result in reports that do not accurately convey the  nature of telework and remote work across the Federal Government.   I received comments from three of the largest Federal employee unions  opposing the Ernst amendment. Here is what I heard from the  International Federal of Professional and Technical Engineers, IFPTE:         This amendment seems duplicative in some parts and counter       to what is required by the Telework Enhancement Act of 2010.       It asks agencies to consider and report actions that, if       taken, would require agencies to violate current legal       standards and regulations. The Telework Enhancement Act of       2010 also requires agencies to design telework programs that       ``do not diminish employee performance or agency       operations.'' By definition, agencies (and unions, when       bargained) must create programs that work for employees and       agencies. Not working on-site does not mean not working.        (b)(1) is highly burdensome for agencies--For employees       with management-approved telework agreements, the Office of       Personnel Management (OPM) defines the official worksite/      official duty station (ODS) as the regular work location to       which they are assigned as long as the employee is reporting       ``on a regular and recurring basis'' to that worksite.       Regular and recurring is defined as at least twice/pay       period. So (b)(1) is highly burdensome for agencies and asks       agencies to guess and estimate whether legal teleworking       ("majority of their working hours'') in the amendment is       greater than two days per pay period).        Agencies are not legally able to carry out the cost savings       in (b)(2) and nothing is  [[Page S5249]]       going to be achieved by the audit in (b)(3). For example, if       an agency took action to change the ODS for an employee who       teleworks six days per pay period, they would violate OPM       regulations. If the agency reduced an employee's salary based       on this, the agency would be liable for back pay and       attorney's fees for each employee who reported at least twice       per pay period per OPM regulations but had their ODS changed.       Also, emergency conditions provide exceptions to all of this       (the agency head can take any actions necessary for       emergencies) so it is not relevant to look at periods under       the COVID-19 health and national emergencies.        The premise of (b)(7) also doesn't make much sense.       Employees are not in charge; management is, so employees do       not need to be ``enticed'' to the office, they are directed       to do so in concert with existing policies.        Reporting in (b)(7)-(10) may have a chilling effect on       telework for employees with disabilities. Many federal       employees with disabilities are legally entitled to telework       as a reasonable accommodation. In many agencies, federal       employees who have maximum telework have difficult personal       situations and disabilities and it is often the only way they       can remain in federal service.        Evaluation of environmental concerns related to       underutilized space in (b)(11) needs to be balanced. Any       evaluation of telework and space utilization needs to       consider the increased environmental burden that commuting       causes, especially in vehicles with a single occupant.       Further, many federal office spaces and worksites have better       space utilization due to telework. For example, IFPTE members       working for Navy shipyards have more productive office       workstations when on-site and when working from home, whereas       prior to the current telework levels, these employees were in       uncomfortably tight cubicles and constrained office spaces.    Here is what I heard from the National Treasury Employees Union,  NTEU:         The Ernst amendment seeks to obstruct well developed       federal telework programs by using a self-crafted standard       contrary to law to determine an employee's post of duty.       Telework and remote work initiatives have saved millions in       taxpayer dollars and improved productivity in part by better       recruitment and retention. Some employees now work remotely       full time following a management determination that the       nature of the work allows for this. These employees receive       locality pay based on the location of their home office. As       federal offices tend to be in high-cost central urban       centers, these moves generally result in a savings to       agencies.        Teleworking employees are different than remote workers and       must, by law, report to their office at least two days per       pay period. Travel to and from the office is considered the       employee's normal commute with no travel expense obligations       by the agency since their official post of duty is their       office, not their home, and they do in fact report to that       office. Even if they do live outside of the locality pay area       it is not fraud, it is just a long commute. The reporting in       the amendment also fails to contemplate that many employees       work away from the office because of work-related travel that       is required by their job (e.g., bank examiners, food and drug       inspectors, fraud monitors, etc.).    And finally, this is what I heard from the American Federation of  Government Employees, AFGE:         Please oppose the amendment offered by Sen. Joni Ernst.       This amendment would require extensive new reporting from       federal agencies, on an unrealistic 30-day timetable,       concerning the telework and remote work activities of       hundreds of thousands of federal employees. As the nation's       largest employer, the federal government is a vast and       complex enterprise with millions of employees performing work       at offices, remote work sites, telework centers, and in some       cases from their homes. Their pay (including locality pay) is       governed by longstanding rules promulgated by the Office of       Personnel Management (OPM). Senator Ernst has publicly and       without evidence accused federal agencies and employees of       ``fraud'' in how locality pay is provided for teleworking       employees.        AFGE supports telework and remote work programs where       appropriate, though the majority of our members--who include       healthcare workers, law enforcement officers, border patrol       agents, and transportation security officers--never       teleworked even during the height of the pandemic. We support       programs to evaluate and measure the effectiveness of       telework and remote work arrangements, and we believe such       efforts will show that these workplace flexibilities are       critical for maintaining a high-performing federal workforce       that can compete with the private sector for the best talent.        The Ernst amendment duplicates almost verbatim a series of       recent requests from Senator Ernst to dozens of agency       inspectors general (OIG) to report on the same questions.       These OIG requests were made less than three weeks ago.       Moreover, the requests were premised in part on a single       report of an alleged poor performer at the U.S. Patent &       Trademark Office that occurred in 2014, nearly a decade ago.       Furthermore, the amendment conflates and confuses remote       work, where an employee is assigned full-time to a remote       duty station that may be far from agency offices, with       telework, where under existing OPM rules employees must       report to an office twice per pay period. In either case,       existing rules govern locality pay and there is no evidence       of widespread misapplication of these rules.    It is for all of these reasons that I oppose the Ernst amendment.
