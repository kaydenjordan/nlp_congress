 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Evans for yielding, for  that gracious introduction, but, more importantly, for his magnificent  leadership. He has come to Congress hitting the ground running, and it  truly has been and is in the spirit of Dr. King, so I thank the  gentleman very much.   And to our chair, Congressman Cedric Richmond, I want to thank him  for his steady leadership--and it is steady--of our caucus and for  helping us to stay focused on this Special Order on the evenings which  we do these to honor the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who was  and is our drum major for justice.   To Congressman John Lewis, I just have to say to him that I owe him a  debt of gratitude. I would not be here if it were not for him.   And I want to say, on behalf of my young people at the Martin Luther  King Jr. Freedom Center who have a chance to be with him every year-- now it has been about 17 years--how much he and Congresswoman Terri  Sewell--how much they have touched their lives and have turned their  lives around, and how they understand now what fighting for justice and  peace really means by being part of their efforts and by their  mentoring them and teaching them that the beloved community is not only  a dream but can be real. So I thank Congressman Lewis so much. It is an  honor to know the gentleman and to serve with him.   This year, as we remember the man in the movement that transformed  really the soul of America, it is really important that we honor the  fullness of Dr. King's dream. So while we remember Dr. King's birthday  this month, we also are reminded that it was 50 years ago, on April 4,  that he lost his life to an assassin's bullet.   Dr. King was a crusader for voting rights and peace, but he was also  a warrior for economic justice and ending poverty. In fact, one of Dr.  King's most memorable speeches, of course, ``I've Been to the  Mountaintop,'' it was given in Memphis, Tennessee, at a time when Dr.  King was determined to transform the civil rights movement into an  intersectional economic justice revolution.   A few months before his death, two young African-American workers  were crushed to death by a faulty truck in Memphis. The American  Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFSCME, union  members went on strike, and Dr. King was right there with them lending  his support.   In a speech to the sanitation workers on strike, Dr. King explained  why he was there. He said: ``Now, our struggle is for genuine equality,  which means economic equality.'' Dr. King said that to thousands  gathered at Mason Temple. He said: ``For we know that it isn't enough  to integrate lunch counters. What does it profit a man to be able to  eat at an integrated lunch counter if he doesn't earn enough money to  buy a hamburger . . . ?''   Dr. King had come to signal the dawn of a new era in the struggle. He  was there to stand with workers who were sick and tired of low wages,  unsafe working conditions, and the city's refusal to recognize their  union. He was there because he believed that labor rights, civil  rights, and human rights are one and the same. He was there because he  understood the simple truth that there can be no racial justice without  economic justice.   Tragically, while fighting to secure the American Dream for all  Americans, Dr. King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Now, that was a  day that changed my life. Congresswoman Jackson Lee mentioned where she  was. We all remember that moment. I was living in San Jose, California,  and was commuting to San Francisco, about an hour away by train. I  returned that evening. My car was parked in the train's parking lot. I  got off the train, turned on the radio, and the news came through that  Dr. King had been killed.   Well, I sat in my car for I don't know how long, and I cried. I was  shocked like everyone, saddened, and angry. But I was also motivated to  fight for the dream that Dr. King envisioned. My job, I quit my job. At  that moment, I knew that I had to do something. So I became involved as  a community worker with Bobby Seale and the Black Panther Party. But it  was Dr. King's assassination that catapulted me into the movement.  [[Page H14]]    I was determined to prove that even though the assassin killed the  dreamer, he could not kill the dream. Right now in this country, the  work that Dr. King went to Memphis to achieve, that work remains  unfinished, which is what we intend to complete. Forty-seven million  Americans remain locked in poverty. Discrimination and institutional  racism continue to hold livable wages hostage, and the economic wealth  divide, it grows deeper every day in urban and in rural communities.   Now, I represent the 13th Congressional District of California, a  great district where there is an explosion of wealth in the bay area,  which has recently experienced also a spike in median household income.                                time  2000    It is a hub of innovation and creativity, yet, in many ways, it is a  tale of two cities. Black households in my district have been locked  out of this explosion of wealth. According to the Census Bureau, the  median income in the bay area jumped by 9 percent while the median  income for Black households inched up just 2 percent.   It is not just wealth inequality. Twenty-three percent of Black  households are poor, and 43 percent of Black children in my district  are considered poor in Oakland. These numbers have remained stagnant  year after year after year. This is unacceptable.   It is not just my district that experiences this wealth divide.  Recent studies show that if trends persist, median Black household  wealth could hit zero by 2053.   This alarming possibility makes one thing clear: the work to achieve  Dr. King's dream must continue, and members of the Congressional Black  Caucus tirelessly continue to work both inside this Congress and in our  communities because there is still much that we must overcome.   As the conscience of the Congress, the Congressional Black Caucus  fights every day to dismantle barriers that prevent low-income people,  poor people, and people of color from having a fair shot at the  American Dream. Dr. King's legacy can be found in our efforts to give  communities of color, struggling families, and women a fair shot at  improving their basic living standards.   There are many bills: Congressman Bobby Scott's bill to raise the  minimum wage to $15 an hour, and Congresswoman Alma Adams' Closing the  Meal Gap Act. There are many bills that many members of the  Congressional Black Caucus really are championing every single day to  ensure that Dr. King's life will be remembered, that his death will not  overshadow his life, and that his legacy of fighting, as Dr. King said,  to make the promises of democracy real will live on for generations to  come.
