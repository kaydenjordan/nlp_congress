 Mr. President, this morning, Americans woke up to a  picture of a 25-year-old father lying facedown, holding his infant  daughter. They both drowned crossing the Rio Grande River. The border  policies implemented by this administration have life or death  consequences. Congress should be doing everything in its power to make  sure that our southern border is safe and secure and that asylum  seekers are treated with dignity and respect.   I share the horror of my constituents in Maryland about the squalid  and inhumane conditions in which children are being held at the border.  We have an obligation to provide resources to ensure the safety of  these children, but this administration has demonstrated only  callousness towards migrants seeking asylum at our border, and we have  an obligation as a coequal branch of government with the power of the  purse to ensure that the resources we provide are spent responsibly and  deliver real care. While I appreciate the guardrails that Senators  Leahy and Shelby negotiated in this bill, I believe that the House- passed package has stronger restrictions that will better protect  children and families at the border.   Also, as I said to my colleagues when we marked up this bill, I have  serious concerns with this administration's repeated practice of  transferring funding from the purpose that we appropriate to meet its  own ends. Today, a group of constituents stopped by my office seeking  reassurance that this funding would not be used for interior  enforcement. They were understandably fearful of the President's  threats of widespread raids and mass deportations. While this bill  prohibits transfers within DHS on this supplemental funding, I cannot  fully reassure my constituents because the administration could still  transfer other FY19 funds to support its draconian immigration agenda.   I have visited the border, and I have seen the tragedy the  President's policies have created there. His family separation policy  is a dark mark on our Nation's history. His Justice Department has  argued that toothbrushes, soap, and even sleep are not necessary for  the well-being of children. It is clear that Congress cannot simply  trust this administration to do the right thing.   I urge my colleagues to work to include the stronger House-passed  restrictions to protect children's safety and to strengthen  restrictions on reprogramming as we continue our appropriations  process.                            ____________________
