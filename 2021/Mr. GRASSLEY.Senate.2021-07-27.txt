 Madam President, because of the increase in  hospitalizations because of the Delta variant of the virus, we are told  that the CDC will soon be requiring, in about half the counties of the  country, masks and other restrictions to prevent the spread of the  virus.   They say they are doing it because of the science. We are told they  will not show us the data. The very essence of science is peer review,  and pity anybody who wants to analyze it. In America, the public's  business ought to be public.   If we can't get this data, what the taxpayers are paying for and  public policy is being made on, it seems to me that principle--that the  public's business is not really public. And when people are able to  cover up things and make policy decisions that are not public and  transparent, it obviously brings about less accountability.   So let's have that data. We want to know why you are requiring masks  again.
