 Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member from Ohio, Mr.  Jordan, for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose H.R. 6.   Under the leadership of President Trump, illegal border crossings  dropped dramatically, and our border was secured.   Since taking office, President Biden has halted construction of our  border wall, attempted a moratorium on deportations, and, in so doing,  created significant incentives for illegal immigration.   In February, over 100,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended at our  southern border, three times the number in the same month the year  previous.   Speaking to Border Patrol agents, Republicans and Democrats are told  the same thing: This is a humanitarian crisis. Violent cartels are  taking advantage of innocent people to smuggle drugs into our country.   Yet, the Biden administration placed a gag order on CBP agents. What  is going on here? Are we going to face the problem, or are we going to  hide it with gag orders?   Now Democrats are introducing H.R. 6, which only exacerbates the  Biden policies at the border by creating the incentive of amnesty with  no discussion of border security.   Madam Speaker, it is time for the House to wake up. This is  disastrous policy, and it is in full view. There is no hiding from it.  We should oppose H.R. 6 on humanitarian grounds.
