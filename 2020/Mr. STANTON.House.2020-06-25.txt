 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the George  Floyd Justice in Policing Act.   I want to thank Chairman Nadler and Congresswoman Bass for their  unwavering leadership on this historic legislation.   Black lives matter. George Floyd was murdered 1 month ago today. This  month has been a painful and reflective period for our Nation, and the  House has taken an essential step to heal that pain with this bill.   Today, we vote on long overdue legislation to bring greater  accountability and transparency into policing and to help make everyone  more safe. The specific measures included in this bill, from banning  chokeholds and no-knock warrants to eliminating qualified immunity, are  critical steps to improve policing practices. It includes reforms to  combat racial profiling and right injustices that exist in America  today.   The ability to end racism in our country is beyond the reach of  Congress. We don't have the power to change every heart and mind, but  we do have the power to change the law, to make it more just, and to  combat structural racism through measurable, meaningful reforms.   Change starts here today.
