 Mr. Speaker, I will talk a little bit about some concerns  and, generally, about the sanctity of human life and the unborn.   I rise today in memory of the over 60 million babies who have been  killed through abortion since the Supreme Court's disastrous decision  Roe v. Wade. As a nation, we have taken extraordinary steps to protect  public health and save lives amid the coronavirus outbreak, but there  is a huge contradiction when it comes to protecting human life in the  womb.   Protecting all human life should be a bipartisan issue. Yet, today,  President Biden is driving policies like taxpayer funding of abortion  and naming pro-abortion extremist Xavier Becerra as the Health and  Human Services Secretary.   As recently as 2012, President Biden restated his long-held view that  human life begins at conception. He said: ``With regard to abortion, I  accept my church's position that life begins at conception.''   Well, it is not only a religious belief, but it is also a scientific  fact that human life begins at conception. Thanks to modern scientific  advancements, we now can visually see and know the personhood of  preborn children.   Doctors can operate on babies in the womb to save their lives. We  know a preborn baby's heart starts to beat at about 6 weeks. Nails  begin to form at 10 weeks, and babies have fingerprints by 13 weeks.   It is time to give a voice to the voiceless. It is time for the law  to acknowledge the dignity of the preborn babies who are the most  helpless among us.   I urge my fellow Members of Congress to join me in defense of all  human life, standing up for all human life. I urge President Biden to  actually enact his personally held views that he acknowledges that it  begins at conception. I think we actually all know that. It is a  scientific fact.   The reconciliation bill that is coming up, there are pro-life  concerns in this bill. For starters, it fails to include the  traditional what we call the high protections. That is a longstanding  policy in Congress that your taxpayer dollars do not go for abortions.  This bill waives that. It enables taxpayer funding of abortion.   There are more than $414 billion taxpayer dollars, supposedly  intended for COVID-19 relief, that have no Hyde protections.   So we are talking a lot about the cancel culture. You have, on the  one hand, a division in this country. Many of us believe it is the  taking of a human life, it is killing, it is murder; and we object to  that. But instead of respecting our views, you actually want to take  money from us through taxes and use our actual dollars to kill  children. If you are going to talk about cancel culture, at least  respect the differences of opinion.   But this bill doesn't do that. This bill we are going to vote on this  week doesn't do that. It gets rid of the high protections. It is  taxpayer-funded abortions. It also requires taxpayers to subsidize  health plans that potentially cover elective abortions.                                National Debt     Mr. Speaker, now I am going to change topics to something  that is not talked about enough in this Congress, and that is spending.  We talk a lot about these bills and how much we are going to spend on  this group and spend on that group, and we are going to give money to  this and give money to that.    Federal debt has increased sharply. I have this beautiful  chart here starting in 1790, the first budget in our country right  after the Revolutionary War, and you can see the national debt. This is  done in a fair way. It is debt to the gross domestic product. So it is  a percentage of the domestic product in debt.   And you can see, in 1790, the mark where it was. We just finished the  Civil War. So we owed some money to the soldiers. We paid that off in  the next 40 years up until the Civil War. And in the Civil War there  was a little bit of debt, and it goes back down again. And you can see  it is kind of steadily up and down a bit. World War II, okay. World War  II, again, debt-to-gross-domestic-product. We were just trying to  survive there, and the debt is back down again.   But when you get to where we are today, things have gone completely  out of control. The Congressional Budget Office estimates an additional  $104 trillion will be added by 2050. The Congressional Budget Office  forecasted debt would rise 200 percent. Today, as I stand here right  now, we have $27.9 trillion in national debt.   $27.9 trillion, what is that to you? That is $84,000.  [[Page H710]]    That is actually a little more than $84,000 of debt to every American  citizen right here today.   Now, on this day 1 year ago, in 2020, the U.S. national debt was  $23.4 trillion, that was $72,309 in debt per person. We have actually  borrowed $10,000 per person in 1 year. I mean, that is out of control.   And when you hear about these bills--I plan to vote against this one  tomorrow; I think many of us do--they say, oh, we are going to give  this and give that.   No. They are taking it from you. This is debt that your children will  have to pay.   This $2 trillion--nearly $2 trillion spending package is full of  liberal priorities. We are going to grow our debt to $29 trillion. That  is even more debt owed per citizen.   There is a lot of misinformation about where the debt is going. The  top two countries we owe the debt to are China and Japan, not actually  our friends. We are at global competition with China all the time. They  are holding a lot of the debt. We owe China over $1 trillion and we owe  Japan over $1 trillion.   The people who are loaning us the money we have to pay back are not  necessarily people who have our best interest at heart. Brazil, we owe  $258 billion. India, we owe $216 billion. And the list goes on the debt  that is owed to foreign countries.   The national debt was $5.6 trillion in 2000. It increased. Under  Obama, it actually doubled. Since the 8 years Obama was President, we  doubled our national debt. And we are adding another--projected here--a  completely out of control debt-to-GDP ratio.   So I urge my colleagues to consider the future. Don't buy into the-- the government has no money it doesn't take from you that you are going  to have to pay back. We need to be judicious with these dollars, and  most of this is not going to coronavirus relief anyway.    I would agree. And I would add that 27 percent of this  bill, over $510 billion goes to State and local governments. So the  taxpayers of my State of West Virginia and your State of Texas and  other States are literally bailing out States that have failed to  manage their own budgets.   West Virginia taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for New York and  Illinois and California that are completely out of control in their  spending. $510 billion is going to bail out these State and local  governments. It is not a good use of taxpayer dollars.
