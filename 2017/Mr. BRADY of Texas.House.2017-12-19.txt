 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 667, I  call up the conference report on the bill (H.R. 1) to provide for  reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution  on the budget for fiscal year 2018, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 667, the  conference report is considered read.   (For conference report and statement, see proceedings of the House of  December 15, 2017, at page H9943.)   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady) and the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill currently  under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill currently  under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Today, we are delivering on our tax reform promise to the American  people. For the first time in over three decades, we are delivering a  new Tax Code that provides more jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger  paychecks to Americans across the country.   With this bill, a middle-income family of four earning $73,000 a year  will see a tax cut of over $2,000. Our local job creators will see the  lowest tax rates in modern history so they can invest more in their  workers and in their futures. And our businesses will finally have a  Tax Code that helps them compete and win anywhere in the world,  especially here at home.   This is our moment to make history, to make good on our promise, and  to make tax reform a reality for the first time in 31 years.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Nunes).

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from California (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader of the House.   Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I want to thank the  gentleman.   Today, we will take a vote that every Member on this floor will  remember. The country will remember. Then next year, when people check  their checks and realize they have more money, they are going to  remember who voted for status quo and who voted to make America's  comeback.   I want to thank the chairman, Kevin Brady, for that work.   Now, Mr. Speaker, a month ago, when the House passed an earlier  version of this bill, I said that, for all the jobless, for everyone  who hasn't gotten a raise in years, for the parents, for the small- business owners, and for anyone who ever dreamed of being that  entrepreneur and a small-business owner, we heard you. This bill is the  start of their comeback, and when they win, well, that is the start of  America's comeback.   Our country has faced some tough times. I don't have to tell you  about that. And for too long, year after year, more and more Americans  gave up hope. They were out of work. Or maybe they had a job, but they  could not see past the next month or even the next week. They watched  factories and businesses close up shop and move out, even moving out of  the country.   Nobody wants to see their communities hollow out. Nobody wants to  feel like they live in a nation in decline. That is not who Americans  are. Frankly, Mr. Speaker, we are not a country that gives up on hope.  This legislation and the Republican Party's entire economic plan, they  are giving people hope.   You can see it in the stock market. For every American who vests  their retirement in a 401(k), 84 times it has set a new record since  last year's election alone.   You can see it in companies like Broadcom. You know, Broadcom was a  company created in America, but they are not domiciled here today. They  moved to Singapore simply over our Tax Code.   So for those who want the status quo and want to keep Broadcom in  another country, go ahead and vote ``no.'' For those who believe in the  hope of this country, even greater, looking at this bill, Broadcom said  they are coming back to America.   Mr. Speaker, you know what that means? $20 billion in revenue in just  a year. That means $3 billion every year invested in R&D $6 billion  every year invested in manufacturing. Those are jobs we all dream  about, and the action of this bill is making it happen.   You can see it in the faces of families who learn that next year  thousands of dollars that they earn won't go straight to Washington; it  will actually stay right at home. And this is all in an environment of  disinformation and fear-mongering. I mean, I have seen what has been  said, and, to me, it is absurd.   Mr. Speaker, Leader Pelosi said that this bill was, and I quote,  ``Armageddon'' and ``the end of the world.'' Now, Mr. Speaker, I  listened a great deal to what my counterpart on the other side, the  minority leader, has said, and I have read when The Washington Post  analyzed what she had said.   Now, when you say something that could be a little off and don't have  all the information, they have this rating for you. She has had a  rating on this. She did not get one Pinocchio. She did not even get  two. She didn't even get the extreme of three. She got the most  Pinocchios you can say when it is totally false, four, for her  conversation about this bill.   Mr. Speaker, in such times when the other side will say anything to  win their political game, I recommend that folks actually look at the  bill: doubling the standard deduction; lowering rates; simplifying the  Code so you don't spend weeks, you spend minutes; doubling the child  tax credit; ending the individual mandate; lowering taxes on small  businesses to the lowest it has been in 40 years; creating incentives  for business to invest and hire. That is not a recipe for Armageddon.  That is hope for a nation to come back.   The American people see through all this rhetoric, and they are going  to feel it next year when they check their paychecks and they see they  keep more money because of the vote today. They are going to feel it  next year and the years after and when they get that raise they have  been waiting for. They are going to feel it more and more as companies  announce coming back home. They are bringing jobs right back to the  USA. They are going to feel it when we start looking to the future not  with fear, but with hope.   I won't accept the status quo. But there will be some in this body  who will vote for the status quo. I won't accept failure.   Now, I do not believe anybody in this body was elected to preside  over America's decline. I recently was overseas, and I was sitting at a  dinner table with some elected leaders from other countries, some  Americans who were working in other countries, and I asked them: What  is the impression of what is happening in America today? I thought the  reports I would get would be a little different.   Do you know what they said to me? They said: America is back. You are  now tackling big items again. Not only are you going to lead your own  country, but you will help, again, lead the world. They were fearful of  the competition of rising America one more time.   So don't vote for the status quo. Vote for a tax cut. Vote for  reform. Don't vote because some leader whipped you and intimidated you.  Vote for your constituents. Vote for your country, and vote to raise  the paychecks of America.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Missouri (Mr. Smith), the secretary of the Republican Conference.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Missouri (Mr. Smith), the secretary of the Republican Conference.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Bishop).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from California (Mr. McClintock).   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I opposed the original House bill  because it severely limited or abolished broad-based deductions,  resulting in higher taxes for many families in high-tax, high-cost  States like California.   Thanks to Chairman Brady's leadership, this bill has largely  addressed these objections and, in combination with much lower rates,  it assures that nearly every California taxpayer will pay lower taxes.  More important still is the higher wages and better jobs it means for  all Americans.   Last Friday, I toured a local company that makes the active  ingredient for certain drugs, yet the actual medicine is not produced  here. It is produced in Ireland.                   Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has detected a disturbance in the  gallery in contravention of the law and against the rules of the House.   The Sergeant at Arms will identify the person or persons responsible  and have them escorted from the House Chamber.   The gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) is recognized for his  remaining 20 seconds.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I was saying that the actual medicine,  the ingredient is produced here, but the actual medicine is produced in  Ireland, solely because of our uncompetitive corporate tax.   Because of this tax reform, the company plans to grow dramatically  here at home, employing hundreds of new workers. That is what the  Democrats mean by tax breaks for the wealthy.   The proof of these policies will come over the next year, and every  American will be able to decide for themselves if they are better off  because of it. I am now highly confident their answer is going to be a  resounding ``yes.''    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, there is only one fundamental question today: Who gets  to decide? When Americans work hard for their money, who gets to decide  what you do with it? Is it you? Or is it some nameless, faceless  government worker here in Washington?   When a family with young children is working feverishly to fund their  kids' future, who gets to decide how they spend their money: them or  Washington?   The single mom fighting every day trying to get by and give a good  life to her daughter, who decrees where her money goes?   When a Main Street businessowner works late into the night and  through the weekend, risking every penny they own to reach their dream,  who gets that meager profit each day? Does it go to you, who earned it,  exhausted at the end of a long day? Or is it grabbed by a Federal  Government who doesn't even know your name except on April 15?   Our communities have watched their companies, jobs, and futures move  overseas for too long. Our local businesses have been fighting other  countries with one hand tied behind their back from an old, outdated  Tax Code. They deserve a new Tax Code that allows them to compete and  win anywhere in the world, especially here at home.   When they compete and win, who decides where that money goes?   Today, Washington says spend it overseas. Our new Tax Code says bring  it home, spend it here in America to grow our jobs, our paychecks, our  communities. That is why this moment is so important.   Opponents of this tax bill don't really worry about tax cuts for the  rich. They worry about tax cuts for you because if you spend your  money, they can't. If you have the first claim over your earnings, they  no longer do. And if your dreams come before theirs, everything in  Washington changes, everything.   Given a choice between the Federal Government and you, we choose you,  the hardworking American taxpayers. We choose you, the only special  interest that truly matters.   Americans deserve a Tax Code for a new era of American prosperity. We  deliver on that promise because it is your money.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their  remarks to the Chair.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), who has devoted his life to this moment and  tax reform, our Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, let's pass this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Budget Committee, I  rise in strong and unyielding opposition to the Conference Report for  H.R. 1, the so-called ``Tax Cut and Jobs Act,'' which more accurately  should be called the ``Republican Tax Scam Act.''   With this Conference Report House and Senate Republicans have pulled  off a near-impossible feat: they have taken a bad bill and made it  worse, much worse.   I oppose this cruel and immoral $1.7 trillion tax giveaway to wealthy  corporations and the top one percent because it raises taxes on poor,  working, and middle class families; explodes the deficit by adding an  additional $2.2 trillion over ten years; and will require an estimated  $5.4 trillion cut in funding for the programs ordinary Americans depend  on for health security, educational opportunity, and economic progress.   Mr. Speaker, Americans are not fooled; they know trickle-down  economics has never worked, and they see right through this phony tax  plan and recognize it for the scam that it is.   That is why Americans reject this Republican tax giveaway by an  overwhelming 2:1 margin.   Here are just a few of the myriad reasons why this Republican Tax  Scam is by far the most unpopular tax measure ever considered by the  Congress:   1. Raises taxes on 86 million middle class families;   2. Gives 83 percent of the tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent and  explodes deficit by $1.7 trillion;   3. Gives new tax breaks to corporations shipping American jobs  overseas which will eliminate jobs and drive down American wages and  salaries.   4. The $1.5 trillion deficit that will be created by the GOP Tax Scam  will be used by the Republicans to justify devastating cuts in Medicare  and Medicaid.   This Republican tax plan is even more toxic to my constituents in the  Eighteenth Congressional District of Texas.   Mr. Speaker, as you may know, my constituents and others in Texas are  still struggling to recover from the devastation caused by Hurricane  Harvey, the worst storm ever to make landfall in the continental United  States.   And by margins exceeding 90 percent, they reject:   1. Any cuts to Medicare or Medicaid to finance tax cuts for wealthy  corporations and the top 1 percent;   2. Eliminating the mortgage interest deduction;   3. Eliminating the deductibility of state and local taxes;   4. Eliminating existing deductions for student loan interest or  making taxable college endowment funds or college fellowships expenses.   Mr. Speaker, my constituents, and Americans across the country,  oppose this unfair Republican tax giveaway because nearly half of the  $1.7 trillion tax cut goes to just the top one percent.   In fact, the average annual tax cut for the top one-tenth of one  percent is $320,000; for the top one percent it is $62,000, and for  those earning $1 million a year it is $68,000.   Nearly 25 percent of the tax cut goes to households in just the top  one-tenth of one percent, who make at least $5 million a year (2027).   While super-wealthy corporations and individuals are reaping  windfalls, millions of middle-class and working families will see their  taxes go up:   1. 13 million households face a tax increase next year.   2. 45 million households face a tax increase in 2027.   3. 29 million households (21 percent) earning less than $100,000 a  year see a tax increase.   On average, families earning up to $86,000 annually would see a $794  increase in their tax liability, a significant burden on families  struggling to afford child care and balance their checkbook.   It is shocking, but not surprising, that under this Republican tax  scam, the total value of tax cuts for just the top one percent is more  than the entire tax cut for the lower 95 percent of earners.   Put another way, those earning more than $912,000 a year will get  more in tax cuts than 180 million households combined.   The core of this Republican tax scheme is a massive tax cut from 35  percent to 20 percent for corporations, but that is not the only way  that the wealthy are rewarded.   The massive tax cuts for corporations are permanent but temporary for  working and middle-class families.   Another immoral aspect of this terrible tax scam is that it abandons  families that face natural disasters or high medical costs by repealing  deductions for casualty losses and medical expenses.   Mr. Speaker, in what universe does it make any sense to eliminate, as  this bill would, a deduction for:  [[Page H10213]]    1. teachers who purchase supplies for their classroom;   2. moving expenses to take a new job and taxes employer-provided  moving expenses; or   3. dependent care assistance, making it harder for families to afford  day care, nursery school, or care for aging parents?   This Republican tax scam jeopardizes American innovation and  competitiveness by eliminating the deduction for student loan interest,  which affects 12 million borrowers, and cuts total education assistance  by more than $64 billion.   Under the extraordinary leadership of President Obama and the  determined efforts of ordinary Americans, we pulled our way out from  under the worst of the foreclosure crisis when the housing bubble burst  in 2007.   Inexplicably, Republicans are now championing a tax scheme that will  make the homes of average Americans less valuable because deductions  for mortgage interest and property taxes are much less valuable than  under current law.   A tax plan that reduces home values, as this one does, puts pressure  on states and towns to collect revenues they depend on to fund schools,  roads, and vital public resources.   Mr. Speaker, an estimated 2.8 million Texas households deduct state  and local taxes with an average deduction of $7,823 in 2015.   But this is not the end of the bad news that will be delivered were  this tax scam to become law, not by a long shot.   The proposed elimination of the personal exemption will harm millions  of Texans by taking away the $4,050 deduction for each taxpayer and  claimed dependent; in 2015, roughly 9.3 million dependent exemptions  were claimed in the Lone Star State.   Equally terrible is that this Republican tax scam drastically reduces  the Earned Income Tax Credit, which encourages work for 2.7 million  low-income individuals in Texas, helping them make ends meet with an  average credit of $2,689.   The EITC and the Child Tax Credit lift about 1.2 million Texans,  including 663,000 children, out of poverty each year.   So to achieve their goal of giving more and more to the haves and the  ``have mores,'' our Republican friends are willing to betray seniors,  children, the most vulnerable and needy, and working and middle-class  families.   The $5.4 trillion cuts in program investments that will be required  to pay for this tax giveaway to wealthy corporations and individuals  will fall most heavily on low-income families, -students struggling to  afford college, seniors, and persons with disabilities.   America will not be made great by financing a $1.7 trillion tax cut  for the rich by stealing $1.8 trillion from Medicare and Medicaid,  abandoning seniors and families in need, depriving students of  realizing a dream to attend college without drowning in debt, or  disinvesting in the working families.   America will not be positioned to compete and win in the global,  interconnected, and digital economy by slashing funding for scientific  research, the arts and humanities, job retraining, and clean energy  just to pay for a tax cut to corporations and individuals who do not  even need it.   Mr. Speaker, the tax scheme presented here by Republicans is not a  plan but a scam that represents a betrayal of our values as a nation.   This tax scam is not a revenue policy adapted for the real world that  real Americans live in but a fantasy resting on the monstrous belief  that the wealthy have too little money and that poor, working, and  middle-class families have too much.   Our Republican friends continue to cling to the fantasy belief that  their tax cuts for the rich will pay for themselves despite all  precedent to the contrary and evidence that their tax scheme is  projected by experts to lose between $3 trillion and $7 trillion.   Mr. Speaker, in evaluating the merits of a taxing system, it is not  enough to subject it only to the test of fiscal responsibility.   To keep faith with the nation's past, to be fair to the nation's  present, and to safeguard the nation's future, the plan must also pass  a ``moral test.''   The Republican tax bill fails both of these standards.   I strongly oppose the Conference Report to H.R. 1, the ``Republican  Tax Scam Act,'' and urge all Members to join me in voting against this  reckless, cruel, and heartless proposal that will do nothing to improve  the lives or well-being of middle and working class families, and the  poor and vulnerable `caught in the tentacles of circumstance.'   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 667, the previous question is ordered on  the conference report.                              Motion to Recommit
