 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2022.   I have long believed that there is a role for public servants to  create the conditions that help our fellow citizens obtain a good- paying job. With a good-paying job, most folks have the time and the  resources to take care of themselves, their families, and address the  difficulties that sometimes arise in life.   I appreciate that this legislation promotes the value of our  workforce and focuses on the improvements to apprenticeship programs,  digital literacy programs, and summer job programs for our youth.    In my experience for 15 years as someone who helped upskill people, I  worked very closely with workforce development in order to find jobs  for people who are sitting across the table from me trying to make ends  meet. This investment gives them hope and promise. It also absolutely  addresses what all employers and all small businesses are looking for:  a ready, skilled workforce in order to be able to get into the market  quickly.   When it comes to labor unions, I emphasize the investment in our  labor unions. What they provide for my community, in Indiana's First  District, is livable wages, healthcare benefits that are affordable,  safer workplaces, and secure retirement.   When it comes to the prevailing wage, that prevailing wage sets a  wage that allows for all programs and all development in my district.  That is something that is sacred that allows us to be competitive, to  have a safe workplace, and allows us to provide for families.   Northwest Indiana is home to such a diverse and talented workforce,  and I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation so that  communities and organizations throughout our Nation have the resources  to ensure that everyone has the opportunity and tools to thrive in our  economy.
