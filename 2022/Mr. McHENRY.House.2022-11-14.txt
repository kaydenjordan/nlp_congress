 Mr. Speaker, in 2015, I spoke here to pay tribute to the  wonderful place in Gaston County, North Carolina, called Holy Angels.  Then it was being recognized for its 60th year fulfilling their mission  of ``loving, living, and learning for the differently able.''   Today, I am here to honor the leader of this organization, Regina  Moody, who, after 40 years as president and CEO of Holy Angels, is  retiring.  [[Page H8444]]    I have known Dr. Moody for most of my life. In fact, prior to her  work at Holy Angels, she was my principal at St. Michael's School in  Gastonia, where she spent a lot of time with my two brothers in the  principal's office.   Dr. Moody has been a visionary leader for Holy Angels. Under her  leadership, the organization has greatly expanded its level of full- time resident care, as well as physical therapy, day, and vocational  programs. They also opened several local businesses to serve the  community and give their residents occupational experience.   I wish Dr. Moody and her family the very best as she begins a very  well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
