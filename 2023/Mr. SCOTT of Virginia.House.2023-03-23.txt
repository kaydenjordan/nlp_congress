 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 5, the politics over parents  act.   First, let me be clear. House Democrats believe parental engagement  is central to student success. Parental engagement in schools is  closely linked to better student behavior, higher academic achievement,  and enhanced social skills.   Unfortunately, the politics over parents act does not take meaningful  steps to increase or support parental engagement. In fact, it lists so- called rights and then declares that this allows the parents to control  what is taught. Let's be clear: There is nothing in the bill to give  parents the right to dictate what their children are taught.   Instead, this bill is one of many attempts by Republican politicians  to give a vocal minority the power to try to impose their beliefs on  all parents and students. This extreme education agenda has real  consequences for students and educators.   According to PEN America, over 2,500 books were banned in schools  during the school year 2021-2022, and nearly 140 additional book bans  have taken effect since July 2022.   Let me just list some of the books that Republican politicians have  gotten banned under the guise of parental rights: ``Diary of a Young  Girl,'' the stories of a Holocaust survivor, by Anne Frank; ``The Kite  Runner,'' a novel on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, by Khaled  Hosseini; ``Beloved,'' a novel about slaves during the Civil War, by  Toni Morrison; and on and on. Books like that have been banned because  of efforts like what we have before us today.   Let's be clear. These books are taught at age-appropriate levels. If  you have a problem with it, you should call the librarian. Yet,  Republican politicians are actually having them removed from classrooms  and school libraries.   Simply put, the politics over parents act is an educational gag order  across the Nation which will prevent students from learning and prevent  teachers from teaching. These efforts seek to score political points  and scare parents into thinking that schools do not have their best  interests at heart. Instead, we should be talking about the support  that schools and families actually need to improve parent-teacher  engagement.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the politics over  parents act and join House Democrats in an amendment in the nature of a  substitute to deliver real solutions to build partnerships between  schools and families.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wilson), the ranking member on the Higher  Education and Workforce Development Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), the ranking member of the Early  Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education Subcommittee, which has  jurisdiction of the bill.    Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chairman.    Was the gentlewoman's request to introduce a  statement recognized?    Mr. Chair, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), the ranking member of the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), who is a member of the  Committee on Education and the Workforce.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Florida, (Mr. Frost).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), the Democratic whip.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio-Cortez).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries), the Democratic leader.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin), the ranking member of the  Committee on Oversight and Accountability.    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentleman from Maryland  an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Mr. Chairman, on Page 8 of the bill, it says that parents have ``the  right to know if a school employee or contractor acts to:   ``Change a minor child's gender markers, pronouns, or preferred name;  or   ``Allow a child to change the child's sex-based accommodations,  including locker rooms or bathrooms;   ``The right to know if a school employee or contractor acts to treat,  advise, or address the cyberbullying of a student;   ``Treat, advise, or address the bullying. . . . `'   This says, ``a child.'' It doesn't say their own child. It says a  child, so I am not sure what the answer was.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. Craig).    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentlewoman from  Minnesota an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time  remains on each side?    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. McGarvey).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. McClellan), the newest Member of the  House.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentlewoman from Virginia.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds. I  include in the Record a statement from Equity-Minded Education, Civil  Rights, and Immigration Advocates on H.R. 5 that concludes that we urge  Congress to focus on real and meaningful efforts to truly support our  students, parents, and teachers, and to stop using parents as a decoy  to launch political attacks on our schools.                               [Mar. 7, 2023]      Joint Statement From Equity-Minded Education, Civil Rights, and                      Immigration Advocates on H.R. 5         As equity-minded education, civil rights, and immigration       organizations, we work to ensure that our nation's students       are learning, feel safe and respected at school, and have the       supports they and their families need to succeed. As such, we       are deeply concerned about the Parents Bill of Rights Act       (H.R. 5) recently introduced in the House of Representatives.       This legislation, like similar bills in a growing number of       states that ban books or censor curriculum and textbooks, is       divisive and designed to politicize our schools rather than       provide what parents really want: a great education for their       children.        In addition to enabling book bans and curriculum       censorship, the bill is redundant and out of sync with what       parents want. Provisions in the bill that allow a parent to       demand inspections of schools and school budgets are designed       to disrupt teachers' ability to teach students, and hinder       school administrators' ability to run safe and welcoming       schools. The bill also inserts the federal government to help       determine the frequency of parent-teacher conferences--      something nearly all school districts across the country       establish through locally determined policies. Moreover,       recent polling indicates that the top priorities for parents       are not these wedge issues; rather they want to keep their       children safe from violence at schools, ensure adequate       mental health supports for them, and help in their learning       recovery. Federal law should--and already does--require that       parents receive information on what their kids are learning,       how they are achieving, and on the qualifications of their       child's teachers.        We support and encourage a broader view of the rights of       parents and students: the right to have access to fully-      resourced schools, prepared and qualified teachers, safe and       welcoming places for students to learn, and the supports to       make sure all students can thrive. The ability of the U.S.       education system to provide these essential requirements       should be the primary focus of Congress. We have supported       bipartisan efforts over the years to help achieve these       goals, including the funding of the Elementary and Secondary       School Emergency Relief Fund to provide schools with the       resources to safely reopen and to help students get back on       track after the disruption and loss caused by the pandemic,       and additional resources for mental health needs through the       Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. We urge this Congress to       focus on real and meaningful efforts to truly support our       students, parents, and teachers--and to stop using parents as       a decoy to launch political attacks on our schools.        All4Ed        Center for American Progress        Education Reform Now        National Center for Learning Disabilities        National Parents Union        Schoolhouse Connection        The Education Trust        UnidosUS        National Urban League     Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a  statement from Third Way, which concludes: ``Protecting the ability of  parents to make the best decisions for their children is a fundamental  American value. This proposal is a serious distraction from what our  students really need right now: to be learning in an academically  challenging and safe environment that engages families and teachers in  true partnership to support students.''         Washington.--Third Way released the following statement       from Lanae Erickson, Senior Vice President for Social Policy,       Education, and Politics:        ``This week, the House majority will bring H.R. 5 to the       floor under the guise of increasing parental engagement in       schools--but its substance would do nothing to advance that       goal. Instead, this bill would censor parents, undermine       student mental health, ban books from school libraries,       redirect resources and personnel away from meeting families'       real needs, and ultimately function as a gag order on       teaching and learning across the country.        ``We should be empowering school boards and Parent Teacher       Associations to make informed decisions when it comes to       their students' education. This bill would invite Congress to       dictate the schedule of parent-teacher conferences and       control course instruction in every one of the nearly 100,000       public schools from coast to coast. We should be supporting       the well-being of students by increasing access to mental       health professionals. This legislation would limit families'       access to crucial mental health services in an era when we       know they are needed more than ever. We should be investing       in the safety of our students by keeping firearms out of       classrooms. This bill would focus only on reporting violence       once students have already been hurt or killed.        ``Protecting the ability of parents to make the best       decisions for their children is a fundamental American value.       This proposal is a serious distraction from what our students       really need right now: to be learning in an academically       challenging and safe environment that engages families and       teachers in true partnership to support students.''                                time  1600     Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Landsman).    Madam Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentleman from Ohio.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Madam Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Hayes), a former teacher of the  year.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, I want to get back to something that was said a little  earlier because it is a little disturbing the way this legislation, a  notice of rights--that people have a right to information about their  child, their child, their child. You have a right to notice before a  person speaks to their child at a class, school assembly, or any other  school-sponsored event.   If you have a field trip, I guess you have a right to notice before  anybody at the museum can speak to your child. But under subsection L,  it says you have: ``the right to know if a school employee or  contractor acts to change a minor child's gender markers, pronouns, or  preferred name. . . .''   That means any child--if any teacher addresses any child, everybody  has a right to notice if they change their minor child's gender  markers, pronouns, or preferred name. I think that is concerning. I  don't know what is meant by that, but that is the way it reads.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.

Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, in that case, the individual child will be identified  and will be, essentially, outed, and that is even worse than the  underlying language. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Madam Chair, in closing, despite our colleagues' claims, the politics  over parents act would only further politicize our children's  classrooms while doing nothing to meaningfully improve partnerships  between parents and educators. It will lead to censoring books.   Last night at the Rules Committee, a significant amount of time was  taken to identify books that ought to be banned, and although the bill  does not technically, directly censor books, the reporting requirements  will allow national groups to find books all over the country that they  don't like, and they could threaten each of those schools--wherever  they find the book, they can threaten lawsuits unless the book is  actually banned.   House Democrats tried several times to ensure that this legislation  would actually address real challenges facing students, parents, and  educators, and increase parental involvement.   For example, Democrats offered amendments to prevent this bill from  banning books or censoring the curriculum. Moreover, in committee, we  offered 25 amendments to actually improve student success, such as  improving access to teacher training, fully fund parent engagement  centers, and ensure students have access to mental health resources,  among others. Unfortunately, they were struck down.   Madam Chair, Democrats are dedicated to improving parental engagement  and ensuring that every child receives a well-funded and accurate  education. This legislation does nothing to achieve that goal and would  only advance an extreme education agenda at the expense of students and  parents.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 5, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, as with most of the underlying  bill, this is yet another unfunded mandate placed on our schools  requiring them to issue yet another report as a condition of receiving  much-needed title I funds.   The majority would prefer to impose additional burdens to already  understaffed schools rather than do what they were trained to do, and  that is teach and work with parents.   I would agree with the gentleman's comments about the need for  counselors. He is absolutely right. We need more counselors. However,  this amendment does not increase the number of counselors. It just  reports the number they have. It doesn't improve students' mental  health.   So for those reasons, Madam Chair, since it doesn't improve mental  health or increase the number of counselors, I oppose the amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, this is another effort to turn  classrooms into the epicenter of a culture war. The politics over  parents act doesn't do anything to actually help students succeed and  seeks to scare parents into thinking that schools do not have their  best interests at heart. Children benefit when their parents and  teachers work together, but the politics over parents act would not  take any meaningful steps to increase that parental cooperation.   The bill would create necessary and burdensome reporting requirements  on schools. It would divert essential resources and personnel from  their jobs, meeting the family's real needs into reporting and  everything else in the bill, and it would open the door to dictating  what students can and cannot read or learn.   The underlying bill distracts from what our public schools really  need. Similarly, the manager's amendment does nothing to provide the  families with real parental engagement as some of the amendments would  have done that were rejected.   The bill, for example, gives a so-called Federal right of action to  address the school board. We know that many school boards in recent  years needed police protection to conduct their meetings because of  credible threats of violence. These are elected officials. They don't  need a Federal law to instruct them to be polite. The voters can take  care of that. There is no right that is being given. We already have  the right.   Now, one thing that is a little concerning is that I had an amendment  to allow this right to take place with reasonable limitations.   If 100 people show up at a school board meeting, does the school  board have to listen to each and every one as long as they want to  speak without any limitation?   Each one has a Federal right of action where they can bring a lawsuit  to compel the school board to sit up and listen to each and every one  without limitation.   If they have heard from 10 or 15 or 20 people on one side of the  argument or one side of a debate and nobody on the other side, then do  they have to listen to the other 80?   I don't know. That is what the bill suggests. I don't know any  jurisdiction where you don't have the right to address the school board  in a reasonable way, and that is what this bill does and that is what  the manager's amendment does.   Madam Chair, I ask Members to defeat the manager's amendment and the  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, all school systems are members of  athletic leagues. They are dealing with this controversy. They don't  need a Federal law to apply all over the country. In higher education,  the NCAA is dealing with this.   We don't need a Federal law to tell local school divisions what to do  in all cases. Local school divisions are dealing with this.   This is controversial, and I think we would do well just to let them  work this out.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, did the gentlewoman yield back  her time?    Madam Chair, as I said, the NCAA is working on  this, and I just assume rather than disparage trans youth, let them  work it out.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I don't think we need a Federal  law to help schools tell students which bathroom to use.   In Loudoun County, that situation is under investigation, including  criminal charges. I think it is time we stop disparaging trans youth.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I think the amendment speaks for  itself. If a hundred parents show up at a school board meeting, and  each demands to be heard for as long as they want to speak, this bill  will give them a private right of action in Federal court to enforce  their right to speak to the school board.   My local school board limits people to 3 minutes. I think that is a  reasonable limitation, but when the amendment to allow reasonable  limitations was defeated, you have the bill that they have--everybody  has a right, each and every one of the hundred people who show up, no  matter how repetitive or irrelevant it may be.   I think people need to know what is in the amendment and can judge it  for themselves.   People have said that some parents have been arrested by the police  for showing up at the school board. Let me tell you, that can only  happen if the police believe that a crime is being committed.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I think I would prefer that we  fixed all of the schools so that all students are provided with an  opportunity of a high-quality education and a safe and healthy  environment.   All this amendment does is give people the right to scurry around and  try to find the best schools. Those that are the best at identifying  the best schools may end up there, but frankly, all this is going to do  is cause confusion because when word gets around as to which are the  best schools, everybody will want to go to that school. Then what?   The majority has offered the amendment in committee to let parents  know that if they can work the system, they may get their child into a  good school but all the rest end up in a school that is dilapidated,  unaccredited, or otherwise undesirable.   We need to work to improve all of the schools, not just figure out a  scheme where some can figure out how to get their child into a good  school and leave everyone else behind.   Madam Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim  the time in opposition, although I am not opposed.    Madam Chair, I support the amendment because  the GAO report will actually expose the legislation for what it is. It  is a waste of money, will provide no meaningful rights, and it will  adversely affect the education of the children.   Madam Chair, I support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the House Republican  majority's effort to override President Biden's veto of H.J. Res. 30.   This resolution sought to nullify a popular and sensible rule that  enabled retirement plan managers to make fully informed investment  decisions.   I commend the President for his veto. Workers should be able to  invest their retirement savings in a way that reflects their values,  such as combating climate change, without sacrificing investment  returns.   That is why the Biden-Harris administration issued a rule to clarify  that retirement plan managers may consider the economic effects of  climate change and other environmental, social, and governance factors,  or ESG factors, when they make investment decisions for participants in  retirement plans.   Simply put, this rule is not an ESG mandate. It just allows  participants to make those decisions.   Additionally, the rule does not change the fiduciary standard to  which the professionals who make the investment decisions for  retirement plans are bound. They must still prioritize the interests of  retirement plan participants and cannot sacrifice investment returns to  pursue ESG goals.   Today's debate is not a referendum on the administration's rule or  even ESG in general. We had that debate last month.                                time  1730    The debate is about two things. First, it is about arithmetic.   As my colleagues know, overriding the President's veto requires  support of two-thirds, or 290 Members of the House. H.J. Res. 30 passed  the House with 216 votes, nearly all of which came from the Republican  Caucus. Anyone who can count knows that the Republican majority will  not have the votes to override the President's veto; and everyone  should be asking why are we going through the motions.   Second, the debate is a window into the Republican majority's agenda.  Unfortunately, they would rather spend precious time on the floor on a  doomed effort instead of advancing legislation that would help put  people over politics.   While we are considering the veto override, we could have been  considering ensuring women received equal pay for equal work; ending  workplace discrimination; strengthening a worker's ability to join a  union and negotiate for better working conditions; help people balance  work and family by providing paid sick leave and family and medical  leave; or raising the minimum wage.   House Democrats and the Biden administration are focused on these  priorities and remain committed to lowering costs for our constituents,  creating better-paying jobs, and making our communities safer.   Madam Speaker, before I reserve the balance of my time, I will ask  unanimous consent to enter into the Record President Biden's veto  message of H.J. Res. 30. It says, in part: ``There is extensive  evidence showing that environmental, social, and governance factors can  have a material impact on markets, industries, and businesses. But the  Republican-led resolution would force retirement managers to ignore  these relevant risk factors, disregarding the principles of free  markets and jeopardizing the life savings of working families and  retirees. In fact, this resolution would prevent retirement plan  fiduciaries from taking into account factors, such as the physical  risks of climate change and poor corporate governance, that could  affect investment returns.''   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the complete veto message  be entered into the Record.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  the time.   Today, we have heard a lot about ESG and other topics, but nobody  made a convincing case that there are the votes to override the  President's veto, and that is because a convincing case cannot be made.   The Republican majority may think this futile attempt to override the  President's veto is an appropriate use of the House's time and  resources, but we disagree.   The first quarter of this year is nearly over, and there is so much  the Republican majority has failed do to improve the lives of  Americans.   In contrast, under Democratic leadership during the last Congress,  the House made significant progress to deliver for the American people.  We took action to create millions of jobs, reduce unemployment to near- record lows, to save workers' pensions, to deliver historic funding for  education, to improve child nutrition, and to bring the number of  uninsured Americans down to the lowest level ever.   By that standard, this current majority has a long way to go.  However, at the very least, we should agree that we can't afford to  waste time on futile efforts that we know won't go anywhere.   I urge my colleagues to quickly join me in rejecting the veto  override, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim  time in opposition, although I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment exposes a problem  with the underlying bill.   You should not be able to ban books for other parents' children. In  fact, this amendment exposes the bill as actually doing exactly that.  That is why this amendment is appropriate, and I would hope that it  would be adopted.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim  the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to it.  [[Page H1390]]     Mr. Chairman, I have some concern with some of  the terms in the amendment, like what constitutes a major cyberattack  or who determines whether an attack has been made, or if notice is  required if it may have compromised information and exactly what is  concerned there.   Generally speaking, if information is exposed during a cyberattack,  people expect to be notified so that they can take appropriate action  to protect themselves. These schools should be no exception. I support  the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, in the first part of the bill,  it says nothing is actually to be construed to oppose any requirements  of non-public elementary and secondary schools. I am unaware of  anything the bill does to impose requirements on non-public elementary  or secondary schools, so it seems to me to be unnecessary.   Second, it is the sense of Congress that says local agencies do not  have the authority to exercise any direction, supervision, or control  over curriculum or program of instruction of non-public elementary and  secondary schools. Again, I am unaware of local school boards'  authority to exercise such supervision, direction, or control, so that  seems also to be unnecessary.   I am not sure what the amendment speaks to that is relevant, so I  oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.  [[Page H1393]]     Mr. Chairman, whenever we encounter an attempt  to dismantle the Department of Education, it is clear that we are  undermining public education. Yet, even the Founders of our great  Nation were committed to education.   Moreover, without a Federal role in education, when States were left  to their own devices, we lacked a common set of standards for high- quality education, high-quality teachers, and high expectations for  student outcomes. Many students were left behind, such as racial  minorities, low income, those with disabilities, those with English as  a second language.   The Federal role in education ensures a level playing field for all  of our students and especially provides funding to help the most needy  students.   Moreover, the Federal role in education is still striving to live up  to the promise of Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 decision. In  that decision, the Supreme Court said that education is a right, which  must be made available to all on equal terms, and further, that  racially segregated so-called separate but equal education was  inherently unequal.   The GAO first revealed in 2016 that public schools, unfortunately,  are still segregated--as a matter of fact, more segregated now than the  late 1960s.   In July 2022, GAO found that more than one in three public K-12  students attend essentially racially segregated schools, so we still  have work to do in that area. We still have work to do to fulfill the  promise of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. We are not  fulfilling that promise.   So we still have a lot of work to do on the Federal level. There is a  Federal role for education. The Department of Education is working on  fulfilling that responsibility.   For these reasons, I oppose the amendment, and I urge my colleagues  to vote ``no.''   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this is not a complicated  amendment. It just asks whether you want a Department of Education. I  think we should have a Department of Education, therefore, I ask for a  ``no'' vote on this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, parents already have the right  to address their local school board. It should be done, unfortunately,  within reason, but a reasonable amendment was rejected in committee.  You don't need a Federal law to instruct school board members who are  elected to be polite to the public. The voters can take care of that.   This bill grants a Federal right of action to each and every person  who shows up for the school board, no matter how obnoxious, extreme,  irrelevant, or repetitive that person may be.   This amendment is unnecessary because it doesn't do anything to the  underlying bill. The underlying bill gives you that so-called right,  but we have heard that some parents have been arrested. As I have said  before, they were arrested because the police believed they were  committing a crime.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I  have remaining?    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Kamlager-Dove).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I am having a little trouble  understanding the amendment. As I understand it, a student couldn't  participate in a non-curriculum-based activity, event, or initiative  unless the parents have affirmatively opted in. Otherwise, the students  would be prevented from participating in that event.   If that is my understanding, if the parents don't get the paperwork  in, the students can't participate in the event.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Chairman, I am advised that in some Montgomery County, Maryland  schools, they have a celebration on Halloween with a costume parade and  a Valentine's Day with a class party. If the parents didn't get the  paperwork in on time, the children can't participate.   I don't know if recess is a non-curriculum-based initiative, but my  guess is, until you get your paperwork in, you can't go out and play in  recess.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I think we understand that now we need a Federal law to determine how  schools will handle recess and Halloween or Valentine's Day parties. We  need a Federal law to tell them how to handle it.   I don't think so. I hope we oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment, you actually  would assume that this was part of the bill to begin with. Since it is  a bad bill, making sure that this is in it is just another bad idea.   For example, it brings in the provision that you have to notify the  parents in advance of all the speakers that may be participating, so if  you are in a career in technical education and you have a Career Day,  you have got to identify all the speakers that are coming to Career Day  so the parents--if you can get that list, all of them--they have to be  notified.   It would limit the use of employers as speakers because you would  have to know exactly which one is going to show up, and that would  limit the students' ability to learn the high-wage, in-demand jobs  available at a Career Day.   Basically, this just makes sure that the career and technical  education is part of the bill, and insofar it is a bad bill, I would  hope the amendment would be rejected.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Chairman, that is exactly not what I said. There is nothing wrong  with carpenters or other careers.   It said that if you have a Career Day you may not be able to have the  Career Day unless you can get all the speakers lined up well in advance  and notify all of the parents in advance who they are going to be.   If you have a plumbing firm wanting to participate, you have to  figure out which plumber is going to actually show up so you can notify  the parents of the right one.   This adds too much confusion to it. You may not even be able to have  a Career Day. To suggest that I am not in favor of career and technical  education is ridiculous.   If you want a reasonable program, you have to allow for the  participation of people to come in and speak, talk about the high-wage,  in-demand jobs that are available. Forcing the school to outline each  and every speaker, know each and every person that is going to show up  at a Career Day, before the Career Day, in time to notify the parents  is absurd.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.
