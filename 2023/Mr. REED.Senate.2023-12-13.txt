 Madam President, pursuant to rule XXVIII, paragraph 6, I  move to waive all applicable points of order, and I ask for the yeas  and nays.    I yield back all remaining time.                           Vote on Motion to Waive     Mr. President, for the Committee on Armed Services I report  favorably the following nomination lists which were printed in the  Records on the dates indicated, and ask unanimous consent, to save the  expense of reprinting on the Executive Calendar that these nominations  lie at the Secretary's desk for the information of Senators.    Madam President, I am pleased to introduce the homebuyers  Privacy Protection Act with the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Hagerty.  This bipartisan legislation restricts the use of so-called mortgage  ``trigger leads'' and gives prospective home buyers control over their  personal credit information.   Trigger leads are essentially tips based on information the major  credit reporting bureaus sell to mortgage brokers and lenders when the  bureaus learn that a consumer has applied for a mortgage with another  lender. Each trigger lead they sell can generate dozens of calls and  solicitations to the consumer from lenders, ostensibly to provide the  consumer with better offers. In fact, one home buyer reported to the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that they received over 100 calls  from other lenders within 2 days of applying for a mortgage.  Prospective home buyers who are bombarded by these kind of  solicitations typically have no idea their information was sold without  their affirmative consent.   Buying a home is often the most consequential financial decision a  family will make. Getting ``spammed'' with additional offers, after a  family has already shopped for a mortgage and chosen a lender, makes  this already stressful process even more stressful. It can be very  difficult, if not impossible, for a family to sift through dozens of  offers over a few days and actually receive better credit. Consumers  who are subjected to a deluge of solicitations as the result of a  trigger lead are justified in feeling that their privacy has been  invaded.   Many reputable mortgage companies see it the same way. They support  curtailing trigger leads since prospective home buyers often blame  their lender for selling off their personal information even though it  is the credit bureaus that are providing this information.   Unrelenting, aggressive solicitations are more than just a nuisance.  Indeed, some companies that buy trigger leads may not use them  responsibly and may have poor track records of compliance. In 2018, the  Washington Post reported that some mortgage lenders had used trigger  leads to misrepresent themselves in calls by suggesting that they are  underwriters for the consumer's current lender or by implying that they  are calling from a government agency. According to reporting in the  Chicago Tribune, unsuspecting home buyers are at risk of inadvertently  handing over sensitive personal information, exposing themselves to  identity theft.   The current system leaves consumers without control of their personal  information when they apply for a mortgage. Our bill will fix the  current system by significantly restricting the circumstances in which  the credit bureaus can sell home buyers' personal information to  generate trigger leads. The credit bureaus would be permitted to sell  this information only in the limited circumstances when the consumer  already has a significant financial relationship with the lending  institution seeking the information or when the prospective home buyer  has provided affirmative consent to share this information broadly with  other lenders.   The Homebuyers Privacy Protection Act will go a long way towards  securing consumers' personal information and will provide much needed  relief from the seemingly never-ending solicitations prospective home  buyers receive during an already stressful time.   I thank the broad coalition of consumer advocacy groups and trade  associations for their support, including the Mortgage Bankers  Association, the National Consumer Law Center on behalf of its low- income clients, the National Association of Mortgage Brokers, the  Community Home Lenders of  [[Page S5964]]  America, U.S. PIRG, the Association of Independent Mortgage Experts,  the Broker Action Coalition, the American Bankers Association, and the  Independent Community Bankers of America.   I urge my colleagues to join Senator Hagerty and me in supporting  this commonsense, bipartisan bill.                            ____________________     Madam President, I am pleased to introduce the homebuyers  Privacy Protection Act with the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Hagerty.
