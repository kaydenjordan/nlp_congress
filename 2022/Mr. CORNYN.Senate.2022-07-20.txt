 Mr. President, while my friend, the Senator from  Delaware, is on the floor, in Texas we are known for oil and gas  production, but the truth is, and what I think we really should be  known for, is for an ``all of the above'' energy policy.   We produce more electricity from wind turbines than any other State  in the country, and that is a surprise to a number of people.   But one reason for an ``all of the above'' energy policy is that  during the current hot spell we are experiencing in Texas--I think we  have had over 33 days of over 100-degree temperatures in my hometown of  Austin, TX. It is hot. Some might say: Well, of course it is hot. It is  July in Texas. But what has happened, we have seen this phenomenon  where the wind is not producing nearly as much electricity because it  is not blowing as hard as it might otherwise do.   So, again, I think if we can encourage an ``all of the above'' energy  policy, then different segments of the energy picture can fill in at  different times and satisfy our overall need.   I thought while my friend was speaking on that topic I would just  mention that interesting lesson that we have learned here recently in  Texas.
