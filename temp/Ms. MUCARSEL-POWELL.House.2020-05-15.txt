 Mr. Speaker, I can't believe what I am hearing,  that this bill is political, that we have to wait, and that our  constituents don't need help. I want my colleagues on the other side to  tell my constituents in Florida who can't access their unemployment  benefits that they have to wait. Tell the people who don't have food to  feed their families that they have to wait.   Each day that we delay, our constituents don't get the help they  need. This is a bipartisan bill, and local municipalities are in dire  need of those funds. Monroe County and Miami-Dade County are going to  get the money they need to pay for our heroes--firefighters, teachers,  and educators.
