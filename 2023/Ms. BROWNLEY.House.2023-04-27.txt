 Mr. Speaker, House Republicans' ineffectual and  outright wrong economic policies are bringing our country to the brink  of default and opening the door to crippling financial hardships for  America's working families.   In addition to catapulting our Nation into economic instability, the  House Republican default on America bill will cause unemployment to  double, the stock market to crash, and mortgage and student loan rates  to skyrocket.   The Republican budget cuts vital funding to schools, forces  communities to lay off thousands of first responders, and increases  housing costs.   Rather than discuss the budget in good faith, Republicans are intent  on holding the full faith and credit of the United States hostage.   Under the guise of responsible spending, Republicans are destroying  our economy and putting the lives and livelihood of millions of  Americans at risk in the process.   House Democrats stand united in working for the people and building  an economy that lowers costs, creates good-paying jobs, and makes  communities safer.                            ____________________
