 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   I rise in support of the SECURE Act, a bipartisan proposal to address  our Nation's retirement security crisis. Several of the bill's  provisions are under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Education and  Labor, and I would like to discuss two of them.   First, the SECURE Act makes it easier for small businesses to band  together to form multiple employer plans. This is expected to increase  workers' access to retirement savings programs with potentially lower  cost investment options.   Second, the SECURE Act includes a carefully and narrowly tailored  safe harbor for the selection of an annuity provider for 401(k) plans.  This limited safe harbor is intended to ease employers' concerns about  their fiduciary liability and to expand workers' access to annuities  and other lifetime income options.    I thank Chairman Neal and Ranking Member Brady for their leadership,  and I urge my colleagues to support the SECURE Act.
