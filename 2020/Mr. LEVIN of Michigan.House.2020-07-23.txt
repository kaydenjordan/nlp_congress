 Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the public  schools in Macomb and Oakland Counties.   In between votes earlier this week, I hosted a Zoom call with the  superintendents in my district. I was struck by how much they figured  out in such a short time about operating a school during a pandemic.   Educators are nimble and creative. They are used to doing a lot with  a little. The PPE, the cleaning, the social distancing, the technology  needs, and the social and emotional health, they are up for figuring it  all out on top of already having one of the hardest jobs there is.   The problem is, they don't have a fraction of the resources they need  to put their plans into place. While they have spent their summer days  and probably fitful nights determining how to keep their students,  educators, and other school professionals safe, this administration has  offered no plan other than: Reopen or else.   As a father of four, as a lifetime advocate for and product of public  schools, as a union organizer with worker safety top of mind, and as a  human being with compassion and common sense, I am calling on the  Senate to offer a real plan in this next relief package, one that  acknowledges that we must contain this pandemic and provide schools  with the resources they need to reopen safely.   It has been nearly 10 weeks since the House passed the HEROES Act to  put us on a path required to reengage our schools and the economy as a  whole safely.   Mr. Speaker, 59,679 Americans have perished from COVID-19 since May  15 when the House passed the HEROES Act, yet here we are, still trying  to push public health common sense uphill in the face of denial,  politicization, and the most disastrous vacuum of leadership in modern  times.   The HEROES Act directs more than $100 billion in emergency education  funding to cover unexpected costs and $75 billion for COVID-19 testing  and contact tracing, including key provisions of the coronavirus  containment corps legislation I wrote with Senator Elizabeth Warren.   What has happened in the intervening 10 weeks with their 60,000  deaths? The need has not only grown; it has doubled. Just this week,  national health organizations and child advocates, led by the American  Academy of Pediatrics, wrote to House and Senate leadership, calling on  Congress to pass at least $200 billion in K-12 education funding.  Meanwhile, Senate Republicans have met this growing need with the  inaction we have come to expect: ignoring this proposal.   What is even more dangerous, Trump and DeVos threaten to strip  funding from public schools, a threat they have no authority to fulfill  unless they put students in the classroom full-time even as daily cases  are higher than they were when schools went online in the first place  during the spring.   Nowhere is this more dangerous than in our communities of color,  where schools are disproportionately underfunded even in normal times.  These are some of the same communities that have been the hardest hit  by the coronavirus and may need more time to reopen safely. If we are  at long last serious about racial justice, we must offer resources and  flexibility, not ultimatums.   Senate Republicans can choose to be redefined by the vanity projects  of a President only concerned with pretending this virus is over and a  Secretary of Education continuing her lifelong crusade to defund public  schools and even spreading outright falsehoods, such that children are  stoppers of COVID-19, or they can do their job: represent the  educators, school professionals, parents, and students in their States  by doing what is in the best interest of the health and safety of our  citizens.                            ____________________
