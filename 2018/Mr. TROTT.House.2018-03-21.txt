 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of William  Pulte, Sr. He passed away earlier this month at the age of 85.   In 1950, at the age of 18, Bill Pulte started building and selling  homes in southeast Michigan. In 1956, he founded Pulte Homes, known  today as the Pulte Group. Over the next 50 years, he grew the company  into the largest homebuilder in the United States.   Bill Pulte was a legend in the business world, but his legacy is one  of great devotion to his family and community. He was involved with the  Angel Fund, a group which anonymously provides families in Detroit with  shelter. His philanthropy helped Cornerstone Schools provide thousands  of young people in Detroit with a great education, and his passion for  homebuilding took him all the way to Central America to help its  poorest communities.   So it is most appropriate that we pause today from our Nation's  business to remember and celebrate the life of Bill Pulte. His hard  work, devotion, and vision changed the world for the better, and for  that, we thank him.                            ____________________
