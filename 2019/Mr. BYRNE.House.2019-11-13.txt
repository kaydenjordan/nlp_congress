 Madam Speaker, the House of Representatives has been the  scene of serious chaos, not only today, but for weeks.   Unfortunately for the American people, we have nothing to show for  it. We have issued more subpoenas from this House than we have had  bills that have actually been signed by the President.   We haven't been working on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade  agreement that President Trump worked so hard to negotiate. We haven't  been working on funding the military or bipartisan legislation to lower  the cost of prescription drugs. No, 100 percent of the energy of this  place has been devoted to the impeachment of President Trump.   There has been a lot of noise, a lot of rumors, and a lot of  confusion about exactly what has happened and what is going on, where  we are and how we got here. There is a reason for that.   You see, Madam Speaker, by House rules, impeachment is under the  jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee. The Judiciary Committee has a  great big hearing room just across the street. That is where an  impeachment inquiry is supposed to take place. But we aren't holding  hearings there because Speaker Pelosi doesn't want them there.   Instead, the impeachment charade has been taking place in a small,  restricted room, two floors underground, below this Chamber, deep in  the bowels of the Capitol. That room is known as the SCIF. The SCIF is  a very important room because it is where Members of Congress hear  about our country's great secrets. You can't bring a cell phone in  there. You can't bring a camera in there. Most importantly, the public  can't go in there.   Democrats made a big spectacle about holding their first public  hearing today. They act as if they are making some great, virtuous  action to bring forth transparency, as if they are operating with the  utmost integrity. The truth is that today's hearing is little more than  a public showcasing of witnesses they have already interrogated and  vetted in that little room to ensure they will only say what the  Democrats desire.   You see, Madam Speaker, by conducting impeachment in that little  room, Speaker Pelosi and Adam Schiff knew that the American people  wouldn't know what was going on, what was being said.   But right outside the SCIF, that tiny room, you will find dozens of  cameras and news people. Here they are, you can see, talking to Adam  Schiff.   Adam Schiff and his staff have been feeding these reporters bits of  information for weeks. For weeks, we have been flooded with reports of  so-called explosive things that supposedly have been said in this  small, secret room.   Madam Speaker, there is a rule of the House that every Member of  Congress has the right to at least watch a committee hearing. A couple  of weeks ago, some of my colleagues and I decided that we wanted to  know what was really going on in that small, little room. So, we  entered the SCIF, that little room, simply to watch. Adam Schiff  immediately stopped the proceedings, and he refused to proceed until we  left.   There is another rule of the House that says the records of  committees are the property of the House, and every Member is entitled  to review them. There is a reason for this rule. Those records don't  belong to Adam Schiff. They don't belong to Speaker Pelosi. They don't  belong to me. They belong to the American people.   So, again, I went back to the SCIF, back to that little room. I  showed them that House rule and informed them that I wanted only to  read the transcripts from these secret proceedings. But Chairman  Schiff's staff said no. They would not follow the rules of the House.  They would not let me read them. They said: You will get them later,  along with everybody else, when we say so.   Finally, they started releasing the transcripts--in a way that fit  their agenda. Madam Speaker, I have been reading these transcripts as  they come out. I have also been reading what the mainstream media has  to say about them. Would you believe it? The mainstream media is saying  exactly what Adam Schiff wants them to say. Almost none of them are  talking about the other side, about President Trump's defense.   To make sure the American people have the facts, I felt compelled to  come down to the floor tonight to talk about the things that, if you  are not reading these thousands of pages of materials, you might have  missed.   There have now been about 3,000 pages of testimony released. Despite  many different opinions of those pages, there is universal agreement  that Ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries on Earth. You see,  Madam Speaker, Ukraine, like many former Soviet countries, is  controlled by oligarchs. These guys have almost all the wealth, most of  the industry, and pretty much all the political power.   Corruption is so bad in Ukraine that many American businesspeople  refuse to do business there because they don't want to deal with the  notorious oligarchs.   It has been the policy of Republican and Democrat Presidents, for  nearly 30 years, that Ukraine must end corruption, must adopt the rule  of law, and must take away power from the oligarchs. You have had  Ukrainian Presidents come and go but, time and time again, things seem  to stay the same.   During the 2016 Presidential election, we know that senior members of  the Ukrainian Government were very much on Secretary Clinton's side.  Don't take my word for it. You can pull this article, which was written  in the final days of President Obama's Presidency. You can look at it  yourself.   That is not some rightwing website. That is Politico. It might be a  little hard to read, but here it says Ukrainian ``officials are  scrambling to make amends with the President-elect''--President Trump-- ``after quietly working to boost Clinton.'' The Ukrainian Government  was boosting Secretary Clinton.   Thanks to Adam Schiff's Star Chamber rules, we still have not gotten  to hear the President's side of the story. But it should come as a  surprise to no one, as some Democrats have pretended, that President  Trump did not want to devote his valuable, limited  [[Page H8821]]  time by doing things like holding an Oval Office meeting with the  President of Ukraine after facing stuff like this.                                time  1830    Of course, a President not offering a rare Oval Office meeting is not  the same thing as not providing United States support. As most people  know, Ukraine has been at war with Russia for about 5 years. Russia  illegally invaded Ukraine and still has forces there today. President  Obama rightly began to give nonlethal aid to Ukraine to help in that  war. But President Obama would not sell weapons to Ukraine because he  was scared that it would upset the Russians.   It actually was, would you believe it, President Trump who began  selling real weapons to Ukraine to help them actually bring the fight  to the Russians. That decision has had an enormous positive effect on  Ukraine. Even those testifying in Adam Schiff's hearings who don't like  the President have praised President Trump for that.   But, again, it appears that most of the issues that the Democrats are  raising started with a few individuals in the administration trying to  convince President Trump that we should forget Ukraine's past, embrace  the new President of Ukraine, and put a serious amount of his time into  that country. They began, in their own words, working to change  President Trump's mind on Ukraine.   For weeks, we have been going back and forth about what these  individuals may or may not have been doing. We have a mound of  bureaucratic gossip. We have been calling it hearsay, but it is gossip  about what was going on, who was doing what.   We have a lot of conflicting testimony, speculation, and, yes,  hearsay--gossip--but the Democrats have provided zero, and I mean no,  direct evidence showing President Trump ordered some kind of quid pro  quo. In fact, they quit talking about quid pro quo because they don't  have any evidence of it.   With all of this testimony, with all of these rumors, it is easy to  forget that this all goes back to the whistleblower. Of course, we know  that the whistleblower also lacked firsthand knowledge of what he  reportedly blew the whistle on.   He was, according to the inspector general, a partisan individual. So  a partisan individual who has no firsthand knowledge filed a  whistleblower complaint and that is what we are dealing with.   The whistleblower made allegations that President Trump made demands  on President Zelensky in a phone call that occurred in the White House  on July 25, but very few people in the media have reported that  President Zelensky has publicly, clearly, and repeatedly denied any  demands were made on him.   They also have not reported that the Justice Department, the Criminal  Division of the Justice Department, reviewed this allegation and  declined to pursue a criminal investigation. They found no crime.   Nevertheless, President Trump took the extraordinary step of  releasing the transcript of this supposedly extraordinary call. You can  read the entire transcript online. I hope the American people will do  so because they won't find one demand in there. Not one. Read the  transcript.   Madam Speaker, the other issue that has been swirling downstairs in  that little room is this hold that was placed on security assistance to  Ukraine and apparently some other countries as well.   We know that somewhere around July 10, the Office of Management and  Budget placed a hold on certain foreign aid going to Ukraine. That is  not a cancellation of funds. That is a process allowing the funds to be  reviewed.   Importantly, Madam Speaker, that hold was placed before the phone  call that President Trump had with President Zelensky, the call that  the whistleblower raised.   But, Madam Speaker, something interesting in the transcript was that  neither President Trump nor President Zelensky said one word about the  hold on that call. One would think that if President Trump were trying  to use the aid for extortion, he would have at least mentioned it. One  would have also figured that President Zelensky would have mentioned  the issue himself, given how important this aid was to his country.   The truth is, the reason President Zelensky did not mention the funds  was because he did not know the funds were on hold and President Trump  never told him.   Madam Speaker, this would be a very strange quid pro quo where  President Trump did not tell President Zelensky and President Zelensky  did not know that the funds were on hold.   In fact, it appears that the Ukrainians first found out about the  hold when it was reported in the press on August 29, over a month after  the phone call; never mind that the funds were released 11 or 12 days  later at the latest, unconditionally.   But let's talk about that hold. Many of the witnesses have speculated  about why OMB placed a hold on the aid. But when pressed, in all those  thousands of pages, they have all said some version of: I don't know  why the aid was placed on hold, or I think it was for this reason, but  I don't really know.   Let's just look at the facts. It seems that most everybody has  somehow forgotten that President Trump ran a campaign on deep  skepticism of foreign aid. He asked some tough questions that the  American people appreciated. Are we getting our fair share? Are the  Europeans freeloading off of us? Should we be taking a second look at  this?   So we have a new President, a new parliament in Ukraine. Is it really  that surprising that an administration run by President Trump would  say: Let's take another look at this before we send another $250  million out the door. I think the American people would find that  pretty reasonable.   Again, Madam Speaker, we have a lot of bureaucratic gossip here, a  lot of people standing around the water cooler somewhere in the White  House; a lot of speculation. But not one person has testified they had  any direct knowledge that President Trump ordered the aid be held in  exchange for some kind of political favor. Not one person.   In fact, the only witness who had any form of serious contact with  President Trump, Ambassador Sondland, testified that he called  President Trump and asked him what was going on with this aid.    Almost nobody has reported it, but here is a direct quote from that  exchange. In this exchange, Sondland talks about one of the Democrat  witnesses raising the rumor of quid pro quo with him.   So Sondland called the President, and here you see the President  directly told him: ``There is no quid pro quo. No quid pro quo.'' That  is the evidence that is being introduced today and before today.   On top of that, we have Vice President Pence meeting with President  Zelensky on September 1, and about 3 weeks later, you have President  Trump, seen right here in this picture, you have President Trump with  President Zelensky.   So, Madam Speaker, in closing, let's review. We have got a total sham  process, a real Star Chamber. The Star Chamber, by the way, it actually  was something that grew up in the 17th century in Great Britain, so  that the king, in order to squash his political opponents, could have a  closed hearing, have his own rules, and then do whatever he needed to  take the people who were dissidents and squash them. That is the Star  Chamber that Adam Schiff has been running.   We have no evidence that President Trump ordered any kind of quid pro  quo. None. No evidence. And the Democrats have stopped talking about  quid pro quo because it isn't working for them. Because they don't have  the facts.   The call transcripts show no demand. President Zelensky says there  was no demand. And no evidence shows President Trump ordered a demand.   The Ukrainians got the aid money within days of even finding out it  was on hold. And, finally, Madam Speaker, they got the high-level  meeting, not only with the President of the United States, but also  with the Vice President that they wanted.   But here we are, Madam Speaker, so many important issues falling by  the wayside with nothing getting done for the American people.   We are going to run out of money to run the government in about a  week and we have done nothing about it.   The Constitution makes clear that impeachment is an acceptable  redress  [[Page H8822]]  only for, let me quote it: ``treason, bribery, or other high crimes and  misdemeanors.'' Nothing less.   I think my friends on the other side, unfortunately, they get up here  in Washington, and they forget that although they may not like this  President, he was chosen by the American people as the leader of this  country.   I am sorry, Madam Speaker, they must do much better than offering the  American people some hearsay and bureaucratic gossip if they want to  take this President down.   The truth is this about removing the President: They know that the  votes in the Senate aren't there for that. The Senate is not going to  remove President Trump from office. It is not happening.   This is about satisfying the Democrat's desire to play to their  resistance base, the people who said the day after the election in 2016  that they wanted to impeach Donald Trump.   The whistleblower's lawyer wrote that he wanted a coup in January of  2017.   This is also about trying to build up a case for defeating President  Trump in the 2020 election. The impeachment process is not supposed to  be used for that. We have campaigns for that. We raise money to do  that. We don't use this body for that.   This entire process from its very inception has been a hypocritical,  shameful exercise in partisan political opportunism. There is no  substance here. None of President Trump's actions even approach  anything remotely near impeachable conduct.   But Democrats have made a critical error in orchestrating their  scheme. If you watched what happened today, most of it was boring, and  the reason it was boring is because there is no there there.   The Democrats have misunderstood and underestimated the resolve of  the American people that elected this President. The facts are on the  President's side, and we will rise to the occasion and fight back  against this radical scheme to remove President Trump.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
