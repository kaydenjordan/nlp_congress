 Mr. President, I want to congratulate and pay  tribute to Mildred Schindler Janzen, a World War II survivor and author  of the memoir, ``Surviving Hitler, Evading Stalin.''   Mildred was born in Great Bend, KS, in 1929 to German parents.  Shortly after her birth, her family returned to Germany to take care of  the family farm. Growing up in Nazi Germany, World War II completely  disrupted Mildred's childhood and her family's life. Mildred and her  family were driven away from their home, separated from each other, and  forced to become refugees in their own country. As a teenager, Mildred  and her family were captured by Russian soldiers, and eventually, her  father was led away to never be seen again. After returning to their  family farm, she and her mother and brother were displaced once again  by Polish soldiers.   Mildred experienced the horrors of World War II and her courage in  sharing her story should be commended. After the war and with the help  of her American birth certificate, Mildred was able to return to the  United States to live with relatives. Back in the United States,  Mildred came back to Kansas, to her birthplace. She settled in  Ellsworth, KS, where she attended high school, learned English, and  worked at a local bank. During her time in high school, Mildred met and  married Leon Janzen, and they had four children together: Karen,  Kenton, Susan, and Galen.   After sharing her story with many others, Mildred decided to write a  memoir. It is her hope that releasing this memoir will help prevent  history from repeating itself. Mildred's bravery and resilience is a  testament to her strong character. Her choice to rise above past  hardships and instead focus on a life filled with happiness,  persistence, and love is a prime example of the enduring survivor that  Mildred is.   Today, Mildred spends her time gardening, baking, being active within  her church and being with family. She embodies a true Kansan:  determined, hard-working, and committed to her community.   Mildred, I congratulate you on the release of your memoir and thank  you for demonstrating to Kansans and the world your outstanding courage  and character. Thank you for telling your story.                            ____________________
