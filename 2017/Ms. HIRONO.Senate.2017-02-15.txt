 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Director of the Office of Management  and Budget, or OMB, is probably the most powerful Federal job that most  Americans have never heard of. If you were to ask five out of five  regular people whether they have even heard of the Office of Management  and Budget, or its importance, I would say that probably five of them  would say: I have never heard of it; what do they do?   The Director of OMB has broad discretion to develop Federal  regulations and to set spending priorities across the government-- spending priorities across the government. I think we should make sure  that this person actually cares about service to the people of America.   For example, if the Defense Department needs more resources for our  troops, OMB has to sign off. If the Environmental Protection Agency  wants to protect our communities from air and water pollution, OMB has  to sign off. If the President wants to cut Social Security, Medicare,  and Medicaid under the guise of ``saving money,'' the OMB Director is  responsible for implementing the policy.   Given the tremendous power invested in this position, the next OMB  Director should, at a minimum, believe in the  [[Page S1214]]  central government functions he or she will be tasked to carry out.  That is why I strongly oppose the nomination of Congressman Mike  Mulvaney to serve as the next Director of the Office of Management and  Budget.   Congressman Mulvaney came to Washington at the very right fringe of  the tea party wave in 2010. Since then, he has consistently pursued  policies that would be disastrous for our economy, for the most  vulnerable members of our society, and for America's seniors--our  kupuna.   Congressman Mulvaney has been one of the strongest proponents for  privatizing and voucherizing Medicare and dismantling Medicaid during  his time in Congress. In 2011, while explaining his support for the  draconian, really terrible Republican budget that would have destroyed  the social safety net and gutted funding for nearly every domestic  program--nearly every domestic program and you can imagine the  thousands and thousands of domestic programs people across the country  are relying upon--Congressman Mulvaney said:         Two nights ago, there was a group of Republicans in the       House of Representatives who voted to dramatically overhaul       Medicare and Medicaid and lightning did not strike us. If       that is not a sign that maybe things can be different around       here, I don't know what is. So I'm hoping that--I hope we       have that exact debate over the course of the next year.    Let me be clear. Congressman Mulvaney was gloating over a bill that  would be devastating to millions of seniors and Americans on Medicaid  and Medicare. If confirmed, Congressman Mulvaney would not just be one  extremist in the House of Representatives; he would be the person--the  one person--responsible for developing, rolling out, and implementing  the President's budget and his priorities.   With this power, he would be in a position to fulfill his heart's  desire--all of the things he worked on as a member of the tea party and  a Member of the House of Representatives. He could destroy programs  like Medicare and Social Security, which more than 200,000 seniors in  Hawaii and tens of millions across the United States depend on every  single day. There are things we can do to fight back.   Last month, I fought alongside my friend and colleague from Indiana,  Senator Joe Donnelly, to prevent Congressman Mulvaney and the Trump  administration from using budget gimmicks to privatize Medicare and cut  funding from Medicaid. While our amendment was defeated in a very close  vote, I was encouraged that two of our Republican colleagues--Senator  Dean Heller of Nevada and Senator Susan Collins of Maine--voted in  favor of my amendment.   This vote demonstrated that there is bipartisan opposition to  balancing the budget on the backs of our seniors. This is exactly what  Congressman Mulvaney wants to do. He has called Social Security a Ponzi  scheme. Ponzi schemes are illegal, but he calls Social Security--a  program that millions and millions of people throughout our country  rely upon--a Ponzi scheme and supports raising the eligibility for it  to 70 years old.   When he was in the South Carolina legislature, he even supported a  bill that said that Social Security was unconstitutional. I would say  even the most conservative person would not deem Social Security to be  unconstitutional, but that is the kind of position that Congressman  Mulvaney takes. His positions on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social  Security are enough to disqualify him from serving as OMB Director.   We do not need an ideological flamethrower like Congressman Mulvaney  at the helm of OMB. Sadly, there is more. Congressman Mulvaney is a  debt limit denier. To demonstrate the point, I wish to read his  response to a question he received from the Budget Committee:         I do believe that defaulting on America's debts would have       grave worldwide economic consequences. I do not believe that       breaching the debt ceiling will automatically or inevitably       lead to that result.    Not only is this statement wrong, but it contradicts itself. I was in  the House in 2011 when Congressman Mulvaney and his colleagues played  political games with the debt limit. I can tell you that the stock  market did not agree with his assessment that there wouldn't be an  immediate negative impact.   Here is what happened over the course of a week. The stock market  lost $1 trillion in value--$1 trillion in value. Standard & Poor's  downgraded the U.S. credit for the first time in our country's history.   The Government Accountability Office later found that the standoff  increased our borrowing costs by $1.3 billion, which Congressman  Mulvaney and his Republican allies were all too happy to pass along to  the American taxpayers to pay.   Congressman Mulvaney's record clearly demonstrates why he is unfit to  serve as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. He wants  to balance the budget on the backs of seniors and other vulnerable  communities. He believes in governing from fiscal crisis to fiscal  crisis. It isn't even clear if he supports the mission of the  department he has been nominated to lead.   Congressman Mulvaney joins a list of nominees--many of them confirmed  at this point, sadly--ranging from an Education Secretary who does not  believe in public education to a Secretary of Health and Human Services  who wants to basically dismantle Medicare, Medicaid, and Social  Security not far behind.   I ask my colleagues, when does this long list of nominees come to a  stop? I say, at the very least, someone with the power of the Director  of OMB is where we should be drawing the line, unless we want one who  thinks that defaulting on our national debt is not a problem, unless we  think that hurting millions and millions of seniors on Social Security  and Medicare is not a problem.   I feel as though Congressman Mulvaney perhaps has not encountered  enough people in his time in public service who have come to him to  share their stories of the devastation that would come into their lives  if these safety net programs were not there for them. I feel as though  maybe if they have come to talk to him, he hasn't listened very well.   I encourage my colleagues to hold the line at this point and to  oppose this nomination. Congressman Mulvaney is not the person for OMB.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
