 Mr. Speaker, on July 19, 2023, Federal Judge Lewis Kaplan  rejected Donald Trump's request for a new trial and confirmed that  Donald Trump raped E. Jean Carroll.   I must submit this court ruling into the Congressional Record, and I  will read what the judge found. On page 43, the judge wrote: ``Ms.  Carroll testified that the sexual assault--the `rape'--of which she  accused Mr. Trump involved especially painful, forced digital  penetration. . . . ''   The judge further writes: ``The testimony of the outcry witnesses,  [Mses.] Birnbach and Martin, corroborated the essence of Ms. Carroll's  account of a violent, traumatic sexual assault.''   On page 44, the judge wrote: ``The jury's finding of sexual abuse  therefore necessarily implies that it found that Mr. Trump forcibly  penetrated her vagina.''   The judge further writes: `` . . . in other words, that he raped her.  . . . ''   Mr. Speaker, Judge Kaplan's memorandum opinion denying defendant's  rule 59 motion can be found at: https://storage.courtlistener.com/ recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590045/gov.uscourts.nysd.590045.212.0.pdf.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Representative Connolly,  for his leadership.   I am a proud coauthor of the Taiwan International Solidarity Act.  Taiwan is a critically important partner to the United States, and  Taiwan has made significant contributions to the international  community.   Unfortunately, the actions of the government of the People's Republic  of China have prevented Taiwan from being a part of important  international organizations that help not only the United States but  also helps their international community and helps the PRC.   For example, the PRC blocks Taiwan from being a part of the  International Civil Aviation Organization. That is just really stupid  because there are people from the PRC flying into Taiwan and flying  out; there are people from the United States flying into Taiwan and  flying out.   Why wouldn't you want Taiwan to have safer air travel? You absolutely  would. The PRC also, unfortunately, blocked Taiwan from being in the  World Health Assembly. Factually, it turns out that Taiwan got it  right. Taiwan told the entire world that COVID could be passed through  human transmission. The PRC lied to the entire world and said that that  was not true.   Taiwan got it right and yet, the WHO excludes Taiwan. The WHO should  be ashamed of themselves and should let Taiwan in.   Taiwan is also excluded from INTERPOL. Why wouldn't you want Taiwan  to help with fighting crime and  [[Page H3915]]  terrorism around the world? You absolutely would.   This bill would require the State Department to report to Congress  every year on any efforts by the PRC government to undermine Taiwan's  participation in international organizations.   It would also require the State Department to report on any PRC  government effort to undermine Taiwan's relationships with other  countries. This information we receive will be critical to holding the  PRC government accountable for any efforts to undermine Taiwan's  contributions to the international community.
