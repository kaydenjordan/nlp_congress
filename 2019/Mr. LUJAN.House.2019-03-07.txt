 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand before you today in  strong support of H.R. 1.   Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking Congressman Sarbanes,  Speaker Pelosi, Chairwoman Zoe Lofgren, and my colleagues for their  work on this issue.   H.R. 1 is historic legislation. It will restore transparency in our  government and put the power back in the hands of the people.   It will reduce the role of dark money in politics and make it easier  to vote.   Perhaps most importantly, it will reaffirm that this is the people's  House and our work here is for them. There could be nothing more  fundamentally important than that.   Too many have lost faith in the process; too many have lost faith in  their government. They look around and wonder who is on their side, who  is fighting for them. They see rules rigged against them, and every day  it gets harder and harder for their neighbor to buy insulin or for  their daughter to shake off the incredible burdens of student loan  debt.   This legislation, H.R. 1, is an important step in how we stand up for  our communities and for the people. It is a tool that allows us to act  on the many issues impacting working men and women, the family that I  was raised in.   It will also give Americans a greater voice in their government. This  legislation will allow automatic voter registration and create a  national holiday for election day.   I am also proud to submit an amendment to H.R. 1 that will expand  election infrastructure grants to promote voter participation, secure  our elections, and increase funding for these efforts to engage all  parts of our society in our democracy.  [[Page H2512]]    Looking ahead to next week, I am looking forward to reintroducing  with my colleagues the Native American Voting Rights Act. This  legislation will make sure that communities are not left behind as we  strengthen our democracy.   House Democrats committed to the American people that we would  fundamentally change Washington if elected to the majority; we  committed that our work would be for the people. This week, we are  living up to that commitment.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, our democracy is at its best when all voices  are heard. Unfortunately, whether due to an antiquated voting system or  restrictive voter laws, too many Americans face too many obstacles to  participating in our elections.   There is also an immediate need to protect election security. Russia  attacked our democracy in 2016 and could do so again. That is why, last  Congress, I introduced a Voting Innovation Prize Act, to tap into  America's innovative spirit to strengthen our democracy. These are  competitive grants.   Today, I am proud to offer an amendment based on that legislation. My  amendment will expand the election infrastructure grants to promote  voter participation, secure our elections, and increase funding.   Madam Chair, I thank Chairman Bennie Thompson for working with me on  this amendment, and I urge adoption of this amendment and the For the  People Act.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield as much time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren), the chair of the  Committee on House Administration.    Madam Chair, I urge adoption of this amendment, I urge  adoption of H.R. 1, and I yield back the balance of my time.
