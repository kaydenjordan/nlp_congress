 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, I came down to the floor to  discuss the importance of military preparedness to our national  security. The most basic requirement of national security is a strong  military, but it is not the only requirement. Maintaining our Nation's  strength and our ability to deter threats and discourage our enemies  from tangling with us also involves things like a strong economy,  energy security, and border security.   And, today, I want to spend a few minutes talking about border  security. Border security is an essential part of  [[Page S5096]]  keeping our Nation secure. Porous borders are an invitation to  criminals, terrorists, and other dangerous individuals. And let us be  very clear: There are dangerous individuals out there right now who  would like to enter and harm our country. Porous borders are an  invitation to those types of individuals.   Since the beginning of the month, four Iranians considered to be  ``special interest aliens''--individuals, that is, who may pose a  threat to the United States--have been apprehended at the southern  border in Texas. Now, all told, thousands of special interest aliens--a  number of them from Middle Eastern countries--have been apprehended at  our southern border in the past 2 years.   During fiscal year 2023, 151 individuals on the Terrorist Watchlist  were apprehended attempting to illegally cross our southern border-- 151. As a recent news story noted, ``that figure is more than the total  of the previous six . . . years combined.''   That same story also notes:         In the first two weeks of the fiscal year, the CBP sources       told Fox News that agents had apprehended more than 30       Iranians, nearly 60 Syrians, 35 Pakistanis, more than 100       Russians, 285 Afghans and nearly 2,000 Chinese migrants at       the southern border.    ``[M]ore than 30 Iranians, nearly 60 Syrians, 35 Pakistanis, more  than 100 Russians, 285 Afghans and nearly 2,000 Chinese migrants at the  southern border''--now, it is likely that many of those individuals are  simply in search of the promise the United States offers of a better  life. But it is also entirely possible that some of these individuals-- some of them from intensely hostile countries like Iran--had more  malign intentions. And while Customs and Border Protection apprehended  the individuals I have mentioned so far, it is not only possible, but  likely, that similarly concerning individuals have entered our country  undetected.   Since President Biden took office, there have been more than 1.5  million known ``got-aways'' at the southern borders. Those are  individuals that Border Patrol saw but was unable to apprehend. And we  can only imagine the number of unknown ``got-aways'' who have sneaked  into the country. Those are people they didn't see. They have no idea.   How many of those individuals are from hostile countries or are on  the Terrorist Watchlist or are members of cartels that target literally  every State in the Union and are fueling the fentanyl epidemic? The  truth of the matter is we just don't know, but it is a good bet that,  among the ``got-aways'' were dangerous individuals who should not be  entering our country.   Now, I don't need to tell anyone that the situation at our southern  border right now is disastrous. All signs point to fiscal year 2023  being the third recordbreaking year of attempted illegal crossings at  the southern border under the Biden administration's watch. The number  of attempted illegal crossings at the southern border last month alone  has been estimated to be somewhere in the range of 270,000 people,  which would make it the highest monthly number ever recorded.   Customs and Border Protection is overstretched--to put it mildly--and  has been for pretty much the entirety of the Biden administration. We  could scarcely be sending a more welcoming signal to criminals,  terrorists, and other dangerous individuals if we put out a welcome  mat. Why wouldn't dangerous individuals like this take advantage of the  chaos at the border to slip into our country undetected?   The Director of the FBI recently warned of copycat attacks in the  United States after Hamas's deadly attack on Israel, and a September  threat assessment from the Department of Homeland Security noted:         Terrorist and criminal actors may exploit the elevated flow       [of migration] and increasingly complex security environment       to enter the United States.    If we want to keep our country secure, we are going to have to get  the situation at our southern border under control now. I am glad that  President Biden has finally conceded that a border wall is part of the  solution, but it must be backed up with the willingness to fully  enforce our laws.   In the coming weeks, I expect that we are going to take up a  supplemental spending bill to address support for our allies and to  provide additional funding that our military may need. I hope--and will  work to ensure--that that legislation also includes measures to help  secure our southern border.   I have said it before, and I will say it again: If we don't get  national security right, the rest is conversation. And securing our  border is an indispensable part of national security.   The terrorist attack on Israel on October 7 should be all the  reminder we need of the importance of being constantly on guard against  those who would seek to ruin our Nation and to do us harm.   And I hope that, in the wake of this attack, President Biden and  congressional Democrats will join Republicans to make both  strengthening our military and securing our border a priority.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from South Carolina (Mr. Scott).
