 Mr. President, I rise to express my strong opposition to  President Trump's nomination of Scott Pruitt to be the next  Administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency.   The reason is simple. In a choice between corporate polluters and  people who want to breathe air and drink water, Scott Pruitt sides with  the corporate polluters. He has no business being the head of the EPA.   During his nomination hearing, Mr. Pruitt had countless opportunities  to answer for his record. His responses were flippant, evasive, and  outright misleading. He has been asked repeatedly to provide records  from his office concerning dealings with big oil companies, but he told  the Senators that, hey, they should submit an open records request,  hoping that his confirmation would be over long before those documents  would see the light of day.   Just a few hours ago, an Oklahoma district court judge ordered a dose  of sunshine for Mr. Pruitt's dirty dealings from his perch as attorney  general of Oklahoma. The judge has demanded that Mr. Pruitt cough up  more than thousands of emails pertaining to his cozy relationship with  Big Oil--emails he has been hiding from Oklahoma open records requests  for over 2 years, but the Republican leadership is not interested in  waiting. Its plan is to jam this nomination through tomorrow--4 days  before the emails are slated to become public.   Are you kidding me?   If those emails show corruption, every Senator should have that  information before--not after--they vote to put someone in charge of  the EPA who may be there for years.   Clean air and clean water used to be a nonpartisan issue. In earlier  decades, leaders in both parties had the courage to say no to  suffocating smog and towering plumes of toxic chemicals poisoning our  children. Republicans and Democrats came together, and together they  declared that access to clean air and clean water was a basic right for  all Americans. We passed the Clean Air Act, and we passed the Clean  Water Act. We updated those laws when necessary, and we did those  things together.   Together, we depend on the Environmental Protection Agency for three  critical reasons: The EPA is the cop on the beat, protecting American  families from corporate polluters that would put profit ahead of  safety. It watches out for us and for our children; the EPA exists  because pollution knows no State borders. What is burned at the  powerplant in Ohio is breathed by children across Massachusetts; and  the EPA takes on the ever-changing task of researching, monitoring, and  regulating toxic emissions because the job is far too great for any one  State to tackle.   To do all of this, the EPA routinely turns to local governments,  businesses, and innovative workers for local solutions; the EPA turned  to the University of Massachusetts to create a research center to  assist smalltown water systems; the EPA turned to towns along Cape Cod  and on Martha's Vineyard to pursue innovative solutions to increase  coastal resiliency as sea levels have risen; and the EPA recently  recognized New Bedford's exceptional work in monitoring industrial  waste discharge in the city's collection system.   Across Massachusetts and across the Nation, the EPA sets big national  goals that help inspire ingenious local solutions. The EPA is one of  our great successes as a nation, but that success has not come without  a fight. Each time the EPA has taken a step to clean our air, industry  has poured more and more money into the debate, yelling that regulation  is just too costly and that companies can never survive if they have to  clean up their act.   In the 40 years following the Clean Air Act, emissions of common air  pollutants fell nearly 70 percent while the number of private sector  jobs doubled. Industry talks about the costs of pollution controls  because dirty is cheap. Clean air saves more than 160,000 lives each  year. Clean air saves more than 3 million schooldays our children would  have collectively lost. Clean air saves 13 million workdays the hard- working, healthy Americans simply can't afford to miss.   Scott Pruitt doesn't measure success by this yardstick. No. He  measures success by how happy his corporate donors are. As Big Oil's  go-to attorney general from Oklahoma, Pruitt has spent the last 6 years  trying to silence the lifesaving, data-driven work of dedicated EPA  employees and scientists. And now, those big polluters have their  fantasy EPA nominee--someone who will work on their side and not on the  side of the American people.    How about a couple of examples. When EPA issued a rule to limit  mercury, arsenic, and other toxic chemical emissions from coal  powerplants, Mr. Pruitt questioned whether mercury poses a health  hazard. Mercury is a well-known neurotoxin. It means that it poisons  the nervous system. And Scott Pruitt thinks he should question whether  it poses any health hazard. Wow.   Or maybe it is this example. When the EPA moved to reduce leaks of  methane, a greenhouse gas that is 30 times more potent than  CO2, he turned the Oklahoma AG's office into a clearinghouse  for big oil to pursue lawsuits attacking the EPA. Scott Pruitt has  spent so much time with his campaign donors that he honestly appears  incapable of understanding the difference between the financial  interests of millionaires who run giant oil companies and the health  and well-being of the 4  [[Page S1272]]  million human beings who actually live in Oklahoma.   The people need a voice more than ever. For generations, Oklahoma has  had very few earthquakes. Then, oil companies decided to up production,  to pull every last drop of oil out of the ground. But with every drop  of oil came useless, toxic radioactive salt water waste, and it has to  go somewhere. So they took the cheapest option available: Pump billions  of barrels of wastewater deep underground, under immense pressure, and  that is when the problems started. Suddenly, earthquakes--big  earthquakes with a magnitude of 3.0 and above, started occurring every  day across Oklahoma.   Here was Mr. Pruitt, the State attorney general, the people's lawyer.  What did he do? Did he seek relief for the families that were stiffed  by insurance companies? Did he join residents who were suing to stop  the drilling while their homes crumbled? Did he even pretend to do  something--you know, like maybe issue a strongly worded press release  supporting frightened citizens? No, not Mr. Pruitt. No, Mr. Pruitt  stood by his friends in the oil industry, and the heck with everybody  else.   Mr. Pruitt has been consistent in his work for big oil. As attorney  general, he dismantled the environmental protection unit in his  office--dismantled the environmental protection unit. He appointed a  billionaire oil man to be his 2014 campaign chair, and he ignored the  citizens he was sworn to protect. That is the measure of Mr. Pruitt as  a public servant.   A State attorney general is supposed to serve the people. Right now,  Massachusetts attorney general Maura Healey is leading the case to  prove that ExxonMobil deliberately deceived the public about the impact  of climate change on our economy, our environment, our health, and our  future. Good for Maura. Did Scott Pruitt join that suit? Of course not.  Pruitt ran to the defense of one of the world's largest corporations,  whining about how that corporation felt bullied. Instead of working as  the attorney general for Oklahoma, Mr. Pruitt has served as the  attorney general for Exxon.   Finally, Scott Pruitt has the nerve to say that the cause of climate  change is ``subject to more debate.'' More debate? We had that debate  in the 1980s, in the 1990s, in the 2000s. Maybe Mr. Pruitt missed it,  buried under a pile of big oil money.   So let me just offer a summary. For well over a century, we spewed  fossil fuel filth into our atmosphere. And, yes, this allowed us to  fuel the thirsty appetite of our 20th century economy. But that  blistering pace came at a price.   Our planet is getting hotter. Our coasts are threatened by furious  storm surges that sweep away homes and devastate our largest cities.  Our poorest neighborhoods are one bad storm away from being under  water. Our naval bases are under attack--not by enemy ships but by  rising seas; droughts and wildfires are all too familiar across the  country. Refugees are fleeing homes that are no longer livable. And the  risk of rapidly spreading diseases like malaria and Zika is on the  rise.   Our coastal communities don't have time for politicians who deny  science. Our farmers don't have time for more debate. Our children  don't have time for more cowards who will not stand up to big oil  companies defrauding the American people.   Scott Pruitt has been working hard for big oil to dismantle the EPA,  and now, President Trump wants to give him that chance.   Where are the Senators who will stand up for the health, the welfare,  and the safety of their citizens? Where are the Senators who will stand  up for the people's right to breathe clean air and drink clean water?  Where are the Senators who will have the courage to demand action on  climate change so that our children will have a chance to inherent a  livable Earth?   In the end, despite this despicable record, if the Republicans link  arms again, there will not be enough of us to stop this nomination. But  make no mistake, if President Trump wants a fight over the health of  our children, a fight over the creation of clean energy jobs, a fight  over the very future of our planet, then we will fight every step of  the way.   We will fight alongside moms and dads who know the terror of a  childhood asthma attack. We will fight alongside the cancer victims. We  will fight alongside the fishermen and the hunters. We will fight  alongside the families of Flint, MI, and everywhere else in America  where families cannot safely turn on their water taps or step outside  and take a deep breath.   We are all in this together.   People in Massachusetts care deeply about preserving a safe and  healthy environment for our kids and our grandkids. We see it as a  moral question. And I receive letters from people all across the State,  describing how important clean air and clean water are to them and how  worried they are about what Scott Pruitt leading the EPA will mean for  our most vital natural resources. I hear those concerns and I share  those concerns.   I would like to read just a few of the many letters that I have  received about this nomination.   Edward from Dennis wrote to me on behalf of the Association to  Preserve Cape Cod about the importance of the EPA to coastal  communities in Massachusetts. Here is Edward's letter:         The Association to Preserve Cape Cod (APCC), the Cape Cod       region's leading nonprofit environmental education and       advocacy organization, writes to state our strong opposition       to the appointment of Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt       for the position of Administrator of the Environmental       Protection Agency. We urge you to vote against his       nomination.        APCC is deeply concerned that Mr. Pruitt's record of       vigorously opposing the efforts of the EPA to protect the       nation's water and air quality is in direct conflict with his       responsibilities as EPA Administrator to ensure that the       agency's important work continues. In fact, his record       clearly shows that his loyalties side with polluters       instead of with the environment and the welfare of the       American people. Of particular concern is Mr. Pruitt's       refusal to accept the science of climate change and the       implications this has for EPA's ongoing efforts to reduce       greenhouse gas emissions.        In addition, the EPA has most recently played a vital role       in furthering efforts to protect and restore water quality       through its Southeast New England Program (SNEP) for       Watershed Restoration, a program that has greatly benefited       coastal communities in Rhode Island and southeastern       Massachusetts. We worry that important initiatives such as       the SNEP program, which was originally proposed by Senator       Reed with the strong support from each of you, will be in       jeopardy under the oversight of Mr. Pruitt, should he be       confirmed as EPA Administrator.        The New England states, as well as the entire nation, have       made significant strides forward in addressing the protection       of our air and water. However, much more needs to be       accomplished. With so much at stake, we cannot afford to step       backward in our effort to protect the environment. We,       therefore, urge you to oppose the nomination of Mr. Pruitt       for EPA Administrator.    Thanks, Edward, for writing, and thanks to all of you at the  Association to Preserve Cape Cod for the work you are doing every  single day. It makes a real difference.   While all sorts of people have written to my office about Mr. Pruitt,  I have noticed that a lot of people are writing in about kids--their  kids, kids they work with, or just kids in general. My constituents are  concerned about Scott Pruitt's commitment to protecting the air our  kids breathe and the water they drink, and I share those concerns.   I heard from Mary in Worcester, who is concerned about the effects of  environmental toxins like lead on children. She is concerned both as a  parent and as a family doctor. Here is what Mary had to say:         With so much focus in Washington on ensuring politicians       are held to a strong ethical standard, I ask you to oppose       the nomination of Scott Pruitt as EPA Administrator. I wrote       to you yesterday asking the same, but after the hearing       yesterday, it is increasingly clear that Mr. Pruitt is unfit.        In addition to being a parent, I am also a Family Medicine       physician. Rarely, I see children who are exposed to lead       through environmental sources. This is rare because lead has       been regulated, and as such rates of lead poisoning, and the       accompanying irreversible brain damage, have plummeted.        But yesterday Mr. Pruitt revealed that he knows nothing       about this issue, responding to Senator Cardin, ``Senator,       that is something I have not reviewed nor know about.''        I continue to ask you to oppose him and to encourage       colleagues to do the same.    Thank you for writing, Mary. That is why I am here tonight--to  encourage my colleagues to oppose him.   I heard from Elizabeth in Belchertown, as well. Here is what she  wrote:         As a resident of MA and a teacher of AP Environmental       Science in a public high  [[Page S1273]]       school in western MA, I am writing to express my concern       about the appointment of Scott Pruitt as director of the EPA.       He appears to be the exact opposite of the qualifications and       perspective of a person who should have that position. As you       know, he has close ties to fossil fuels, has repeatedly sued       the EPA, avoided mercury legislation, and espoused the belief       that the EPA is too powerful. I urge you to work with other       Senators to block this appointment.    Thank you, Elizabeth. The work that you are doing, that teachers are  doing, is more vital than ever now, and I share your concerns. Thank  you.   A man from Boston wrote to me with concerns about Scott Pruitt's ties  to fossil fuel companies, and here is what he said:         As a constituent who cares about our environment, I want       you to know I am deeply concerned about the nomination of       Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.        Scott Pruitt is firmly in the pocket of the oil and gas       industry. He is not concerned with the world we leave for our       children. As a father and an educator, I am fighting his       nomination because I have a responsibility to care about the       world I leave children and not merely the wealth my cronies       accumulate.        Pruitt has actively worked to dismantle protections for       clean air and clean water that people and birds need to       thrive. The EPA must adhere to science and support common-      sense solutions for ensuring a healthy environment and stable       climate for people and wildlife.        Please oppose confirming Scott Pruitt and demand a nominee       instead who will represent the vast majority of Americans--      regardless of party affiliation--who support strong action       and safeguards for our air, water, and climate.    I couldn't agree more with what he said.   Wendy from Newton wrote to me about the concerns as well. Here is  what she had to say:         Dear Senator, I am appalled and scared by the possibility       of Scott Pruitt to head the EPA. It will be disgraceful if he       is confirmed. To appoint someone who stands against       everything that agency is for is cynical, disrespectful and       dangerous in this urgent time of climate change. Now more       than ever we need a strong EPA that believes in science and       will protect us from environmental disaster. I hope you will       do everything you possibly can to fight against Pruitt       getting confirmed.    Thank you for writing.   I also heard from Arlene in Wayland, who is worried about what the  future of the EPA means for her two grandchildren. Here is what she had  to say:         Senator Warren, please assure your constituents that you       will not support Scott Pruitt's nomination to head the EPA.       Mr. Pruitt is an enemy of the agency and of the future of our       environment. He has stood in the way of the agency's purpose       to protect our air and water. He is ignorant of the findings       of climate science and medical studies on toxicity, has dealt       dishonestly with Congress, and is so obviously in the pocket       of the fossil fuel industry. Please use your considerable       persuasiveness and rigor to convince your colleagues in the       Senate to ditch his nomination. The future of my two       grandchildren depends on it. Thank you.    Thank you for your note, Arlene. I am doing my best, and so are the  rest of the Democrats. We just need some Republicans to help us out  here.   Joan from Maynard reached out to me about her experience working with  children who have suffered from lead poisoning. Here is what Joan  wrote:         I have been an Educational Advocate for children with       disabilities for 24 years. I've worked with children who       suffer from lead poisoning, and they are heartbreaking. Even       the smallest exposure has life-long profound consequences. I       haven't personally seen anything the level of what has       happened in Flint, MI, but I know that it's a tragedy for a       generation of children in Flint.        Pollution of our waters is just one of the risks we face if       Scott Pruitt is approved. There are countless more, many       evident and others not readily apparent, but ready to unfold.       Please, please fight this appointment in every way you can.    Thank you, Joan, for writing and for the important work you do.  Believe me, I am fighting in every way I can.   A man from North Falmouth wrote to me, worried that the progress we  have made on protecting public health and the future of our planet is  in danger. Here is what he said:         Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt is a lifelong ally       of corporate polluters. Pruitt's nomination is a clear threat       to the nation's public health and the progress made on       common-sense pollution standards. I cannot tolerate the       appointment of a fossil fuel cheerleader to lead the nation's       environmental protection efforts. In 2014, Pruitt literally       acted as a messenger between Devon Energy and the EPA in an       attempt to stifle public health protections.        Please continue to defend the Clean Power Plan and methane       pollution standards against the influence of the fossil fuel       industry. 64% of Americans are concerned about climate       change, we deserve a leader who will take action to protect       air quality.    Thanks for writing. I really appreciate it.   Since President Trump nominated Mr. Pruitt, I have received hundreds  of letters like these from people in Massachusetts who are worried  about what he will mean for the environment and for the future of our  planet, but I have also heard from the experts, people who understand  the ins and outs of the EPA and its mission. Hundreds of former EPA  employees who have serious concerns about Mr. Pruitt's record on the  environment sent a letter to me and my colleagues here in the Senate.  Here is what they wrote:         We write as former employees of the Environmental       Protection Agency (EPA) to share our concerns about Oklahoma       Attorney General Scott Pruitt's qualifications to serve as       the next EPA Administrator in light of his record in       Oklahoma. Our perspective is not partisan. Having served       under both Republican and Democratic presidents, we recognize       each new Administration's right to pursue different policies       within the parameters of existing law and to ask Congress to       change the laws that protect public health and the       environment as it sees fit.        However, every EPA Administrator has a fundamental       obligation to act in the public's interest based on current       law and the best available science. Mr. Pruitt's record       raises serious concerns about whose interests he has served       to date and whether he agrees with the longstanding tenets of       U.S. environmental law.        Our nation has made tremendous progress in ensuring that       every American has clean air to breathe, clean water to drink       and uncontaminated land on which to live, work and play.       Anyone who visits Beijing is reminded of what some cities in       the U.S. once looked like before we went to work as a people       to combat pollution. Much of the EPA's work involves       preserving those gains, which should not be taken for       granted. There are also emerging new threats as well as       serious gaps in our environmental safety net, as the       drinking water crisis in Flint, Michigan, painfully       demonstrates.        Our environmental laws are based on a partnership that       requires EPA to set national standards and give states       latitude when implementing them so long as certain minimum       criteria are satisfied. This approach recognizes that       Americans have an equal right to clean air and water, no       matter where they live, and allows states to compete for       business without having to sacrifice public health or       environmental quality.        Our environmental laws include provisions directing EPA to       allow for a ``margin of safety'' when assessing risks, which       is intended to limit exposure to pollutants when it is       reasonable to expect they may harm the public health, even       when all the scientific evidence is not yet in. For example,       EPA's first Administrator, Bill Ruckelshaus, chose to limit       the amount of lead in gasoline before all doubt about its       harmfulness to public health was erased. His actions spared       much of the harm that some countries still face as a result       of the devastating effects of lead on human health.       Similarly, early action to reduce exposure to fine particle       pollution helped avoid thousands of premature deaths from       heart and lung disease. The magnitude and severity of those       risks did not become apparent until much later.        Mr. Pruitt's record and public statements strongly suggest       that he does not share the vision or agree with the       underlying principles of our environmental statutes. Mr.       Pruitt has shown no interest in enforcing those laws, a       critically important function for EPA. While serving as       Oklahoma's top law enforcement officer, Mr. Pruitt issued       more than 50 press releases celebrating lawsuits to overturn       EPA standards to limit mercury emissions from power plants,       reduce smog levels in cities and regional haze in parks,       clean up the Chesapeake Bay and control greenhouse emissions.        In contrast, none of Mr. Pruitt's many press releases refer       to any action he has taken to enforce environmental laws or       to actually reduce pollution. This track record likely       reflects his disturbing decision to close the environmental       enforcement unit in his office while establishing a new       litigation team to challenge EPA and other federal agencies.       He has claimed credit for an agreement to protect the       Illinois River that did little more than confirm phosphorus       limits established much earlier, while delaying their       enforcement another three years.        In a similar vein, Mr. Pruitt has gone to disturbing       lengths to advance the views and interests of business. For       example, he signed and sent a letter as Oklahoma Attorney       General criticizing EPA estimates of emissions from oil and       gas wells, without disclosing that it had been drafted in its       entirety by Devon Energy. He filed suit on behalf of Oklahoma       to block a California law requiring humane treatment of       poultry. The federal court dismissed the case after finding       that the lawsuit was brought not to benefit the citizens of       Oklahoma but a handful of large egg producers perfectly       capable of representing their own interests. To mount his       challenge to EPA's rules to reduce carbon pollution from       power plants, he took the unusual step of accepting free help       from a private law firm. In contrast, there is little or  [[Page S1274]]       no evidence of Mr. Pruitt taking initiative to protect and       advance public health and environmental protection in his       state.        Mr. Pruitt's office has apparently acknowledged 3,000       emails and other documents reflecting communications with       certain oil and gas companies, but has yet to make any of       these available in response to a Freedom of Information Act       request filed more than two years ago.        Contrary to the cooperative federalism that he promotes,       Mr. Pruitt has suggested that EPA should refrain from trying       to control pollution that crosses state lines. For example,       he intervened to support a Farm Bureau lawsuit that would       have overturned a cooperative agreement between five states       and EPA to clean up the Chesapeake Bay (the court rejected       the challenge). When asked how a state can protect its       citizens from pollution that originates outside its borders,       Mr. Pruitt said in his Senate testimony that states should       resolve these disputes on their own, with EPA providing       ``informational'' support once an agreement is reached. But       the 1972 Clean Water Act directs EPA to review state water       quality plans, require any improvements needed to make waters       ``fishable and swimmable,'' and to review and approve plans       to limit pollutant loads to protect water quality. EPA's       power to set standards and limit pollution that crosses state       lines is exactly what ensures every American clean air and       water, and gives states the incentive to negotiate and       resolve transboundary disputes.        We are most concerned about Mr. Pruitt's reluctance to       accept and to act on the strong scientific consensus on       climate change and act accordingly. Our country's own       National Research Council, the principal operating arm of the       National Academies of Science and Engineering, concluded in a       2010 report requested by Congress that human activity is       altering the climate to an extent that poses grave risks to       Americans' health and welfare. More recent scientific data       and analyses have only confirmed the Council's conclusion       and added to the urgency of addressing the problem.        Despite this and other authoritative warnings about the       dangers of climate change, Mr. Pruitt persists in pointing to       uncertainty about the precise extent of humanity's       contribution to the problem as a basis for resisting taking       any regulatory action to help solve it. At his Senate       confirmation hearing, he stated that ``science tells us that       the climate is changing, and that human activity in some       manner impacts that change. The ability to measure with       precision the degree and extent of that impact, and what to       do about it, are subject to continuing debate and dialogue,       and well it should be.'' This is a familiar dodge--      emphasizing uncertainty about the precise amount of       humanity's contribution while ignoring the broad scientific       consensus that human activities are largely responsible for       dangerous warming of our planet and that action is urgently       needed before it is too late.        Mr. Pruitt's indulgence in this dodge raises the       fundamental question of whether he agrees with the       precautionary principle reflected in our nation's       environmental statutes. Faithful execution of our       environmental laws requires effectively combating climate       change to minimize its potentially catastrophic impacts       before it is too late.        The American people have been served by EPA Administrators,       Republicans and Democrats, who have embraced their       responsibility to protect public health and the environment.       Different administrators have come to different conclusions       about how best to apply the law in view of the science, and       many of their decisions have been challenged in court,       sometimes successfully, for either going too far or not far       enough. But in the large majority of cases it was evident to       us that they put the public's welfare ahead of private       interests. Scott Pruitt has not demonstrated this same       commitment.        Thank you for considering our views.    Thank you to all who signed that letter and for the incredibly  important work that you have done to protect our environment. I am with  you all the way.   Next, I wish to read an article published by The Atlantic that uses  Scott Pruitt's actions to critique his appointment to head the EPA.  Actions speak volumes louder than words, and his tell a pretty  compelling story of exactly how he will lead the Agency. Here is what  it says:         While broad strokes of Trump's policies were never in       doubt, there was often enough bizarreness to wonder what he       would do with the powers of the Environmental Protection       Agency.        On Wednesday, those questions were all but settled. Trump       has chosen E. Scott Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma,       to lead the EPA. . . .        In a certain light, Pruitt is an inspired choice to lead       the EPA, as he has made fighting the agency a hallmark of his       career. His own website calls him ``a leading advocate       against the EPA's activist agenda.'' The significance could       not be more clear: As he promised on the trail, Trump will       likely use the powers of the presidency and the legal       expertise of Pruitt to block or weaken the Obama       administration's attempts to fight climate change.        And Trump will be able to try for more than that. For what       distinguishes Pruitt's career is not just his opposition to       using regulations to tackle climate change, but his       opposition to using regulation to tackle any environmental       problem at all. Since he was elected Oklahoma's attorney       general, in 2010, Pruitt has racked up a sizable record--      impressive in its number of lawsuits if not in its number of       victories--of suing the EPA.        Many of these suits did not target climate-related       policies. Instead, they singled out anti-pollution measures,       initiated under presidential administrations, that tend to be       popular with the public.        In 2014, for instance, Pruitt sued to block the EPA's       Regional Haze Rule. The rule is built on a 15-year old       program meant to ensure that air around national parks is       especially clear. Pruitt lost his case.        Last year, he sued to block a rule restricting how much       mercury could be emitted into the air by coal plants. He lost       that, too.        And early in his tenure, he sued to keep the EPA from       settling lawsuits brought by environmental groups like the       Sierra Club. That one was dismissed.        He has brought other suits against EPA anti-pollution       programs--like one against new rules meant to reduce the       amount of ozone in the air--that haven't been heard in court       yet. While ozone is beneficial to humans high in the       atmosphere, it can be intensely damaging when it accumulates       at ground level, worsening asthma and inducing premature       deaths. The American Lung Association calls it ``one of the       most dangerous'' pollutants in the United States.        All this is not to say that Pruitt has omitted climate       regulations from his litigation. His most common target has       been the Clean Power Plan, the Obama administration's set of       Clean Air Act rules meant to reduce greenhouse gas emissions       from power plants. The Clean Power Plan is Obama's main       mechanism for pushing the United States to meet its pledge       under the Paris Agreement.        Pruitt began suing the EPA to block the Clean Power Plan       more than two years ago. Now, Oklahoma is one of the 28       states challenging the agency in court, and it helped succeed       in getting the Supreme Court to block the rules in February.        But Pruitt's understanding of the bill seems not entirely       legally minded in two significant ways. First, Pruitt's       knowledge of global warming appears to be lacking, at best.       Earlier this year, for instance, he wrote in the National       Review that ``scientists continue to disagree about the       degree and the extent of global warming and its connection to       the actions of mankind.''        While this sounds reasonable, it is not true. The       overwhelming consensus among scientists who study the Earth       is that humans are largely to blame for the planet's warming.       Climate scientists understood this to be the case since at       least the early 1990s, and since then, scholarly consensus on       the issue has only strengthened. The majority of scientists       also believe that global warming will be quite harmful; the       scientific debate about its ``degree and extent'' is only       about how bad it will be and how soon its consequences will       kick in.        Second, Pruitt has worked extremely closely with oil and       gas companies in opposing the plan. In one case, a New York       Times investigation revealed that Pruitt sent an official       letter to the EPA, bearing his signature and letterhead, that       had been almost completely written by lawyers at Devon       Energy, a major oil and gas company. It was delivered to       Pruitt's office by Devon's chief lobbyist.        Energy firms and lobbyists, including Devon, have donated       generously to the Republican Attorneys General Association,       which Pruitt has led. In interviews after the Times report,       Pruitt described the collaboration as a kind of constituent       service, saying that Devon is based in Oklahoma City. He       agreed with the letter's legal reasoning, he said, so he       signed it.        ``I don't think there is anything secretive in what we've       done,'' Pruitt told The Oklahoman. ``We've been very open       about the efforts of my office in responding to federal       overreach.''        Now Pruitt could be the one doing the federal reaching.       Environmental groups immediately condemned Trump's selection       of him. ``The EPA plays an absolutely vital role in enforcing       long-standing policies that protect the health and safety of       Americans, based on the best available science,'' said Ken       Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, in a       statement. ``Pruitt has a clear record of hostility to the       EPA's mission, and he is a completely inappropriate choice to       lead it.''        Once, it had seemed like perhaps Trump--who speaks often of       his adoration for clean air and clean water--would bypass       those old fights and only target Obama's new climate rules.       But with Pruitt leading his EPA, it seems that Trump's       administration will act like its GOP predecessors. Whether it       is successful depends on the Senate, on the courts, and on       how well environmental advocates make their case to the       public.    Finally, I wish to share a few excerpts from an in-depth New York  Times article that uncovered Scott Pruitt's extensive ties to energy  companies. The article clearly explains the massive conflicts of  interest that Mr. Pruitt would face as Administrator of the EPA. Here  is what it says:         The letter to the Environmental Protection Agency from       Attorney General Scott Pruitt of Oklahoma carried a blunt       accusation: Federal regulators were grossly overestimating       the amount of air pollution  [[Page S1275]]       caused by energy companies drilling new natural gas wells in       his state.        But Mr. Pruitt left out one critical point. The three-page       letter was written by lawyers for Devon Energy, one of       Oklahoma's biggest oil and gas companies, and was delivered       to him by Devon's chief of lobbying.        ``Outstanding!'' William F. Whitsitt, who at the time       directed the government relations at the company, said in a       note to Mr. Pruitt's office. The attorney general's staff had       taken Devon's draft, copied it onto state government       stationery with only a few word changes, and sent it to       Washington with the attorney general's signature. ``The       timing of the letter is great, given our meeting this Friday       with both the E.P.A. and the White House.''        Mr. Whitsitt then added, ``Please pass along Devon's thanks       to Attorney General Pruitt.''        The email exchange from October 2011, obtained through an       open-records request, offers a hint of the unprecedented,       secretive alliance that Mr. Pruitt and other Republican       attorneys general have formed with some of the nation's top       energy producers to push back against the Obama regulatory       agenda, an investigation by the New York Times has found.        Out of public view, corporate representatives and attorneys       general are coordinating legal strategy and other efforts to       fight federal regulations, according to a review of thousands       of emails and court documents and dozens of interviews.        For Mr. Pruitt, the benefits have been clear. Lobbyists and       company officials have been notably solicitous, helping him       raise his profile as president for two years of the       Republican Attorneys General Association, a post he used to       help start what he and his allies called the Rule of Law       Campaign, which was intended to push back against Washington.        ``We are living in the midst of a constitutional crisis,''       Mr. Pruitt told energy industry lobbyists and conservative       state legislators at a conference in Dallas in July, after       being welcomed with a standing ovation. ``The trajectory of       our nation is at risk and at stake as we respond to what is       going on.''        Mr. Pruitt has responded aggressively and with a lot of       helping hands. Energy industry lobbyists drafted letters for       him to send to the EPA, the Interior Department, the       Office of Management and Budget, and even President Obama,       the Times found.        Industries that he regulates have joined him as plaintiffs       in court challenges, a departure from the usual role of a       state attorney general, who traditionally sues companies to       force compliance with state law.        Energy industry lobbyists have also distributed draft       legislation to attorneys general and asked them to help push       it through state legislatures to give the attorneys general       clearer authority to challenge the Obama regulatory agenda,       the documents show. And it is an emerging practice that       several attorneys general say threatens the integrity of the       office.    The message is clear across Massachusetts and across the Nation: Big  Oil's go-to attorney general is Scott Pruitt, and he has no business  running the EPA. He has proven over and over again that he will put  short-term industry profits ahead of the health of our children. This  nominee has no interest in protecting every American's right to breathe  clean air and drink clean water. We cannot put someone so opposed to  the goals of the EPA in charge of that very Agency.   For these reasons, I will be voting no on Scott Pruitt. I urge my  colleagues to do the same.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a fellow on  my staff, Brian Clark, be granted floor privileges for the remainder of  this session.
