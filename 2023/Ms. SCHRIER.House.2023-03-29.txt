 Mr. Chairman, just last year, we made the largest  investment in clean energy technology and climate science ever. The  intention is to spur research and innovation in cutting-edge  technologies and then accelerate development and construction of a  modernized electric grid, solar and wind farms, modular nuclear  reactors, and improved hydropower. However, none of that funding will  actually affect climate change if we can't streamline the permitting  process.   Frankly, it is pretty exciting to me to think about permitting reform  as an area where Democrats and Republicans can work together, but let's  be clear that speeding up the permitting process does not mean throwing  all environmental protections out the window. That is essentially what  today's bill, H.R. 1, their top priority, does today.   It doesn't streamline permitting. It undermines environmental  protections and is a huge handout to fossil fuel companies, in some  cases allowing them to avoid environmental regulations altogether. It  pushes our energy system in the wrong direction.    There is urgency to shift to energy sources that don't emit  greenhouse gases. Some of the glaciers on Mount Rainier in my district  have already disappeared. That is why we do need to improve the  permitting process.   However, the bill we are addressing today decimates that process,  putting natural resources at risk and fast-tracking more drilling for  oil and gas and mining for minerals on our public lands.  [[Page H1558]]    By the way, there are already 9,000 permits out there for oil and gas  extraction that aren't even being used, and oil and gas companies are  making record-shattering profits right now, quarter over quarter. They  don't need another gift from Congress.   It is time to prioritize clean energy projects, and it is those  permits that require the most expediency.   This bill isn't permitting reform, and it won't cut costs for  American families. When they are ready, I look forward to working with  my colleagues on real, serious, pragmatic permitting reform that will  allow for the quickest possible transition to cleaner sources. We owe  it to generations we will never know.                                time  1445
