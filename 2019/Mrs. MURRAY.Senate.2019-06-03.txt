 Mr. President, as ranking member on the Senate  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, I wish to honor a  public servant who established a remarkable legacy as a passionate  champion for gender equality, Lenora Lapidus.   Lenora fought for the rights of all Americans. Over the course of her  career, Lenora distinguished herself as a civil rights leader. She  began working at the ACLU in 1988 as a summer intern and rose to serve  as legal director of the ACLU of New Jersey and led the Women's Rights  Project since 2001. At the ACLU, Lenora fought tirelessly in the courts  on behalf of women and girls, winning cases that pushed us to respond  to gender-based violence and ensured that combat positions in the  military were open to all Americans, among many other cases.   Lenora was also a tireless champion for improving lives through  policy. She played an important role in the Be HEARD Act, legislation I  introduced this Congress along with many others, which is the first  comprehensive plan to fight harassment in the workplace. Lenora made  sure the fight for gender equality included all women, including low- wage workers whose stories are too often ignored or forgotten. Her  legacy is a testament to the work and passion she brought to every  fight against injustice. Lenora is irreplaceable, and her loss will be  felt by all of us who worked with her.   I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing the life and  important work of Lenora.                            ____________________
