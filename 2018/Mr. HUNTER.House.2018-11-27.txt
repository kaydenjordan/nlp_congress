 Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank Chairman Shuster for  giving me the opportunity to serve for nearly 6 years as the chairman  of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, and I  would like to thank him for yielding me time.                                time  1830    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 140, the Frank LoBiondo  Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018. Congressman LoBiondo is and has  been a tireless advocate for the men and women of the Coast Guard, and  there is no other name more fitting for this bill.   Let me run through a few of the things that I find extremely great  about this bill.   Title 9 contains the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act, legislation  that I have introduced for three consecutive Congresses. It was  compromised a little bit in the Senate but is still getting done.   Mr. Garamendi and I held many, many subcommittee hearings together.  He has been known to ask at the appropriate hearings about the backup  to GPS. This question is always met with blank stares. This bill makes  important progress on a backup GPS system.   Finally, specifically section 514 establishes this backup timing  component of the GPS system. That is no doubt thanks to Mr. Garamendi's  tireless work.   I am also pleased that the legislation establishes a land-based  unmanned aircraft system program for the Coast Guard. They have never  had their unmanned aerial vehicle program until now. They have had to  rely on other services or agencies for this important capability. These  additional UAS assets will strengthen the Coast Guard's ability to  interdict contraband and improve search and rescue missions.   During the last 6 years, we have held 46 hearings and five  roundtables. We have worked to protect the Jones Act and ensure that  our country has a strong maritime industrial base, including a skilled  pool of American shipyard workers and mariners who would be critical in  a time of conflict.   Earlier this year, Congress enacted legislation coming out of the  tragic El Faro accident to improve the safety of those American  mariners. We have also worked to reduce burdensome regulations that  harm U.S. maritime jobs and the competitiveness of the U.S. flag fleet.   We held joint hearings with the Committee on Homeland Security to  shed light on security vulnerabilities at our ports and sought to  enhance the screening of cargo entering our country and, with the Armed  Services Committee, to look at the shared missions of the Navy and the  Coast Guard in carrying out defense missions. We pushed the Coast Guard  to act like the military service that they are.   The subcommittee also took massive steps to modernize our Nation's  icebreaker fleet and to encourage the Navy and Coast Guard to have a  comprehensive plan for the Arctic.   Mr. Speaker, I want to end by thanking a few people. Some of the most  fulfilling work serving as the subcommittee chairman was forming strong  relationships with the men and women who guard our coasts. The Coast  Guard House Liaison Office and the Coast Guard fellows assigned to the  subcommittee over the last 6 years have represented their service well.  I would like to thank them for their hard work and camaraderie.   I also want to thank Congressman Garamendi for his friendship and  being such a strong partner on these issues.   Finally, I want to thank the subcommittee's staff director, John  Rayfield, and the exceptional committee staff who have been invaluable  as a resource and worked tirelessly to carry out the subcommittee's  mission.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the  legislation.
