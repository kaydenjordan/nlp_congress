 Madam Speaker, I am so incredibly honored to be appointed  to the Select Committee studying economic disparities and fairness in  growth. I welcome my Republican colleagues.   I am especially grateful to be taking a fresh look at how we build  economic growth in our rural communities. The challenges facing rural  America, while longstanding, have been made even more urgent as a  result of the COVID-19 public health crisis. In Congress, it is our  responsibility and our moral duty to respond to the unique needs of our  rural communities.   Right now, in small towns across my district a lack of reliable  internet access is preventing entrepreneurs from growing their small  businesses. Higher insurance premiums and out-of-pocket healthcare  costs are putting a strain on families' bottom lines. Access to  healthcare sometimes means driving an hour to the nearest hospital. We  must enter this work with an open mind to examine the issues, and we  must build a roadmap that ensures our rural communities are not left  behind.   To be sure, the Build Back Better Act has many provisions designed to  address growth in rural America, most notably, the President's Rural  Partnership Program, which would empower local communities to shore up  unreliable electric grids, childcare, and support small businesses that  power local communities.   These long overdue investments won't reverse all of the economic  decline we have seen in our rural communities, but it is a start to put  into place an economic foundation that paves the way for consistent,  longstanding growth that has eluded our rural communities for decades.   I came to Congress to deliver these solutions for my constituents,  and now we have an opportunity to step back and examine these issues  with fresh eyes. We cannot let this opportunity pass us by.   Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for all of his work, and I  appreciate the opportunity to be on this Select Committee.
