 Madam President, I rise today in recognition of the  distinct history of Wyoming's Platte County Courthouse. The courthouse  reopens this summer following its first significant renovation in over  a century. For 105 years, the residents of Platte County have  recognized the courthouse as an important landmark and testament to the  county's history. Located in the county seat of Wheatland, WY, the  roots of this historic courthouse are tied to the wild frontier.   After the county's incorporation in 1911, the Platte County Board of  Commissioners agreed to lease office space in the Stock Growers Bank  for $55 per month. Five years later, the commission recognized the need  for a permanent structure to house both the court and jail. Eager to  start, commissioners issued $50,000 in county bonds to finance  construction, subject to voter approval. Residents were passionate  about the campaign for a new courthouse and jail. There were well- reasoned arguments on both sides. On November 7, 1916, the will of the  people won: Platte County would build a new courthouse and jail.   Construction progressed quickly. Commissioners contracted with  architectural firm Baerreson Brothers, based in Denver and Cheyenne,  for initial design plans. By April 6, 1917, the county approved Archie  Allison's bid for general construction. State Grand Master of the  Masonic Lodge, Herbert King of Laramie, dedicated the building's  cornerstone on June 20, 1917. In January 1918, the county completed  work on the courthouse and jail. The total cost, including furnishings,  was $85,000. Since then, generations of dedicated civil servants have  preserved and enhanced the building. The National Park Service  recognized the rich historical value of the courthouse on October 15,  2008, when the building was listed on the National Register of Historic  Places.   Today, the courthouse acts as an archive for the history of Platte  County. It provides a sense of community for its citizens and is an  important gathering place for public activities. Remarkably, in its  105-year history, the Platte County Courthouse has undergone only small  renovations to adapt to changing technology and workplace standards.  That changed in 2018, when voters authorized the county to collect $4.7  million in Specific Purpose Excise Tax--more commonly known as a sixth- penny sales tax. This, plus other reserve funds and grants, allowed the  county to complete $6.5 million in extensive renovations. For the past  18 months, county officials have been temporarily displaced while the  building underwent massive changes. In addition to a brandnew HVAC and  electric system, the renovation includes added insulation, new  plumbing, and a new elevator. The county implemented all of these  designs with an intent to increase efficiency and accessibility.   On July 1, 2023, residents of Platte County will gather to celebrate  this impressive achievement. Officials will host a county-wide  celebration. They plan to commemorate the history of the county and the  generosity and commitment of its citizens.   Platte County is led by these dedicated individuals:         Steve Shockley, Commissioner        Kayla Mantle, Commissioner        Ian Jolovich, Commissioner        Malcolm Ervin, Clerk        Kristi Rietz, Treasurer        David Russell, Sheriff        Doug Weaver, Attorney  [[Page S2182]]         Phil Martin, Coroner        Danette Eppel, Assessor        Hal Hutchinson, Engineer        Terry Stevenson, Emergency Management        Jim DeWitt, Maintenance Supervisor        Doug Dumont, Planning Director        Penny Simonton, Public Health        Beal Angle, Road and Bridge        Mona McAuley, Clerk of the Court        Honorable Edward Buchanan, 8th Judicial District Court       Judge        Honorable F. Scott Peasley, 8th Judicial District Court       Judge        Honorable Nathaniel Hibben, 8th Judicial Circuit Court       Judge        Honorable Clark Allan, 8th Judicial Circuit Court Judge        Magistrate Scott Cole, 8th Judicial District    It is an honor to rise in recognition of this significant milestone  for Platte County. Bobbi joins me in extending our congratulations to  the citizens of Platte County on the lasting legacy of their newly  renovated courthouse.                            ____________________
