 Mr. Speaker, I offer a privileged resolution (H. Res.  1161) and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1161         Resolved, That the Speaker is hereby authorized and       directed to administer the oath of office to Ms. Brenda       Jones, a representative-elect from the 13th Congressional       District of Michigan.    The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I proudly present Brenda Jones as a new  Member of Congress for Michigan's 13th Congressional District for the  remainder of this Congress.   Brenda Jones was elected in a special election earlier this month.  She very much wanted to essentially be faithful to the votes of her  constituents, so all of us are here proudly to be with her.   Her career in public service started in 2005 when she was elected to  the Detroit City Council. My brother was once president of that city  council.   She has subsequently been reelected three times and rose to become  president of the council in 2014 and again in 2018.   Brenda is a former small-business owner, a past president of the  Communication Workers of America Local 4004, and a proud alumnus of  Wayne State University.   We all welcome you here to Congress, especially fellow colleagues  from the Michigan delegation.   But if I may add, the former Speaker is here, Nancy Pelosi. It is so  characteristic of her to join all of us.   In addition to the Michigan delegation, I see others who are here who  either know Brenda Jones or will come to know her in a short period  while she is here in the U.S. Congress.   Mr. Speaker, with those words, I appreciate the chance to address the  House, and I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Jones). I  proudly leave this place to the Member, now, of the House of  Representatives, Brenda Jones.
