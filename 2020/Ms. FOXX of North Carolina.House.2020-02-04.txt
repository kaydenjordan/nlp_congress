 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Jessie Craft, an exemplary Latin teacher at Reagan High School in  Pfafftown, North Carolina.   Simply put, Jessie goes the extra mile to provide his students with a  high-quality education. Instead of relying only on textbook  instruction, he crafts lesson plans that meet the unique needs of his  students. From creating online language tutorial videos to reading and  speaking entirely in Latin, Jessie keeps his students engaged while  unlocking new ways to help them learn pertinent material.   His novel approach serves as a reminder that when educational  innovation is deliberately exercised, students succeed.   Reagan High School is fortunate to have Jessie Craft as a teacher,  and I am confident that he will continue to impact the lives of  students now and in the future.
