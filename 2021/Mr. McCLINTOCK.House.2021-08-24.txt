 Madam Speaker, not long ago, our elections worked  well. We maintained accurate voter registration rolls and routinely  removed people who moved or died.   After all the candidates had their say, on election day, we went to  our local polling place. We brought our children to watch the process  and taught them to respect it.   Our neighbors on the precinct board handed us our ballot after we  identified ourselves and signed the roll. We took  [[Page H4400]]  it into a curtained booth where no one could pressure us to vote a  certain way. We then handed that ballot back to our neighbor, who  placed it in a locked box.   It was very hard to cheat because every ballot had a simple chain of  custody.   The woke left seeks to destroy that process. Where they control the  law, registration is instant, and outdated registrations are rarely  removed. Ballots are sent to every name, followed by partisan  harvesters to collect them. In fact, over 300 mail-in recall ballots  were just found in the possession of a felon passed out in his car in  Torrance, California.   Back in California, you can print ballots on your home printer and  then send them in. Ballots are no longer secret. Family members,  spouses, caregivers, or party hacks can cajole or pressure you as you  cast your vote.   Every fraudulent vote disenfranchises a legitimate voter. That is the  ultimate in voter suppression.   This bill effectively makes it impossible for States to restore  integrity measures like in-person election day voting or voter ID. It  ensures that the chaos and turmoil of recent elections is magnified and  institutionalized.   In every election, somebody wins and somebody loses. Democracy  depends on both sides having the confidence that an election was fair  and accurately reflects the will of the majority. How can anyone have  that confidence under such a system as the left would impose? The  answer is we can't.
