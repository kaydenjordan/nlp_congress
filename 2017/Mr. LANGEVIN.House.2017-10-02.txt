 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``Yea'' on rollcall No. 544.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, last night we witnessed another  unspeakable act of gun violence that took too many innocent lives.   Today my heart breaks once again for those victims of the Las Vegas  shooting and for the families whose  [[Page H7652]]  lives have been irrevocably changed by this terrible tragedy. Each of  them is in my prayers today.   Mr. Speaker, prayers alone are not enough. We cannot, in good  conscience, sit idly by as innocent people continue to die.   Mr. Speaker, there are reasonable steps that we can take to make our  communities safer, things like limiting high-capacity magazines and  banning assault weapons--weapons, by the way, that are weapons of war  and have no business being on the streets in the first place.   Mr. Speaker, we have a solemn responsibility as Members of Congress  to ensure that our communities are safe. Let us honor the victims of  the Las Vegas shooting by doing something to prevent such tragedies  from happening in the future.                            ____________________
