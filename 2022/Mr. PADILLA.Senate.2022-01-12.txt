 Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  join me in confirming Justice Gabriel Sanchez to the U.S. Court of  Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.   Justice Sanchez has long be held in high esteem in California's legal  circles. He brings thoughtfulness and empathy to every decision that he  makes.   He was born and raised in Los Angeles and was the proud son of a  single mother from Mexico. She raised him while working tirelessly to  make ends meet. With her unwavering support, Justice Sanchez went on to  earn degrees from Yale College, from Cambridge University, and  graduated from Yale Law School.   He began his legal career as a law clerk to Judge Richard Paez on the  Ninth Circuit, the same court where he is now nominated to serve.  Justice Sanchez then went into private practice, as many young lawyers  do, but he committed himself to engaging in the community deeply by  providing pro bono legal services, so much so that in the year 2010, he  earned a social justice award from the ACLU of Southern California for  his work representing farm workers in a lawsuit to enforce workplace  safety protections to help prevent deadly heat illnesses.   Justice Sanchez went on to serve with distinction in California State  government; first, as a deputy attorney general, and then as a deputy  legal affairs secretary to then-Governor Brown. There, he proved  himself to be a critical thinker, a creative problem-solver, and a  dedicated public servant.   In recognition of his work and his service, his even-handed  judgments, and his great legal talent, Governor Brown appointed Justice  Sanchez to the California Court of Appeals in 2018.   Justice Sanchez has earned a reputation as an outstanding jurist  committed to justice for all.   I am confident that he will bring the same dedication to the bench of  the Ninth Circuit, and I am proud to support his confirmation today.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
