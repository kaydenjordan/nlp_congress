 Madam Speaker, as the designee of the chairman of the  Committee on Education and Labor, pursuant to House Resolution 303, I  call up the bill (H.R. 1195) to direct the Secretary of Labor to issue  an occupational safety and health standard that requires covered  employers within the health care and social service industries to  develop and implement a comprehensive workplace violence prevention  plan, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1195, the Workplace Violence  Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, if there is one lesson that all Americans have learned  in the last year from the shared experience of the COVID pandemic, it  is that our Nation's healthcare workers have truly been heroic, putting  their lives and health at risk, treating and caring for millions of  patients suffering from a scary deadly disease. I am sure that every  Member in this Chamber at some point has tweeted, issued statements,  held up signs thanking nurses, EMTs, doctors, and many other caregivers  for their amazing work.   But as all those brave workers can attest, there is a second  colliding epidemic that they continue to face, namely, frightening  levels of violence at rates that far exceed those faced by any other  sector in our economy.   The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which has studied this alarming  phenomenon, found that 73 percent of all violent incidents that happen  in American workplaces happen to healthcare and social assistance  employees. Year after year, BLS tallies tens of thousands of violent  incidents which could be prevented by the standard required by today's  legislation.   Today, we have the power right here in this Chamber to prevent this  wave of violence by passing H.R. 1195, the Workplace Violence  Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act.   The primary source of this violence comes in the form of assaults:  kicking, hitting, spitting, even the use of firearms and other weapons  from patients and those who accompany them.   H.R. 1195 would require an enforceable workplace violence prevention  standard within 42 months after enactment at about 200,000 healthcare  centers, not small doctors' offices or clinics. The standard would  require that covered employers develop a workplace violence prevention  plan that is tailored to the specific conditions and hazards present at  each workplace, not a one-size-fits-all mandate.   Since 1996, OSHA has published voluntary guidelines that recommended  many commonsense measures that employers can take to reduce the risk  and severity of violent incidents. These guidelines are an excellent  resource, but the fact that we continue to see an alarming growth in  violence means that relying on ad hoc, voluntary adoption is failing to  protect our healthcare heroes. We need an enforceable standard.   Over the last 5 years, in the last two administrations, despite  verbal support for an enforceable OSHA rule, nothing has moved in the  rulemaking process. History shows that with no deadlines in statute,  OSHA takes 15 to 20 years to issue a standard.   Indeed, in the last administration, despite giving lip service for 3  years that they were creating a new rule, not one administrative step  was actually taken to protect healthcare and social assistance workers.   I want to be very clear. Right now, over at that agency, this issue  is dead in the water.   Every year we fail to address this situation, we are condemning  thousands of nurses, doctors, aides, EMTs, and social workers to suffer  preventable injuries, sometimes fatal, on the job.   That is why a huge coalition of healthcare workers from the American  College of Emergency Physicians, National Nurses United, American  Nurses Association, EMTs, and many more have come together, begging  Congress to enact this bill.  [[Page H1853]]    No more delays. It is time that Congress puts a clock on this issue  so that we can get the preventative measures in place nationwide that  we know will save lives.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the chair of the committee, Mr. Scott,  for his great support on this measure, as well as Chair Adams, the  Subcommittee on Workforce Protections chair, as well as my Republican  colleagues, because there actually is some agreement on the basics on  this issue.   Lastly, I want to thank our outstanding, stellar staff: Richard  Miller; Jordan Barab, who is leaving us shortly, at the end of the  month, for his incredible institutional knowledge and work; and Maria  Costigan, from my office.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.          Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of             Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, March 26, 2021.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      Chairman, Committee on Education and Labor, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Scott: I write concerning H.R. 1195, the       ``Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social       Service Workers Act,'' which was additionally referred to the       Committee on Energy and Commerce.        In recognition of the desire to expedite consideration of       H.R. 1195, the Committee on Energy and Commerce agrees to       waive formal consideration of the bill as to provisions that       fall within the rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on       Energy and Commerce. The Committee takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and that the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within our jurisdiction. I also request that you support my       request to name members of the Committee on Energy and       Commerce to any conference committee to consider such       provisions.        Finally, I would appreciate the inclusion of this letter in       the report on the bill and into the Congressional Record       during floor consideration of H.R. 1195.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman.                                   ____           Committee on Education and Labor, House of             Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, March 26, 2021.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman, House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: In reference to your letter of March       26, 2021, I write to confirm our mutual understanding       regarding H.R. 1195, the ``Workplace Violence Prevention for       Health Care and Social Service Workers Act.''        I appreciate the Committee on Energy and Commerce's waiver       of consideration of H.R. 1195 as specified in your letter. I       acknowledge that the waiver was granted only to expedite       floor consideration of H.R. 1195 and does not in any way       waive or diminish the Committee on Energy and Commerce's       jurisdictional interests over this or similar legislation.        I would be pleased to include our exchange of letters on       this matter in the committee report for H.R. 1195 and in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill       to memorialize our joint understanding.        Again, thank you for your assistance with these matters.            Very truly yours,                                         Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. Very briefly, again, I appreciate that Ms. Foxx acknowledges  the severity of this issue, and I think that is important. But I would  note, if anyone checks with the House Clerk's office, we actually have  a solid number of Republican cosponsors on this bill. I want to make  that clear, for the record, and I appreciate their support as well.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Virginia  (Mr. Scott), the chair of the Committee on Education and Labor and an  outstanding staunch supporter of this legislation.  [[Page H1854]]                                     time  0930     Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Virginia.    Madam Speaker, I would just note that the bill language  explicitly protects a comment period for all stakeholders, including  hospitals and every other institution affected by it.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Adams), who is the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on  Workforce Protections and a staunch advocate for this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina.    Just to be clear, Madam Speaker, that CBO score is not  per facility. That score is spread out over 200,000 healthcare centers.  If you do the math, it is actually $9,000 per year per facility.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms.  Bonamici), who is the chair of the Subcommittee on Civil Rights and  Human Services.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Mrvan), an outstanding new member of the Committee on  Education and Labor.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Michigan (Ms. Stevens), an outstanding member of the Committee on  Education and Labor who worked very diligently to protect the comment  process called for in this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   First of all, I just want to compliment Ms. Foxx about her very  thoughtful remarks about what is driving this crisis out there for  healthcare workers. There is no question that behavioral health and the  heroin and opioid addiction--and we heard this from witnesses who  testified before our committee.   But I would respectfully suggest that the people who are actually out  there on the front lines, the EMTs--their association has endorsed this  bill--and the American College of Emergency Room Physicians--they are  the ones right there taking in these very sort of high-risk, intense  cases--have issued a letter of support for H.R. 1195 because they  realize that what this bill will, in fact, create, is a safer system  for better communication, better lighting, not leaving people alone  with patients, who have been identified as high-risk.   Really, all you have to do is talk to any ER doc. They will tell you  it is tough out there, and we need to change. We need to have systems  in place to better protect them.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support from the  American College of Emergency Physicians.                                                 American College of                                            Emergency Physicians,                                                     March 23, 2021.      Hon. Joe Courtney,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Courtney: On behalf of the American       College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) and our 40,000       members, thank you for introducing for H.R. 1195, the       Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social       Service Workers Act. ACEP appreciates your leadership to help       establish procedures to ensure that emergency physicians,       health care workers, social workers, and patients, are       protected from violence in the workplace, and we urge       Congress to swiftly consider and pass this important       legislation.        Violence in the emergency department is a serious and       growing concern, causing significant stress to emergency       department staff and to patients who seek treatment in the       emergency department (ED). According to a survey conducted by       ACEP in 2018, nearly half of emergency physicians polled       reported being physically assaulted, with more than 60       percent of those occurring within the past year. Nearly 7 in       10 emergency physicians say ED violence has increased within       the past 5 years. Beyond the immediate physical impacts, the       risk of violence increases the difficulty of recruiting and       retaining qualified health care professionals and contributes       to greater levels of physician burnout. Most importantly,       patients with medical emergencies deserve high-quality care       in a place free of physical dangers from other patients or       individuals, and care from staff that is not distracted by       individuals with behavioral or substance-induced violent       behavior.        There are many factors contributing to the increase in ED       and hospital violence, and like you, we recognize there is no       one-size-fits-all solution. Employers and hospitals should       develop workplace violence prevention and response procedures       that address the needs of their particular facilities, staff,       contractors, and communities, as those needs and resources       may vary significantly.        To this end, ACEP asks that Congress also take into       consideration how emergency departments are staffed to ensure       that the important provisions of this legislation are       implemented in the most appropriate manner. As you are aware,       emergency physicians may be employed in an ED in a variety of       ways, whether directly employed through the hospital in an       academic setting, or contracted as a member of a small       democratic practice or a larger, national physician group.       Given that emergency physicians and these groups do not       control the resources of an individual facility that they       staff, it would be neither practical nor effective to require       contracted groups themselves to be responsible for       implementing, tracking and reporting of violent incidents.       ACEP believes that emergency physicians that contract with       hospitals or facilities should not be held responsible for       situations or hazards outside of their direct control;       however, they can and should serve an integral role in       developing effective violence prevention strategies. We       appreciate your efforts to date to provide additional clarity       on what a ``covered employer'' is ultimately responsible for,       and ask Congress to ensure that any new federal requirements       do not create any unintentional or undue burdens for entities       that do not control the health care workplace.        Once again, thank you for your leadership on this important       issue. ACEP looks forward to working with you to ensure       patients, health care workers, and all others in the       emergency department (ED) are prepared for and protected       against violent acts occurring in the department.            Sincerely,                                    Mark Rosenberg, DO, MBA, FACEP,                                                    ACEP President.     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Green), another outstanding supporter of this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of  support from AFT, which is a union that represents hundreds of  thousands of frontline workers, including nurses, across the country in  support of H.R. 1195.                                                            AFT,                                                     March 23, 2021.      House of Representatives,      Committee on Education and Labor,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.7 million members       of the American Federation of Teachers, including nearly       200,000  [[Page H1859]]       healthcare professionals, I thank Chairman Bobby Scott for       bringing H.R.1195, the Workplace Violence Prevention for       Health Care and Social Service Workers Act, before the       committee, and I urge you to vote in support of Congressman       Joe Courtney's crucial legislation.        This bipartisan bill is straightforward and needed,       requiring employers to develop violence prevention plans and       establishing whistleblower protections so that healthcare and       social service workers don't fear retaliation for speaking       out against what they see in the workplace.        This is not an abstract issue for me. I hear from AFT       healthcare members about violence all the time: a nurse       choked to the point of unconsciousness, a nurse stabbed,       members who have suffered bone fractures and brain injuries       from being thrown against walls and floors. Subcommittee       Chairwoman Alma Adams held an important hearing on workplace       violence last Congress, where an AFT member shared the       following:        He then spun around on his back and kicked his leg high       into the air striking me in the neck, hitting with such force       to my throat that my head snapped backward; I heard this       ``bang'' and ``pop,'' and all the air just rushed out of me.       . . . Since June 2015, I have been diagnosed with moderate to       severe post-traumatic stress disorder, moderate anxiety,       insomnia, depressive disorder and social phobia related to       this incident. . . . I LOVED being a nurse. I have a huge       problem still calling myself a nurse. I do not know what to       call myself now. There is a deep loss when you used to make a       difference in the lives of people, in your true calling and       with passion. Now, that space is filled with extreme sadness       and fear. . . . I lost my career.        Violence is not just ``part of the job.'' No one should       face violence, intimidation or fear for their safety while       working to heal others and save lives. Sadly, healthcare and       social service workers are nearly five times more likely to       be assaulted while on the job than the rest of our workforce.       The costs of this violence are high: in injury rates, in       professionals being driven from doing the work they love, and       in workers' compensation claims and staff shortages.        Our nurses, health techs, social service workers and other       health professionals need more than nightly applause; they       need enforceable federal protections to keep them safe from       the epidemic of workplace violence and other serious hazards       they face at work. These are the people who take care of us       when we need them, who have devoted their careers to looking       after the aging, the sick and the injured, but are forced to       beg Congress for basic workplace rights.        I urge you to support the nurses, social workers and other       healthcare professionals in your district by voting for       committee approval of the Workplace Violence Prevention for       Health Care and Social Service Workers Act.            Sincerely,                                                  Randi Weingarten,                                                         President.     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), my neighbor and good friend.    Madam Speaker, really quick, on page 11 of the bill it  specifically states that the plans proposed to be adopted by OSHA would  ``be tailored and specific to conditions and hazards for the covered  facility or the covered service, including patient-specific risk  factors and risk factors specific to each work area or unit.'' That is  not one size fits all.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Garcia), a Member who can really bring a very powerful personal  experience to this issue.                                time  1000     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. Craig).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Minnesota.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, just to clarify, the April 9 CBO report that came out,  which, again, cited the numbers which were cited accurately by the  opposition, is a number that is spread out over 200,000 facilities  across the country.   If you do the math, we are talking about $9,000 per facility per  year. Ask yourself whether or not that figure, weighing the balance of  what we are trying to protect here, which is people's health and lives,  is worth it.   I think most people would apply common sense to that and realize that  it is not going to drive healthcare costs through the roof. In fact, it  is going to protect workers and protect them from absenteeism. It is  going to protect these institutions from high workers' compensation  costs. It is just common sense.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan  (Ms. Tlaib).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Michigan.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Here is the good news. When we started this journey on this  legislation back in 2013, a number of us requested a GAO report because  we had heard anecdotal evidence about the fact that healthcare workers  were experiencing this really disturbing level of violence that was  something that people had really never seen before.   GAO took 3 years, very methodically, as only they do. They are the  gold standard, in terms of research. They brought in all the studies  and all the evaluations. They verified, sadly, all the statistics that  we have talked about here on the floor today. Seventy-three percent of  incidents happen in these two sectors. The fact is that they not only  verified that, but they showed that those numbers are actually  underreported.   What is happening out there is because we don't have any system that  people can turn to when they are experiencing this kind of unacceptable  behavior. They basically are in a situation where, most of the time,  they just are saying suck it up, shake it off, that is part of the job,  just move on, don't spend any time on that.   In fact, what GAO told us is that the numbers that we are seeing in  other sorts of reports underreport what is going on out there.   We took that report, and we crafted legislation. We really did  accommodate some of the issues that we have heard talked about on the  floor here today, about ensuring that there is going to be an adequate  comment period for all stakeholders. We want that. We understand that  the hospital association, just like the emergency room doctors, just  like the nurses, should all have their opportunity to weigh in, in  terms of what is a viable, workable standard.                                time  1015    But what we don't need is to have OSHA just sort of lapse into its  notorious dysfunctional delays in terms of developing a workforce  standard.   Mr. Scott ticked off, again, some of the most recent examples: 2017  beryllium took 18 years, silica dust took 17 years.   Again, when the last administration came to the committee, they said,  ``We are going to start the process. We are going to begin a docket in  terms of getting a rulemaking.''   And then the first scheduled date was delayed, and then the second  scheduled date was delayed again, and on and on and on. Right now,  today, as we stand here in this Chamber, there is nothing scheduled.   When you really boil it down, where I think the disagreement exists-- and I am happy to acknowledge that, but I think it is a meaningful  distinction--is that we are going to put this agency on the clock. We  are telling them that, you know, you can follow the procedures, take  the comment, but we are not going to sit back and allow this  unacceptable trend to continue unaddressed.   That agency was created back in the Nixon administration to protect  America's workers, and as the branch of government that created them,  we want them to develop a standard in a reasonable amount of time.   Madam Speaker, this is not unprecedented. Congresses, in the past,  have done this. During the last pandemic, during AIDS, we saw a blood- borne pathogen that was just totally sweeping hospitals and healthcare  institutions all across the country, and we intervened and put a clock  on OSHA to develop a blood-borne pathogen workforce standard.   That is why, today, when you go to the hospitals, people are wearing  gloves and using disposable needles. All that stuff that we take for  granted now, that was OSHA. Actually, it was Congress who told OSHA to  develop that standard. So we are in a situation here today in 2021  where, again, we are seeing something out there.   I thank Ms. Foxx because she is not in denial, that is for sure. She  really thoughtfully talked about what is driving some of this, but the  fact is now it is time to act. I thank some of the Republican Members  who came forward because it is hard right now, but they came forward  and cosponsored this bill.   I hope, Madam Speaker, that the shared experience of the last year  that this country went through is something people will think about  when they vote later today and support this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, as the designee of the chairman of the  Education and Labor Committee, and pursuant to section 6 of House  Resolution 303, I rise to offer amendments en bloc.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the amendments en bloc.   These five amendments will: one, direct OSHA to prioritize providing  technical assistance and advice to employers to promote compliance  during the first year; two, clarify that nothing in this act will limit  existing protections against domestic violence, stalking, or sexual  violence; three, clarify that employers can consult experts when  developing their workplace violence prevention plans; four, provide  additional training to workers who interact with survivors of torture,  trafficking, and domestic violence; and, five, adds Alzheimer's and  memory care facilities as facilities covered by this legislation.   These amendments make meaningful improvements to the bill, and I urge  a ``yes'' vote on the amendments en bloc.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Jones).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from New York.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Madam Speaker, again, I support the en bloc as stated  earlier, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I again want to clarify for the record  that Congress in the past has required interim standards in situations  where there have been real acute problems in America's workforce. We  did it for workers who were working in hazardous waste and hazardous  disposal sites, and we did it for workers who were exposed to lead.   So, again, there is precedent for this. This is not having an interim  standard where there is an urgent need to have some action for just a  program standard for workers out there. We have done it in the past.  And I think we have certainly heard enough from the other side that  they acknowledge the severity of the problem and the incredible people  that would benefit from having a standard out there that we should  apply the interim rule in this case, which would take place a year from  enactment and then the final standard 3\1/2\ years from enactment.   I want to be clear. When we drafted the bill, we put in language that  requires a notice and comment section for both the interim standard and  the final standard. Nobody is being foreclosed in terms of having an  opportunity to weigh in.   Since 1996, OSHA has had voluntary recommendations and guidelines for  workplace safety in healthcare settings. This thing has been knocking  around for 25 years, and that is no secret here. We are not starting  from a blank sheet of paper.   So, again, all the stakeholders know what some of the strategies are  that could be employed to protect workers better, and what we are doing  in the baseline of the bill is basically saying we are not going to sit  back and let the dysfunctional history of OSHA dominate and really  expose people needlessly to workplace violence.   Again, Mr. Scott went through the sad history over OSHA: 18 years for  beryllium; 17 years for silica dust; 16 or 17 years for working in  enclosed construction site spaces. OSHA is just notorious in terms of  going slow, and, in fact, the last administration, which did try to  convene the Small Business panel, postponed it five separate times, and  today there is nothing scheduled. I mean, zero.   So, again, I appreciate the fact that the other side acknowledges the  seriousness of the problem. Again, I think the bill acts on that by  actually putting a clock on OSHA to move forward.   I will close by saying that the administration has weighed in, who  actually is the executive branch that has control of OSHA, and, again,  they submitted a letter titled: ``Statement of  [[Page H1871]]  Administration Policy'' on April 13 supporting this bill, and  specifically the 1-year interim standard and the 42-month final  standard timeline that is in the bill. I include that letter in the  Record, Madam Speaker.                     Statement of Administration Policy     H.R. 1195--Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social        Service Workers Act--Rep. Courtney, D-CT, and 145 cosponsors          The Administration strongly supports passage of H.R. 1195,       the Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social       Service Workers Act. This bipartisan legislation will lead to       the development of Federal standards to ensure that health       care and social service employers develop and implement plans       to protect their staff, prevent and improve the response to       workplace violence, and address existing barriers to       reporting.        Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, incidents of violence       against health care and social service workers have been on       the rise. A 2016 Government Accountability Office study       reported that rates of violence against health care workers       are up to 12 times higher than rates for the overall       workforce. In 2018, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported       that health care and social service workers were nearly five       times as likely to suffer a serious workplace violence injury       than workers in other sectors, and that healthcare workers       accounted for 73 percent of such injuries. In 2017, state       government health care and social service workers were almost       nine times more likely to be injured by an assault than       private-sector health care workers. Front line employees in       these settings interact with a range of patients, clients,       and their families, often with little training or direction       for how to handle interactions that may become violent.       Workplace violence often causes both physical and emotional       harm. Victims of these incidents often suffer post-traumatic       stress that undermines their ability to continue their       employment in that sector. This burdens a stretched health       care workforce that has been severely impacted by the COVID-      19 pandemic. There is currently no Occupational Safety and       Health Administration (OSHA) standard that requires employers       to implement violence prevention plans that would help reduce       workplace violence injuries among health care and social       service workers.        Under the Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and       Social Service Workers Act, OSHA must issue an interim final       standard in one year and a final standard within 42 months       requiring employers in the health care and social service       sectors to develop and implement a workplace violence       prevention plan. Under such a standard, employers would need       to ensure that health care and social service workers are       directly involved in the development, implementation, and       assessment of these plans. This will include identifying       risks, specifying solutions, and requiring training,       reporting, and incident investigations. It would also provide       protections from retaliation for reporting violent incidents.       Additionally, this legislation will protect health care and       social service workers in the public sector in 24 states       where those employees are not covered by OSHA protections.        The Administration commends the bipartisan support for the       Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social       Service Workers Act and urges swift passage of this       legislation.     Madam Speaker, respectfully I rise in opposition and  recommend a ``no'' vote on Mr. Keller's amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
