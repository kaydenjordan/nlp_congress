 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the America  COMPETES Act, a bill that would bolster American leadership in critical  economic sectors for decades to come.   In addition to necessary provisions to spur American production of  semiconductors, the America COMPETES Act would take action to address  supply chain disruptions and shortages.   My bill, the Supply CHAIN Act, is included in this package and would  ensure the newly created Office of Supply Chain Resiliency and Crisis  Response at the Department of Commerce has the tools it needs to map  and monitor critical supply chains, as well as prepare for and respond  to supply chain shocks and disruptions.   I have heard from families and small businesses and manufacturers in  Georgia's Seventh District of the challenges presented by supply chain  disruptions, especially amidst the pandemic.   This package of supply chain resiliency measures will help us to  identify and mitigate these disruptions moving forward.   In closing, I would like to commend my colleagues for their hard work  in assembling this critical legislation. I urge my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to support the America COMPETES Act.
