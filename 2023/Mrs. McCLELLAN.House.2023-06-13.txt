 Mr. Speaker, I rise today alongside members of the  Virginia delegation as we mourn the loss of Shawn Jackson, an 18-year- old high school graduate, and Renzo Smith, his stepfather, an Army  veteran.   Just 20 minutes after Shawn received his high school diploma, both  were tragically shot and killed when a gunman opened fire at the  Huguenot High School graduation in Richmond last week.   We pray for Shawn's mother, Tameeka Jackson-Smith, and his sister,  Renya Jackson-Smith, who, at 9 years old, was struck by a car fleeing  the scene that night.   We invite all Members of the body to join us in a moment of silence  to remember Shawn and Renzo.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition today to H.R. 1640,  the so-called Save Our Gas Stoves Act.   After weeks of holding the American economy hostage to their ransom  note of devastating cuts and policy changes that would impact American  families, State budgets, and our economic recovery, after a temper  tantrum that brought this body to gridlock last week, we are now  debating a bill that is nothing more than a political stunt to peddle  the lie that the Biden administration is attempting to ban gas stoves.   The American people can rest easy knowing that the Department of  Energy cannot ban gas stoves, but the Department of Energy is  proceeding with a congressionally mandated efficiency standard that  will save the American people money, reduce harmful indoor air  pollution that disproportionately and adversely impacts the health of  low-income communities, communities of color, and our children.   House Republicans are using this bill as a guise to prioritize the  fossil fuel industry and raise utility costs for Americans while  misrepresenting data from the Department of Energy. Ultimately, H.R.  1640 is nothing more than a desperate attempt to weaken the  Department's ability to issue energy efficiency standards.   This is astoundingly disappointing. We should be addressing the  issues that matter to my constituents, like reducing the gun violence  that killed an 18-year-old 20 minutes after he received his diploma  last week, increasing access to affordable healthcare and affordable  childcare, addressing the mental health needs of our veterans and our  servicemen and -women, the farm bill, and addressing the maternal  health crisis instead of this bill.   I find it interesting that the party that thinks it can insert itself  into healthcare decisions of pregnant people now is accusing the Biden  administration of inserting itself into the decisions of buying  appliances.   Instead of dealing with the issues that my constituents sent me here  to deal with, we are having to deal with a ridiculous political stunt,  delayed votes, and nonsensical bills.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill, and I encourage my  Republican colleagues to stop the fear-mongering and infighting so we  can get back to governing and solving the problems that our  constituents are actually asking us to address.
