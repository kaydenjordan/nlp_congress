 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as my colleagues know, one of the best  times of the week for me is when I get to come down to the floor and  talk about some of my great constituents back home in Alaska, somebody  or a group of Alaskans I refer to as the ``Alaskan of the Week.''  [[Page S2817]]    We all think we come from great States, but what I really enjoy about  talking about the Alaskan of the week is not just talking about Alaska  and how beautiful and big and majestic it is but also about the people  who make it such a great place. In this ``Alaskan of the Week''  presentation, I want to talk about not just Rich Owens, whom I am going  to talk a lot about this afternoon, but also small businesses in  Alaska--in this case, in Anchorage, my hometown. As you know, the  owners of these businesses really make a positive impact on communities  like Anchorage or States like Alaska or really the whole country.   When you think of Alaska, you think of food. Particularly right now,  as spring is in full swing, you think of our delicious salmon. I have  good news for all the salmon lovers out there: Copper River salmon  season opened last week. It is some of the best wild salmon on the  planet. You might also think about our halibut and black cod, king  crab, shrimp, and oysters. We actually serve that to our fellow  Senators here when we have lunch. I know the Presiding Officer loves  Alaskan seafood.   I want people to actually realize that some of our food is ice cream.  I know that sounds strange--ice cream in Alaska. In fact, it is said  that Alaskans consume more ice cream per capita than any other State in  the country. Go figure on that one. That doesn't surprise Rich Owens,  our Alaskan of the week, who is the owner of the bustling Tastee Freez  on the corner of Jewel Lake and Raspberry Road in Anchorage. That  Tastee Freez, which opened in Anchorage at a slightly different  location 60 years ago, is one of the oldest Tastee Freezes in the  country, and it sells more ice cream than any other Tastee Freez in  America. That is remarkable. Rich also claims the largest menu of any  Tastee Freez in the United States.   Like so many of our great small businesses, it is much more than just  an ice cream store. To those who live in Anchorage and many who live  across the State, Rich's Tastee Freez is an institution. It is a  bulwark for the community, thanks largely to Rich's ownership. Since he  bought the business in 1994, he has made giving back to his community  his top priority in so many different ways beyond running that great  small business.   Rich was raised in a small town in Montana. His father was a  pharmacist, and his parents owned a drugstore. Giving back to the  community was something he saw his parents do every single day. ``It  was not the exception,'' Rich said, ``it was the rule.''   Rich came to Alaska in the 1980s to work at what is now the  Millennium Hotel--another great business in Alaska. In 1994, he bought  the Tastee Freez. Since that time, Rich has donated his time and energy  and, importantly, his philanthropy to our great State and our  community. Let me provide a few examples.   Rich is a huge champion for our schools. That can mean delivering up  to 400 sundaes to elementary schools when they have a family reading or  math night. He helps fund school trips for students who need help.  Every year, each elementary school that he works with stages a Tastee  Freez takeover. School staff members work shifts behind the counter,  and Tastee Freez employees wear school T-shirts. Those takeovers are  widely advertised and popular, and Tastee Freez donates a portion of  that day's take to the school. He is very focused on community.   Rich has also formed a work-study partnership with high schools. He  guesses that the average age of his 28 employees is 17 years old--about  the age of our pages right here listening so intently. For so many  Alaskans, it was their first and some say their best job ever, working  in that Tastee Freez Rich owns. He has donated his time, energy, and  talents to successful summer camps that teach young Alaskans about the  outdoors and important values. One of his assistant managers began to  work at the shop when she was 15 years old. She is 31 years old, and  she met her husband at the shop. This is a great community small  business.   Rich is also a huge supporter of our military, our veterans, and the  National Guard. As we are approaching Memorial Day weekend and as we  are literally debating a very important Veterans Affairs' bill on the  Senate floor right now, it is important to remember the thousands of  Alaskans and the literally millions of Americans who are veterans and  those like Rich, who are supporting our veterans day in and day out.   For example, Rich has been part of the Alaska National Guard's  Operation Santa Claus each Christmas holiday, which flies Santa Claus  and a bag of presents, toys, school supplies, and fresh fruit to some  of the most remote, far-flung Alaska villages each year during the  holidays. These kids and these communities love it. Of course, Santa  and his helpers also bring Rich's ice cream. Thanks to Rich, the kids  get ice cream in the winter. Every year, he serves thousands of 5-ounce  sundaes to these young kids in our villages--some who have never seen  sprinkles or caramel toppings on their ice cream. For his efforts, Rich  is known in my State as the commander of the Alaska National Guard Ice  Cream Support Squadron.   Just a few weeks ago, the Tastee Freez in Anchorage--Rich's great  small business--celebrated 60 years of service to the community. In  case you want to know whether this is a popular small business in our  community, over 1,000 people showed up at this celebration. They served  1,644 small ice cream cones, not including the dipped cones and sundaes  that day--all free of charge.   I was there for that great celebration. Senator Murkowski was there.  Congressman Young was there. Our Governor was there. Tastee Freez  corporate officers from the lower 48 flew up to Alaska for this big  event. They had never seen anything like it. This is the No. 1 Tastee  Freez in the country. But what most excited Rich that day was all the  people there he had served throughout the years, including the hundreds  of people who used to work at the shop, who met their spouses at Tastee  Freez and then had children, and those children now go there, and some  even work there.   That is what a small business with heart can do for a community. It  can provide young people with their first real job. It can bring us  together. It can provide a sense of community. It can serve the  community. And, of course, it can be a delicious place of memories for  families. That is what the Tastee Freez in Anchorage has done, and that  is why we want to congratulate Rich on being our Alaskan of the week  and thank him again for all the great things he has done for our State  and community.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, as we approach Memorial Day to  remember the men and women who sacrificed their lives in devotion to  the causes of liberty, freedom, and democracy, I would like to take the  opportunity to speak about one event in our Nation's history that had a  profound impact on my great State. The Battle of Attu was the only land  battle fought in North America during the Second World War.   Commonly referred to as the Forgotten Battle or Forgotten War, the  campaign began in 1942 with the bombing of Dutch Harbor and subsequent  invasions of Adak, Kiska, and Attu by the navy of Imperial Japan. On  June 7, 1942, close to 3,000 Japanese soldiers invaded Attu, exactly 6  months to the day after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. As the only land  battle during World War II, it was costly. In May of 1943, over 15,000  American soldiers stormed this small island in the Aleutians, and over  the course of the engagement, the United States suffered 549 casualties  and sustained more than 1,200 injuries. Many more were taken out of  action due to disease and nonbattle injuries. Of the over 2,400  Japanese soldiers present at the battle, only 28 survived the battle by  capture.   In addition to these often forgotten sacrifices is the impact on  those residents who lived on Attu. During the Japanese invasion, all 47  residents of the island were detained, captured, and taken to Japan as  prisoners, where 22 would later perish. Those who did survive were not  able to return home; there were too few people to rebuild the community  after being destroyed by war.   Today, before the Senate, I would like to take a moment to honor the  brave servicemembers and the Alaska Territorial Guard members who  fought and, in many cases, gave the ultimate sacrifice to defend the  territories of the United States and the memory and lives of those  Aleut evacuees and Attuan prisoners of war whose communities, culture,  and languages were forever effected.   From May 17 to May 19, a memorial ceremony took place in Alaska to  honor and acknowledge those who were affected by the Battle of Attu-- the Aleut evacuees, their descendants and veterans of this Forgotten  War, both living and deceased.                            ____________________
