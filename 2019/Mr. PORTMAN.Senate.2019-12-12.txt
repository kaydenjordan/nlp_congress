 Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor several  times over the past year to talk about the importance of passing the  U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. This is the successor agreement to the  25-year-old NAFTA accord.   Yes, it has been a year; in fact, it has been over a year since that  agreement was negotiated between Canada and Mexico, and then Congress  was meant to take it up. It has been too long.   However, I am happy to report today that now we are at the end of  that long process. I am told that the legislation is actually going to  be voted on in the House of Representatives probably next week and then  here in the U.S. Senate right after the holidays.   We will have a chance, finally, to pass this agreement that is so  good for the farmers, for the workers, for the manufacturers, and for  the small businesses that I represent.   I am really pleased that the President of the United States and his  chief trade negotiator, Bob Lighthizer, had the persistence to get this  done. I am not sure I would have had the same patience.   I also want to congratulate House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for making the  decision to move forward with it. This is one of these situations in  which, under our law, the agreement has to be voted on first by the  House. So the Speaker of the House had an unusual role here, where it  couldn't go forward without her approval. Again, finally, we are there.   The agreement, which was negotiated over a year ago and languished-- specific language was sent up here in May of last year--is pretty much  the same. About 99 percent of it is the same agreement. It is a good  agreement because it opens up more markets for us. What has changed is  there are new provisions, different provisions, as it relates to  enforcing the labor standards that are already in the agreement.   In the agreement, what Mexico and Canada were asked to do, in  addition to the United States, in terms of higher labor standards, was  negotiated over a year ago, but what has happened over, really, the  past several months is now there is a mechanism to enforce it that is a  little different.   I think it will make it easier to enforce potential violations of the  agreement we have reached, particularly with regard to Mexico. It  doesn't really come back against the United States at all. We can  explain this in more detail as we see the exact language that is coming  up in the next couple of days.   The bottom line is, for a U.S. company, the labor standards that are  established are the ones we already have in our law. For Mexico or  Canada to file an objection to us potentially not following that  agreement is simply after there has been a U.S. law processed, which  would involve the National Labor Relations Board and our existing law,  so it really shouldn't affect us at all.   By the way, Secretary Scalia, who is the Secretary of Labor, was very  involved in ensuring that it wouldn't come back on U.S. companies, on  U.S. workers, and on our economy.   At the end of the day, although it took way too long to get there, we  have ended up with a very good result--an agreement that does expand  trade, and that is the whole idea.   We have talked a lot on the floor as to why this is so important. I  will tell you, in my home State of Ohio, we send more than half of our  exports to two countries, Canada and Mexico. By far, the No. 1 trading  partner is Mexico, and No. 2 is Canada.   This is really important because these jobs are really important. It  is about $28 billion a year. These are jobs that pay higher wages and  better benefits--export jobs. For our farmers, this is really  important. For manufacturers and workers, it is really important  because this lets them be able to do what we do best, which is  efficiently and productively make things and produce things that could  be sold to other markets.   Remember, in America, we are only about 5 percent of the global  economy--five percent of the people--so our  [[Page S7006]]  population is only about 5 percent, but we are about 25 percent of the  GDP of the world. We are a relatively small country by population, but  we have this big economy. To access that 95 percent of consumers  outside of America to sell our products is absolutely essential to our  prosperity here, to our jobs here.   As I mentioned earlier, those export jobs tend to be better jobs and  higher paying jobs with better benefits.   What does this agreement do? First of all, it creates a bunch of new  jobs. This chart has 176,000-plus new jobs. That is because the  International Trade Commission--which is the independent body that  analyzes these things--gave us a range. The GDP increased. It increased  our economy. The number of jobs is huge, by the way--greater than any  other trade agreement we have entered into, greater on the economic  growth side than the Trans-Pacific Partnership that many of my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle thought was something we  should have entered into and was so important. This is even bigger.   Obviously, it is so big because Canada and Mexico are such big  trading partners with us. So even relatively small changes to open up  new markets have a big impact. These are going to be welcome jobs and,  again, higher paying jobs.   Second, it really helps us with regard to online sales. One of our  advantages as a country is we do a lot of commerce over the internet.  When the original NAFTA agreement was written and was currently  enforced--the status quo--there really were not any significant online  sales--virtually none. So there were no provisions in there. Every  modern trade agreement has provisions for online sales or for sales  over the internet. Now we have them with regard to Mexico and Canada,  which we would not have had under the old NAFTA. So that is a big  improvement. For Ohio, that is a lot of small companies because  entrepreneurs--some of these new startups are online companies--really  like these provisions.   By the way, it says a number of things. It says you can't require  localization of data. In other words, Canada and Mexico can't say: Hey,  you have to have your servers in our country if you are going to do  business with us. That is really important to our American online  industry.   Second, it says that you can't put tariffs on data online. Again, it  is very important to establish that, not just for Canada and Mexico but  as a precedent for other trade agreements going forward.   Third, it actually raises the de minimis level. In other words, to  apply customs duties on stuff going to Canada and Mexico, they have a  very low level. We have a relatively high level here. That level has  increased for Canada and Mexico. That is an administrative burden that  is lifted off of a lot of these small businesses but also a costsaver  because they don't have to pay customs duty on a relatively small  product that goes to another country.   These are all good things for American jobs. Again, we have a  comparative advantage here because we do a lot of online sales.   Third is more U.S.-made steel and auto parts. This is really  important to Ohio but also to our country. Manufacturing is now finally  on the upswing. Manufacturing jobs are actually increasing in this  country for the first time in years, and we are getting back on our  feet in terms of what has always made America great, which is that we  produce things; we make things. So this agreement helps.   It says, as an example, that 70 percent of the steel that goes into  automobiles--and the automobile industry is a big deal for Canada and  Mexico and the United States--has to be from North America. That helps  U.S. steel mills and steel mills in Ohio, as opposed to steel coming in  from China, for example, from Brazil, and from other countries.   Second, it changes the rules of origin--how much stuff can go into an  automobile that comes from other countries. It is 62\1/2\ percent now,  and it would take it up to 75 percent in this agreement. That is the  highest level of any agreement we have with anybody.   Why is that important? Well, think about it. We have agreed with  Canada and Mexico that we are going to have this agreement that lowers  the tariffs in all these countries and lowers the trade barriers  generally. In other words, it gives them an advantage in our market. We  get an advantage in their market. That is the idea. If you don't have a  rule of origin where you say stuff can't come in from other countries  and take advantage of that, then you have basically free riders.   As an example, China can send a bunch of their auto parts to Mexico  and produce a car that is a Mexican car that therefore gets the benefit  of the NAFTA agreement. China has not opened its market at all; it has  only provided this product to Mexico. But then the product gets the  advantage of the lower tariffs and lower trade barriers generally. That  is not fair. Raising it from 62\1/2\ percent to 75 percent is really  significant. Again, it is the highest number of any trade agreement we  have, and it avoids this problem.   Some of us say: Gee, that sounds protectionist. I don't think it is.  I think what it says to China, Japan, Brazil, or other countries is  that if you want to get the advantage of the U.S. market that Canada  and Mexico are getting and that we get reciprocally from them, then  enter into a trade agreement with us.   Let's have more trade agreements. Let's lower the barriers for  everybody. That actually will expand trade. But we ought not to allow  them to do it without that. This is a big deal.   It also is true that in this agreement, there is something  unprecedented with regard to leveling the playing field. Remember, a  basic concept of our trade laws is that you want to have a balanced  trade law where you have imports and exports because that makes sense-- keeps consumer prices down and allows us to have good jobs here--but  you want it to be reciprocal and balanced. You don't want to have a  situation where a country, because of its low wage rates and lack of  labor standards or lack of environmental standards, where it is  polluting a lot, can take advantage by having lower cost goods coming  into America.   In this agreement, we do say that there is a minimum wage for between  40 and 45 percent of the auto production. It is $16 an hour. That will  end up benefiting us because wages are relatively higher in America and  Canada than they are in Mexico. That will be good for auto jobs here  and help to level the playing field. This is why you might have seen  that some of the labor unions are supporting this agreement and some of  the U.S. manufacturers are supporting this agreement. They have a lot  of facilities here in America, and they like that part of it as well.   There are new markets for farmers. I mean, this is kind of a no- brainer that has made it, for me, frustrating over the last year  because we haven't been able to move forward on this agreement while  farmers have really been suffering because of a few different things.   One is weather. We have had some lousy weather, particularly in my  State and across the Midwest, where it is too wet to plant and too dry  for the crops to grow properly for a harvest, and that has hit us hard.  We couldn't plant in Ohio in a number of cases this last year because  of the weather being too wet, and so farmers have been hit by that.   The second is that prices have been relatively low--not just recently  but really over the last several years for different commodities such  as corn, soybeans, and wheat. Part of that is because of the global  markets.   Part of it is because of the third issue, which is China. Because of  our ongoing negotiation with China and disputes with China over what  they are doing on intellectual property, stealing our technology, and  other issues, they have bought less of our farm products. For Ohio, as  an example, our No. 1 market overseas for soybeans is China, and one  out of every three acres planted in Ohio is planted for export. Think  about how that affects your prices if you lose that big market share  and that big customer.   I am pleased to say that we seem to be making some progress with  China right now, incidentally, as an aside. It is great to have this  agreement done. The next agreement I hope we get done is with China and  get them to play by the rules and open those markets more. This week,  they started to buy more soybeans, and that is good.   In the meantime, our farmers are desperate for more markets, and in  this  [[Page S7007]]  agreement, that is exactly what they get. So if you are an Ohio  farmer--and we are No. 2 in the country on eggs--you can now have  access to these markets in Canada and Mexico, on eggs, that you never  had before.   On dairy, Canada in particular has some very protectionist provisions  in place with regard to dairy products--think milk and cheese.   If you are an Ohio dairy farmer, you can sell stuff into Canada you  couldn't sell before--also pork, beef, wheat, and other products. This  is good for our farmers. This is why over 1,000 farm groups around the  country have supported this agreement. I mean, I don't know a farm  group in Ohio that doesn't support it strongly. Again, part of it is  that this is a great agreement for them, and part of it is that they  are hurting, and this gives them some light at the end of the tunnel,  an opportunity to see new markets and therefore see some prices  increase in our ag community.   This is a good agreement that is good for jobs, good for small  business, as we talked about, good for farmers, good for workers, and  good for our economy. It is important that we get it done. I am glad  the House is going to go ahead and vote on it in the next week. I wish  we could vote here in the Senate right away, too, but under the process  called trade promotion authority, we do have some processes we need to  go through. It is probably best to have it happen after the holidays.  Right after the holidays, my hope is that here on the floor of the  Senate, Members will look at this for what it is. This is not a  Democratic or a Republican victory; this is an American victory.   Again, I appreciate the efforts of President Donald Trump because he  was persistent and tough on the negotiations, and then he was  persistent and patient in working with the U.S. Congress. There were a  lot of people saying: Go ahead and send the agreement up and try to jam  the Democrats into doing the right thing. He didn't do that. He waited  to figure out a way to come up with an agreement, particularly on the  labor enforcement provisions we talked about, and as a result, we now  have the ability on a bipartisan basis to get this done. I hope the  vote in the House will reflect that; likewise, here in the Senate.   I know there are some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who  think this agreement is not perfect. No agreement is perfect; I will  just say that. I am a former U.S. Trade Representative. I am a former  trade lawyer. I am a former member of the Ways and Means Committee,  which is the trade committee over there. I am now on the trade  committee here, the Finance Committee. No agreement is ever perfect. It  is not the agreement exactly that you would write or I would write,  but, boy, this is a good agreement.   To make perfect the enemy of the good would hurt the farmers and the  workers and the small businesses that we represent that want this  agreement badly because they know it is going to help them.   The other thing I would say is that it also helps our relationships  with our two biggest trading partners in Ohio, Canada and Mexico, and  also our neighbors.   For North America's future, this is a good idea--to have the  certainty and predictability that comes with an agreement we have all  been able to coalesce around and improve the status quo. NAFTA was  negotiated 25 years ago. A lot has happened in the last 25 years. We  talked about how the digital economy has transformed our economy, and  we have a competitive and comparative advantage in that. That is one  small example. So many things have changed.   We have better protections for intellectual property in this  agreement, as an example. We have these new trade-opening opportunities  in agriculture. We have these opportunities in manufacturing to do more  here in North America and specifically in the United States.   A vote against this new agreement is a vote for NAFTA, which is this  25-year-old agreement that has these flaws because that is the status  quo. My hope is that the next time I come to this floor to talk about  this, it will be to ask my colleagues in short order to support a vote,  that it will have come out of the Finance Committee with a strong  bipartisan vote, that it will have come to the floor with a strong vote  from the House, and that we can get this done. Then President Trump can  sign it, and the people we represent will be better off, our community  of nations here in North America will be better off, and the United  States of America will have another victory.   I yield back.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  100th season of the National Football League.   Ohio has a rich football history. In 1920, 10 teams gathered in  Canton, OH, to form the American Professional Football Association. Of  those original 10 teams, Cleveland, Canton, Akron, Columbus, and Dayton  were all in the lineup. Further, the Dayton Triangles hosted the first- ever NFL game in 1921 against the Columbus Panhandles.   Home to the Cleveland Browns and the Cincinnati Bengals, Ohio has  continued to embrace the legacy and tradition of America's game. The  birthplace of the NFL, Canton's Pro Football Hall of Fame sees 225,000  visitors annually. Additionally, Ohio natives Don Shula, Chuck Noll,  Paul Brown, Roger Staubach, and Cris Carter are among the 326 players  who have been inducted into the Hall of Fame. Further, Cleveland looks  forward to hosting the 2021 NFL draft, and I was proud to advocate for  this selection last year.   Since its first season in 1920, the NFL has grown from humble  beginnings to a national pastime known as America's game. Represented  in 22 States by 32 teams, the NFL has united communities across the  Nation through live games and televised events. In fact, the Super Bowl  has become the single most-watched annual television event in the  United States.   I commend the NFL for their continued philanthropic and volunteer  efforts. Through working to honor veterans, promote cancer awareness,  and encourage healthy lifestyles, the league has embraced community  through sport. I applaud the commitment of the NFL, its staff, and all  who were involved in reaching this milestone and making the first 100  seasons of the NFL a success.                            ____________________
