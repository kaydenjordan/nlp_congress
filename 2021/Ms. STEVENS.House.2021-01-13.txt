 Madam Speaker, insurrection. A violent mob. A week ago  today, five people were killed, many injured, and everyone in this  building forced to hide for their very life.   The President was called for help, but he did not answer our call  while our government was being taken over. He failed to lead and,  therefore, proved himself incapable of doing so.   Some may say impeachment is political. Some may cry it is divisive.  Madam Speaker, our obligation to our Constitution is to protect this  Nation.
