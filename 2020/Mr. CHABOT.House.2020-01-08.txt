 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 5078, the Prison to Proprietorship Act, as  amended.   Before I speak on our first bill, I thank Chairwoman Velazquez for  continuing our tradition in the Small Business Committee that we have  had over recent years of emphasizing bipartisanship. I thank her for  that. It is Democrats and Republicans really working together to pass  legislation that is beneficial to the vast majority of Americans,  whatever their political inclinations may be. It is something that we  have been working on for years in the committee, and I thank her for  that.   Once again, we have four strong bills here that came out of the Small  Business Committee. Our first two bills focus on fostering  entrepreneurship among the soon-to-be or formerly incarcerated.   Last fall, we held a hearing that featured compelling testimony about  the power of entrepreneurship and how that power can help people  looking to get their lives back on track after having been  incarcerated. These individuals typically face higher rates of  unemployment than any other segment of our population, not  surprisingly, really. Providing worthy individuals an outlet for their  entrepreneurial spirit not only helps them to reacclimate to society  but also boosts our economy, and it benefits many local communities all  across this Nation.   The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that almost half of all U.S.  prisoners, unfortunately, are without access to vocational training  programs. Studies show that inmates who go through vocational training  programs are much less likely to commit additional crimes when they get  out. So it just makes sense for us to emphasize these training  programs.    This bill directs the Association of Women's Business Centers and the  Association of Small Business Development Centers to coordinate reentry  entrepreneurship services by providing counseling and training services  that focus on individuals who have been incarcerated in Federal prison.   This bill will create a pathway for qualified ex-offenders to be  successful, contributing members of society, and I urge my colleagues  to support this bill.   Madam Speaker, again, I thank the gentlewoman from New York for  working with us and collaborating with us on this important  legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation that can help unlock the power of entrepreneurship for  people who either are about to be incarcerated or have been.   It makes sense to give them a chance, rather than have them on a path  where they are going to be in prison, get out, and commit more crimes,  which are going to harm society as well as mess up their lives  severely, as well.   This legislation is something that we have before us and can pass. It  is good for the country, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5065, the Prison to  Proprietorship for Formerly Incarcerated Act.   As our committee heard in a hearing on this topic last fall, up to 60  percent of people released from prison will remain unemployed after a  year. It is not surprising, then, that half of all former inmates  recidivate. In other words, they commit another crime after they have  been released within 3 years of release from prison.   This is not good for them, and it is certainly not good for society.  We want these former prisoners to be constructive members of our  communities.   Small business ownership can provide steady employment to nonviolent  individuals, which can drastically lower the risk of recidivism.   This bill, H.R. 5065, the Prison to Proprietorship for Formerly  Incarcerated Act, directs the SBA Administrator to work with the Bureau  of Prisons to provide entrepreneurship counseling and training services  for those who have served time in Federal prison. This counseling will  be conducted by SCORE, a resource partner of the SBA and the Nation's  largest network of volunteer expert business mentors, with more than  10,000 volunteers in 300 chapters.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett)  and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries) for their bipartisan  work on this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H36]]         Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett), and I thank him for his  leadership on this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I have no further Members seeking time,  and I am prepared to close if the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Velazquez) is prepared as well.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Madam Speaker, entrepreneurship has the power to equip those  returning from incarceration with tools to overcome barriers to  employment, which they often face upon their release.   Recidivism rates in America remain today, unfortunately, alarmingly  high; yet, entrepreneurship can be a pathway to success and an antidote  to recidivism for the formerly incarcerated.   This bill is designed to help individuals reacclimate to society,  utilizing their desire to start and own a small business. I urge my  colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5130, the Capturing All  Small Businesses Act of 2019.   Our next two bills focus on a longstanding goal of our committee:  increasing small business access to the Federal marketplace.   The U.S. Government is the largest purchaser of goods and services in  the  [[Page H38]]  world. It is very important that small businesses have ample  opportunity to compete for Federal contracts.   A vibrant small business presence in Federal contracting increases  competition, increases quality, and, most importantly, lowers prices  for the American taxpayer. All of these things are good. This  bipartisan legislation will make it easier for small firms to compete  against larger firms.   Madam Speaker, this bipartisan legislation will increase our small  businesses, and it will encourage them to grow successfully and  competitively into the midsize marketplace.   We have heard too many stories of small businesses successfully  providing significant value to the Federal Government and growing at a  steady pace only to hit a wall once they grow out of their small size  threshold. We need to ensure that there is a pathway for sustained  development for our Nation's small manufacturers, and this bill takes  us a step in the right direction.   I want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Kevin Hern), the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce), and the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Veasey), who all worked together and showed great leadership on  this issue and, again, did it in a bipartisan manner. So I thank all  three of them.   Madam Speaker, I urge the bill's adoption, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such as he may consume to the  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Kevin Hern) and thank him for his  leadership in working on this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce) and thank him, also, for his  leadership in working on this important legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, in closing, this bipartisan bill allows small firms to  have the additional time, as a small business, to solidify their  competitiveness and infrastructure and achieve greater success when  they eventually must compete against much larger companies.   After all, about 70 percent of the jobs created in America are  created by  [[Page H39]]  small businesses, so we need to help them in every way we can.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank all of the Members who spoke here this  afternoon on the floor for their leadership in this important area. I  would urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5146, the Unlocking  Opportunities for Small Businesses Act of 2019, as amended.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Minnesota  (Mr. Hagedorn), and the two gentlemen from Pennsylvania, Dr. Joyce and  Mr. Evans, for their leadership on this legislation and, again, working  together in a bipartisan manner, which will reduce significant barriers  to small contractors in the Federal marketplace.   As we have heard from our colleagues, obtaining relevant, past- performance information is critical for a small business to be  competitive for a contractor award. Unfortunately, Federal agencies  take a narrow view on what they might consider as relevant past  performance for a prime contract opportunity.  [[Page H40]]    This limits a small business' ability to compete for contracts that  they would otherwise be a perfect fit for, which is detrimental both to  the small business and to the government. In short, the important thing  for a Federal agency to know is whether a business is capable of  successfully completing the specific task being requested.   If the small business can show that it has successfully performed  that type of work in the past, it should be able to use that as  evidence that it can complete the task in the future. It is that  simple.   This bill will not only unlock prime contracting opportunities for  small businesses, but it will also have the additional positive impact  of eventually growing the industrial base, increasing competition, and,  again, most importantly, lowering costs to the taxpayer.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Hagedorn), and I thank the gentleman for  his leadership on this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce). I thank him for his leadership  and for working so hard on this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Madam Speaker, again, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Hagedorn) and the two gentlemen from Pennsylvania, Mr. Evans and Dr.  Joyce, for their leadership on this important piece of legislation.   Increasing Federal contracting opportunities for small firms is a  win-win situation. The taxpayers get better value from their tax  dollars, and small firms grow and spur our economy forward.   This is really commonsense, bipartisan legislation. I urge my  colleagues to support it, and again, I thank the gentlewoman from New  York, the chairwoman of the committee, who, once again, has shown that  she is working together in a collegial and bipartisan fashion. We  really do appreciate that. That is one of the reasons that all four of  the bills we have taken up this afternoon have had both Republicans and  Democrats working together. That doesn't happen in every committee, but  it does happen in the Small Business Committee, and I thank her for  that.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
