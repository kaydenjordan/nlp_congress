 Mr. Speaker, to Maverick Kemp, because  we love his parents, his birth on October 21 was much celebrated in our  office. He is a cute little guy, cuter than most babies even.   His mother, Jazmine, is a dear friend, a trusted adviser, and a  brilliant coworker. She spent 5 years working with me in service to  this country, and what a blessing she has been.   Now, the other children of our office, A.J. and Max, Gabby, Dakota  and Drew, Wyatt and Gavin, Stevie and Woodrow, would tell him that it  isn't always easy to have a parent in this line of work. I know that he  will understand it is work worth doing.   We are grateful that Jazmine and all of the parents of our office  choose to serve, and we are very happy that Maverick is here.                            ____________________
