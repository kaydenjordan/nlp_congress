The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 22, the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.    Mr. Chairman, for years my Republican friends have been  trying to convince everyone that Federal agencies are scary and  unpopular. In reality, Americans support Federal rules that protect  them from injuries, diseases, and death. They always have and they  always will. The people we represent don't want those rules to go away.  They want stronger rules to protect their jobs, their pay, their  health, and their fair treatment in the workplace.   Let's remember that it takes years to finalize most rules. Before an  agency makes a rule, it considers science, costs, benefits, public  stakeholder input, and public comments. Republicans have invented  stories about surprise regulations that appear out of nowhere. These  stories sound interesting until you realize they were invented to help  their corporate friends get where they want. We know where this will  lead us. Big banks got away with robbing us and creating a major  recession because they weren't regulated strongly enough. Republicans  think the answer is making it harder to regulate them.   If this bill passes, it won't be the nameless, faceless, unelected  corporate CEOs who feel the pain. It will be the Americans from big  cities and small towns who need Federal standards to keep their  environment clean, to keep their workplace safe, and to make sure the  products they buy won't hurt their families.   My Democratic colleagues are offering amendments today that exempt  certain kinds of rules from the unrealistic burdens this bill creates.  I support these amendments.   My amendment is a little different. It is not nearly enough to save  this terrible bill, but it takes a big step in the right direction. It  acknowledges that doing nothing carries a major cost.                                time  1600    It acknowledges human-caused climate change and requires agencies  that propose regulations to report on how a rule impacts greenhouse gas  emissions. If we require reporting a rule's costs, we should also  report its impacts to our planet and to our way of life.   It also requires an analysis of a rule's impacts on low-income and  rural communities. My Republican friends are deeply concerned about  whether new regulations make big business and Wall Street investors  happy. I think it is time we assess the impacts of regulations on the  urban poor, the rural poor, or on coastal Native American tribes  already fleeing the impacts of climate change, or the farmers in the  West and South struggling to cope with drought, flooding, and extreme  weather.  [[Page H137]]    Finally, my amendment requires congressional approval of any  regulation that would increase carbon pollution by 25,000 metric tons  or more, or could increase cancer, birth defects, kidney disease, or  cardiovascular or respiratory illness.   If House Republicans are so eager to rewrite the regulatory process,  they should be willing to cast recorded votes allowing the release of  tens of thousands of metric tons of pollution into our air. They should  publicly vote to increase the rates of these terrible diseases among  their constituents.   Passing this amendment is the very least we can do to make sure the  bill doesn't put Americans at risk of injury and death.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it should be noted that the REINS Act is  one sweeping piece of legislation that does not take into account  public health, does not take into account clean air, clean water, and  the effects of constituents and the American people, the environment,  or the cost attended with increased illnesses. With that sweeping  deregulation process that is being proposed by the majority, we have an  exposure on issues of public health, clean air, clean water, and the  regulations that are in place to protect the public health and the  well-being of the American people.   My amendment just requires that, if these sweeping changes are to  occur, Members of this body take the votes that would release  additional metric tons into the atmosphere that would promote and  increase the levels of disease in this country that is harmful to the  American people. It is one of disclosure and accountability if the  Members, indeed, are the ones that want to make the final decision.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will  be postponed.               Amendment No. 4 Offered by Ms. Castor of Florida    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4  printed in House Report 115-1.   Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:        In paragraph (2) of section 804, title 5, United States       Code, as proposed to be amended by section 3 of the bill,       insert after ``means any rule'' the following: ``(other than       a special rule)''.        In paragraph (3) of section 804, title 5, United States       Code, as proposed to be amended by section 3 of the bill,       insert before the period at the end the following: ``, and       includes any special rule''.        Add, at the end of section 804, title 5, United States       Code, as proposed to be amended by section 3 of the bill, the       following:        ``(6) The term `special rule' means any rule that will       result in reduced incidence of cancer, premature mortality,       asthma attacks, or respiratory disease in children.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 22, the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Castor) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida.   Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Chairman, my amendment makes an important  exemption to the REINS Act to ensure that policies that protect  children from cancer, premature death, asthma attacks, or respiratory  disease are not delayed or denied.   For example, the Clean Air Act, which has been in place for over 40  years, and has improved our health and protected all Americans from  harmful toxic air pollution, such as ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur  dioxide, and particle pollution, often requires updates based upon the  best science, especially when it comes to our kids.   Toxic pollutants, such as ozone, which is a major component of smog,  are linked to asthma, lung, and heart disease and result in thousands  of deaths every year and up to 1 million missed days of school. Our  kids are particularly susceptible to this type of pollution because  their lungs are still developing. On average, they take deeper breaths  and are more likely to spend long periods outdoors, placing them at  higher risk.   The American Lung Association states that inhaling smog pollution is  like getting a sunburn on your lungs, and often results in immediate  breathing trouble.   I remember very well back in the early seventies, when I was a little  girl, what the air was like in my hometown in Tampa. We had a lot of  industrial users at the port of Tampa, a lot of industrial plants. I  have seen the progress over time that the Clean Air Act has brought to  this country. We are not like other countries in the world. We are  stronger, and we are better, and we are healthier because of the Clean  Air Act.   So let's not go backwards. Let's not throw a roadblock like the REINS  Act into the mix here. But we do have to be careful because there still  are many communities in America that continue to suffer, and they are  often the underserved, economically distressed communities.   Studies have shown that working class communities often bear the  brunt of environmental pollution because the only homes they can afford  are often located near industrial sites. According to the NAACP, 78  percent of African Americans live within 30 miles of an industrial  power plant, and 71 percent of African Americans live in counties that  violate Federal air pollution standards.   In addition to that, a study by the Environmental Defense Fund found  that our Latino neighbors are three times more likely to die from  asthma, often for those same reasons.   Let's not go backwards. Because here, what the REINS Act does is it  really complicates the American system of checks and balances. Let's  not go backwards. Because it is not only our families and neighbors  that would suffer. It is also our economy that would suffer as well.   This type of regulatory scheme of mirrors and false promises would  create great uncertainty for many of our businesses. The Clean Air Act  is one example. These clean air protections in the United States have a  great track record. We have grown as a country. The economic growth has  tripled. Our economic base has more than tripled. Clean air protections  and environmental protections go hand-in-hand with economic growth.   Since 1970, we have cut harmful air pollution by 70 percent, while  our economy has grown like gang busters. I know many of you are  probably going to have your eyes on the Tampa Bay area Monday night  when we have the college football championship in Tampa with Alabama  versus Clemson. I  [[Page H138]]  want you to take a look at our clean skies, the clean air. I wish we  could all be there, but I think we are going to be back here in  Washington, D.C. But just know, it hasn't always been that way. When  you see the beautiful sunset across Tampa Bay with clear skies, that  has been because of the Clean Air Act.   But if you bring a regulatory scheme, like the REINS Act, that says  you have to come back to Congress for every single little new policy  that is based on updates and new science, that is going to complicate  everyone's lives. I worry at the outset of this new Congress, because  the first bill passed yesterday was one that short-circuited public  participation, and now this bill today appears to be a late Christmas  gift to corporate polluters who put profits over people. We are better  than that. You can prove me wrong, though, by supporting this  amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.
