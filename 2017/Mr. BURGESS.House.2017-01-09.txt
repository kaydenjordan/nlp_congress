 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 309) to amend the Public Health Service Act to foster more  effective implementation and coordination of clinical care for people  with a complex metabolic or autoimmune disease, a disease resulting  from insulin deficiency or insulin resistance, or complications caused  by such a disease, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 309         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 309, the National  Clinical Care Commission Act, introduced by Representative Pete Olson  and which was supported by over 229 cosponsors in the 114th Congress.   H.R. 309 establishes a clinical care commission to evaluate and  recommend solutions regarding better coordinating and leveraging of  Federal programs related to complex metabolic or autoimmune disorders,  such as diabetes.   Metabolic disorders take a large toll on many Americans each year,  and complications from these disorders can lead to catastrophic health  outcomes. Currently, there are various programs across the Federal  Government that touch on metabolic disorders--some focus on prevention  and others focus on treatment--but there is a lack of coordination  among these programs. Improving coordination of such efforts provides  an opportunity to reduce costs while improving health outcomes.   This legislation received broad support from the Energy and Commerce  Committee, passing through a full committee markup by a voice vote  during the 114th Congress.   H.R. 309 provides no new spending and utilizes only existing funds at  the Department of Health and Human Services.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), a new member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers at this time.   This is a good bill. It did pass at the end of last Congress. Maybe  by passing at the beginning of this Congress, we will give the other  body ample time to take it up this year.   It is a good bill. It is worthy of our consideration again today. It  provides no new spending.  [[Page H203]]    I urge passage of H.R. 309.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 315) to amend the Public Health Service Act to distribute  maternity care health professionals to health professional shortage  areas identified as in need of maternity care health services.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 315         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Access to       Maternity Care Act''.       SEC. 2. MATERNITY CARE HEALTH PROFESSIONAL TARGET AREAS.         Section 332 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.       254e) is amended by adding at the end the following new       subsection:        ``(k)(1) The Secretary, acting through the Administrator of       the Health Resources and Services Administration, shall       identify, based on the data collected under paragraph (3),       maternity care health professional target areas that satisfy       the criteria described in paragraph (2) for purposes of, in       connection with receipt of assistance under this title,       assigning to such identified areas maternity care health       professionals who, without application of this subsection,       would otherwise be eligible for such assistance. The       Secretary shall distribute maternity care health       professionals within health professional shortage areas using       the maternity care health professional target areas so       identified.        ``(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall       establish criteria for maternity care health professional       target areas that identify geographic areas within health       professional shortage areas that have a shortage of maternity       care health professionals.        ``(3) For purposes of this subsection, the Secretary shall       collect and publish in the Federal Register data comparing       the availability and need of maternity care health services       in health professional shortage areas and in areas within       such health professional shortage areas.        ``(4) In carrying out paragraph (1), the Secretary shall       seek input from relevant provider organizations, including       medical societies, organizations representing medical       facilities, and other organizations with expertise in       maternity care.        ``(5) For purposes of this subsection, the term `full scope       maternity care health services' includes during labor care,       birthing, prenatal care, and postpartum care.        ``(6) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as--        ``(A) requiring the identification of a maternity care       health professional target area in an area not otherwise       already designated as a health professional shortage area; or        ``(B) affecting the types of health professionals, without       application of this subsection, otherwise eligible for       assistance, including a loan repayment or scholarship,       pursuant to the application of this section.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 315, the Improving  Access to Maternity Care Act, which I introduced with Representative  Eshoo.   H.R. 315 increases data collection by the Department of Health and  Human Services to help better place maternity care providers through  the National Health Service Corps repayment program. Currently,  maternity care providers participate in the National Health Service  Corps through the primary care designation, but they are not always  placed where they are needed the most. H.R. 315 will require increased  data collection on maternity care providers who will then be placed in  geographic areas within existing health professional shortage areas,  again, where they are most needed.   This legislation enjoyed broad support on the Energy and Commerce  Committee, passing through the full committee markup by a voice vote in  the 114th Congress.   H.R. 315 provides no new spending, Mr. Speaker.   I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Roe), the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee  and a fellow OB/GYN.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 315, once again, is a bill that passed  with overwhelming support in the last Congress. I hope that by taking  it up early in this Congress, we will allow time for the other body to  attend to this needed legislation. I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  315.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 302) to provide protections for certain sports medicine  professionals who provide certain medical services in a secondary  State.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 302         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Sports Medicine Licensure       Clarity Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. PROTECTIONS FOR COVERED SPORTS MEDICINE                     PROFESSIONALS.         (a) In General.--In the case of a covered sports medicine       professional who has in effect medical professional liability       insurance coverage and provides in a secondary State covered       medical services that are within the scope of practice of       such professional in the primary State to an athlete or an       athletic team (or a staff member of such an athlete or       athletic team) pursuant to an agreement described in       subsection (b)(4) with respect to such athlete or athletic       team--        (1) such medical professional liability insurance coverage       shall cover (subject to any related premium adjustments) such       professional with respect to such covered medical services       provided by the professional in the secondary State to such       an individual or team as if such services were provided by       such professional in the primary State to such an individual       or team; and        (2) to the extent such professional is licensed under the       requirements of the primary State to provide such services to       such an individual or team, the professional shall be treated       as satisfying any licensure requirements of the secondary       State to provide such services to such an individual or team.        (b) Definitions.--In this Act, the following definitions       apply:        (1) Athlete.--The term ``athlete'' means--        (A) an individual participating in a sporting event or       activity for which the individual may be paid;        (B) an individual participating in a sporting event or       activity sponsored or sanctioned by a national governing       body; or        (C) an individual for whom a high school or institution of       higher education provides a covered sports medicine       professional.

(3) Covered medical services.--The term ``covered medical       services'' means general medical care, emergency medical       care, athletic training, or physical therapy services. Such       term does not include care provided by a covered sports       medicine professional--        (A) at a health care facility; or        (B) while a health care provider licensed to practice in       the secondary State is transporting the injured individual to       a health care facility.        (4) Covered sports medicine professional.--The term       ``covered sports medicine professional'' means a physician,       athletic trainer, or other health care professional who--        (A) is licensed to practice in the primary State;        (B) provides covered medical services, pursuant to a       written agreement with an athlete, an athletic team, a       national governing body, a high school, or an institution of       higher education; and        (C) prior to providing the covered medical services       described in subparagraph (B), has disclosed the nature and       extent of such services to the entity that provides the       professional with liability insurance in the primary State.        (5) Health care facility.--The term ``health care       facility'' means a facility in which medical care, diagnosis,       or treatment is provided on an inpatient or outpatient basis.       Such term does not include facilities at an arena, stadium,       or practice facility, or temporary facilities existing for       events where athletes or athletic teams may compete.        (6) Institution of higher education.--The term       ``institution of higher education'' has the meaning given       such term in section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965       (20 U.S.C. 1001).

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 302, the Sports Medicine  Licensure Clarity Act of 2017, introduced by my colleague on the Health  Subcommittee, Brett Guthrie. The bill is identical to H.R. 921 from the  last Congress, which passed by a voice vote in the House in September.   Team physicians and other licensed sports medicine professionals  often travel with their athletes to away  [[Page H205]]  games and other sanctioned sporting events outside of their home State.  When providing care to an injured player during the game or in the  locker room afterwards, they are often doing so at great personal and  professional risk. If they are sued, their home State license could be  in jeopardy and their malpractice insurance may not cover them.   This commonsense bill would provide needed clarity.   First, by stating that their liability insurance shall cover them  outside of their home State for limited services within the scope of  their practice, subject to any related premium adjustments.   Second, to the extent that the healthcare professional is licensed  under the requirements of their home State to provide certain services  to an athlete or to a team, they shall be treated as satisfying  corresponding licensing requirements of the secondary State in these  narrowly defined instances.   H.R. 302 is supported by a wide range of professional medical  associations as well as amateur and professional sports organizations.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 302 by this body,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 304) to amend the Controlled Substances Act with regard to  the provision of emergency medical services.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 304         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Patient Access to       Emergency Medications Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES.         Section 303 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C.       823) is amended--        (1) by redesignating subsection (j) as subsection (k); and        (2) by inserting after subsection (i) the following:        ``(j) Emergency Medical Services That Administer Controlled       Substances.--        ``(1) Registration.--For the purpose of enabling emergency       medical services professionals to administer controlled       substances in schedule II, III, IV, or V to ultimate users       receiving emergency medical services in accordance with the       requirements of this subsection, the Attorney General--        ``(A) shall register an emergency medical services agency       if the agency submits an application demonstrating it is       authorized to conduct such activity under the laws of each       State in which the agency practices; and        ``(B) may deny an application for such registration if the       Attorney General determines that the issuance of such       registration would be inconsistent with the requirements of       this subsection or the public interest based on the factors       listed in subsection (f).        ``(2) Option for single registration.--In registering an       emergency medical services agency pursuant to paragraph (1),       the Attorney General shall allow such agency the option of a       single registration in each State where the agency       administers controlled substances in lieu of requiring a       separate registration for each location of the emergency       medical services agency.        ``(3) Hospital-based agency.--If a hospital-based emergency       medical services agency is registered under subsection (f),       the agency may use the registration of the hospital to       administer controlled substances in accordance with this       subsection without being registered under this subsection.        ``(4) Administration outside physical presence of medical       director or authorizing medical professional.--Emergency       medical services professionals of a registered emergency       medical services agency may administer controlled substances       in schedule II, III, IV, or V outside the physical presence       of a medical director or authorizing medical professional in       the course of providing emergency medical services if the       administration is--        ``(A) authorized by the law of the State in which it       occurs;

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 304, the Protecting  Patient Access to Emergency Medications Act, introduced by the  gentlemen from North Carolina, Mr. Hudson and Mr. Butterfield.   H.R. 304 would update the Drug Enforcement Administration  registration process for emergency medical services agencies with  multiple locations, clarifying recordkeeping requirements related to  the transportation and storage of controlled substances in the process.   Further, the bill would ensure that paramedics and other EMS  professionals are able to continue to administer pain and antiseizure  medications in emergency situations pursuant to standing or verbal  orders when certain conditions are met.   This commonsense measure is supported by over a dozen EMS and trauma  care organizations.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 304, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden), the chairman of the full Committee on Energy and  Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  H.R. 304, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
