 Mr. Speaker, this weekend I proudly joined United Auto  Workers on the picket line at United Auto Workers Local 12 in Toledo,  Ohio, striking Jeep Stellantis in solidarity.  [[Page H4374]]    Our mother helped organize the United Auto Workers nearly 90 years  ago at Champion Spark Plug, organizing and negotiating with United Auto  Workers founders Victor and Walter Reuther.   Our father, Stephen, who they called Kappy, retired in 1969 from  Jeep. Both were able to get better wages and benefits to help our  family as we were growing up.   I am including in the Record our mother's brief summary of why she  joined the union and worked so hard; primarily to assure seniority  rights of employment so you couldn't be fired because the supervisor  brought family members to replace you.   A bidding system was established so any open job was put up on the  board so the one with the most seniority got the job, if qualified.   Discrimination was outlawed so the foreman could no longer put his  pets or relatives on the best job. The right to ask for a pay raise was  assured through negotiation and the right to strike granted to  employees.   Leaves for illness were granted so people wouldn't be fired if a  doctor certification was provided.   I will continue tomorrow and enter the additional three sentences  orally, but I just want to say go, UAW. We are so proud of you.   When our mother Anastasia was in her early 20's, she landed a job at  the Champion Spark Plug Company in Toledo where she had applied at the  employment office every day for one year. She never missed a day of  work between any of her jobs. Here, her weekly wage rose to $40 a week.  She worked the production line at plug tamping where she was paid based  on her output and she always did the maximum number each day. It was at  Champion that she was elected to the Charter Committee of the Local 12  United Auto Workers Trade Union that was forming. She summarized for  her children why she helped form the union--``primarily to assure  seniority rights of employment so you couldn't be fired because the  supervisor brought family members to replace you. A bidding system was  established so any open job was put up on the board so the one with the  most seniority got the job if qualified. Discrimination was outlawed so  the foreman could no longer put his pets or relatives on the best job.  The right to ask for a pay raise was assured through negotiation and  the right to strike granted to employees. Leaves for illness were  granted so people wouldn't be fired if a doctor's certification was  provided. Bathroom privileges were allowed for personal contingencies.  Three months leave was allowed for pregnancy. Layoffs would occur  according to seniority. And a grievance procedure was established to  curb harassment by mean foremen.''   Elected union Secretary, Mom gained respect by both company and union  members for her knowledge of the bidding system, her ability to handle  grievances, and her detailed grasp of the labor contract.                            ____________________
