 Mr. President, I thank Senator Menendez. I appreciate  the opportunity to talk about what this Senate and Congress has done.  Last Congress, we passed unanimously the North Korea Sanctions and  Policy Enhancement Act.   This legislation that we are about to vote on builds on the success  we started with last year. We have more work to do to stop the crazed  Kim regime.   I thank the chairman and the leader for committing to further  conversations on North Korea, further action that needs to be taken  because we know that, in China, there are over 5,000 businesses still  doing business with North Korea. China is responsible for 90 percent of  the North Korean economy. Now, 10 of those 5,000 businesses are  responsible for 30 percent of the economic activity, the imports from  North Korea into China. More work has to be done to stop this madman in  Pyongyang.   I thank this Senate for moving forward on legislation today to build  on the success we had last year. I urge its passage. We have more work  to do to put an end to this regime.
