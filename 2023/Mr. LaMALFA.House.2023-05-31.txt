 Mr. Speaker, there was a crazy lawsuit brought by an  environmental group here recently in the West to stop the usage of fire  retardant that is used to fight forest fires, that red stuff that comes  out of the aircraft that they drop on fires to keep them from getting  worse.   Thankfully, that lawsuit was overruled. A district judge ruled that  the U.S. Forest Service can keep using the aerial fire retardant for at  least another couple of years, so we have that going for us.   Now, they do have to keep checking back every 6 months to make sure  that they are working on a permit process to keep the ability to use  that fire retardant to put out forest fires.   As you know, every year millions of acres of forest go up, sending  even the smoke plume all the way back here to the East Coast sometimes  and causing health days to not be able to go outside.   Here in Congress, we have legislation ready. I have introduced H.R.  1586, the Forest Protection and Wildland Firefighter Safety Act of  2023, so we will be ready in case there is a court ruling that comes in  and says they can't use that stuff anymore. Congress needs to act.                            ____________________
