 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in special recognition of my  dear friend, mentor, and former surgical chairman, Dr. J. William  McRoberts, known affectionately as ``Mac.''   A native of Rochester, Minnesota, he graduated from Princeton  University and attended Cornell University School of Medicine where he  was elected class president.   After completing his surgical training at the Mayo Clinic, he was  stationed as director of urology at the U.S. Naval Hospital in  Bremerton, Washington. He continued to serve in the U.S. Navy as a  captain in the Reserves for 20 years.   He began his academic career as an assistant professor at the  University of Washington, excelling throughout the ranks and becoming  chairman of urology in the division of surgery at the University of  Kentucky.   As my chairman, Dr. McRoberts taught me a great deal about patient  care, endurance, and professionalism. Despite long and oftentimes  grueling hours, he kept a great wit and humor about him, challenging us  all not only to be better physicians but better humans. He demonstrated  that compassion and surgical skill are not mutually exclusive.   Once he retired from academic life in 2001, instead of just enjoying  the fruits of his labor, he has served in underserved areas in Kentucky  and for the last 3 years in rural eastern North Carolina.   Now, at the age of 90, I am releasing him of his medical obligation  to enjoy his life with his wife, Marley; son, Porter; daughter, Jane;  and their grandchildren.   My life has been a better one lived because of his professionalism,  humor, and friendship.  [[Page H6157]]                                ____________________
