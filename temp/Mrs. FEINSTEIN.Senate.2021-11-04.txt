 Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of my  bipartisan bill, the National Commission on the COVID-19 Pandemic Act.  This bill would establish a 9/11-style Commission to conduct an  investigation on the COVID-19 outbreak and identify lessons learned  regarding preparedness, response, and recovery. I would like to thank  my cosponsors, Senators Marshall, Gillibrand, and Ernst, for joining me  in introducing this crucial bill.   Like we did after the devastating September 11 terrorist attacks, our  bill would establish a bipartisan Commission on the COVID-19 pandemic  to better understand the vulnerabilities it has revealed in our  national security and healthcare system and improve our preparedness  for future crises.   It is crucial to improve our understanding of pandemic threats and  health issues that the United States could face in the coming decades  to better protect our population and mitigate the risk of a similar  human and economic catastrophe in the future.   To date, COVID-19 has caused more than 750,000 deaths in the United  States and infected at least 46 million people.   Beyond the devastating toll it has taken on human lives, the pandemic  revealed vulnerabilities in our preparedness for dealing with such a  deadly virus.   At the beginning of the U.S. outbreak, hospitals struggled to secure  enough personal protective equipment to keep health workers safe. As  the pandemic worsened, we saw additional shortages in critical medical  equipment like ventilators and other medical products that save lives,  including testing supplies.   As we waited for effective treatments and vaccines to be developed  and approved, testing and mask wearing supplemented with physical  distancing and other nonpharmaceutical tools were our only weapons  combating the spread of the virus. However, we knew these tactics alone  wouldn't ultimately defeat the virus.   After unprecedented scientific collaboration and innovation, we now  finally have three FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines that are safe,  effective, and free for all Americans. While getting as many people  vaccinated as possible remains the only path out of the pandemic,  barriers to access and misunderstanding about the safety of the  vaccines have delayed too many Americans from getting their vaccine.   Disturbingly, throughout the pandemic, we have seen an increase in  hate crimes against the Asian American and Pacific Islander community  due to racially discriminatory language related to COVID-19. Possible  underreporting means this problem may be even more prevalent than we  know.   Finally, after examining all available intelligence reporting and  information, the intelligence community remains divided on the most  likely origin of COVID-19. According to the latest declassified  assessment on COVID-19 origins, more information is needed to provide a  more definitive explanation of how the virus emerged.   The Commission that would be established by our bipartisan bill would  conduct a comprehensive investigation of our government's preparedness  and response to the COVID-19 pandemic and make recommendations on how  we can be better prepared in the future.   Modeled after the 9/11 Commission, this investigative body would  complement other oversight efforts in Congress and the administration.   The Commission would be composed of 10 members who aren't current  Federal officials, with the same partisan balance as the 9/11  Commissioners and with a variety of backgrounds in relevant fields,  including public health, epidemiology, emergency preparedness, medical  intelligence, and others; provide a full accounting to the President,  Congress, and the American people of the facts and circumstances  related to the outbreak in the United States as well as abroad,  including our preparedness, the intelligence and information we had  available before the virus reached the United States, and how Federal,  State, and local governments, as well as the private sector, responded  to the crisis; and gather information and hold hearings to eventually  publish public reports on the Commission's findings and  recommendations.   The global COVID-19 pandemic showed just how unprepared we were to  respond to a major public health threat that has continued for almost 2  years. This lack of readiness caused widespread shutdowns of society in  the United States and across the globe, resulting in a number of  preventable deaths too high to comprehend.   As we mourn those we lost, we must acknowledge that this pandemic is  still not over and the threat of a new virus emerging that has greater  pandemic potential looms. This Commission will ensure we learn from our  achievements as well as our tragedies during this modem plague so that  it may never happen again.   I want to thank the Infectious Diseases Society of America for their  support of our bill, and I look forward to working with my colleagues  to pass it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of my  bipartisan bill, the National Commission on the COVID-19 Pandemic Act.
