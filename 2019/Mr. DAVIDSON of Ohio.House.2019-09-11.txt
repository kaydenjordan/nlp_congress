 Mr. Speaker, never forget. In 2001 on 9/11,  2,977 peaceful people were murdered by 19 jihadi terrorists who were  recruited by, plotted with, and were directed by al-Qaida to commit  evil acts of war against the United States of America.   America is the greatest Nation to ever exist. We must never waiver in  our resolve to defend our way of life. As the world tragically learned  on 9/11, terrorists should never be ignored or given sanctuary to plan,  prepare, or launch their evil acts. As Scripture says, there is a time  for war. Following 9/11 was such a time.   Sadly, America's focus has long since expanded from finding and  eliminating terrorists and those who give them sanctuary. Great nations  don't fight endless wars. If we are truly to make America great again,  we must be laser focused. America does not negotiate with terrorists or  those who give them sanctuary. There is no substitute for victory.                            ____________________
