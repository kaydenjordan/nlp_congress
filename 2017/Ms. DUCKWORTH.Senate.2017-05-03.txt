 Mr. President, our Nation faces a retirement savings  crisis. Too many seniors live in poverty after a lifetime of hard work,  and too many people are facing retirement who have not been able to put  away the adequate savings they will need. That is a problem not only on  a human level and on a moral level but on an economic level.   When seniors are forced to live in poverty, that hurts all of us and  is a strike against our Nation's values. As more people have to spend  money to take care of their retired parents and relatives, that hurts  our economy. Millions of seniors do not have family  [[Page S2700]]  members who can spend those resources, so it is taxpayers who will have  to make sure seniors have a place to live, food to eat, and medicine to  keep them healthy. That is why we must do everything we can to help  people save for retirement themselves and not have to rely on the  taxpayer, to help them put a little bit of money away while they still  can.   At the very least, the Senate should stay out of the way of our  States that are taking action to address this looming crisis, but that  is not what the Senate is doing here today. Instead, we are debating a  resolution that would make it harder for people to save for retirement.  We are debating whether to limit the ability of State governments to  help people save for their retirement.   While some Americans are fortunate enough to work at companies that  offer their employees retirement plans, many more do not. That is  significant because research shows that the best way for people to save  for retirement is through a retirement plan at work. Without one,  workers are less likely to invest in an IRA or a 401(k) savings plan.  That is why it is so worrisome that there are 55 million Americans  right now in this country who do not have access to a retirement plan  through their jobs. As the baby boomer generation approaches  retirement, that is a serious problem.   President Obama proposed establishing a national individual  retirement account program to help these 55 million Americans, but  Republicans said no. In the absence of congressional action, both red  States and blue States took the lead. They did so by coming up with a  way for Americans to better save for retirement. One solution that has  gained momentum over the last few years is to establish retirement  programs at the State level to give people the chance to have  retirement contributions deducted out of their paychecks into that plan  if their company doesn't already offer a retirement program. It would  give every worker across this Nation the same access to the tax breaks  those lucky enough to have access to an employer-sponsored plan  receive.   In my home State of Illinois, we were one of the first to do this. A  few years ago, our State created the Secure Choice Program. It is an  innovative program that is poised to give 1.3 million Illinoisans the  opportunity to save for retirement when it launches next year. It is  important to note that not only is Secure Choice innovative, it does  not impose any burdensome mandates. It is optional. People can deduct  up to 3 percent of their wages, and it applies only to businesses with  at least 25 employees that have been in existence for 2 years. Secure  Choice is also portable, so people can take their savings with them if  they switch jobs. It is estimated that it will save taxpayers almost  $243.8 million in the first 10 years because retirees will not need to  rely as much on Medicaid spending.   It is a pragmatic solution to address a real-world problem. Other  States have since followed our lead in establishing other similar  programs. That is why I find it so ironic that my Republican  colleagues, who frequently speak about the need to protect States'  rights, are using this resolution we are voting on today to try to  block States as culturally and politically different as Illinois and  Arizona from offering or even having the freedom to offer these plans.  Instead of allowing States to be the laboratories of democracy they so  often talk about, Republicans are trying to limit States' flexibility  and, in the process, increase regulatory burdens on employers. That is  quite a role reversal.   Why is there this push to block the States from trying to help their  residents better save for retirement? One reason could be that it would  pad the financial industry's bottom line. That is because many  investment brokers don't want increased competition, and they are  worried that programs like Secure Choice that are run by States will  offer people who are saving for retirement a better deal.   News reports have indicated that mutual fund companies are worried  that they will lose customers to State-based plans, even though the  entire purpose of efforts like Secure Choice is to help the millions of  Americans who are not currently saving for retirement. Other news  outlets have reported that financial analysts on Wall Street are  worried that State plans will be transparent about hidden fees, which  means that financial analysts may be forced to reveal that they are  charging fees that are perhaps a little too high and will have to lower  how much they charge.   Instead of encouraging greater competition that will help 55 million  Americans save money for retirement, some of my colleagues are  listening to Wall Street lobbyists who want less competition and who  want to take away a retirement savings option from hard-working  Americans. And here I was thinking that the conservatives believe  competition produces better outcomes for the American people.   At the end of the day, we as Senators must do everything we can to  make it easier for people to save for retirement, not harder. We must  look out for the constituents who sent us here to represent them, not  for Wall Street or for special interests. That is why I urge my  colleagues to stand by the States that have led the Nation in creating  retirement plans, States as different as Illinois, Arizona, California,  Maryland, Oregon, Connecticut, Washington, and New Jersey. Please do  not take the opportunity to save for retirement away from 55 million  hard-working Americans.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.
