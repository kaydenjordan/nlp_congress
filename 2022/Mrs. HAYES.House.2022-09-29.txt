 Mr. Chair, as a teacher, I rise in strong support of the  Mental Health Matters Act.   This crucial legislation will help rebuild schools and address the  mental health crisis plaguing our country by providing schools with  resources to help students and educators heal and recover after this  pandemic.   I am excited that this package includes my legislation, the  Supporting Trauma-Informed Education Practices Act. My legislation  specifically will help develop and improve prevention, screening,  referral, treatment, and support services to students. It will  implement schoolwide positive behavioral interventions and provide  professional development to school personnel. This legislation will  also engage with families and communities to increase awareness of  child and youth trauma.   The broader impact of the pandemic on students and their families is  often overlooked. We talk about the number of children who were lost as  a result of being low, but I remind everyone that those children lost  parents, grandparents, neighbors, and community members to the COVID-19  pandemic. That loss has taken a tremendous toll on their ability to  learn and thrive in school.   The impact of trauma is greater than just one incident. No person,  especially a child, should ever have to carry that weight alone.   As students continue to heal from the most traumatizing interruption  to their academic journeys, they need strong, reliable, and accessible  support services.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bill to ensure  students recover completely.
