 Madam Speaker, the shock of the loss of Justice  Ginsburg and the stunning hypocrisy of Republicans who denied Judge  Garland even a hearing because a year was not enough time rush to jam  through another Trump appointment.   The devastating national disasters of the Oregon and California fires  and Trump's failure to respond to the COVID health and economic  disasters are a stunning backdrop to the work we have before us.   We have a chance to take steps in this Congress that in normal times  would be historic reforms working with you, Madam Speaker on  legislation to reform our hopelessly outdated marijuana legislation.   We have a chance to pass legislation that would rescue 500,000  independent restaurants, who are at risk of going out of business if we  don't take steps now. And these are bipartisan initiatives.   Congress ought to do what it can moving forward where it can  cooperate. Who knows, it might become habit forming.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 991) to extend certain provisions of the Caribbean Basin  Economic Recovery Act until September 30, 2030, and for other purposes,  as amended.

SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, let me begin by commending Representatives Sewell and  Wenstrup for taking a leadership role on this program. Last year, they  introduced this bill to reauthorize the Caribbean Basin Trade  Partnership Act, which expires at the end of the month. They helped  organize a terrific hearing before the Ways and Means Trade  Subcommittee to be able to focus on this.   It is imperative that the Senate act quickly on this bill and that we  get it done before September 30.   In today's political climate, it is important to highlight those few  areas of bipartisan consensus. The CBTPA has historically enjoyed that  bipartisan and bicameral support, in part because of the shared history  and close ties to the United States with the Caribbean Basin region.   There are about 13 million Americans who have Caribbean ancestors.  They represent 4 percent of the American population.   The Caribbean, in particular Haiti, played a critical role in the  American Revolutionary War, where hundreds of Haitians fought for  America's independence.   Years later, Haiti would defend the French and become the first Black  republic, influencing the rise of abolitionist and anti-colonial  movements all over the world, especially here in the United States.  Haiti's sacrifices and unyielding resolve continue to inspire millions.   Sadly, the United States, under the influence of slave-holding  interests, actively worked against this fledgling new republic. They  were threatened by the specter of a slave uprising and Black  independent government.   The United States was hostile to Haiti for years, and worked to  undermine its success. Rather than be a constructive partner to help  this fledgling republic, the United States interfered, and more  importantly, failed to embrace the emergence of the first Black  republic.   Now, there are some admitted problems of governance, poverty, and  corruption in Haiti and in the region. I personally strongly believe  that some of those difficulties that Haiti experiences to this day are  the result of failures of American policy.   That is why this Caribbean Basin Initiative is so important. It is an  opportunity to continue to strengthen Haiti's economy and our working  relationship.   In 2001, after that devastating earthquake in Haiti, I joined a  bipartisan, bicameral delegation to Port-au-Prince to demonstrate the  ongoing support in Congress to the Haitian people, to understand the  challenges they face, and demonstrate our commitment to work with the  Haitian Government to assist with reconstruction efforts.   Haiti, by design, is the primary beneficiary of the textile and  apparel preferences under CBTPA, more important now than ever.   Recently, we heard firsthand at our hearing from witnesses and some  of our colleagues, including Congresswoman Sewell, about the  development challenges that persist in the region.   Like any good trading relationship, we will continue to work to  improve labor conditions, political stability, and expand economic  development to all countries in the region.   Passing this reauthorization is an important step toward those goals.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation and I urge the Senate to act quickly to extend the  bipartisan program without delay. It is an opportunity for us to  demonstrate to the country and to ourselves that despite many of the  challenges, there are things we can do working together to improve the  conditions.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume  to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell), who has played an  instrumental role in this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close so I will defer  to my colleague from Ohio. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I thank the good doctor, and Ms. Sewell for helping us  facilitate the movement of this legislation and make it possible for us  to actually maybe even get it enacted in this Congress before the  deadline expires at the end of the month.   As I referenced, this, I think, is very, very important. The region  is home to these eight countries that have provided some 13 million  Americans with a country of origin. It is in our neighborhood and it is  an area where the United States has been involved from the beginning.   As I mentioned in my opening comments, we have not always  distinguished ourselves with honor but this is an opportunity for us to  do the right thing: to build on this existing legislation; to not have  it expire; to demonstrate broad, bipartisan commitment and then get  back to the hard work of implementing it.   It provides a framework but it is not self-executing. It is something  that we need to do with policy, with our actions and words, being able  to build on this as a foundation for progress in this critical region.   I thank Madam Speaker for the opportunity to advance it, and I  strongly urge all of my colleagues to approve this legislation and be  able to keep it in force before it expires at the end of the month.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, last week our subcommittee held a  hearing on the Chinese Government's use of forced labor for the  production of all kinds of goods through a concerted program of  oppression and coerced assimilation of China's Uyghur population.   You have heard the horrible details that we had expressed in our  committee. We have had a long history of grappling with the depravity  of forced labor and ensuring that goods produced under such conditions  do not eventually make their way into our grocery stores and shopping  malls across the country.   We passed a law a century ago prohibiting importation of such goods.  But, unfortunately, the ban--founded on principles of morality, human  rights, worker rights, as well principles of fair competition--has, to  be charitable, a history of spotty implementation.   We don't pretend that it is going to be easy to stop this. Global  supply chains now are complex and interrelated. It is going to require  the concerted efforts of us all. But we should not allow complex supply  chains to justify the chains of oppression on the Uyghur populations  now.   I look forward to working with my colleagues in the aftermath of the  passage of this legislation, that we work to actually implement it, we  work with the expressions that have been positive from the private  sector and NGOs, and other partners, to make sure that it is real. It  is going to require concerted effort. It is going to require some  dislocation. We may even pay a dime or two more for a pair of socks or  a T-shirt.    But I do think not being complicit with this horrific oppression of  over a million--and I agree with Mr. Smith, it may well be more than  that. It is time for us to make sure that we take a stand. Make it  real.   I deeply appreciate the sentiment on both sides of the aisle that we  are committed to stop it now. In an era of, shall we say, a little  conflict, this could be a bright spot for us going forward.
