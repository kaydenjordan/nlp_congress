 Mr. Speaker, I am angry.   I am angry that Republicans are trying to fool the American people.  The Republican healthcare bill is nothing more than a tax bill  disguised as a healthcare bill.   TrumpCare is an almost $570 billion tax break for health insurance  companies, pharmaceutical companies, and the extremely wealthy. It is a  bill that asks working families to pay more for less: less coverage,  less access, and less care.   Recently, a concerned constituent called my office after discovering  that his son would need surgery at birth for a heart defect and then  subsequent surgeries later on. He wanted to know what he could do to  stop TrumpCare and protect his son, who would be born with a  preexisting condition and face thousands of dollars of cost throughout  his life.   Mr. Speaker, let's pass healthcare legislation that invests in and  protects the healthcare of all Americans, holds the healthcare industry  accountable, and lowers cost.                            ____________________
