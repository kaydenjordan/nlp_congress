 Mr. Speaker, I am here today because I, like the rest of  our Nation, am outraged about what we have seen happen in Tennessee.   Six innocent people died as a result of senseless gun violence in  Nashville, a school shooting where we lost children that will never be  forgotten.   Instead of banning together to honor these victims, to honor those  families, to honor with action, real action that would save lives,  Republicans in the Tennessee Legislature took the racist step of  expelling two Black lawmakers who stood with the families, students,  teachers, and their constituents in demanding change.   The only thing that Representatives Jones and Pearson are guilty of  is doing the right thing, of standing with their constituents who sent  them to the State legislature to fight for their lives. That is why  they have already been unanimously reappointed to their positions by  the people in their local governments.   I pray and act and fight for a day when we are more outraged that  children were murdered in a pool of their own blood at school than we  are that Black folks have the audacity to take up space in the halls of  power.   Guess what? Representatives Jones and Pearson will continue to take  up that space. Black lawmakers such as myself and my colleagues in this  room will continue to take up that space. The people--children--for  whom the leading cause of death in this country is guns will continue  to take up that space.   As long as there is injustice, we will not be silent. We will  continue to fight for a world where no one has to have the fear of gun  violence.   I commend Representatives Jones and Pearson. They are American heroes  because they fight for a day when we can be safe.   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Kamlager-Dove).
