 Mr. Speaker, last February, President Trump had CEOs  from America's largest manufacturers to come and talk about progrowth  tax policies. Instead of talking about taxes, what they really talked  about is the real need out there, which is to close the skills gap in  this country and get the job training out there so that people can get  hired.   USA Today reported the next day with the headline: ``U.S. factory  CEOs to Trump: Jobs exist; skills don't.'' In the 2017 budget, the  bipartisan budget, Congress listened, and we appropriated robust  funding for apprenticeship programs, for youth job training programs,  and for adult, older incumbent job training programs.   Incredibly, a few minutes ago, the partisan Republican budget cut  apprenticeship grants to zero, from 95 million from last year to zero.  Mr. Speaker, better skills means better wages and better jobs. We  should be investing strongly in job training programs so that people  will have a future for themselves and their families.   We should listen to the job creators in this country. We should  listen to the people back home, and we should reject this Republican  budget which incredibly turns the clock back so that we can fill the  job openings that the Labor Department says now total almost 6 million  jobs in this country. Close the skills gaps. Invest in job training.                            ____________________
