 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas  (Mr. Womack) for his hand of conciliation, his reconciliation, and to  acknowledge the work that he and the chairman of the Budget Committee  have done and the tone in which the Budget Committee has conducted  itself in 2019.   Let me, as the gentleman referred to Article I, Section 8, take note  of the fact that it is a recognition of the power to lay and collect  taxes and duties, to borrow money and regulate commerce, but in  particular, I believe that there is an underlying responsibility that  when we do lay taxes on the American people, or we cut taxes and give 1  percent of the population an enormous gift of paying no taxes, that we  then have a responsibility to try to respond to the Americans who work  every day and pay taxes and are wondering, ``What is our government  doing?'' This budget is answering the question.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to join the gentleman and repeal the Trump  tax cuts, as it burdens working Americans, as it denies nonprofits the  ability to have deductions when gifts are given to them, but we are  where we are today.   This bipartisan budget resolution, which I am grateful to have a  combination of leadership and others, eliminates the risk of another  costly and devastating government shutdown. There were government  workers on food stamps who could not get to work.   It lifts the sequestration caps imposed under the Budget Control Act  of 2011 to provide for increased investments in nondefense  discretionary programs needed to keep America competitive.   I was in the midst of those discussions, as many of us were. They  were devastating. They were cutting the needs of Americans.   We avoid default on the national debt.    Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to the gentleman for  yielding.   I want to bring to the attention of the American people what we will  be able to do: public health and disease control, highways, waterway  maintenance, hazardous waste.   I came from a community where Hurricane Harvey dumped 51 trillion  gallons of water. We need infrastructure.   The Army Corps of Engineers, Federal courts, FBI, childcare, disaster  assistance, economic development, all of that will now come about.   At the same time, we will ensure that the United States military will  be strong.   We will not be competing against each other. By the time we get  through, we are avoiding an 11 percent cut to defense and a 9 percent  cut to nondefense discretionary. We are making people whole.   As it relates to what the Budget Committee has done, we have had  hearings on healthcare, climate change, education, Medicare, Social  Security. We have been doing work in the Budget Committee on issues  that are important, but we are seeking parity.   We are helping with domestic priorities. We are saying to the  American people that we are not just taking your money and giving it to  the top 1 percent of Americans. We are now balancing the budget, or  working on the budget, paying down on the debt, and ensuring that we do  not default on America's debt.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to be able to support this bill to help  America.   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Budget Committee, I rise in strong  support of H.R. 3877, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019.''   I support this agreement because it:    1. eliminates the risk of another costly and devastating government  shutdown;    2. lifts the sequestration caps imposed under the Budget Control Act  of 2011 to provide for increased investments in non-defense  discretionary (NDD) programs needed to keep America strong and  competitive; and    3. avoids default on the national debt and preserves America's  standing as the world's most creditworthy nation.   I thank my Chairman Yarmuth of the Budget Committee and Chairman Neal  of the Ways and Means Committee, and the bipartisan and bicameral  leadership of the Congress for their work in reaching this agreement  and shepherding this legislation to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support lifting the caps imposed by the  Budget Control Act of 2011 and ending the awful policy of  sequestration.   That is why I strongly supported the H.R. 2021, the ``Investing For  The People Act,'' when it was marked up by the Budget Committee earlier  this year.   Mr. Speaker, without Congressional action, statutory caps on  discretionary funding will force an 11 percent cut to defense and a 9  percent cut, about $55 billion, to nondefense discretionary (NDD)  programs for 2020 relative to the amounts provided for 2019.   The Balanced Budget Agreement of 2019 replaces these destructive cuts  with a realistic budgetary framework so that Congress, through its  annual appropriations bills, can make critical investments in our  nation's infrastructure and people.   As we learned and documented in several Budget Committee hearings  convened by Chairman Yarmuth, such deep cuts would have a devastating  effect on U.S. national security and economic vitality.   Failure to lift the budget caps and leaves agencies that respond to  public health threats and emergencies vulnerable to harmful cuts.   The National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease  Control, along with the State Department and U.S. Agency for  International Development, play unique roles in preparing for and  responding to threats domestically and abroad.   At a time when there are numerous challenges--from outbreaks of Ebola  and Zika, to the Flint water crisis, to chronic diseases like  Alzheimer's and cancer, to the opioid epidemic--it is clear we cannot  neglect these investments.   Climate change threatens crop yields, infrastructure, water and  energy supplies, and human health.   Climate change poses risks to federal property and resources,  increases potential outlays from flood and crop insurance, and creates  looming disaster assistance needs.   Under sequestration, agencies dealing with this threat would be  dramatically underfunded and deprived of the resources needed to  respond to this national and global challenge.   According to military experts, diplomacy and foreign aid are critical  components of our national security.   Both Trump's own former Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, and  former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates have stressed the importance  of diplomacy and foreign aid:         ``If you don't fully fund the State Department, then I need       to buy more ammunition.''--then Commander of U.S. Central       Command, General James Mattis, 2013        ``. . . based on my experience serving seven presidents, as       a former director of C.I.A. and now as secretary of defense,       I am here to make the case for strengthening our capacity to       use `soft power' and for better integrating it with `hard       power.' ''--Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, 2007    Inadequate nondefense funding levels lead to State and Foreign  Operations appropriations bills that:    1. slash embassy security funding by more than 21 percent; and    2. decrease assistance to multilateral organizations, including our  UN contributions, signaling to the rest of the world that the U.S. no  longer keeps its word.   Mr. Speaker, the sequestration regime created by the Budget Control  Act of 2011 is an untenable state of affairs and must be corrected.   The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 is an important step in the right  direction and represents a vast improvement over the harmful cuts  contained in the President's 2020 budget, restores certainty to our  budgeting and achieves the important priorities of the American people,  including:    1. Permanently ends the threat of the sequester and preventing  devastating funding cuts of 14 percent to defense spending and 13  percent to non-defense spending, and replaces years of reckless  austerity budgeting with responsible budgeting;    2. Achieving parity between defense and non-defense discretionary  spending; in fact, the increase in the non-defense budget authority  that exceeds the defense number by $10 billion.    3. Securing robust funding for critical domestic priorities,  including an additional $2.5 billion for a fair, accurate and timely  Census; robust funding for veterans, Child Care Development Block  Grants, and a strong increase in the National Institutes of Health  budget to accelerate life-saving cancer and health research.   Mr. Speaker, for nearly 75 years, since the end of World War II, the  world has been impressed by examples of American power.   But what has inspired people the world over is the power of America's  example.   To defend America and keep her great and strong, we need to pass the  Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, which ends sequestration and lifts  [[Page H7408]]  the budget caps and enable the Congress to invest in America and her  people and restore their faith in their government.    Madam Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 549, the  Venezuela TPS Act of 2019.   This particular bill designates Venezuela for temporary protected  status for an initial 18-month period beginning on the date of  enactment, and such designation would allow eligible nationals of  Venezuela who are in the United States on the date of enactment to  register for TPS benefits, including temporary immigration status and  employment authorization.   Let me indicate that, in my community in Houston, there are a number  of Venezuelans who have told their story of fleeing and leaving behind  family members. Many of them, however, have had the opportunity to be  in this country to be safe but still to be concerned about family  members.   We know that there are difficult times in Venezuela. It is important  for the United States to engage diplomatically to try and resolve this.   We know there are medical crises, health crises, crises of family  separation, and violence.   So, I would make the point that this is an important initiative, and  I would also say that I would like to thank one of the constituents in  my community, CITGO, a company that has many Venezuelans working there  but has been a generous supporter of Houston.   I believe that it is important to try and resolve these issues to  bring peace to Venezuela. TPS is appropriate, and we should do it now.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, first, I would like to congratulate  the gentleman from Illinois, Congressman Garcia, not only for his  legacy and leadership here in the United States Congress, but really  for the work of reconciliation and friendship in the great city of  Chicago, working with so many different groups and understanding the  myriad of issues dealing with immigrants.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to, first of all, say to my fellow  Americans--that was something utilized by President Lyndon Baines  Johnson. And I would think that, as he said it many, many years ago,  America was less diverse--I use it now, because I think it is  important in a Nation that is enormously diverse, that we, in fact, use  the words ``fellow Americans,'' so that we cannot pit one group of  Americans against another, these immigrants against those who are here,  or those who have been immigrants that have come and now have either  gotten status or been here for a long time. Let us not let the  administration pit one American against another. We are, in fact,  really our brothers' and sisters' keeper.    When I think of immigrants, I think of every single person who has  come to this Nation. They have come in many different colors and in  many different eras. Yes, Native Americans were already here. Yes,  African Americans came as slaves. But then, as the years passed, there  were people of African descent who came as immigrants. There were Irish  and Italians, there were people from Britain and Germany, and there  were people from South Asia, Asia, and Asia Pacific. And, of course,  there are those who have now come from the southern border.   Why do we have the right to be able to demonize individuals who have  come in a recent time, individuals who simply want an opportunity to  work, to contribute, and, yes, to put on the uniform?   I am reminded of Captain Khan and his wonderful family. Captain Khan  was a Pakistani who died in the recent war in Iraq. He came here to  this country. His family came here to this country.   So, I join with my colleague to say that we must pass comprehensive  immigration reform, but we must pass the legislation that includes the  American Dream and Promise Act. We must recognize that we have to  confront the issue of dealing with the treatment of those who have come  most recently.   How do we deny it, when those of us who have been to the border, for  example, literally talked to persons who have said they watched their  father being beat to death and they watched as the MS-13, who are  wanted in that country, come to make them a member? How are you going  to challenge that?   How do you challenge a woman who got on the road and had her baby on  the road because people in the neighborhood said she owed them money  and they were going to kill her?   How do you answer an aunt who went to the store and came back and  found all of her nieces and nephews drugged and individuals in the  house and all they had to do was escape for their life?   So, I believe that standing here today is recognizing that there must  be a solution.   Let me share with you just some of the comments from a hearing that  we had on the oversight of family separation and CBP short-term custody  under the Trump administration.   In March 2017, former Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly  announced that DHS was considering a proposal to separate families at  the southern border as a means of deterring migration. And that is what  they did.   Today, it was indicated that they had not reunited every one of those  children that had been separated. Who of us in America would welcome  the idea of children being snatched from you? You wanted that child.  This wasn't a situation of abuse. And then you come to find out they  could not find you or find your child to reunite.   In a September 2018 report, the DHS Inspector General found that DHS  was not fully prepared to implement the administration's zero-tolerance  policy or to deal with some of its aftereffects. Can you imagine that?  They just didn't have the facilities to deal with this very detrimental  policy.   What about asylum? That is international law. That is a law that  allows individuals fleeing persecution to come to any country and seek  asylum under their laws. Under our law, if you are in credible fear,  you could seek asylum. Those administrations that were reasonable  recognized that domestic violence could be taken into consideration.   But let us realize where we are: The Trump administration eliminated  domestic violence right out and then wanted to eliminate the rights of  those individuals to file for asylum. Just recently, a lawsuit said,  no, Mr. President, you cannot do that. You cannot do that and deny the  rights under international law and national law for these individuals  to be able to use the process that has been granted to so many before  them.   And then, of course, this report from the Office of Inspector General  that--in actuality, a report was made public on July 2, though it was  given to the Department of Homeland Security much earlier than that,  but I think this was a report on the CBP and BP facilities at the  border. Let me recognize, of course, the need to provide resources.   We voted on a $4.6 billion appropriations at the beginning of July to  be able to help and to provide better resources. But one of the things  that was said to the Secretary of Homeland Security: ``DHS needs to  address dangerous overcrowding among single adults at El Paso Del Norte  processing center.''   And: ``DHS needs to address dangerous overcrowding and prolonged  detention of children and adults in the Rio Grande Valley.''   This is not Sheila Jackson Lee or Congressman Garcia, this is the  Department of Homeland Security Inspector General's report.   We are, in fact, our brothers' and sisters' keeper. We are many  colors as immigrants. Africans are coming across the border, fleeing  for their lives, seeking relief.   All we have to do is to follow our laws to allow the asylum process  to proceed and those individuals to be rendered a judgment that they  can stay or not stay. And then to use our refugee resettlement and our  humanitarian agencies to either help settle them in the United States  or resettle them as they go back out of the United States.   There's also the possibility of having an agreement that after their  asylum has failed, if it does, that they can remain with opportunities  in Mexico, which was originally spoken about.   But since I have been to the place in Mexico where the policies of  the President are to keep them in Mexico, I can tell you that Mexico at  the border does not have the resources, does not have the housing, and  does not have the jobs to take care of those individuals who are there.                                time  1915    Madam Speaker, I want to make it very clear, as I started out, my  fellow Americans, on this floor, this particular Democratic Congress in  the majority has recognized the importance of Americans.   We have passed legislation to bring down prescription drugs costs, to  protect against eliminating preexisting conditions, and to bring down  insurance costs. We just passed the historic  [[Page H7451]]  $15-an-hour wage increase as Federal law. We are working on gun safety.   We are working on issues dealing with Americans. But we must call our  higher angels and recognize the responsibility of this Nation to  address the concerns of its people.   So, as I conclude my remarks, let me say that I hope that we will be  able to work together on the 9,000 children who are held by the  Department of Health and Human Services in what we call shelters, and  to realize or to state--let me state it publicly to Health and Human  Services, whom I worked with on the Obama administration--that these  shelters do not belong to Health and Human Services. They belong to the  people of the United States, funded with taxpayer dollars, and that  means the Members of the United States Congress.   No Member of Congress should be blocked from going into these  facilities. No Member of Congress should be blocked from talking to  these young people who want to talk to them and tell them that they  have been in these centers for 3 months, 100 days. They are not  supposed to be there that long. There needs to be a system put in place  to expedite these youngsters. One youngster wants to go back home to  Mexico. He is still there.   So I want to put Health and Human Services on notice not to block any  of us from coming in, facilitating how we are to interact with these  young people, to provide them comfort and understanding of how we can  move their cases along--not pull them out, not break the law, not  disrespect the system, but to help the system, overloaded, choked down,  not concerned, to move forward on behalf of these young people.   I thank Congressman Garcia for giving me the opportunity to share  some of my thoughts about how we have to fix the broken immigration  system, which includes recognizing that many people who are here  working, paying taxes, paying a mortgage, have come here through no  fault of their own, and, as well, their families, who are here seeking  opportunity.   I believe that, together, in a bipartisan manner, we could really do  this, as we have done for immigrants who have come to this country in  the 1800s and the 1900s, and they have now integrated into our society.   Let me thank the gentleman so much for his leadership on this.
