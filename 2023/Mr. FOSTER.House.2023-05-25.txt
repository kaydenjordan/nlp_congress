 Madam Speaker, the obvious solution to this threat to our  economy is for the U.S. to join the rest of the world and simply repeal  the debt limit.   For years, I have been introducing legislation to do just that. House  Republicans now insist that they want to drag budget negotiations into  this discussion. Fine.   Both parties agree that default is unacceptable. Both parties agree  that our national debt must be dealt with.   There are two basic ways to do this: First, by cutting tax breaks  that allow billionaires to pay lower taxes than middle-class Americans  or by cutting programs that help ordinary Americans: retirees,  veterans, students, or just families that are trying to get their kids  through school.   As long as Republicans insist that the only thing that they will  consider to solve this problem is 100 percent on the backs of the  middle class and zero percent on the backs of the billionaires who fund  their campaigns, then they are not negotiating. That refusal is putting  our economy at risk.                            ____________________
