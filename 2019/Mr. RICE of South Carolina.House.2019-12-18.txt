 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to  this partisan sham of an impeachment resolution that is ripping our  country apart.   Beginning even before he took office, President Trump has been  attacked by a never-ending barrage of lies, corruption, and deceit by  the liberal political elite, including James Comey, Peter Strzok, Lisa  Page, Hillary Clinton, and the impeachment zealots in this Congress.   Democrats colluded with Russia and Ukraine to interfere in our 2016  election by producing the now-famous fake dossier. Now, they accuse  President Trump of colluding with a foreign power. What a joke.   They abuse their office to illegally wiretap and spy on President  Trump's campaign. Now, they accuse him of abusing his office. What a  joke.   Democrats structure these proceedings to deny the President and  Republicans in Congress a fair hearing. Then, they accuse the President  of obstructing Congress. Look in the mirror, folks.   The reaction of the American people, that this is contrived and  corrupt, was entirely predictable and is entirely correct. The polls  will turn against them, and the Democrats are desperate to stop the  bleeding. That is why we are cramming this vote in today, just before  leaving for recess, to dispose of impeachment as quickly and painlessly  as possible.   The actions of the Democrats are a stain on this Chamber. I urge my  colleagues to join me in fighting against this shameful abuse of power  and vote ``no'' on this sham of an impeachment resolution.
