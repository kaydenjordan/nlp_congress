 Madam Speaker, today I address something that is near  and dear to everyone's heart, and that is food security.   One of my biggest concerns right now, as I have become educated on  the things that concern Americans, is the fact that all around the  world right now, we are facing food shortages. A lot of this is created  by our own actions.   If you look in Ukraine right now, you have food rotting in bins  because of a war. The breadbasket of Europe is not going to be  producing crops in the next year because of the war.   In China, you have massive pollution which is contaminating their  agricultural output.   Meanwhile, you have countries like India that are reliant on foreign  fertilizer that are going to be choked off because of the environmental  movement.   You have the Netherlands and Germany reducing their nitrates in their  fertilizers, which they haven't done since World War I, which created a  famine back then.   In the United States, we have a third of our chickens and our eggs  that are being reduced because of Avian Flu.   Meanwhile, we are allowing Chinese nationals and billionaires to buy  up millions of acres of farmland. This is concerning for many reasons.  If we thought that the pandemic was a reason for government to  overreach, if we thought that that was going to be a crisis, imagine  what it would be like if we ran out of food, if we have food shortages.   When you realize that we had people panicking over toilet paper,  imagine what they will do when they panic when our cupboards are bare.  This could be a worldwide reason for war.   It is also another reason for government to increase their control.  There is always a reason for people to turn to the government to solve  the problems that the government created; and that is my main concern  today, to be something proactive rather than reactive.   We see it coming. We can see that any foreign national country could  come up with a virus to contaminate our livestock or even our crops;  and yet, we are doing nothing to proactively make sure that Chinese  nationals can't buy farmland in America; that billionaires can't buy  millions of acres of farmland and artificially increase prices during a  food shortage.   We, as Congress, need to be proactive. We need to reach out and make  sure we are doing things to strategically protect our food resources,  both here and abroad.   We need to fight back this idea that the environmental movement  shouldn't use fertilizer, shouldn't produce agriculture; shouldn't be  having foresight to protect human life over all else.   Madam Speaker, I propose that Congress is realistic in the way we  allow people to purchase. I am all for a free market. I am all for  allowing people to sell to who they want to; but always with the idea  that America still comes first, and Americans are protected in the  process; that we don't turn to the government to solve the problem that  we are creating, and that we don't allow foreign nationals to affect  our food supply because this would be catastrophic, both here and  abroad, and would lead to wars, as we have seen over and over through  the history of this world.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the people of  Iran as they struggle against an oppressive and dangerous regime.   I also commend our great Iranian-American community in Georgia and  across this Nation who hope that their friends and family on the other  side of the world may one day have the freedom and prosperity we all  enjoy in the United States. They are great patriots and valued  citizens.   For 4 consecutive months, Iranians have been protesting and calling  for the downfall of the clerical regime in Tehran. Their rulers have  brutally repressed dissidents and protesters, killing women who violate  their dress codes and men who stand up for their sisters, mothers,  wives, and daughters.   In the 117th Congress, 260 bipartisan Members of Congress cosponsored  H. Res. 118, which expressed unequivocal support for the Iranian  people's desire to establish a secular, democratic, and nonnuclear  republic.   I hope that we can attract even more bipartisan signers for our  resolution this week, of which I am a proud cosponsor.                            ____________________
