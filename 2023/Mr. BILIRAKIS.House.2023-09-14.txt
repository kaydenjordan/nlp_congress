 Mr. Speaker, Chairwoman Rodgers is doing a great job.  We are so fortunate to be on this committee. I think it is the best  committee in Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation that I co- lead with Representatives Joyce, Latta, and the gentleman from  California (Mr. Obernolte).   The California ban would have far-reaching national effects, not only  indirectly forcing EV vehicles onto consumers outside of California and  the 17  [[Page H4321]]  other States tied to California standards, but also likely increasing  the cost of all new vehicles nationwide and giving consumers fewer  choices. We are all about choices, Mr. Speaker.   Currently, auto manufacturers face significant losses with their EV  divisions and rely on the profits from their gas-powered vehicle sales  to maintain profitability.   If this California rule stands, auto manufacturers will likely be  forced to increase retail costs on all their vehicle options to remain  profitable.   Many of my constituents are on fixed incomes and cannot afford to  humor California's or the Biden administration's radical green  policies.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this particular bill.
