 Mr. President, I agree with my colleagues that we need  tax reform, but we need tax reform that simplifies the Tax Code,  bolsters the middle class, and helps small businesses to create jobs. I  think we can do that, and we can do that in a fiscally responsible way,  but we need to work together, Republicans and Democrats, as we did the  last time we did tax reform.   Unfortunately, these priorities are not reflected in the bill that is  before us. Instead, it is a partisan, fiscally irresponsible giveaway  to the wealthy and the largest corporations in this country, and it  comes at the expense of the middle class and small businesses.   We know that the wealthiest Americans will see massive tax breaks  from this bill, including President Trump himself. In fact, the New  York Times has estimated that President Trump and his family would save  more than $1 billion from this tax bill.   How does this legislation pay for these tax cuts? Well, it asks  today's middle class and future generations to foot the bill. The  nonpartisan analysis from the Joint Committee on Taxation has found  that the bill will raise taxes on millions of middle-class families  making less than $75,000 a year. The bill sunsets any middle-class tax  breaks in 2026, and at the same time it makes tax breaks for large  corporations permanent. It increases the national debt by $1.5  trillion.   I think the headline in the current Forbes Magazine says it all. It  says  [[Page S7399]]  ``The GOP Tax Bill Is The End Of All Economic Sanity In Washington.''  As more people look at this bill, they are beginning to see how it will  hurt middle-class families across the country.   Over the past few weeks, I have heard more and more concerns from  people throughout New Hampshire, and I just want to take a minute to  highlight some of these concerns. I met recently with the New Hampshire  Realtors and homebuilders. They are major advocates for home ownership  in New Hampshire. They told me that this bill is nothing short of an  attack on home ownership. In particular, they are concerned about the  impact of repealing the State and local tax deduction, which would be a  huge hit to middle-class families in New Hampshire. Right now, more  than 200,000 Granite State homeowners use the State and local tax  deductions so that they are not double-taxed. That is about one-third  of taxpayers in New Hampshire. It is particularly important to us where  property taxes account for 66 percent of all State and local taxes.  That is a higher share than any other State in the country.   Homeowners are also concerned about proposals to limit the mortgage  interest deduction, including on home equity lines of credit, where  homeowners in New Hampshire are going to get hurt more than others  because we have approximately 14 percent of homeowners who have a home  equity line of credit, compared to 3.8 percent nationally. The result  is, according to the Realtors and the homebuilders, that home values  will decline significantly.   According to the Association of Realtors, this bill will put downward  pressure on home values by as much as 18 percent in New Hampshire and  10 percent nationally. If we look at this chart for New Hampshire, we  can extrapolate this across the rest of the economy.   If we look at this tax bill, this is the impact on homeowners in New  Hampshire. Values are going to be reduced by about 18 percent. That is  equivalent to what we saw after the financial meltdown in 2008, where,  again, we had about that same reduction in property values--about 18  percent. That is a huge hit for us in New Hampshire and for people  across the country.   I thought the Realtors put it very well when they said: It is simply  unfair to ask homeowners, who pay 83 percent of all Federal income  taxes, to take a greater tax burden so that the biggest corporations in  this country can have steep tax cuts. It doesn't make sense.   I also heard significant concern from students, colleges, and  businesses that this bill will raise taxes on students trying to get  the skills they need to get ahead. That is really crazy because when we  do that, we don't create the workforce we need for the future. The  House bill, for example, would eliminate the ability of individuals to  deduct the interest on their student loans, and it would tax graduate  students on tuition assistance. I heard from a graduate student who,  right now, is making $20,000 a year on a stipend. That is what he is  trying to live on. If this bill goes into effect, he will pay $5,000 of  that in taxes. It doesn't make sense. We need to be encouraging our  students to get graduate and higher education degrees so that they can  take on the jobs of the future.   Again, in New Hampshire, it is a particular problem, where student  loan debt is higher than the national average. For the graduating class  of 2016, New Hampshire had the highest per capita student loan debt in  the country. The average debt for New Hampshire graduates was $36,367.  We know, nationally, student loan debt has roughly tripled since 2004  to a staggering $1.3 trillion. That is higher than the total credit  card debt. What this legislation is likely to do is to make that worse  for young people who are trying to get out of college, have their  student loans paid, get married, start families, buy a house. If they  continue to have this impact, they are not going to be able to do any  of those things.   The top challenge that faces New Hampshire businesses and so many  businesses across this country is finding skilled workers. The last  thing we should be doing is making education more expensive.   I also serve as the ranking member on the Senate Small Business  Committee. Small businesses employ more than half of our workforce.  They make up more than 99 percent of all employers. We need to work in  a bipartisan way to enact tax reform that supports our small  businesses. Again, this bill, unfortunately, doesn't provide meaningful  reform for small businesses and the problems they are facing with the  Tax Code. First of all, this bill doesn't address the top issue that we  have heard from small businesses--tax simplification and the cutting of  redtape in our Tax Code.   For entrepreneurs, time is one of their most valuable resources.  Every wasted hour spent filling out forms or navigating confusing tax  rules is an hour they can't spend innovating, marketing, and growing  their businesses. The tax system is so difficult to navigate that 89  percent of small businesses turn to outside tax preparers to fill out  their forms and file their returns. The compliance burden for small  businesses is 67 percent higher than it is for large businesses, and it  costs about $18 billion annually.   Tax reform should be an opportunity to help us help small businesses  focus on what they do best, and that is running their business.  Instead, this bill will result in even more redtape and complexity.   According to a former Joint Committee on Taxation economist, if this  bill becomes law:         Treasury will be writing regulations and Congress will be       enacting technical corrections for years. There are more       ticking time bombs in this bill than in a Roadrunner cartoon.    A recent poll of small business owners from Businesses for  Responsible Tax Reform found that a majority of them oppose the plan.  This is polling that has just been done in the last week or so; 61  percent oppose, and only 28 percent support.   Small businesses are even more concerned about the impact this tax  bill will have on our debt and deficit. In fact, 61 percent of small  business owners oppose raising the debt by $1.5 trillion to pay for tax  cuts.   Increasing the debt will inhibit our ability to address the real  challenges facing small businesses, such as educating a skilled  workforce, building out broadband in rural areas, and fixing our broken  infrastructure.   Then there is the repeal of the individual mandate, which is a part  of this tax proposal. According to CBO, repealing the individual  mandate, as this bill does, would cause 13 million Americans to become  uninsured by 2027. It would sharply raise premiums for those who  purchase insurance on the individual market.   Now, we have heard from our colleagues that they think that including  the Alexander-Murray legislation would help address that, but that is  not designed to address the underlying healthcare bill that we have in  this country. All that will do is address the uncertainty in the  marketplace.   Repealing the individual mandate is going to deny health insurance to  millions of Americans. It is going to cost middle-income families more,  and, ultimately, it is going to have an impact on people's abilities to  provide for their families and the long-term health of this Nation.  That is not the kind of investment we should be making in the future of  this country.   There are many more issues with this tax bill, but my time is  limited. If we look at who is opposed to this bill, there are so many  organizations: the Realtors, the homebuilders, the AARP, and the  Fraternal Order of Police. They have all come out in opposition, and  that is just to name a few.   I have heard from nearly 3,000 Granite Staters who have expressed  their opposition to the impact of this bill, and as more and more  people have a chance to read it, that number is going to continue to  grow.   You know I want to work with my colleagues here. I think Republicans  and Democrats should genuinely reform the Tax Code. It is long overdue.  But we need to do it in a way that is transparent, that looks at where  we want to go in the future and what we need to be investing in in this  country. We need to work in a bipartisan way that puts the middle class  and small businesses first and that doesn't leave a massive debt for  our children and grandchildren. If we pass this legislation, that is  exactly what we are going to be doing--leaving future generations to  deal with a massive debt without  [[Page S7400]]  the benefits of the investment that we should be making in this  country.   So it is a sad day for America.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.
