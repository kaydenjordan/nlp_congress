 Mr. Chair, I want to commend the managers of the House  Department of Defense Fiscal Year 2024 Appropriations bill for  including my amendment No. 122 in En Bloc 3, to provide a $5 million  increase within the Air Force RDT&E account, to the Air Force Research  Lab (AFRL) trusted microchip manufacturing prototype program in the en  bloc package.   Microelectronics support nearly all DoD activities, enabling  capabilities such as the global positioning system, radar, command and  control, and communication. Ensuring secure access to leading-edge  microelectronics, however, is a challenge. The pandemic exposed the  challenges associated with the global supply chain, the changing global  semiconductor industry, and the sophistication of U.S. adversaries. who  might target military electronic components.   The AFRL is working on a new modelling and simulation research  program to advance next generation semiconductor design and  manufacturing, called a secure digital twin. Funding for the zero-trust  environment for semiconductor technology will help provide the  capabilities to deliver solutions to protect against malicious function  insertion, fraudulent products, theft of intellectual property, and  reliability failures within DoD semiconductors.   I believe Congress should continue to provide the resources necessary  to update our domestic microelectronics security framework. I am proud  of the work being undertaken in  [[Page H4596]]  my district's semiconductor technology district, known as NeoCity, to  support domestic semiconductor manufacturing technology development as  we work to address this critical supply chain. I look forward to  continuing to work with my colleagues to support this goal.
