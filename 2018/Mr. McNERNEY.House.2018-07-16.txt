 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Northern  California Power Agency, which is celebrating 50 years of service this  year.   Back in 1968, a group of municipal electric utilities, including the  city of Lodi in my district, joined together to form the NCPA. The NCPA  continues to harness the power of clean energy today.   For 50 years, NCPA has utilized new technologies to provide clean,  renewable energy for its consumer-owners. This includes the Lodi Energy  Center, a fast-start, combined-cycle natural gas project.   The NCPA's commitments to innovation and clean power have made  significant contributions to their California member communities,  resulting in low electric rates and CO2-free generation.   I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the NCPA and its  members on 50 years of service, achievement, and success.                            ____________________
