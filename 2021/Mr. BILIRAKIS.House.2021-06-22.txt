 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3723, the Consumer  Safety Technology Act.   I thank Representatives Burgess, McNerney, Guthrie, Soto, and  Davidson for their leadership on this effort and, of course, our  chairman and our ranking member, and our ranking member on the  subcommittee, as well as the chairman of the subcommittee.   Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan bill directs the Consumer Product Safety  Commission to conduct a pilot program to determine how artificial  intelligence may be used to advance the agency's product safety  mission.   Given the agency's broad jurisdiction over so many consumer products,  efficiently and accurately analyzing data in the marketplace is  critical to its effective operation.   This bill also includes an important study of how blockchain  technology may be used to prevent fraud, increase privacy, and bolster  our Nation's supply chain. This is complementary to the American  COMPETE Act that also prioritizes this emerging technology to ensure  America leads in the technology and in its development.   Furthermore, H.R. 3723 also focuses on digital tokens, which are  seeing increased adoption by consumers. The bill targets ways in which  we can protect consumers from fraud in the digital token marketplace, a  dangerous trend that has recently become more apparent.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their important work on this  particular piece of legislation, and I urge all my colleagues to  support this bill.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), an important member of the Energy and Commerce  full committee and also the subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers.   Mr. Speaker, this is a very important bill. We have to get it past  the finish line this time. I urge all of my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3182, the Safe Sleep for  Babies Act. I thank Mr. Cardenas and, of course, Chair Schakowsky for  their hard work on this bill.   H.R. 3182 addresses the risk of dangers that infants face from  inclined sleepers and crib bumpers. This bill bans all products with an  inclined sleep surface greater than 10 degrees to address the tragic  deaths related to inclined sleepers and any crib bumpers intended to  cover the sides of a crib or that prevent access to openings on the  sides of the crib.   I am always ready to work with my colleagues on the Energy and  Commerce Committee to help protect Americans from potentially harmful  products. That is the reason I requested this subcommittee.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this particular measure,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this very important bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill directs the Consumer Products Safety  Commission to issue a consumer product safety standard for clothing  storage units to protect children from tip-over related injuries, as  the chairman stated.   The CPSC has recognized this as one of the top five potential hidden  hazards in the home, with an average of one child fatality every 2  weeks from falling furniture and appliances. It is good to restate it  because people need to know.   We support this bill moving forward with House passage today. I thank  the chairwoman of the subcommittee, my colleague, Ms. Schakowsky, for  championing this bill; along with Mr. Cardenas and all of the members  of the Energy and Commerce Committee for their efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1314, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Schakowsky for  championing this very important bill. The best ideas come from the  people, from our constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill swiftly, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3841, the Tribal Health  Data Improvement Act of 2021, introduced by my Energy and Commerce  colleagues, Representatives Mullin and O'Halleran.   This important public health bill addresses the chronic challenges  faced by Tribal Nations and Tribal Epidemiology Centers in gaining  access to critical healthcare and public health surveillance data.   Obtaining this data is necessary for engaging in preventative public  health work and combating the current health crises in American Indian  and Alaska Native communities.   Structural barriers to accessing data have been especially  problematic during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately  impacted these communities. In order to ensure that Tribal Nations and  Tribal Epidemiology Centers have access to the data necessary to  accomplish public health priorities, the bill requires that the  Secretary of HHS create a data-sharing strategy that takes into  consideration the recommendations of the Secretary's Tribal Advisory  Committee.   In addition, in reauthorizing the CDC's National Center for Health  Statistics, the bill requires the Secretary to make public health  surveillance data available to the Indian Health Service, Indian  Tribes, the Tribal organizations, and Tribal Epidemiology Centers so  long as the data requested for use is consistent with Federal law and  obligations.   The Secretary must also consult with Indian Tribes, Tribal  organizations, urban Indian organizations, and the Tribal Technical  Advisory Group of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to  develop guidelines for State and local health agencies to improve the  quality and accuracy of birth and death records of American Indians and  Alaska Natives.   It makes a lot of sense. By improving the sharing of data between the  Federal Government and the Tribes, this  [[Page H2952]]  important bill would help address the health disparities in American  Indian and Alaska Native communities.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this particular bill. Let's pass this bill  swiftly and get it to the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
