 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4499, the NIMHD Research  Endowment Revitalization Act of 2020.   This is an extremely important piece of legislation, and I intend to  support it.   I also intend to ask the House today to support my legislation, which  is H.R. 4806, the Debarment Enforcement of Bad Actor Registrants Act of  2019, or the DEBAR Act.   Substance abuse continues to wreak havoc in our communities and is  responsible for claiming nearly 700,000 lives since 1999. In the first  quarter of this year alone, overdose death rates increased 11.4 percent  compared to the same time last year.   As we work to put an end to the coronavirus pandemic, addressing the  ongoing opioid epidemic is increasingly critical.                                time  1215    I introduced the DEBAR Act because it takes significant steps to  reduce the circulation of illegal substances in our country.   This bill provides the Drug Enforcement Agency debarment authority to  permanently prohibit a person or entity who has violated the Controlled  Substances Act from being able to receive a registration to  manufacture, distribute, or dispense a controlled substance.   We cannot stop our efforts to end the opioid and substance abuse  crisis, and I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 4806 and H.R.  4499.   I also want to thank the chairman for his work on both of these  pieces of legislation, and the ranking member, and I encourage my  colleagues to support both pieces of legislation.
