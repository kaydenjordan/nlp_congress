 Mr. President, today, I rise as our country faces a  monumental choice. It is a choice about who we want to be as Americans  and the future we want to build as Americans. All across our country  this year, we have seen Americans standing up and speaking out for  greater equality and greater justice. Our choice is this: Does the  highest Court in the land stand with the people of America as we strive  to build a more perfect Union, or does the Court side with the most  powerful interests and most extreme views that will take our country  backward in our quest for justice and equality?   Judge Amy Coney Barrett does not stand on the side of the American  people. She does not represent mainstream values--certainly, mainstream  values that we cherish in Michigan.   Right now, we are in the middle of a pandemic. Over 225,000 Americans  have already died, and we are nowhere near getting it under control-- nowhere.   Instead of providing help to families, communities, and businesses  that are suffering, Republicans are rushing through. Here we are on a  Sunday, not talking about how we help people, help our small  businesses, help our communities, do what needs to be done to get this  pandemic under control. No, we are seeing a rush to get a Supreme Court  nominee on the Court that will have disastrous consequences for our  Nation, both for today and for decades to come.   On behalf of the majority of the people of Michigan, I am strongly  opposing this nomination, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Perhaps, nothing is more at risk right now than healthcare--the  healthcare that Americans depend on. Exactly one week after election  day, the Supreme Court, as we know, will hear arguments in the case  that could very well overturn the Affordable Care Act in the middle of  a pandemic--in the middle of a deadly pandemic.   Republicans in Congress have tried to repeal the healthcare law for  10 years now--10 years. And each time, people across our country,  people across Michigan, have spoken out. They have demanded that  Republicans protect their healthcare. Healthcare is not political in  the eyes of Americans. It is personal. They want us to strengthen and  improve healthcare, not rip it away from them. But, unfortunately,  Republicans have voted more than 100 times in those 10 years--more than  100 different times--to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and more than  100 times they have failed.   So now President Trump has turned the job over to the courts. He  expects Judge Barrett to, in his words, terminate the healthcare law.  That is the word of the person who nominated Judge Barrett. He wouldn't  have nominated her to the Supreme Court if he didn't trust that she  would do just that.   Judge Barrett has already called the Court's previous decision to  uphold the ACA ``illegitimate.'' She publicly criticized Chief Justice  Roberts for upholding the law. She said that if the Supreme Court reads  the statute like she does, they have no choice but to, in her words,  invalidate it.   This is not a mystery here about how she is going to vote. It is  very, very clear. That would be a disaster for Michigan families, a  disaster for people all across our country. Protections for the over  130 million Americans with preexisting conditions--gone. That number is  going up every day because of COVID-19.   Bans on yearly and lifetime caps on cancer treatments and other  critical care--gone. Healthy Michigan, which has helped more than  880,000 Michigan residents get healthcare--gone. The ability for young  adults up to age 26 to be covered by their family's health insurance-- gone.   You can also say goodbye to guaranteed maternity care so you are  going to pay extra if you want to have children and have maternity  care, free preventive health screenings, and birth control without  copays.   Seniors would see their drug prices go up. The ACA closed the  Medicare prescription drug--what we call the doughnut hole, the gap in  coverage, and saved the average Michigan senior more than $1,300 just  in 6 years between 2010 and 2016--$1,300.   Seniors would have additional reason to worry. During her  confirmation hearing, Judge Barrett refused to say whether she believes  Medicare and Social Security are even constitutional.   As is often the case, American women would have the most to lose if  [[Page S6464]]  the ACA is overturned. Remember when simply being a woman was  considered a preexisting condition by insurance companies, and we had  to pay more? I do. Yet the threat of Justice Barrett goes far beyond  insurance rates. The fundamental right for women to make basic choices  about our own healthcare, our own health, our own lives would be at  risk.   Since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973, women in our country have had  the right to make our own decisions about reproductive choices that are  best for our own health and our own family. It is among the rights that  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg spent her career defending, and it is not a  right that Judge Barrett respects. She has long aligned herself with  organizations devoted to eliminating a woman's right to choose. She  signed her name to a letter calling for Roe v. Wade to be overturned.   During her nomination hearing, she refused to say whether Roe v. Wade  is Federal law. At its most basic, Roe v. Wade is about undue  government interference. Think about that--undue government  interference, which we hear a lot about from our friends on the other  side of the aisle. That is something that Republicans deeply oppose, at  least when it is corporations that need defending from undue government  interference.   Reproductive rights are only one freedom, as critical as they are, as  that is, that are on the line right now. Over the past decade, we have  made major progress in ensuring that our LGBTQ+ friends and neighbors  aren't discriminated against simply for being themselves. Yet Judge  Barrett has openly opposed this progress, including speaking out  against the decision that made marriage equality the law of the land.  She has even given numerous speeches on behalf of the Alliance  Defending Freedom, a rightwing organization that thinks being gay  should be a crime.   Workers, too, could see their rights evaporate under a Justice  Barrett. Barrett would be just one more conservative Justice who will  issue rulings that hurt the ability of workers to fight workplace  mistreatment and discrimination, and to organize and collectively  bargain for wages, benefits, and workplace protections. That is what  she did in her decision Wallace v. Grubhub Holdings in which she ruled  against workers who were denied overtime wages--against workers who  were denied overtime wages that are protected by the Fair Labor  Standards Act.   If a Justice Barrett sides with the powerful against people, I think  we all know what that means for the future of our world.   During her confirmation hearing, Judge Barrett refused to say whether  or not she believes that climate change exists, saying she is not a  scientist. You don't need to be a scientist. Just ask people in  Michigan about what is happening in our State. The climate crisis is  already affecting Michigan agriculture, our environment, our public  health, our Great Lakes.   A number of crucial cases dealing with the environment are likely to  end up at the Supreme Court in the next number of years, and the  Court's decisions will have consequences that outlive any of us.  Critically important to all American citizens is what Justice Barrett  would mean for voting rights and the results of the 2020 election. Let  me remind everyone that election day isn't November 3, it is every day  up to November 3. People are voting right now. If you have not voted, I  hope you do and that you do it safely and do it early, but voting ends  on November 3. People are voting as we speak and whether or not those  votes are counted could very well depend on the U.S. Supreme Court.   Judge Barrett refused to say whether she believes voter  discrimination exists. Voter discrimination. Given that 23 States have  passed restrictive voting laws since the Supreme Court's Shelby County  v. Holder decision, it is pretty clear that voter discrimination  exists.   Judge Barrett has also refused to recuse herself from rulings on  cases related to the outcome of the 2020 election, even though  President Trump is rushing to make sure that she is there. That is a  clear conflict of interest if I ever heard one. There is no right more  fundamental than the right to vote--no right more fundamental than the  right to vote. Perhaps nobody knew that better than our beloved  colleague, the late Congressman John Lewis. He once said this:         My dear friends, your vote is precious, almost sacred. It       is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have to create a more       perfect union.    A more perfect union; that is what we want, isn't it? That is what we  are working toward every day, I hope. That is what Americans have been  marching for and speaking out for and bleeding for and dying for as  long as we have been a nation.   We face a crucial choice. I am choosing to stand with the vast  majority of the American people on the side of justice and equality. I  urge a ``no'' vote on Judge Barrett. The American people deserve much,  much better   Mr. President, there is one other thing that I need to do before  yielding the floor. I would yield my remaining postcloture time to the  Democratic leader.   I yield the floor.
