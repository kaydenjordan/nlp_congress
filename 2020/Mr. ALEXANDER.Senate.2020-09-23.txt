 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I come to the floor to talk about  COVID in two ways. The Senator from Tennessee, who is presiding today,  will appreciate this. She and I have a regular call with Governor Lee,  our Governor, and we just finished part of it. Her staff was on part of  that.   He gave some very interesting information that I think would be  important to all Senators and to our country, and that is the  significant learning loss that occurs when children aren't in school.  In Tennessee, Governor Lee and some national researchers have completed  a study of the learning loss in the third grade for reading and math  proficiency for children who were not in school from March through the  summer.   Now, you always have a learning loss in the summer, but for March  through summer, this is what they found. Preliminary data shows an  estimated 50-percent decrease in proficiency rates in third grade  reading and a projected 65-percent decrease in proficiency in math.  That, in the Governor's words, is a dramatic decrease. It shows that  the vast majority of students learn in person, the Governor said, with  their teacher, and he is working to get a safe environment so that they  can get back to school.   The good news on that is, according to the Governor, 1,800 schools in  Tennessee are open, in person, and only 7 of those schools have any  sort of closure incident today--in other words, one class or one school  closed because of COVID. So, this problem we are just discussing,  hopefully, will not be as pronounced this semester in Tennessee  because, except in Memphis and except in Nashville, almost all of our  schools are open in person to some degree.   The Governor went on to say that the March through the summer school  closings produced a learning deficiency that is expected to be 2.5  times that of a normal summer rate. He also said the learning loss  impacts early grades greater than later grades, placing those students  further behind in the learning trajectory. Students with lower  proficiency rates are also disproportionately impacted by learning  loss. In other words, students who are already behind fell behind even  further as a result of leaving school in March.   Then it shows that the research from the Organisation for Economic  Co-operation and Development, which worked with the Governor on these,  shows that each additional year of schooling increases life income by  an average of 7.5 to 10 percent. And with the loss of one-third of a  year in effective learning--which is what we just heard about for just  the students affected by the closures--that organization estimates it  would lower a country's gross domestic product by an average of 1.5  percent for the remainder of the century.   I don't know whether those numbers are exactly accurate, but the  message is clear. Children, especially young children and especially  young children who are further behind already, need to be in school so  that they can be taught in person or their learning loss is dramatic.   I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record the press release  that Governor Lee of Tennessee released detailing this dramatic  learning loss   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   Tennessee Releases Data Showing Significant Learning Loss Among K-12                                  Students    Projected Losses Tied to Prolonged School Closures and Time Away From                                 Classroom         Nashville, TN--Tennessee Governor Bill Lee and the       Tennessee Department of Education today released estimated       data regarding learning loss for Tennessee students resulting       from COVID-19 school closures through the summer months.       Preliminary data projects an estimated 50% decrease in       proficiency rates in 3rd grade reading and a projected 65%       decrease in proficiency in math.        ``This data highlights the immense challenges that the       COVID-19 pandemic has created for our students and       educators,'' said Gov. Lee. ``The vast majority of students       learn best in-person with their teacher, and we'll continue       to help provide a safe environment for Tennessee students to       get their educational journeys back on track.''        While many students traditionally experience learning loss       over the summer, projections show that learning loss from       March school closures through the summer is expected to be       2.5 times that of a normal summer rate. Projections were       developed in partnership with national researchers using       historical, Tennessee-specific data to provide additional       learning loss estimates based on the extended school       closures.        ``We know that increased time away from school has negative       implications for students, which is compounded during       extended building closures,'' said Tennessee Commissioner of       Education Penny Schwinn. ``The department is focused on       ensuring we provide essential services and resources to       mitigate learning loss and keep students on a path to success       this new school year.''        The learning loss impacts early grades greater than later       grades, placing these students further behind in the learning       trajectory as they progress through school. Students with       lower proficiency rates are also disproportionately impacted       by learning loss, further exacerbating existing achievement       gaps.        Research from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation       and Development on the economics of education shows that each       additional year of schooling increases life income by an       average of 7.5-10%. Further, a loss of one-third of a year in       effective learning for just the students affected by the       closures of early 2020 will, by historical data, lower a       country's GDP by an average of 1.5% over the remainder of the       century.     Today, our committee--the Health, Education, Labor,  and Pensions Committee--had its last  [[Page S5824]]  hearing of the year, and it was my last hearing as chairman of the  committee. While we are on the theme of education, one of the  interesting--and I am here today to give a little report on what I  consider to be an unprecedented sprint toward success in three areas:  vaccines, treatments, and diagnostic testing.   I asked Dr. Fauci, who was one of the witnesses, this question: Dr.  Fauci, there are a lot of outbreaks on college campuses around the  country as millions of students go back to thousands of colleges. Is  the right thing to do to send the students home?   He said: Absolutely not. That is the wrong thing to do. Segregate the  students from the other students in the college until they are well-- and the people they have exposed until they are well--and then go on.  Don't send them home to infect their parents and their grandparents and  the community from which they came.   I think that is important advice for the college administrators all  over America who are dealing with this issue very bravely. I know at  the University of Tennessee they had a big outbreak. It was some poor  judgment on behalf of a number of students who had just gone back to  school. You can just imagine 18-, 19-, and 20-year-olds, they all want  to get together. Well, they got together, and they infected one  another, and they had a big outbreak--maybe 750, the Governor said, but  it is now down to 150.   So Dr. Fauci's advice to the school administrators is this: Isolate  them, segregate them, track them, and don't send them home.   The hearing today included Dr. Fauci and Dr. Redfield from the  Centers for Disease Control. It included Admiral Giroir, who is in  charge of testing, and it included Dr. Hahn, who is the head of the  Food and Drug Administration.   Here was the first question I asked Dr. Hahn, who is the only person  who knows when the vaccines that are being developed will be  distributed. He doesn't really know because he doesn't know the date,  nor do any of the career scientists at the FDA know the date when the  data will show that the vaccine is safe and effective, and it will not  be distributed until it is.   So I said to Dr. Hahn: Who makes the decisions at FDA? Do you make  the decisions? Do the career scientists make the decisions? Or does the  White House make the decisions about safety and effectiveness of a  vaccine?   He said: The career scientists make the decisions. The White House  does not, and I will not make a decision about the safety and  effectiveness of vaccines unless the career scientists and I agree that  it is safe and effective according to independent and transparent data.   I asked Dr. Fauci this question. I said: Dr. Fauci, you have been  around a while. You came on in the Reagan days. You have been in your  job as head of infectious diseases since 1984. Here is my question: Is  this administration cutting corners on safety and efficiency?   Dr. Fauci said: Absolutely not.   I asked all four of the witnesses: If the vaccine is approved by the  FDA, would you take it, and would you recommend your family take it?   They said yes, that they had great confidence in the FDA.   Here is a summary of what they told us today. Let's start with  vaccines:   According to the administration, it is already manufacturing tens of  millions of doses of six vaccines, and by the end of the year, there  will be tens of millions of doses of these vaccines already  manufactured, ready to distribute--first, of course, to the priority  individuals, those who are most vulnerable, healthcare workers, and  others.   Then, according to the administration, they expect to be able to  produce 300 to 700 million doses of vaccines by March or April of next  year. That is unprecedented.   When I was a kid, we were terrified by polio. I had classmates who  were in an iron lung and parents who were worried their children might  be just as well. It took 10 years to get a polio vaccine, and polio is  now eradicated.   For most of the vaccines that our children take before they go to  school--like mumps, measles, and chickenpox--you have to take these  vaccines in all 50 States and the District of Columbia before you go to  school. Most of them took 10 years to develop.   If the optimism of the administration--they call it Operation Warp  Speed--is accurate, vaccines will have been manufactured, and they are  optimistic that at least one of them will be approved before the end of  the year. They know they will be manufactured because they are already  doing that.   They don't know for sure, and they say: There is no guarantee of  success, but we are optimistic that we will reach a goal that once was  considered impossible and now seems likely.   In other words, instead of waiting 10 years for a vaccine to save  lives, this vaccine for COVID-19 will be developed in less than a year  if it is approved before the end of the year.   That is an unprecedented success story, and it is only possible for a  variety of reasons, which I will go into in a minute.   The same is true with treatments. There are five treatments-- medicines--for those who have contracted COVID-19. That is especially  interesting to teachers and faculty members at schools and colleges.  The children don't seem to get as sick, but the older teachers could,  and they do get sicker. So it helps to know that there is a treatment  for COVID if you get sick.   What we are told by Dr. Fauci, Dr. Redfield, Dr. Hahn, and others is  that they are cautiously optimistic that new treatments will be  available in the next few weeks--specifically, the monoclonal  antibodies, the antibody cocktails that were developed and used during  the Ebola crisis to help prevent and cure it.   If these work--and, again, they only can be approved based on data  from the FDA. They are not approved yet. They are in clinical trials,  but late clinical trials. If they are approved in the next few weeks,  then, if you come down with COVID, you will have an antibody cocktail  that, in the case of the Ebola, proved to prevent and help cure it.   Knowing that these vaccines are being manufactured and are likely to  be approved by the end of the year and that treatments will be broadly  available by the end of the year, in addition to the five that now  exist, should help give Americans more confidence in going back to  school, back to college, back to childcare, back to work, and out to  eat.   Then, there is a third success story, and that is diagnostic testing.  The United States got off to a bumpy start with diagnostic testing. The  first CDC test flopped, and we lost some time. But since then there has  been an explosion of diagnostic testing.   Today, we have a capacity to deal with 90 million tests a month.  Abbott Laboratories has announced that in October, it will produce 50  million rapid tests. You can get a result in 15 minutes with a higher  degree of specificity--that means accuracy--and it costs $5. The  administration has bought 150 million--the whole output--for the first  3 months of Abbott Laboratories' fast tests and is in the process of  distributing them to nursing homes, schools, colleges, childcare  centers, and States.   I was able to say to the Governor that if Tennessee gets its rough  share of 2 percent of 150 million tests, that is a lot of tests for the  State of Tennessee to be receiving over the next few weeks.   Again, the importance of that is, between now and the time a vaccine  is administered and treatments are widely available, the surest path  back to school, back to work, and out to eat is an oversupply of  diagnostic testing so you could have it whenever you want.   Just as Governor Lee was saying, we have 1,800 schools open in  person, Nashville and Memphis worrying about whether they should open.  I think if the teachers knew they had more treatments and if they could  test whenever a class needs to test--a whole class--and do surveillance  testing, that people would be safer and feel better about going back to  school.   The same would be true with the colleges and universities. If there  is a breakout of 750 cases at the University of Tennessee and you can  quickly do random surveillance testing of an entire dorm or a dorm  floor or a class of students, then you can feel better about keeping  the place safe.   The hearing was a good hearing. During the hearing, I thanked Senator  Murray, my partner over the last 6 years, the ranking Democrat. She is  a  [[Page S5825]]  member of the Democratic leadership. She is pretty tough when she wants  to be. Because she is, I like working with her, and we have been able  to do a lot with our committee.   We have 23 members on our committee. I thanked them today. I said,  Senator Ted Kennedy used to say that we have the broadest jurisdiction  of any committee in the Senate. I think we have the broadest range of  views in the Senate of any committee. We have some very able advocates  of those diverse points of view, and still, we have a very impressive  record from fixing No Child Left Behind to 21st Century Cures, to the  opioids bill, to passing important bipartisan legislation that is good  for the country   President Obama called the Every Student Succeeds Act a Christmas  miracle. Senator McConnell said the 21st Century Cures Act was the most  important law of that Congress.   I thanked Senator Murray and all the Democrats and Republicans on the  committee for creating an environment where we can have our differences  of opinion but still get important results.   There was one other thing we discussed that I would like to mention.  I see my friend from Connecticut on the floor. I know he wants to  speak, and I will get out of the way so he can do it. But there were  actually two things I wanted to briefly summarize, and then I will ask  to put my statement into the Record.   One was that the New York Times said on March 1, that the United  States was as well prepared as any country for COVID. To the extent  that was true, it was because of several Presidents and several  Congresses doing such things as, in 2012, authorizing three standby  manufacturing plants for vaccines. Of Operation Warp Speed, Dr. Slaoui,  who is their principle adviser, said that they could not be producing  four of those vaccines if those plants had not been put in place back  then.   In addition, earlier Congresses created more authority for the FDA,  for example, to do emergency-use authorizations, which Dr. Hahn has  used expertly. They have given the NIH record funding for 5 years in a  row and new authority. All of this authority has been put to work by  this administration to do what I would call an unprecedented sprint  toward success on vaccines, treatments, and tests without cutting  corners on efficacy and safety. There is a risk, but the risk is to the  taxpayers.   The reason things are going so fast is because they are doing  everything in parallel. They are manufacturing while they are  developing the vaccine and while they are reviewing whether it is safe  and effective.   Then, at the end of that process--say, at the end of this year--if it  is effective, we are ready to distribute it. The States have been asked  to get ready. If it is not safe, if it is not effective, then, we lose  the money. The taxpayers lose the money.   I think most of us would be glad to lose that money if the result was  that one or more of those vaccines turned out to be the one that  produces 300 to 700 million doses of vaccines that are safe and  effective as we move into the new year.   There is a lesson from all of this, and that is that the earlier  Congresses and Presidents were visionary in this respect: They built  those standby manufacturing plants. They created BARDA. Senator Burr  from North Carolina was one of the leaders of that, for example.  Without that, we wouldn't have this explosion of vaccines, treatments,  and tests on the way. We need to do that again.   Senator Bill Frist, the former majority leader, testified before our  committee with some others. He said we go from panic to neglect to  panic, and we don't do the hard things we need to do after the epidemic  is over.   The hardest thing to do is sustained funding. So we need sustained  funding for manufacturing plants so they don't go cold while we wait  for the next pandemic. We need sustained funding for our stockpile so  they are not depleted by budget problems. We need sustained funding for  the strategic stockpile, and we need sustained funding for our State  and local public health agencies, which are about 50 percent supported  by Federal dollars.   Sustained funding is something we don't do very well--that means  mandatory funding that needs advanced appropriations. We like to do it  year by year. But if we don't do it, you can see what it costs us:  200,000 lives we lost already and $3 trillion we have already spent. So  a little sustained funding to prevent the next pandemic would be a very  wise investment, and we ought to do it now while we have our eye on the  ball.   Jared Diamond, who wrote ``Guns, Germs, and Steel,'' pointed out in a  recent article in the Wall Street Journal that, in his opinion, what is  different about this vaccine is the jet plane--that people can fly from  Wuhan to San Francisco or from San Francisco to Nashville, and pretty  soon, suddenly, this is spreading all over the world. Jared Diamond  said that the next pandemic could be next year. We hope it is not, but  it could be, and we should be ready for it.   So I wanted to report to the American people and to my colleagues in  the Senate that we hear a lot about problems, but I think it is  important to know that vaccines are being manufactured, that the  decisions are going to be made by scientists about when they are ready  to distribute, that the States have been asked to get ready, that there  are more treatments coming, likely, and that there has been an  explosion of diagnostic tests. So, really, there should be plenty of  diagnostic tests for anyone who wants to use them before very long in  the United States. My theory has been for a long time that as soon as  we had an oversupply, we wouldn't have a problem or an issue.   I thanked those four witnesses, Senator Murray, and my Republican and  Democratic colleagues for monitoring this COVID-19. I am glad the  hearing was broadly carried for 2 hours on many television networks.   I hope it gave the American people some relief and sense that our  chances of going back to school, back to college, back to childcare,  back to work, and out to eat are increasingly good. It is very simple:  Wear the mask, wash your hands, stay apart, and keep this unprecedented  sprint toward vaccines, treatments, and diagnostic tests going.   I yield the floor.
