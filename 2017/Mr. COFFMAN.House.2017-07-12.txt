 Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2810,  the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.   The bill contains significant policy and funding initiatives that  continue our commitment to maintain military personnel and family  readiness and address issues important to our troops. The provisions  contained in this bill provide our warfighters, retirees, and their  families the necessary pay and benefits to sustain them into today's  highly stressed force.   To support these efforts, this bill establishes a fully funded by-law  pay raise for all of our servicemembers overriding the President's  ability to reduce the pay raise. After years of lower than by-law pay  raise requests, it is critical that we continue to give our troops and  their families the pay increases they deserve.                                time  2000    The bill increases the end-strengths of our Active Duty, National  Guard, and Reserve forces, increasing mission readiness while reducing  the stress and strain on the force and their families.   The bill further focuses last year's management reform of the  Military Health System to provide clear responsibility for the delivery  of healthcare services at military medical treatment facilities and for  military medical readiness.   The bill also stops an ill-considered, cost-saving measure that would  close several U.S. military hospitals overseas. We believe our  servicemembers and their families should continue to have the best  medical care possible wherever they serve.   It also continues to improve sexual assault prevention and response  by adding a new provision to the Uniform Code of Military Justice  specifically prohibiting nonconsensual sharing of intimate images,  expanding Special Victims' Counsel training to include training on the  unique challenges often  [[Page H5539]]  faced by male victims, and clarifying the process by which a designated  representative can be appointed by a victim prior to a court-martial.    Finally, servicemembers returning to civilian life and  their spouses are challenged by varying State licensure and  certification requirements. Rather than imposing a single Federal  standard on the States, we provide for a $500 reimbursement to defray  these costs. We ask States to work with the Secretary of Defense to  develop common standards where possible.   In conclusion, I want to thank Ms. Speier and her staff for their  contributions to the mark and support in this process. Of course, we  were joined by an active, informed, and dedicated group of subcommittee  members. Their recommendations and priorities are clearly reflected in  the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.  Additionally, I appreciate the dedication and hard work of the  subcommittee staff.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.
