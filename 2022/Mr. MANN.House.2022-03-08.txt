 Madam Speaker, in preparation for reauthorizing the farm  bill in 2023, I rise today to deliver the next installment of my farm  bill impact series, where I am highlighting various aspects of the farm  bill that deserve Congress' awareness and support.   If America is going to thrive, then the people who feed, fuel, and  clothe America must thrive, and the farm bill contains certain programs  that have been critical to the success of agricultural producers in my  district and the energy independence of our country.   Every committee in this Congress should work to develop a sound, 21st  century energy policy, one that embraces American energy independence,  one that employs an all-of-the-above strategy embracing both fossil  fuels and biofuels, and one that is not a mandated approach from the  government.   For example, the House Energy and Commerce Committee should continue  to pressure the Biden administration to reapprove the Keystone XL  pipeline while it also considers the Year-Round Fuel Choice Act, and  the House Agriculture Committee should weigh in on the enforcement of  the renewable fuel standard while it also includes strong biofuels  language in the next farm bill.   Energy policy has an impact on every American and cannot be crafted  in a vacuum. When it comes to the farm bill, we know that we can  strengthen our access to reliable, affordable, and efficient energy,  like biofuels.   The Rural Energy For America Program provides financial assistance to  promote energy independence and efficiency and renewable energy  development for agricultural producers and rural small businesses.   Kansas Ethanol LLC, based in Lyons, Kansas, has utilized the REAP  program twice. The first time they used it, they were able to expand  their facility and went from producing 65 million gallons of ethanol to  80 million gallons of ethanol per year. The second time, the program  helped them put in the infrastructure to produce their own electricity.  They now produce their own heat and power through a gas turbine for  their facility and export some power to the grid.   As Kansas produces nearly 500 million gallons of ethanol each year,  programs like the Biodiesel Fuel Education Program and the Biomass Crop  Assistance Program are important for Kansas and for the rest of this  country. The Biodiesel Fuel Education Program awards competitive grants  to nonprofit organizations and institutes of higher education that  educate the public, as well as government and private entities, about  the benefits of biodiesel fuel use.                                time  1030    The Biomass Crop Assistance Program supports the establishment and  production of eligible crops for conversion to bioenergy and assists  agricultural landowners and operators with the collection, harvest,  storage, and transportation of eligible material for use in a biomass  conversion facility.   These programs, and many more, are investments in the future of our  country, and they must remain strong in the 2023 farm bill if America  is going to be energy independent. That is why the farm bill is so  important. It is not just about food and farming. It is about ensuring  the security and self-determination of our country. We must support not  only the efforts of farmers, ranchers, and agriculture producers who  aim to keep us food-secure, but also the efforts of the renewable  energy pioneers in our country, like Kansas corn growers and Kansas  sorghum growers who aim to keep us energy independent.   I will be back on the floor soon to deliver another installment of my  farm bill impact series and highlight more programs and titles within  the bill that I believe Congress must understand and support to ensure  that agriculture thrives in America.                            ____________________
