 Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Supreme  Court issued a hold to keep the Title 42 border control policy alive.  This follows litigation by 19 States, along with a warning by the  Border Patrol officials, of a doubling of illegal aliens crossing the  border.   Implemented in 2020 by President Donald Trump, and was set to expire  today, the pandemic-era program is a critical tool used to quickly  expel illegal aliens. Since Biden took office, over 4 million illegal  aliens have been caught crossing the border, including 230,000 in  October.   The Biden administration is intentionally promoting the deadly drugs  by cartels, the child human trafficking into our country, and  terrorists crossing over into American society putting every family at  risk of mass murder.   The newly elected House Republican majority will work to secure the  border to protect families.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.   Welcome President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine to Washington.  During my visit to Kiev last week, I saw firsthand the resolve of  Ukraine. Ukraine will achieve victory.                            ____________________
