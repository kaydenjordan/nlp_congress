 Mr. President, I begin this morning with some welcome  news. After meeting with a group of  9/11 first responders last night, Leader McConnell gave them his  commitment to move legislation to reauthorize the Victim Compensation  Fund before the August recess. That is an important commitment.   I thank the leader. We have been struggling for years to get not a  quarter, not half but the full Victim Compensation Fund, as well as, of  course, the healthcare for those who bravely rushed to the towers right  after 9/11 and the awful attack.   Even more importantly than thanking the leader, I want to thank the  first responders who came down here to continue their advocacy. I have  little doubt that without them, this wouldn't have happened. Many of  them are sick. Some of them are dying.   This week, I spoke to New York police detective Luis Alvarez, who is  now in hospice and dying of cancer. He would normally have been right  next to John Feal and the other advocates meeting with Leader McConnell  because his illness never stopped him from advocating for his  compatriots. Instead of him being there, John Feal gave Leader  McConnell his badge. It is  [[Page S4528]]  not easy for a police officer to part with their badge, but Alvarez, in  his usual selfless and magnanimous way, knew how important it would be  for McConnell to see it.   I remember my dear friend Ray Pfeifer. Before he passed away, he was  the same way. He kept coming down, in pain, suffering, and knowing that  his cancer, caused by 9/11 and the toxins in the air, was incurable,  but Ray knew that if he kept coming down, it would help others who had  not yet gotten those cancers but who were sure to get them because  they, too, had rushed to the towers. His effort was about making sure  that friends and families were cared for. That is what Alvarez stands  for; that is what Pfeifer stood for; and that is what all the first  responders stand for, particularly those who come down, and there are  many of them.   That is the very definition of ``selflessness,'' the same  selflessness that compelled these men and women to rush to the towers  without a thought for their own safety, to ensure the safety of others.   Now that Leader McConnell has committed to address this issue before  August, we are making real progress. We have gotten to the 5-yard line,  but we are not over the goal line yet when it comes to the Victim  Compensation Fund. There are still a few ways this Senate could fumble  the ball. I will be there to make sure they will not.   As the leader well knows, there is a House and Senate version of the  9/11 bill. The House has already passed its version through the  committee. The full House should pass it in early July. The best way to  get this done without fuss or muss, without somebody fumbling the ball,  as we are on the 5-yard line, would be to have the Senate vote on the  House bill. I hope that is what the leader will decide to do.   I would also say to the leader, respectfully, that he need not wait  for a must-pass vehicle. Based on the number of cosponsors on the  Senate bill, we have 60 votes. I want to thank my colleague from New  York, Senator Gillibrand, for working so hard to round up votes. We  have the votes to move this bill separately on the floor and alone. It  would take very little of the Senate's time to take up and pass the  bill whenever the leader decides to do so. On an issue as important as  this, we should consider the legislation as stand-alone rather than  tucked inside a must-pass bill because we know must-pass bills often  don't pass these days.   Again, I appreciate the leader's commitment. It means a great deal to  the 9/11 first responders.   I spoke to John Feal this morning. He is very optimistic now but also  told me: Make sure we get this done. We are not there yet. Feal and I  agree. We are at the 5-yard line. We have come a long way, 95 yards  down the field, but we are not over the goal line yet, and we cannot  let a last-minute fumble, one way or the other, stop the Victim  Compensation Fund from being fully funded permanently or at least for  as long as can be, helping those who need the help.   Parenthetically, I prefer permanent or at least the 71 years that is  in the House bill.                                     Iran    Mr. President, I also appreciate Leader McConnell's commitment on  another front. Yesterday, Leader McConnell promised that the Senate  would vote on the Udall amendment to the Defense authorization bill.  Democrats have been urging the leader to allow this crucial vote on our  Iran policy. I am pleased that this Chamber may consider it. I am  hopeful that the leader and I will be able to come to some agreement on  the timing of that vote soon.   This is a debate the Senate should have for the sake of the  Constitution, which houses the power to declare war here in this  branch, for the sake of the Senate, which has ducked too many debates  and too many amendments this year, and for the sake of the American  people, many of whom are worried that the President will bumble us into  another endless war in the Middle East that nobody wants.   I look forward to working with the leader to schedule a time for this  very important debate, a debate mandated by the Constitution.                               Border Security    Mr. President, finally, on border, over the past several weeks, our  Nation has come to grips with the horrendous treatment of unaccompanied  migrant children at our southern border. The reports of what is  happening at detention centers like the one in Clint, TX, and  Homestead, FL, have shaken the conscience of the Nation.   There are hundreds of kids crammed into a facility suited for a few  dozen, at most, with no beds to sleep on, no soap or toothbrushes to  clean themselves, and not enough diapers for toddlers to wear. There  are 8-year-olds taking care of 2-year-olds because they have been  separated from their parents. Many have worn the same clothes for  several weeks, many have gotten sick, and several have died while in  the care of our government.   Yesterday the New York Times released this picture--a Salvadoran  father and daughter, Oscar Martinez and 23-month-old Valeria, washed  upon the banks of the Rio Grande after trying to cross into the United  States. Her tiny head was tucked inside his shirt, her arm draped  around his neck. They were holding on to each other.   President Trump, I want you to look at this photo. These are not drug  dealers or vagrants or criminals; they are people simply fleeing a  horrible situation in their home country for a better life.   How could President Trump look at this picture and not understand  that these are human beings fleeing violence and persecution, willing  to risk a perilous, sometimes fatal, journey in search of a better  life? These people are not coming here to sell drugs or to commit  crimes. They are coming here to escape brutality, starvation, threats  of rape, and murder in their home countries. Any normal person would  flee.   The sad fact is, we can do something about this if the President  would stop playing all the political games of blame, blame, blame.   If Oscar and Valeria had been allowed to petition for asylum in the  United States within El Salvador, if they asked for asylum to come here  but did it at the El Salvadoran Embassy, as Democrats have proposed,  they wouldn't have had to make this perilous journey. If the  administration had followed through on foreign aid to stabilize their  home country's government, they would not have had to make this  perilous journey. If our ports of entry were adequately staffed, if we  had enough asylum judges and our asylum laws were respected, they might  not have perished. That is what is at stake.   There is a rational solution. It has had bipartisan support in the  past, but the President only wants not to solve the problem--he jumps  from proposed solution to proposed solution and then abandons them, and  instead he says: Let's blame the Democrats. That is a disgrace by now.   Mr. President, you are President of the United States. You are head  of the executive branch. You control what is happening at the border.  Much of what is happening at the border, President Trump, stems from  the chaos and mismanagement in your administration.   Just yesterday, the Acting Commissioner of Customs and Border  Protection, John Sanders, abruptly resigned after just a few weeks on  the job, throwing an agency already in turmoil into another round of  chaos. The man who will replace him, Mark Morgan, was only installed as  Acting Director of ICE this month. The Department of Homeland Security  still lacks a Senate-confirmed leader.   I saw a report this morning, based on reporting in the New Yorker  magazine, that even rank-and-file ICE agents who are not particularly  sympathetic to the plight of these migrants are fed up with the chaos  in the administration and the erratic nature--one plan one week,  another plan the next week, another plan the next week, and none of  them implemented. They shouldn't have been implemented because they  wouldn't do the job.   The President's actions at the border are a whirlwind of incompetence  leading to pictures like this. We have to change our policies.   President Trump, if you want to know the real reason there is chaos  at the border, look in the mirror.   The President continues to blame Democrats, but the real problem is  the President.   Democrats believe we have a moral responsibility to act. Right now,  we are  [[Page S4529]]  working to pass a supplemental appropriations bill to help improve the  conditions for children at the border. The House passed its version  last night. It is a much better bill than the Senate version. We should  take up the House bill in the Senate and send something to the  President as soon as possible and then make sure the administration  uses funds to improve the conditions at the border immediately. The  proposal that was done by the Senate Appropriations Committee, a  compromise bill between Senator Shelby and Leahy, got 30 votes. So  there is room for compromise to get something done. There was only one  dissenting vote.   Once we pass legislation to help solve the immediate humanitarian  crisis at the border, we should talk about what else we can do to  alleviate the situation, including allowing folks to apply for asylum  in their home countries, including more security assistance to Central  American countries to crack down on the drug dealers and the violence  and the degradation, including more judges at the border to reduce the  backlog in cases and reduce the strain on temporary housing.   We all--Democrats, Republicans, and Americans--have a responsibility  to act. The Senate, the House, and especially the President need to  act, and the President needs to end the chaos, end the fearmongering,  and get a grip on his administration.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate briefly on leader time.    Mr. President, the bill that was before us has failed.  Most of us on this side of the aisle would have much preferred that  bill, but it has failed.   The bill that Senators Shelby and Leahy have worked on diligently is  now before us. I am going to vote for it. I think most of us on this  side are going to vote for it so that we can quickly move to  conference.   Speaker Pelosi has called the President and suggested a few changes.  I think there are four changes to this bill. We could quickly have a  conference, talk about those four changes, try to get them in the bill,  and finish this quickly. I hope that is what will happen.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, first, I thank the majority leader for  understanding how strongly we feel on the Democratic side and how many  Americans feel that the constitutional right of Congress to examine  foreign conflict and potential war should be upheld. The fact that we  will get a vote on the Udall amendment, which is something we have  asked for, is only fair and only right. There may be differences of  viewpoint on both sides, but the fact that it will be on the floor and  be debated is exactly the right thing to do. It is something we want  and have asked for, and I thank the majority leader for understanding  that and allowing it to happen.
