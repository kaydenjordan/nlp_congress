 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  bill.   This partisan proposal would allocate over $2 billion of taxpayer  resources for a wall around the U.S. Capitol and spend money on other  things, like Members' personal security at home.   I don't believe the American people support that. I don't believe  they understand what is in this bill. And I believe this bill would  only serve to further separate the American people from their elected  representatives here in Washington.   This is not the way we do business in the United States of America.  It is not the way we should do business.   There are so many issues that are more worthy of our attention. The  crisis at our border is unlike anything we have ever seen. We are  recording 20-year highs in border crossings. But instead of completing  the wall at our southern border, which would protect innocent children  from being exploited by human traffickers and drug cartels, Democrats  would rather spend $2 billion on a wall around this building in D.C.   This is the people's House, Madam Speaker, and I cannot support this  proposal to take my constituents' hard-earned money and use it to keep  them out.
