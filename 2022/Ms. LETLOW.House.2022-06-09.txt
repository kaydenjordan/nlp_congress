 Madam Speaker, I come to the floor today to pay tribute  to the late Sherra Ann Everett Fertitta, a truly wonderful person and a  dedicated mother, grandmother, educator, and friend, who was beloved by  so many people across Ouachita Parish and northeast Louisiana.   Madam Speaker, I believe that the best way to describe the kind of  person Sherra was is to use the words of her daughter, Tori Fertitta  Mortensen. She said, ``Her happiness was in seeing the happiness and  good works of others.''   Sherra was the kind of person who lifted you up every single time you  saw her. On a personal level, she was always kind and encouraging,  never forgetting to tell me that she was praying for me. It is her  caring spirit and remarkable kindness that emerges as a common theme in  the memories of her friends.   Sherra was a mom who was absolutely dedicated to her family. She was  a teacher who believed that it is essential to pass along the love of  learning to the next generation. She not only imparted her wisdom on  others but also reminded them that ``education is the best  investment.''    Sherra was a valued member of our community, who worked tirelessly to  make it a better place. For instance, when she was working in the  healthcare industry, she organized forums that would allow doctors and  medical professionals to share information and connect with individuals  who needed care and assistance.   She believed that being involved in the political process, helping  elect good people to office, and being a strong advocate for your  beliefs and values was essential to improving not just our community  but our country.   She was a longtime leader for the Ouachita Parish Republican Women  and served on the parish's Republican Executive Committee. She  volunteered on numerous campaigns and even helped produce a local radio  show.   Madam Speaker, I could go on and on about all that Sherra Fertitta  did for our community in Ouachita Parish, that is the kind of person  she was.   We know that her true legacy lives on through her family, her  friends, and the countless people whose lives she touched here on  Earth. We will miss her immeasurably and the joy that Sherra Fertitta  brought to our lives will never be forgotten.  [[Page H5432]]                                ____________________
