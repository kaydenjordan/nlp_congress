 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1651) to amend the CARES Act to extend the sunset for the  definition of a small business debtor, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1651         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``COVID-19 Bankruptcy Relief       Extension Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. EXTENSIONS.         (a) In General.--Section 1113 of the CARES Act (Public Law       116-136) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)(5) (11 U.S.C. 1182 note), by striking       ``1 year'' and inserting ``2 years''; and        (2) in subsection (b)(2)(B) (11 U.S.C. 101 note), by       striking ``1 year'' and inserting ``2 years''.        (b) Modification of Plan After Confirmation.--        (1) Section 1329(d)(1) of title 11, United States Code, is       amended, in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by       striking ``this subsection'' and inserting ``the COVID-19       Bankruptcy Relief Extension Act of 2021''.

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on H.R. 1651.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1651, the COVID-19 Bankruptcy Relief Extension  Act of 2021, is bipartisan legislation to temporarily extend, until  March 27, 2022, the COVID-19 bankruptcy relief provisions enacted as  part of the CARES Act in the December 2020 omnibus appropriations bill.   Since the bankruptcy provisions of the CARES Act will expire next  week, it is urgent for Congress to ensure that families and small  businesses do not lose access to these economic lifelines.   These provisions were enacted last year to provide critical relief to  families and small businesses forced into bankruptcy because of the  ongoing pandemic. For example, they help ensure that Federal COVID- related relief payments are used by families to get through this  pandemic instead of being seized by creditors. They also help people  stay in their homes and ensure that their utilities are not shut off.   In addition, these provisions protect individuals and creditors alike  from the effects of the pandemic derailing the court-ordered repayment  plans that promise a way out of chapter 13 bankruptcy.   They will also allow more small businesses to take advantage of the  streamlined process established by the Small Business Reorganization  Act.   Extending these necessary protections until March of next year will  provide much-needed certainty that the bankruptcy system will remain  responsive to debtors and creditors alike during this extraordinarily  disruptive crisis.   I thank Mr. Cline for his work with me on this bill, and for his work  to ensure that small businesses have meaningful access to the  bankruptcy process.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this urgently needed  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers.    Madam Speaker, this bill will provide critical relief to  the small businesses and families forced into bankruptcy because of the  ongoing pandemic. These provisions help make sure that the pandemic  does not derail the path to a fresh start that the bankruptcy code  promises for individuals and businesses alike.   As Mr. Issa said, this is bipartisan legislation. I am aware of no  opposition to it whatsoever.   Madam Speaker, I hope all of my colleagues will support this urgently  needed bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1652) to deposit certain funds into the Crime Victims Fund,  to waive matching requirements, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1652         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``VOCA Fix to Sustain the       Crime Victims Fund Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2.

(b) Crime Victim Compensation.--Section 1403 of the Victims       of Crime Act of 1984 (34 U.S.C. 20102) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)--        (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``40 percent in fiscal       year 2002 and of 60 percent in subsequent fiscal years'' and       inserting ``75 percent'';        (B) in paragraph (2), by striking ``of 40 percent in fiscal       year 2002 and of 60 percent in subsequent fiscal years'';        (C) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (4); and        (D) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following new       paragraph:        ``(3) For the purposes of calculating amounts awarded in       the previous fiscal year under this subsection, the Director       shall not require eligible crime victim compensation programs       to deduct recovery costs or collections from restitution or       from subrogation for payment under a civil lawsuit.'';        (2) in subsection (b)(2) by striking ``authorities;'' and       inserting ``authorities, except  [[Page H1391]]       if a program determines such cooperation may be impacted due       to a victim's age, physical condition, psychological state,       cultural or linguistic barriers, or any other health or       safety concern that jeopardizes the victim's wellbeing;'';       and        (3) in subsection (d)--        (A) in paragraph (3), by striking ``; and'' and inserting a       semicolon;        (B) in paragraph (4), by striking the period at the end and       inserting ``; and''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(5) the term `recovery costs' means expenses for       personnel directly involved in the recovery efforts to obtain       collections from restitution or from subrogation for payment       under a civil law suit.''.

SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 1652.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the VOCA Fix to Sustain the Crime Victims Fund Act  would support vital victim service programs by preventing future cuts  to already diminished Federal victim service grants.   Grants under the Victims of Crime Act, or VOCA, are the primary  source of Federal funding for thousands of victim service providers  around the country, including programs serving victims of domestic  violence, sexual assault, child abuse, trafficking, and drunk driving.  VOCA grants also fund victim compensation, including paying medical  bills, covering lost wages, and paying for funeral costs.   These critical grants are not taxpayer-funded. Instead, they are paid  out of the Crime Victims Fund, or CVF, which is funded, in turn,  through Federal criminal fines, forfeited bail bonds, penalties, and  special assessments collected by U.S. Attorneys' Offices, Federal U.S.  courts, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.   Over the past several years, however, deposits into the CVF have  dropped significantly, leading to corresponding cuts in grants to  victim service providers. This is, in part, because the Federal  Government has increased its reliance in recent years on deferred  prosecution and nonprosecution agreements, the penalties from which are  not deposited into the CVF.   This legislation would shore up funding for this critical fund by  requiring DOJ to deposit penalties from these deferred prosecution and  nonprosecution agreements into the CVF, in addition to the funds  currently deposited from other sources.   Not only does this legislation ensure the CVF is more financially  stable, it would also make much-needed improvements to victim  compensation and services. For example, it would increase the statutory  amount awarded to victim compensation programs, and it expands the  range of victims eligible for compensation. It also allows States to  request a no-cost extension from the Attorney General, as allowed for  other Department of Justice formula grant programs, to ensure that  States can thoughtfully and effectively distribute victim service  grants without being penalized.   Other improvements include waiving matching requirements for the  duration of the COVID-19 crisis, plus 1 additional year, and additional  discretion for the States which administer VOCA funds to further waive  matching requirements once this initial waiver period expires.   All of these provisions would substantially improve the program's  effectiveness and would enable it to offer more services to more  people.   I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick),  the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), and the other bipartisan  cosponsors of this important legislation for their support. I also want  to thank our colleagues in the Senate, including Senator Durbin, the  lead sponsor, and Senator Graham, for their efforts to pass this bill  in that Chamber as well.   This bipartisan and bicameral legislation ensures that programs and  services assisting victims of crime are fully funded and are better- supported, with no new taxpayer dollars.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).  [[Page H1392]]         Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1  minute.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  the purpose of closing.   Last year, all 56 State and territorial attorneys general sent a  letter to Congress warning us that the balance and financial health of  the Crime Victims Fund is in jeopardy and urging that we act swiftly to  address the problem. They explained any decrease in the funds available  for distribution results in a decrease in the number of victims and  survivors that are served, as well as potential loss of essential staff  in victim service programs.   The VOCA Fix to Sustain the Crime Victims Fund Act heeds their call  and would ensure that this fund has the resources it needs to continue  delivering essential services to victims of crime. This important  legislation is supported by more than 1,670 national, regional, State,  territorial, and local organizations.   I thank all of my colleagues who have supported this bill. I am aware  of no opposition to this bill at all, and I urge all of my colleagues  to support it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
