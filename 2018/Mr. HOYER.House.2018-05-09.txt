 Mr. Speaker, on March 24, I was in Morristown, New Jersey,  with former Assistant U.S. Attorney Mikie Sherrill, where we attended  the March for Our Lives.   The March for Our Lives was organized by students around the country  to speak out against gun violence and call for action in Congress to  strengthen our gun laws. This march came just days after a deadly  shooting at Great Mills High School in St. Mary's County in my  district, and it came in the wake of horrific incidents of mass gun  violence at a school in Parkland, Florida, and at places of worship,  entertainment, and even public streets across the country.   Congress can and should act. Nine in ten Americans, 90 percent of our  fellow citizens, believe we ought to do so. We have the ability right  now to strengthen background checks and ban the kinds of assault  weapons that make our communities unsafe.   Law enforcement wants us to get this done. So do parents and so do  teachers. In Morristown, we heard directly from students, nine of whom  spoke at the march that Ms. Sherrill and I attended. I was moved by  their words.   Because they are too long to insert here together, Mr. Speaker, I  will be submitting these students' speeches individually into the  Congressional Record in the coming days. But today, let me just share  with you some excerpts from each of them that capture the spirit of the  march and the fears and hopes of these young Americans.   One student, Bella Bhimani, summed it up very well, and she said  this: ``All we want is to make the world safer, which is something, I  think, everyone can agree on.'' Would that that were true, Mr. Speaker.   Another, Caitlyn Dempsey, said this: ``We have been learning that  actions speak louder than words since kindergarten. So we walked out.  So we've written our Congressmen. So we planned this march.'' They took  action.   Senior Isabella Bosrock from West Morris Mendham High School  lamented: ``It is horrible that as adolescents we have become used to  the idea that gun violence is a method of dealing with our problems.''   Another student, Mia Paone, a sophomore at Chatham High School,  declared: ``I am not old enough to vote yet, but I am old enough to  speak out against gun violence.'' She concluded: ``I will not be  silent.''   Nile Burch, a student at Morristown High School, shared his hope  that: ``Piece by piece, we will inspire other students to gain the  courage to stand up for what they believe in.'' What a lesson for all  of us.   Luna Aguilar declared: `` . . . we, the youth, the future of our  country, are deciding--right here, right now--that our lives are worth  more than the right to own an assault weapon.''   One of the students, Benjamin Douglas, spoke about how he rides with  Team 26, a group of cyclists who ride in memory of the victims of Sandy  Hook Elementary School where so many children and teachers lost their  lives. They stop along the way to raise awareness of gun violence.   He said this: ``We must continue to organize these events and never  stop making noise until''--until--``until our Representatives get it.''   Raniya Madhi, a junior at Ridge High School, spoke about how many  students now live in fear. How tragic. She told us this: ``Most of us  are just teenagers. We should be worrying about doing well on our AP  tests and finals at the end of the year, not about being shot  by someone who can enter our school.'' What parent is not terrified at  that possibility?    Finally, Danilo Lopez, a junior at Dover High School, chose, instead  of delivering remarks, simply to read aloud the names of the victims of  the recent Parkland, Florida, shooting. When he concluded, he expressed  what we are all feeling, by saying: ``Let us hope and pray that they  are in a better place--and we will always remember.''   Let me suggest, Mr. Speaker, remembering is not enough. Action is  required. We stand on this floor and have a moment of silence for those  we lost. We are sad for them, for their families, and, yes, for our  country.   A moment of silence is not enough. Action is required to ensure that  future moments of silence will not be necessary. The nine student  speakers in Morristown, Mr. Speaker, like those across the country that  day, gave voice to the millions who are scared but determined to see  things change.   These speeches represent but a snapshot of what Americans heard on  March 24 at the nationwide March for Our Lives. I hope my colleagues  will read what these extraordinarily poised and thoughtful students had  to say, and I hope we can listen to their fears and their hopes and  come together to take action.   That is what they want us to do. That is our responsibility. That is  what we ought to do.                            ____________________
