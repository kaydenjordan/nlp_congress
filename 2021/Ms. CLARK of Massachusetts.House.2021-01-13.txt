 Madam Speaker, suffragist and  abolitionist Lucy Stone stated, ``If we speak the truth fearlessly, we  shall add to our number those who will turn the scale to the side of  equal and full justice in all things.''   The truth is, President Trump incited a violent attack against the  United States Government.   The truth is, President Trump spent his Presidency inflaming hate,  white supremacy, anti-Semitism, and violence.   The truth is, he was enabled by all those who perpetuated the lie  that the most secure election in our Nation's history was stolen.   The truth is that these seditious actions left five dead, our Capitol  besieged, our security threatened, and our democracy hanging in the  balance.   And the truth is, a vote to impeach is our resounding declaration  that the government of the people, by the people, for the people shall  not perish.
