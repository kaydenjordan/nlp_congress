 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the  attempts to take away our Second Amendment rights.   As a gun owner myself, I am a strong supporter of the Second  Amendment, and for me, this support is personal.   Years ago, myself and my employees were held at gunpoint in my own  pharmacy. Fortunately, we all made it out safe. Do you want to know why  we made it out safe? Because we had a gun as well.   But I know we were more fortunate than most who have a similar  experience. I have utilized my gun carry permit ever since.   I believe Americans should have the right to defend themselves like I  did. This experience is just one reason why I oppose attempts to weaken  our right to carry.   Without our Second Amendment rights, we undermine our own rights to  self-defense for ourselves, our businesses, and our families. This  would be a terrible mistake, to try to take away our inalienable right  to self-defense.   Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing any  legislation that threatens our Second Amendment rights, including H.R.  8 and H.R. 1446.
