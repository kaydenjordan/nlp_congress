 Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Ann  Taylor, who is retiring from Connecticut Children's Medical Center  after 19 years of service to the children of Connecticut.   Dating back to my time as the chairman of the State legislature's  Public Health Committee, Ann has been a great friend and counsel to me.  I have relied on her policy expertise and acumen, and I have drawn  inspiration from her relentless focus on improving the lives of  Connecticut's kids.   Throughout her career, Ann has both led and managed various  departments across Connecticut Children's Medical Center, including  legal, risk management, compliance, strategic planning, government  relations, marketing and communications, and the foundation. Ann has  been the voice of Connecticut's kids here in Washington. She  successfully advocated for funding that supports Connecticut Children's  vital role as an academic medical center, healthcare reform efforts  that protect children with preexisting medical conditions, and  protections for the Medicaid Program that maintain a critical safety  net for more than one-third of Connecticut's children. At the State  level, her drive to improve health outcomes for children led her to  establish Connecticut Children's Medical-Legal Partnership Project,  which is devoted to providing traditional legal representation for  children within a comprehensive approach to the child's healthcare  needs. The project also worked to secure funding that improved access  to care for children and adolescents in behavioral health crisis  through the establishment of the CARES unit on the Institute of Living  campus.   On a more personal level, I have seen firsthand the dedication Ann  has for every single child who intersects with Connecticut Children's.  She doesn't just advocate for broad-based policies; she works for every  single patient. I recall working with her for days on one  [[Page S1129]]  single case--a little girl who because of her complicated immigration  status was having difficulty getting insurance coverage for her  expensive, rare medical condition. Ann worked with me to make sure that  little girl got what she needed, so that her life could be extended for  a few more years. I am sure Ann went that extra mile for countless  other children, and that will likely be the legacy she leaves.   The impact of Ann's work will be felt by children and families for  years to come, and we are grateful for her service. I hope Connecticut  realizes how lucky it was to have her fighting for children's  healthcare for the last two decades.                            ____________________
