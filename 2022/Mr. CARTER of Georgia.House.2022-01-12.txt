 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of a very  important day we are celebrating today, National Pharmacists Day.   Today we take time to recognize and appreciate all of our  communities' pharmacists and everything that they do for their  patients.   During the pandemic, pharmacists joined with the frontline workers to  help alleviate the pandemic by distributing lifesaving medicines to  their patients.   Pharmacists are an integral part of each and every community. They  keep people safe and healthy.   As a pharmacist, I am proud to take time today to recognize and honor  my colleagues nationwide. In a world where our frontline workers are  heroes, we must not forget those who bond with their patients and  ensure lifesaving and correct dosages are being distributed properly.   I am proud of my time spent as a pharmacist, and I am very grateful  for my colleagues and what they do to better their communities.   Take time today to thank your local pharmacist and appreciate all  that they do. Thank you all for your service to our towns, our cities,  and our States.                            ____________________
