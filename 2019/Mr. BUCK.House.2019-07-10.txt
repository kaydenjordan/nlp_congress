 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the Speaker for the opportunity to speak about this important  legislation that I am proud to sponsor, the Fairness for High-Skilled  Immigrants Act.   I also want to thank my colleague, the distinguished gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Immigration  and Citizenship. I have appreciated working with the gentlewoman to  make a meaningful change that will make our employment-based  immigration into an equitable system, one that is based on merit, not  on where you were born.   Mr. Speaker, I want to tell you why this bill has a special place in  my heart. Two years ago, as I was traveling through my district, I met  with a group of individuals who were here legally but felt that they  were being put at a disadvantage by our government's immigration  policies. They were resolute that I, and Congress, more broadly, could  change their futures for the better.   As we sat together, my new friends shared their stories of coming to  the United States with a great sense of hope. They came here for any  number of reasons, but every single person arrived seeking a new  opportunity to succeed and realize their own American Dream.   During our conversation, we talked about a bill, but what we really  were discussing was these individuals' hopes and dreams for a future  that will be brighter because of this legislation.   You see, Mr. Speaker, our immigration policies are leaving these  hardworking people stuck between a rock and a hard place. They had made  the difficult decision to pack up their lives and come to the United  States, seeking the opportunity to live and work in the greatest  country in the world. But now these same people found themselves caught  in a decades-long backlog to receive a green card, waiting to open  their own businesses, create American jobs.   At this moment, there are approximately 1.5 million high-skilled  immigrants living in the United States on an employment-based visa.  They are working hard and paying their taxes, yet face decades-long  waits, sometimes up to 70 years to receive a green card.   Worst of all, Congress created this state of limbo by instituting an  arbitrary annual cap on the number of individuals who may receive a  green card from any single country.   This system doesn't make sense. Our employment-based immigration  system has a single purpose, bringing in the best and brightest. We  shouldn't hamstring our economy by placing artificial caps on who can  get a green card quicker based solely on where you are born.   As the Cato Institute and National Review deftly pointed out, we  aren't considering that countries have different population sizes.  India has a population 2\1/2\ times greater than the European Union,  but has an employment-based green card cap that is 4 percent of the  European Union's cap. This policy is not helping to develop our high- skilled economy.   Additionally, studies based on the Department of Labor's own  statistics show that the per-country caps are depressing the average  wage for employer-sponsored immigrants by $11,592. These arbitrary caps  are depressing wages, hurting American workers, and hindering further  economic growth.   We shouldn't be punishing highly-skilled individuals who come to this  country legally. People who do everything the right way, and are only  seeking an opportunity to work hard, contribute to the U.S. economy and  support their families.                                time  1500    We should be celebrating this and helping to create an equitable  system that benefits both U.S. companies and employment-based visa  holders. I am happy to say that is exactly what this bill does.   The Fairness for High Skilled Immigrants Act creates an equitable  system that eliminates the arbitrary per-country caps on employment- based green cards and replaces it with a first-come-first-served  system.   This important change will free U.S. companies to focus on what they  do best: hiring smart people to create products, services, and jobs in  our districts, while ensuring all employment-based visa applicants are  evaluated on their merit, not where they come from.   Mr. Speaker, it is time that Congress fixes this policy once and for  all. Seventy-year backlogs are only going to dissuade talented  individuals from coming to the United States and further hamper our  economy. We need to create an equitable system that helps our  businesses and is fair to the individuals who came here looking to  achieve their own dream to live and work in the greatest country in the  world.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, end the backlogs,  and make our employment-based green card system first come, first  served, not based on where you are born.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Utah  (Mr. Curtis), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Collins), my friend and the ranking member of the  Judiciary Committee.    I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I would note for the Record that one of the  reasons that I am so proud to sponsor this bill is it is not an amnesty  bill. This is a bill that is based on merit, and it even further  enhances the merit aspects of this program. I am proud to sponsor this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Newhouse), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, Congress can create a truly fair and equitable  employment-based immigration system. The Fairness for High-Skilled  Immigrants Act will fundamentally change our employment-based  immigration system for the better by ensuring our employers can hire  people based on qualifications and ability to do the job, not the  country of origin.    We must continue working to build the U.S.-based high-skilled  workforce, but in the meantime, we simply do not have enough U.S.  workers to fill our employment needs. Congress must address the system  to ensure that we are  [[Page H5328]]  not welcoming high-skilled workers here and then promptly leaving them  in a limbo that may last a lifetime.   It is time that we fix the system to create a merit-based, first- come-first-served system that is fair for all employment-based  immigrants.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
