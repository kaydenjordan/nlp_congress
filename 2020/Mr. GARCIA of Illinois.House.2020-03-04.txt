 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to participate in  this conversation about women's rights and access to healthcare  services, especially reproductive healthcare services.   I want to thank Congresswoman Tlaib and Congresswoman Pressley for  their leadership on this matter.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of women's access to  reproductive healthcare.   The Louisiana law now being argued at the Supreme Court today, in  part, is part of an ongoing national effort to effectively ban abortion  without formally bringing up Roe v. Wade. Even if the right to abortion  technically exists, it won't matter if access to places to get abortion  care are eliminated.   Republicans have pushed hundreds of restrictive laws throughout State  legislatures. If they truly cared about women, my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle would have voted for equal pay and for the  Violence Against Women Act, but they didn't.   Instead, in 2020, they are still questioning a woman's constitutional  right to safe and legal abortion, which has been the law of the land  for over 46 years. They want to turn back the clock and deny women the  right to reproductive healthcare, to make choices about their own  bodies.   For many in my community, this is a deeply personal matter. I took a  strong stance on reproductive rights before the issue was widely  discussed and acceptable in my own community, but, for me, it has  always been impossible to separate the issues of economic justice and  reproductive freedom.   The ability to control if, when, and how to have children is at the  core of women's ability to provide a decent standard of living for  themselves and their families.   But let me be clear: While abortion access is critical, women of  color and other marginalized women also often have difficulty accessing  contraception, comprehensive sex education, sexually transmitted  infection prevention and care, adequate prenatal and pregnancy care,  and so much more. In short, one's socioeconomic and immigration status,  ZIP Code, et cetera, should not determine access to reproductive help.   Abortion access is a critical step toward achieving true reproductive  justice for the communities I represent. If the Supreme Court decides  to strip women of their practical access to abortion services, as they  are now considering, they will effectively reverse Roe v. Wade and  outright deny women the ability to determine their own health, family,  and future.                                time  1745    This is an assault on women, an assault on freedom, and an assault on  self-determination. Women alone should have the right to choose what is  best for them.
