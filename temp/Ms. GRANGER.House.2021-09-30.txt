 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, today, I rise to speak about H.R. 5305, a bill that  will prevent the Federal Government from shutting down and provide a  helping hand to Americans who have faced loss and devastation due to  storms, wildfires, and other natural disasters.   I should note that I opposed a similar package last week when it came  to the floor. Since that time, the Senate has removed the debt ceiling  from the bill.   Madam Speaker, let me reinforce an important point for those  listening to us debate this bill. We did not have to be in this place  just hours before shutdown. Republicans made it clear in August that  tying a debt ceiling vote to the continuing resolution was not  something we could support.   Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the party that  controls the House, the Senate, and the White House decided to do  exactly what we asked them not to do. I hope we can soon move forward  with the stopgap measure so that the critical function of government  can continue and the Committee on Appropriations can finish the fiscal  year 2022 bills. If we don't pass a CR today, we will be faced with an  unnecessary and costly government shutdown, which would impact military  readiness, border security, and so many important programs Americans  rely on.    Before I close, I must admit that I am disappointed that an issue I  raised repeatedly on the floor of the House last week is not yet  resolved.   I firmly believe that we cannot wait any longer to replenish Israel's  Iron Dome missile defense system that was so successful this past  spring when Israel was under attack. The Iron Dome bill that passed the  House last week had overwhelming support of 420 votes. The best  solution would have been for the Senate to add back the Iron Dome  funding to this CR. Since that did not happen, I hope my colleagues in  the Senate will continue to work to get the Iron Dome bill passed as a  standalone legislation as quickly as possible.   Israel deserves our strong support. It is essential that the  terrorists who wish to do them harm know that the United States stands  by our allies and friends. I also have concerns about some of the  provisions related to Afghanistan. I hope the issues raised by Senator  Cotton during consideration this morning can be addressed.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1500     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
