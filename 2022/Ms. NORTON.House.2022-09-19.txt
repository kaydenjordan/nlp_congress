 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Chairman Grijalva,  for yielding, and I thank him and Chairman Neguse for bringing this  bill to the floor.   This bill would authorize the Georgetown African American Historic  Landmark Project and Tour to establish a memorial on Federal land in  the District of Columbia commemorating the enslaved individuals who  endured forced migration to the United States by way of the  transatlantic slave trade. The National Capital Memorial Advisory  Commission unanimously supported this bill, and it passed out of  committee by unanimous consent.   We must not hide this history. Enslaved individuals, known and  unknown, rest at the core of our Nation's history. The atrocities of  the system of chattel slavery shed light on our Nation's central  struggle between slavery and freedom--a freedom under which some could  be owned, beaten, separated from their families, and denied any rights.   This bill provides for the creation of a powerful marker of truth- telling and remembrance. Let us honor the personhood of these  individuals who were repeatedly assumed to have none so that they will  never be forgotten.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
