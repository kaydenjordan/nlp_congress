 Mr. Speaker, control of energy equals national security.  I rise to warn how Russia, through hybrid warfare, seeks to destabilize  and divide our closest European allies through control of their energy  supply.   As Americans well know, whoever controls the energy spigot controls  the function of a nation. Russia uses its growing dominance of energy  in Europe as its primary pressure point to destabilize the West and our  allies. That is why I was floored that President Trump inserted himself  so haphazardly into Europe's energy debate.   Nord Stream II poses new, troubling dependency threats by Russia on  Europe's energy security and boosts undemocratic Russia's claw hold on  the European continent. Russia is weaponizing energy in countries  across Europe, including Germany and Ukraine, creating a dangerous new  dependency by those recipient nations.   The fight for Ukraine's liberty depends on its energy independence in  the future, and the free world must help Europe and Ukraine reduce  their economic reliance on Russian gas.   Risking alienation of nations that share freedom's values is  counterproductive and aids and abets our enemies.   Mr. Speaker, I will include in the Record President Trump's and  President Putin's comments on this topic.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, sadly, the provisions contained in this  amendment would block the Postal Service from running a pilot program  designed to improve operations and save taxpayers money, like allowing  travelers to submit passport applications at post offices across the  country. It would severely limit the potential of one of our most  essential, constitutionally mandated government agencies, and hurt our  communities and our citizens in the process.   I represent not only countless letter carriers, but thousands of  Ohioans who rely on the Postal Service for timely delivery of their  Social Security checks, electric bills, and birthday cards from loved  ones.   Expanding the services provided at our Nation's post offices would  achieve two ends: supporting a great Federal job provider, and helping  our communities and citizens at the same time.   At a time when banks and other institutions are abandoning inner  cities and rural communities, in my district alone, post offices  present a perfect medium to collocate, including with traditional banks  or credit unions.   For example, in my home State, 18.6 percent of Cleveland households  have no checking or savings account, and 24.1 percent of households are  under-banked, forced to use costly payday and auto title firms or  currency exchange stores to cash paychecks or make consumer loans. More  than 35 percent of Cleveland's 389,000 residents live below the Federal  poverty line.   Many post offices are located in bank deserts. Fifty-nine percent of  post offices are in ZIP Codes with either zero banks or only one bank  branch.   By giving the Postal Service the opportunity to serve our communities  in  [[Page H6541]]  a more expansive capacity, we could also put the Postal Service back on  the right track financially, bring back hundreds of American jobs, and,  in so doing, restore faith in one of our most fundamental government  services.   The Postal Service is already providing an impressive, expansive, and  affordable service to all the American people--and by the American  people, by the way. I am fighting in Congress to support the  hardworking employees of the Postal Service and our citizens,  especially in underserved communities across not just my district, but  our country.   It is really horrendous to go into communities that have no financial  services, where people are being ripped off every day.   Mr. Chair, I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort and  oppose this misguided amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield my remaining time to the gentleman from Virginia  (Mr. Connolly), a very able and intelligent Congressman.                                time  2130     Mr. Chair, as the designee of Ranking Member Lowey, I  move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I would just like to respond to the gentleman.  The offer of this amendment should never be on an appropriation bill.  This is one of these extraneous riders that belongs in other bills, and  it is very damaging to the future of communities across this country,  thousands of which lack banking services and financial services of any  kind.   What we are talking about here is something simple. It is something  very simple: a pilot program. We are not saying this is going to happen  all over the United States. This gentleman wants to deny the ability of  communities to have any kind of normal financial service where they  have been redlined by the very letters that the gentleman just asked to  be placed in the Record. Those very institutions abandoned the  communities that we are seeking to serve.   I am really disappointed that the gentleman would want people to be  subjected to usurious interest rates or to a lack of any kind of  financial service, even paying your electric bill, for heaven's sake.   So, for two reasons, I ask my colleagues to vote against the  gentleman's amendment: number one, it doesn't belong in this bill; and  number two, it does a great disservice to the people of this country.  They have a right to better service.   The Postal Service is coast to coast. It is audited, it is properly  staffed, and it is universal. Whether you are poor or whether you are  rich in this country, you have a right. You have a right to be treated  fairly by the institutions that this Nation manages.   Mr. Chair, I want to congratulate those who work for our great Postal  Service. I ask that the gentleman's amendment be defeated, and let us  support what is in the Constitution of the United States, which is  respect for the Postal Service, coast to coast to every citizen.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Chairman, you know, if they would operate these  microphones for the Democrats as well as they operate them for the  Republicans, maybe we could be heard on this floor, and especially for  the women Democrats, I might add.    Thank you.
