 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the University of  Texas Rio Grande Valley School of Medicine on the successful  establishment of a medical school, commemorated through the graduation  of their inaugural class.   The class of 2020 has established a precedent of success and  excellence for the UTRGV School of Medicine and for all future classes  to emulate.   The establishment of the UTRGV School of Medicine followed decades- long efforts to ensure that Rio Grande Valley residents have access to  quality healthcare services, an important milestone for the region.   From 1997 to 2009, a regional academic health center was opened and  efforts to build the resources and healthcare infrastructure were  launched. The success of these efforts resulted in the Texas  Legislature approving the creation of the medical school in 2013.   In 2015, the UTRGV School of Medicine received preliminary  accreditation, which allowed the university to recruit its first  medical school class. The inaugural class will receive their doctor of  medicine degrees on May 9, 2020, when they will then go on to complete  specialized medical training across the country, including in south  Texas.   The UTRGV's School of Medicine class of 2020 is the future of  healthcare not only for the Rio Grande Valley but for this country.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the UTRGV  School of Medicine's first graduating class. Congratulations to the  university for their success.   To these future physicians, thank you for choosing to be our Nation's  healers.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Emily J.
