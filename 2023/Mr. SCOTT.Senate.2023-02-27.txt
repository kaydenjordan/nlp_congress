 Mr. President, as the junior Senator from South  Carolina, it is my pleasure to honor Dr. Evans P. Whitaker, who has  dedicated his life and career to our State and the advancement of  Anderson University. In November of 2002, Dr. Whitaker assumed the  presidency of Anderson University following nearly two decades in  higher education leadership, where he served at Gardner-Webb  University, Wingate University, and Belmont University. Today, I ask my  colleagues to join me in celebrating 20 years of outstanding service  from Dr. Whitaker and Anderson's first lady, Diane Whitaker.   Under his leadership, Anderson University has evolved into the  largest private university in the State. Dr. Whitaker also led the  efforts to create the South Carolina School of Arts, a premier arts  conservatory, to establish the school of nursing and to form the  college of engineering. In addition to new degree programs, Anderson  has experienced consistent growth in enrollment, freshman retention,  and campus acreage. His visionary leadership has allowed innovation to  enhance education and the quality of life in our State.   Anderson University's beautiful campus is a resource to the upstate  and our State. Home to the Rocky River Conservancy, Anderson promotes  conservation, outdoor recreation, and educational opportunities for the  community. Clearly bearing the personal touch of Dr. an Mrs. Whitaker  are the beautiful buildings, picturesque Alumni Lawn and enhancements  across campus that Anderson students and residents alike enjoy.   For 20 years, Dr. and Mrs. Whitaker have helped Anderson University  reach new heights of success through increased academic offerings,  higher rankings, and solid institutional ratings. Throughout his  tenure, Dr. Whitaker has been recognized in Anderson and across South  Carolina for his leadership, unwavering service, and vast contributions  to our great State. Congratulations to Dr. and Mrs. Whitaker on this  distinction and for reaching this significant milestone. Thank you for  your excellent stewardship of Anderson University.                            ____________________
