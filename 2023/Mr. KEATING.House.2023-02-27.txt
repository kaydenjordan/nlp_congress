 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I rise in strong support of this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a cosponsor in support of my friend,  Congressman Joe Wilson's resolution, H. Res. 132, responding to the  earthquakes in Turkiye and Syria on February 6, 2023.   This timely and important resolution comes just weeks after multiple  7.5-plus magnitude earthquakes caused widespread devastation across  central-southern Turkiye and northern Syria.   This natural disaster was so powerful that the shaking could be felt  as far away as Egypt. The numbers are just staggering. Following the  initial shaking, Turkiye and Syria have borne the brunt of over 1,000  aftershocks, furthering the massive death and destruction that has  decimated infrastructure and communities across the region. Even today,  Mr. Speaker, there was another aftershock with reported loss of death.   As of February 25, 2023, Reuters estimated that 160,000 buildings  containing over half a million apartments have collapsed or were  severely damaged. The earthquake has killed more than 48,000 people and  injured 118,700 others in Turkiye and Syria combined. Today, the U.N.  Development Programme estimates that 1.5 million people have been left  homeless.   As ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe  and as an original cosponsor of this resolution, I want to express my  deepest condolences to the people of Turkiye and Syria who have been so  deeply impacted by these earthquakes. Tens of thousands have lost their  lives and even more have been left without a safe place to call home.  As a result, once vibrant cities and communities across the entire  region have been shattered and left in ruin.   In addition, I want to commend the efforts of thousands of  international humanitarian aid and rescue workers, as well as national  entities, local organizations, and individuals from across the region  who have come together to provide lifesaving assistance to those  impacted by this devastating earthquake.   During the past few weeks, these aid workers have provided lifesaving  resources and support, all while working in freezing winter conditions,  just to get help and relief for this enormous devastation and provide  the greatest help to the people who need it the most.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud those humanitarian and rescue workers from  across the United States Government who have joined the international  community in a global response. In total, as of February 19, 2023, the  United States has allocated $185 million in humanitarian assistance for  the earthquake response in Turkiye and Syria.   As part of its coordinated response, USAID's Bureau of Humanitarian  Assistance quickly deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team, also  known as a DART, which is working in close coordination with government  authorities and partners on the ground.   The DART included USAID-supported search and rescue units have drawn  domestic voluntary help, as well. It is important to recognize Fairfax  County, Virginia's, and Los Angeles County, California's, fire  departments have come to aid and help these people in such great need.  They provide heroic assistance in working with USAID. USAID has  deployed a total of 160 urban search and rescue personnel to Turkiye  who have now returned to the United States. We thank them for  volunteering and their heroic acts.   Furthermore, through its implementing partner, the World Food  Program, as of February 23, USAID had also supported the provision of  food assistance to 660,000 individuals in Syria and 900,000 earthquake- affected people in Turkiye. In addition, 840 metric tons of USAID in- kind relief commodities, including water, hygiene materials, kitchen  sets, and disaster relief materials were all delivered to support the  earthquake survivors.   Finally, the Department of Defense, in coordination with USAID's  Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance, has air-lifted 541,100 pounds of  critical relief items, including blankets, emergency food commodities,  generators, space heaters, tents, and winter clothing.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support those efforts and commend President  Biden, Secretary Blinken, and Administrator Power for their swift  response to this disaster.  [[Page H889]]    As the international community has responded, the Assad regime has  made that effort far more difficult. For example, while the Department  of the Treasury has taken important steps to clarify existing sanctions  licenses required to ensure the transfer of vital humanitarian aid to  the region, the exploitation of this disaster by the Assad regime is  reprehensible and cynical.   I wholeheartedly condemn these efforts by the Assad regime, which  have included preventing the United Nations from providing assistance  through multiple border crossings between Turkiye and Syria. The people  of Syria have suffered tremendously under the Assad regime, which since  2011 has used any means available, including the use of chemical  weapons, to suppress the voice of the Syrian people.                                   (1715)    There is intense need for international assistance in Syria, and I  support the call in this resolution for the Biden administration to  continue to use all diplomatic tools, including through the U.N.  Security Council, to open and keep open all Turkiye-Syria border  crossings for United Nations assistance.   Despite barriers from the Assad regime, the United Nations has worked  tirelessly in coordinating and facilitating life-saving humanitarian  assistance efforts by providing hot meals, food, tents, clothing,  medical supplies, and personnel to affected areas. Psychosocial support  services are also being provided, as well. Child-friendly spaces and  safe spaces for women to ensure those most vulnerable are cared for are  also in motion there.   U.N. programs like the World Food Programme and the U.N. High  Commission for Refugees have also crossed into Syria at the Bab al- Salam border crossing to ensure the people of Syria receive the vital  aid that they need.   All together, the United Nations has sent health supplies to more  than 400,000 people impacted by the earthquake and has released $50  million from its Central Emergency Response fund to jump-start the  response. The U.N. has also issued a flash appeal to raise all the  necessary funds to help meet the needs of those affected by these  earthquakes.   I, again, thank Congressman Joe Wilson for his efforts on this  legislation as well as over 35 bipartisan cosponsors. This resolution  sends a strong message of solidarity from the United States to the  people of Turkiye and Syria as they begin to cope with the aftermath of  these devastating earthquakes, and I am proud to join in supporting  this effort.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Carolina  for his strong bipartisan support in this gathering together of people  on both sides of the aisle for America's interest. As he pointed out,  we have an interest not only with our own defense facilities not far  from that region and not only associating as he has his own experience  the devastation of earthquakes, but also a stark contrast that occurs  to the people of Syria when they find out the U.S. and other countries  are coming together to their aid while the Syrian regime under Assad  continues to wreak havoc and damage to the everyday lives of the people  of Syria.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Dean), who is a new member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. We  all look forward to working together with the gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Again, I thank Congressman Joe Wilson, the chair of the House Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia  for his work on this resolution.   It is important to recognize that the U.S. is joining the whole  international community, again, at a time of need. It is in our self- interest to move in this respect, too. There are countless aftereffects  as well as aftershocks that will come about as a result of this  [[Page H890]]  earthquake. We are going to see time and time again swift action and  humanitarian action. Action for support will really come back in a very  cost effective and humanitarian way to provide dividends moving forward  in the future.   That being said, too, our NATO ally, Turkiye, is suffering a great  deal. We want to demonstrate not just through NATO and other alliances  that we are there for the Turkish people as well who have often come to  our aid in areas of critical security needs.   The people of Turkiye and Syria have suffered tremendously as a  result of these earthquakes and thousands of the aftershocks.   I support this resolution to signal globally that the United States  stands with the people of Turkiye and Syria and the United States will  continue to support any and all humanitarian efforts to bring aid and  assistance to the victims of these disasters. I hope, Mr. Speaker, that  all our colleagues join together in this bipartisan effort to support  this important resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
