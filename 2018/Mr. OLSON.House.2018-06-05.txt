 Mr. Speaker, I know the people watching back home can't  see my tie, but this tie is a tribute to great Mexican food. It has  tortilla chips, a bowl of queso, and jalapenos.   Why do I have on this special tie? It is a tribute to a Fort Bend  icon: Lopez Mexican Restaurant. The husband and wife to my left,  Rodrigo and Bertha, started Lopez in 1979. They were joined by their  kids: Jonathan, Jose, and Ana.   Lopez was always full. We prayed a new one would open. Those prayers  were answered last month. The second Lopez opened next to another  Houston icon: Mattress Mack.   For 40 years, the Lopez family has had one solemn promise: Every day,  and for generations to come, the restaurant will focus on service,  value, and cleanliness to ensure the guest always leaves satisfied.   Those promises have been kept.   ``Welcome to your new home,'' ``bienvenidos a su casa nueva.''                            ____________________
