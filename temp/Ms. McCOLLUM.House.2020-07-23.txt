 Mr. Speaker, the Interior and Environment division of  this bill makes many critical investments in protecting our natural  resources and contains several provisions designated to stop the Trump  administration from moving forward on disastrous environmental  policies.   This bill puts a halt on the use of funds in the next fiscal year to  review approved mine plans within the watershed in the Nation's most  visited wilderness, the Boundary Waters Canoe Area.   This provision does not--does not--impact the operations of current  mines that already have their plans approved and are operating. There  is no iron ore mine plan under review within the watershed or anywhere  in the Superior National Forest.   Sulfide-ore mines are toxic. They produce acid mine drainage, which  includes heavy metals like lead and cadmium. This poses a significant  risk to surface waters and ground waters.   The Trump administration cannot be trusted to conduct an  environmental review of sulfide-ore mining that could devastate this  wilderness. They have already shown a lack of transparency and a  willingness not to be guided by science.   Multiple Cabinet members have pledged to members of the  Appropriations Committee in congressional hearings that they would  complete a mineral withdrawal study within this very watershed.  Instead, they abandoned this review 20 months into a 24-month plan, and  they have refused to release any of the information.   Mr. Speaker, I would submit the report that they did finally show me,  but I have no idea how the good people who work at this front desk  could put in 60 pages of redacted material, 60 blank pages of a  taxpayer-funded report.   This is a 1-year halt on a mine plan in a wilderness area from an  administration that has shown a total lack of transparency and respect  for science.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the fiscal year 2021  Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Thank  you to my partner in this, Ranking Member Joyce, for his collaboration  and partnership throughout this process. I am grateful for the  leadership of Chairwoman Lowey and Ranking Member Granger.   Last year, House Democrats secured significant new investments in  environmental protection and land conservation. This bill builds on  those successes to advance priorities of American families, ensuring  that we have clean air and clean water to protect our children's  health. We protect our most special places and endangered species and  take meaningful actions to address climate change.   The subcommittee recommends a total of $36.8 billion in discretionary  funding, an increase of $771 million over last year's enacted level.  [[Page H3794]]    The bill also includes $2.4 billion in fire cap adjusted funds for  suppression operations.   The bill includes an additional $15 billion in emergency-designated  infrastructure investments. These investments will increase access to  quality healthcare and education and help clean up contaminated lands,  polluted water, and unhealthy air.   With yesterday's passage of the Great American Outdoors Act in fiscal  year 2021, the Land and Water Conservation Fund will be fully funded at  $900 million, the first time this has happened in over 40 years.   I thank all of our constituents for making this passage a reality.   Back to this bill. We reject the dangerous policies and funding cuts  proposed by the Trump administration. Instead, we move forward by  investing our resources in ways that keep our communities safe and  healthy. We invest in protection and preservation of our landscapes and  our biodiversity.   I am particularly proud that this bill includes protections for our  Nation's most visited wilderness, the Boundary Waters. It will put a  halt to the use of funds in the next fiscal year to review or approve  mine plans in the watershed of this treasured wilderness.    But let me be clear: The operations of the current taconite mines of  Minnesota's iron ore range are not impacted. There are no iron mines  with plans under review. But there is a foreign-owned mining  conglomerate with a plan under review for a toxic copper-sulfide ore  mine on the doorstep of the Boundary Waters. The Trump administration  cannot be trusted to conduct this environmental review.   Multiple Cabinet members pledged in congressional hearings to  complete a mineral withdrawal study within this very watershed.  Instead, they abandoned the congressionally directed environmental  review after 20 months, 4 months from completion, and they refuse to  release results.   This bill seeks to protect the Boundary Waters from an administration  that has shown a lack of transparency, respect for science, or the  ability to follow our Nation's environmental laws.   Our subcommittee continues its nonpartisan approach to issues facing  our Native American brothers and sisters. We provide $3.5 billion for  the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education, and the  Office of the Special Trustee for American Indians, and $6.5 billion to  the Indian Health Service. This is another step in the right direction  toward upholding the Federal Government's trust and treaty obligations,  but the work continues.   The bill contains provisions related to ending the use of Confederate  symbols on our public lands. Confederate flags and memorials have long  been symbols of oppression and discrimination, and I am committed to  doing everything we can to help this country confront and heal its  legacy of racism. This is not about erasing our history, but it is  about whether we are willing to do the hard work that is needed to  confront the truth of our history and to work to right past wrongs.   This is a good bill that works to tell the history of our country,  even though sometimes it is painful to do so. It is a good bill that  strives to use our natural resources wisely to protect our air, our  water, and our land and to clean up those places that have been  polluted in the past. This bill embraces conservation and the judicial  use of our public lands, and yes, at times, it seeks to showcase the  beauty of our natural resources that have been given to us by our  creator.   This is a good bill, and I encourage Members of this House to support  it.   I want to thank staff on both sides of the aisle for their hard work,  including Rita, Jocelyn, Kusai, Janet, Peter, Donna, Tyler, Kristen,  Darren, and Rebecca Taylor on my personal staff.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill.    Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Speaker, this amendment indiscriminately cuts  programs in this bill, not giving one bit of thought to the merit of  the program within the bill that it would cut.   For instance, it would cut--well, it would cut the Indian Health  Service, and that would mean fewer patients seen, especially during the  COVID pandemic, which we know has affected the Native American  population in a very dramatic, painful, and hurtful way.   It would mean fewer safety inspectors, ensuring that accidents and  oil spills do not occur, which means endangering the lives of oil rig  workers and our environment.   It would worsen our Nation's drinking water and sanitation  infrastructure deferred maintenance problem, which means more children  would be exposed to lead in their drinking water.   More generally, investments in our environmental infrastructure and  our public lands would be halted, and the associated jobs would be  lost, jobs Americans desperately need.   More importantly, this amendment, as I said, would contribute to  lives being lost in Indian Country. And I do not say that lightly,  Madam Speaker. Tribes are being particularly hard-hit by the  coronavirus, and this amendment would only compound the problem.   And let me tell you a little more about what critical programs would  be cut in Indian Country. It would mean cuts to basic healthcare and  diabetes programs. It would mean cuts to child and maternal health. As  we know, our Native brothers and sisters--my Native sisters in  particular, suffer high infant mortality rates. It would mean cuts to  mental health service at a time when this population in our country,  the indigenous people, who were here first, would be suffering even  more than they are today with the mental health crisis, as they cannot  go to their customs and traditions when mourning the loss of lives  because of not being able to gather.   It has been a nonpartisan goal of the Committee on Appropriations--a  nonpartisan goal of this entire body--to work to improve the health  status of our Native American brothers and sisters. This amendment guts  those efforts. It will set Indiana Country back. I dare say, it could  set Indian Country back by decades, because we have so much more work  to do to address the health disparity.   This amendment would not encourage agencies to do more with less. It  would simply force agencies, and especially those serving our Native  American Nations, to do less for their Tribal members, less healthcare.   So I urge Members to strongly oppose this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, once again, this is an across-the-board indiscriminate  cut. We all might agree that there are programs and activities that  take place in these bills that we could see a cut with. But this is an  across-the-board 5 percent cut, which will deeply, deeply affect the  gains that we have been struggling to make in a nonpartisan way in  Indian Country, and I simply cannot be silent while that happens.   We have to do what we can do to make sure that the treaty and  obligations that this United States Government entered into with the  First Nations, who were here first, are honored, and part of that is  healthcare.   Madam Speaker, I ask others to join me to oppose this amendment,  which if passed, will harm the American people and do, in my opinion,  irreparable damage to the healthcare and education of our Native  American brothers and sisters.   I oppose this amendment. I encourage my colleagues to join me.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Madam Speaker, for 4 years in a row, President Trump  has set up a truly--well, he sent us a budget that is just not workable  when it comes to his budget request.   On a bipartisan amendment, especially when it comes to the EPA, we  have passed budgets at the end and sent them over to the EPA with more  money than the President has requested. And why? Because we know we  have to fight to have clean air, clean water. We need to have good  scientists. We need to have researchers. We need to have people out  doing inspections. We need to have our Environmental Protection Agency  working.   As I pointed out, the Congress has overwhelmingly rejected these  requests for the President's cuts to the EPA. I predict we are going to  see that happen again, for a fourth year in a row. That is because the  EPA's environmental programs and management account does vital work,  really important work protecting our air and drinking water, restoring  our waterways, and safeguarding us from toxic chemicals.   It has been reported worldwide, because of COVID, we all know people  are driving less. We know that our factories, unfortunately, aren't  running the way they should be, and a lot of people are out of work.  So, yes, the air quality has improved because of the President's  mishandling of the COVID emergency that we are facing. But we don't  want to go back to those pollution levels. We want to work together in  a bipartisan way.   Another thing that the gentleman cuts are the geographic programs  hugely popular in this Congress, and here, they are overwhelmingly  supported bipartisanly--program work like the Great Lakes, Chesapeake  Bay, Puget Sound, Long Island Sound, and the Florida estuaries. These  programs would be devastated if we adopted the President's budget.   Members on both sides of the aisle asked for robust funding in these  accounts. Rural communities that rely upon technical assistance grants  in this account, we help them to make sure that they can afford safe  drinking water for their constituents and that they can safely manage  their sewer and wastewater systems. We worked together to help rural  communities.   Consumers rely on the EPA's ENERGY STAR program to help them choose  energy-efficient appliances, which save them money and help the  environment. Madam Speaker, I can speak from personal experience,  having sold appliances for many years, how important that ENERGY STAR  was to someone when they were making a decision because they wanted to  save money on their electric bill.   Well, the Trump budget, the way it was presented to our subcommittee,  would have slashed all these programs and much more, and the impacts to  public health would be devastating.   The American people overwhelmingly agree that we should be investing  more to protect our families from pollution, not less.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am glad the gentleman brought up the  $15 billion in the EPA's emergency spending budget.    It is for wastewater treatment. That is for clean drinking water.  That is for infrastructure. That is for jobs. That is so the next  generation inherits clean water and a sewage waste disposal system that  they don't find crumbling all around them because of neglect and  because we have not lived up to our obligation to take care of those  infrastructure investments.   For 50 years, the EPA has been responsible for protecting health and  the environment, and they have been doing a job in cleaning up the  environment, as I mentioned with the restoration programs. The  Chesapeake Bay, it is amazing what has happened, the Great Lakes.   Congressman Joyce and I are constantly working with other Great Lakes  representatives, Republicans, Democrats, and Independents, who ask us  to do even more in investing.   These Trump administration budget cuts that the gentleman would have  us return to would cripple the EPA's ability to accomplish those  missions. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Speaker, as I said on the other amendment, for 4  years in a row, President Trump has sent us truly appalling budget  request numbers for the EPA, and the Congress has overwhelmingly  rejected these requests on a bipartisan basis. As I said, I predict we  will do that again for the fourth year in a row.   The EPA's science and technology account does vital research on  health effects of toxic chemicals and pollutants. Now, the Trump  administration, by not doing this research and by not moving forward,  protects corporate polluters' profits, not the health and safety of the  American people. That is why, in my opinion, the administration's  budget proposes to cut hundreds of millions of dollars for funding  research on things like PFAS.   Now, in my constituency, I have several major municipalities that can  no longer just take the water out of the ground the way that they had  before, send it to the homeowners, and they could turn on their tap and  safely drink it. No, it has to be filtered for PFAS. We need research.  We need standards on it.   Lead. How many discussions have we had on this House floor? How many  parents have we heard from? How many children have we heard from about  the effects of lead in water?   Mercury. I am from Minnesota. We have fish advisories because of  mercury. Pregnant women have to be careful how much fish they consume.  We have postings when we go to our lakes about how much fish we can  consume. Mercury is a concern to many of us.   And climate change. I am not afraid to talk about climate change. I  was just on the phone with the Secretary of the Air Force, and we were  talking about what we are going to have to spend in Alaska. You know,  the permafrost is causing issues with radar installations not being  stable--climate change. The permafrost, which is disappearing, is  affecting the ability for runways and safe landings. Climate change.   So, do we need to do the research on climate change? It is a national  security issue. I am glad the EPA is out there looking at it, working  with other agencies within the United States.   People across this country overwhelmingly agree we should be  investing more research in PFAS. We should be getting the lead out of  our water. We should be understanding what is going on with mercury. We  should also be addressing the effects of climate change and, most of  all, protecting our families from pollution.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. Madam Speaker, I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I will read from the National  Geographic, published April 8, 2020:   ``As the novel coronavirus tears around the world, it's exploiting  our biggest weaknesses, from creaking health care systems to extreme  social inequality. Its relationship with one pervasive and neglected  problem, however, has been more tangled: Air pollution has intensified  the pandemic. . . .''   So we need to do studies on that, and the EPA works on that, but at  the same time, the coronavirus has temporarily cleaned the skies.   As I said earlier, for 50 years, the EPA has been responsible for  protecting public health and the environment.   We need to do research to understand how to protect public health and  the environment; and more importantly than ever, we need to understand  how to protect public health and the environment for people who have  long been neglected, the people who are suffering the most right now,  and that is the inequality, the injustice we are seeing between Black  and Brown people in the United States.   We need to do better with the EPA for addressing social injustices  that have affected those populations most by living in polluted areas  and being subjected to pollution. I want to work on that in Congress.  The administration's cuts would cripple the EPA's ability to achieve  that mission.   Madam Speaker, if I understand correctly, the gentleman has yielded  his time.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I was on my way out and I saw the  beautiful white flowers that are sitting on my side of the aisle  celebrating the life of John Lewis.   Last night, I had the radio on and I was listening to C-SPAN, and I  heard the wonderful, wonderful stories on both sides of the aisle of  people celebrating John's life and what he meant to them.   As I was preparing for this bill and working on this bill, working on  the inequalities of years of systemic racism and how it has infected  the environment made me even want to champion this bill that was before  us today even more, as a remembrance of all the work that needs to be  done.   As people were sharing their stories of John, what came to mind for  me was talking about gardening. He loved to garden and he had a few  plants, and we would talk about them.   He loved to fish, and the one thing I would always tease him about,  Mr. Speaker, is going to Minnesota and going ice fishing.   Well, John, that is going to have to wait, but I look forward to  seeing you again in the heavens, and we will go ice fishing.                            ____________________
