 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I don't know what it is like in Alaska,  Wyoming, or Tennessee these days, but a lot of times, when I am going  home or back and forth, people are saying to me: I wouldn't want your  job for all the tea in China.   I say: Well, I actually feel lucky to do this job. They ask: What do  you like about it? I say: I like helping people. They say: Really? And  they ask for examples.   Today is a good example. One of the best ways to help people is to  make sure they have a job. There are a lot of different ways we provide  that nurturing environment for job creation and preservation, and one  of those ways is in the area of infrastructure. Sometimes an overlooked  part of our infrastructure is the one we address directly in the Water  Resources Development Act before us today.   Our water infrastructure is actually the forgotten leg on the  infrastructure stool. We rightly worry about the infrastructure we can  see: our bridges, highways, airports, and railroads, but our Nation's  water infrastructure: our pipes, shipping channels, flood control  structures, and the infrastructure we don't see, as we have learned, is  in desperate need of investment.   Our Nation's drinking water systems, dams, reservoirs, levees,  shipping lanes, and ports support and promote economic growth and job  creation. These systems provide water for everything from families to  agriculture to small businesses. This is infrastructure that Americans  rely on every day, and it keeps our economy moving.    America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, the legislation that we  will soon be voting on, makes water a priority from coast to coast. As  my good friend, the chairman of our committee, John Barrasso, has said,  America needs comprehensive water infrastructure legislation that will  create jobs, keep communities safe, and make the Army Corps of  Engineers and the EPA more accessible to stakeholders.   The legislation before the Senate today has received endorsement from  industry, from environmental protection groups, and from everything in  between. The U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities,  and the National Association of Counties say that this bill drives  investment in navigation, flood protection, and ecosystem restoration  in communities and that it protects public health and safety and our  natural resources. It is critical in helping our communities to build,  maintain, and improve this critical infrastructure while growing our  national and local economies.  [[Page S6746]]    I am here to applaud and thank, once again, our chairman, our staffs,  and everyone who has worked on this from Alaska to Wyoming.
