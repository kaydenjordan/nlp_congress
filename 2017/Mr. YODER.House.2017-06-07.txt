 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand shoulder to shoulder  with our friends and allies in Great Britain, who have suffered three  horrific terror attacks in a period of less than 3 months.   These attacks at the hands of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria are  barbaric, evil, and must be condemned by the entire world. These  cowards have used vehicles, knives, and bombs to rein terror down on  London and Manchester, even targeting innocent young girls at a concert  hall.   Radical Islamic extremism is a vile ideology that must be stamped out  at every corner of the world. This is a time for unity of purpose and  strong leadership.   The United States, our NATO allies, and our allies in the Middle East  must chart a unified course towards complete destruction of ISIS. As we  begin to succeed in the fight, their resolve to attack us will only  grow stronger, but we cannot be deterred.   Mr. Speaker, freedom and liberty must win over hatred and extremism.  We must defeat this enemy, and this Congress stands ready to support  this administration in its efforts to do so.                            ____________________
