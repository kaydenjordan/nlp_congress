 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Meeks and  Chairman McCaul for their leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1684. This timely piece of  legislation, which I cosponsored, calls attention to the unprecedented  humanitarian and security crisis unfolding just miles from our shores  in Haiti.   Despite reports that sexual violence, kidnappings, displacement, and  indiscriminate killings have swept the country, the international  community has in many ways left Haitians to fend for themselves again,  as usual.   The last thing we should do is write off Haiti's struggles as  hopeless and insurmountable. The Haitian people have a long history of  resilience and grit in the face of relentless man-made and natural  disasters. After all, this is a  [[Page H3910]]  country born out of the fight for dignity and human rights against  colonialism, systemic racism, and slavery.   Haitians are a people who have confronted every unthinkable obstacle  that has come their way, and they have persevered against the odds.   We must continue to support the Haitian people with concerted  international action and intentional policies like this bill.   I am glad that this bill takes a strong step in holding accountable  the economic and political elites who are perpetuating and benefiting  from the country's chronic insecurity.   I know there are Members on both sides of the aisle who are deeply  invested in Haiti's future and represent Haitian constituents. I worked  with some of them to introduce a resolution calling for a redoubling of  diplomatic efforts to help achieve a solution to the current impasse.   There is more we can do, and there is more we must do in a strong  bipartisan way.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues not to turn a blind eye to Haiti,  not to forget the Haitian people, and to support this important  legislation. Haiti is our neighbor. Haiti deserves more.
