 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Rutherford), who is my good friend and a wonderful leader in the Law  Enforcement Caucus in the House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for his  promotion of his constituents and their success in exporting and for  his recognizing the importance of small business to the House of  Representatives.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Kiley). My  friend is from one of the most beautiful congressional districts in  America, the Sierra Nevada.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments and for  promoting this good work in his district, and I thank him for his  public service.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss an important piece of  legislation that I am working on here in the people's House.   The Ouachita Mountains inside the Ouachita National Forest stretches  some 220 miles from my district in central Arkansas to eastern  Oklahoma.   For 50 years now, I have sought refuge and pleasure in visiting a  remarkable corner of the rugged Arkansas Ouachita National Forest  mountains called Flatside. It is named for a sandstone outcrop that  dominates the forest below.   Mr. Speaker, you can see in this photo on one very cold February day  with a blanket of snow on the ground that I was looking west from the  top of Flatside toward another high point in the wilderness area called  Forked Mountain.   My guide that day was my good friend of now 50 years and longtime  neighbor in Little Rock, Don Hamilton.   Don is a longtime member of the Ozark Society, a former board member  for the National Wildlife Federation, and a tireless advocate for  wilderness areas in our Nation.                                time  1215    At the time of this photo, I was a Senate staffer, and Don was urging  me to persuade my then boss, U.S. Senator John Tower, a Republican from  Texas, to cosponsor Democrat Arkansas Senator Dale Bumpers' Arkansas  Wilderness Act.   This act would establish the 10,000 acres of public U.S. forestland  around Flatside as one of nine new wilderness areas and the only one in  the Second Congressional District.   With Senator Tower's endorsements and the tireless work by Senator  Bumpers and my Second District predecessor, Republican Congressman Ed  Bethune, Flatside did, in fact, join the U.S. Forest Service wilderness  rolls in 1984 when it was signed into law by President Reagan.   At that time, the Flatside area was anticipated to be larger,  encompassing the additional U.S. Forest Service lands that I am  addressing on the House floor today in my new legislation.   Over the ensuing years, the Forest Service and advocates were never  able to craft a strategy whereby those acres left out of the 1984  designation could be included.   When I joined Congress in 2015, I set about to design an approach  that would expand Flatside to its originally contemplated size.   First, I introduced the Flatside Wilderness Enhancement Act, which  passed in both the House and Senate in 2018 and was then signed into  law by President Trump in January of 2019.   This bill added what I called the Bethune Woods acreage to Flatside.  [[Page H3135]]  Thanks to Congressman Bethune for his years of hard work on this area.   This 640-acre addition had been coded by the U.S. Forest Service as  wilderness and managed that way but had never been formally added to  the boundaries of Flatside.   As a companion measure, Senator John Boozman of Arkansas and I  included in the fiscal year 2019 appropriations bill a provision  whereby the Forest Service would complete a careful and thorough study  of the other Federal forest lands around Flatside that might well meet  the 1964 Wilderness Act definition and be eligible for inclusion.   In May of 2021, Flatside's wilderness evaluation was completed by the  Forest Service. They thoroughly examined all the areas in question and  outlined the ones that they believed would qualify as wilderness if so  designated by this House, by our Congress.   Thus, Mr. Speaker, here we are, 40 years later, discussing my bill,  H.R. 3971, the Flatside Wilderness Additions Act. This act implements  the careful U.S. Forest Service study that was completed back in May of  2021.   Further, I collaborated on the design of the measure with my  colleague, the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, Chair  Bruce Westerman and his staff.   This bill admits 2,200 existing qualifying public U.S. Forest Service  acres to the existing wilderness area. Land that qualifies for  wilderness designation in accordance with the May 2021 study and is  currently already managed as potential wilderness by the Ouachita  National Forest Management Plan.   This measure is supported by our Arkansas Governor, Sarah Sanders,  our parks and tourism leadership, our game and fish commission, our  local officials in the nearby counties, and our outdoor recreation  leaders, including The Ozark Society who was so instrumental in the  1994 work.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and complete the  good work started by my predecessor so long ago, Congressman Ed  Bethune, and initiated by President Reagan, signing the Arkansas  Wilderness Act of 1984 into law.   Today, we take this final step to complete Flatside Wilderness'  original footprint and offer the wild beauty of The Natural State for  generations to come.   For me, Flatside has provided five decades of peace that was promised  in John Muir's great poem that goes like this:       Climb the mountains and get their good tidings, nature's             peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees.             The winds will blow their own freshness into you and             the storms their energy, while cares will drop off like             autumn leaves.                Honoring the Life of Ambassador C. Boyden Gray     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute the life of a dear  friend and a remarkable public servant, Ambassador Boyden Gray. Boyden  died on May 21, 2023, at the age of 80.   There was no finer gentleman, father, companion, or principled  conservative advocate than the Honorable C. Boyden Gray.   In his remembrance of Ambassador Gray at a June 7 service at Christ  Church, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas described Boyden as calm  and courageous, warm and humorous.   It was my great pleasure to serve on the White House staff of  President George H.W. Bush and witness Boyden's humor, courage, and  principled leadership on a regular basis.   President Bush was fortunate to have Boyden Gray as his White House  counsel, his friend, and also his counsel during his years as Vice  President during the Reagan administration.   Boyden was instrumental in advising the President on appointments and  on landmark legislation such as the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990  and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Gray went on to continue his  public service as our U.S. Ambassador to the European Union from 2006  to 2007.   Boyden was also a long-time attorney and conservative constitutional  advocate in private practice in Washington, D.C.   In his touching eulogy, Justice Thomas quoted Boyden's frequent  statement that his daughter, Eliza, was ``the best thing I have ever  done.''   That was in full evidence as Eliza gave a beautiful tribute to her  dad. Her dedication and love and his for her was in full evidence.    Martha and I send our hugs to Eliza, her husband Nick, and their  children Jane and Wyatt.   The world is a less interesting place with the loss of our friend,  Boyden Gray. I have no doubt that he is suggesting many structural  regulatory reforms in Heaven as we speak.   Recognizing North Little Rock High School's Victory in the Capitol Hill                                 Challenge     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight an incredible  achievement from the high school students at North Little Rock High  School who finished in first place in the SIFMA Foundation's 20th  Annual Capitol Hill Challenge.   This is the security industry's nationwide contest. We used to call  it the stock market game many years ago.   Thousands of teams from all 50 States compete in this 4-month  financial education program where student teams invest a hypothetical  $100,000 and learn the value and function of our capital markets and  investing fundamentals through an integrated, comprehensive curriculum.   Additionally, these students learn how to think critically and  collaborate with their peers which, in turn, improves their own  personal decisionmaking and financial literacy.   The Capitol Hill Challenge allows for thousands of students across  the country, particularly at underprivileged schools, to have access to  exceptional financial educational programming and for those who might  not even have had an opportunity to learn these important skills.   These students, as well as others whose schools finish in the top 10,  recently traveled to Washington, D.C., and got to meet with their  Congressmen and their Senators.   I congratulate the hardworking students at North Little Rock High  School for this great achievement of being tops in financial literacy  and in this contest.                       Recognizing Colonel Angela Ochoa     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Colonel Angela Ochoa  for her distinguished service as the 19th Airlift Wing Commander at  Little Rock Air Force Base.   Colonel Ochoa was commissioned in 2001, and throughout her career has  flown in Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Resolute  Support, Operation Freedom's Sentinel, and Volant Shogun.   Colonel Ochoa has spent the last 2 years dedicated to the C-130  airlift community, ensuring that the 19th Wing is mission ready for  global support.   Through her efforts, she has left a positive impact on more than  10,000 personnel and families that travel in and out of Little Rock Air  Force Base every day.   In addition to her focus on combat readiness of the force, Colonel  Ochoa continued to vitalize and support the central Arkansas community  through the introduction of the Department of Defense's STARBASE  program, which provides STEM-focused education opportunities for  children in the area. She has also made immeasurable contributions to  our community through the Honorary Commander Program.   I wish Colonel Ochoa continued success as she comes here to metro  Washington, D.C., and takes command of the 89th Airlift Wing at Joint  Base Andrews.                        Happy 187th Birthday, Arkansas     Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge that this month, June,  our great State of Arkansas celebrates 187 years of statehood.   Arkansas' rich history has shaped the vibrant and growing communities  across our State today. I am especially grateful for the opportunity to  stand before you and celebrate its heritage, progress, and the  possibilities ahead for our citizens.   Arkansas' heritage is evident across our State in museums and  historic sites but also in the individual stories of people across our  State, their own stories, their own generations of calling Arkansas  home.   Throughout our history, Arkansas has consistently lived up to its  nickname, The Natural State. Families across our country visit our  State parks, our historic sites, and other great outdoor recreational  experiences from the Ozark Mountains to the Mississippi Delta.  [[Page H3136]]    Besides the outdoors, Arkansans of all ages take advantage of  opportunities in our State from art to sports to business and  technology.   I am proud to support business investment in Arkansas and our young  people as they learn more about what it means to call Arkansas home.   For all these reasons and more, I am confident that Arkansas has a  bright future ahead. Today, and every day, I am proud to represent the  many central Arkansans that make our State great. Happy Birthday,  Arkansas.   Congratulating Susan Ramsey, Ag in the Classroom Outstanding Teacher of                                  the Year     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Susan Ramsey, the  recipient of the Ag in the Classroom Outstanding Teacher of the Year  award from the Arkansas Farm Bureau.   Ms. Ramsey teaches language arts in Pangburn, and she leads a garden  class on Fridays for third and fourth graders, providing them new and  engaging experiences in and around our food system and agriculture.   Pangburn High School's agriculture teacher Brian Harris, who  nominated Ms. Ramsey for the award, praised her garden program because  it provides students these important experiences at such a good, young  age.   Ms. Ramsey has undeniably made a positive impact on her students,  providing them the tools they need for future success. Programs like  these benefit students and their families across our State.   This recognition is well-deserved, and as our State's nominee, she  will represent Arkansas well at the National Ag in the Classroom  Conference coming up. Thank you, Ms. Ramsey, for your dedication to  your students.                      Congratulating Dr. Gary B. Arnold     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my friend, Dr.  Gary B. Arnold, for his outstanding work as Head of School at Little  Rock Christian Academy. After 16 years at Little Rock Christian, Dr.  Arnold's legacy will not be forgotten.    From expanding the campus, building modern athletic facilities, and  improving the art and science programs, Dr. Arnold improved student  life immensely over his tenure.   Not only did Dr. Arnold lead his students, but he was a mentor to  many other heads of school across the Nation.   Dr. Arnold held many positions of leadership for national  organizations, promoting high standards and the growth of independent  Christian education.   Through his devotion to spreading the faith and serving in the name  of Jesus, Dr. Arnold's leadership creates a long-lasting, positive  impact.   I congratulate Dr. Arnold on his amazing work at Little Rock  Christian and look forward to his continued leadership across our great  country.                         Congratulating Allie Thomas     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Allie Thomas on  representing Arkansas in the 2023 National History Day competition.   National History Day is a high school competition whereby students  can present historical research projects through websites,  endorsements, or even performances.   Each year, nearly a half million students across our great country  participate in National History Day. The topic for this year's  competition was Frontiers in History: People, Places, Ideas. The  students' topics ranged from the history of science to politics and the  military.   Allie was one of only 3,000 students selected to participate in the  National History Day competition at the University of Maryland just  this past week.   To advance to the National Competition, Allie's project was named a  top-two project in her category and division.   I am so proud of Allie and her hard work. And we are honored she  represented our great State of Arkansas.                                time  1230                   Recognizing Arkansas Children's Hospital     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Arkansas Children's  Hospital for being featured in the most recent U.S. News & World  Report's list of best children's hospitals.   Arkansas Children's Hospital received a top 50 ranking in seven  medical specialties for pediatric hospitals across the United States  and was also ranked in the top 10 pediatric hospitals for the southeast  region.   This recognition is well deserved. Arkansas Children's provides  critical and incredibly valuable services to our children and their  families across our State and the surrounding region.   This kind of comprehensive care is necessary so that kids and their  families in our State can reach their full potential and have access to  the absolute best care possible for every kind of complication that  life can bring.   Providing these important services at such a high caliber requires a  committed and talented team. The staff at Arkansas Children's Hospital  certainly reflects these values.   As a former hospital director there and now a Member of Congress, I  am always proud to highlight their quality pediatric care in our State  and glad that the exceptional performance of Arkansas Children's  Hospital is being recognized at a national level.                          Congratulating Jimmy Moses     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Jimmy Moses, who  was recently honored for his work in downtown Little Rock for Little  Rock's successful growth, redevelopment, and preservation over his many  decades of leadership.   Mr. Moses was featured in Block, Street, & Building magazine as a  true difference maker, and I can certainly assure you, Mr. Speaker,  that is understated.   His family has exemplified values that made our State great for  generations. They have not only benefited from their deep roots in  Little Rock, but they have used those talents and love for the area to  give back. Jimmy Moses is absolutely continuing that longtime Moses  family tradition.   Mr. Moses has worked in urban development and planning for years. He  has worked on projects to restore historic buildings and facilitate  creative development as our vital central business district of Little  Rock has grown and changed over the past 40 years.   Mr. Moses also serves as one of the founders of Moses Tucker  Partners, a prominent real estate development firm in Little Rock.   His background, skills, and passion demonstrate why he is so  deserving of this important recognition. I am proud to recognize him as  a visionary that has been so clearly dedicated to making our hometown a  better place.                   Celebrating Earl Smith's 100th Birthday     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Earl  Smith, who celebrated his 100th birthday on June 10.   Mr. Smith, an Arkansas native, is a World War II veteran. Drafted at  19, he served in the Army and the Army Chemical Corps.   He was also part of the Rhineland campaign and the northern France  campaign and was awarded two Bronze Stars and a good conduct medal.   Earl was married to his wife, Eloise, for 57 years. Together, they  had two children, four grandchildren, eight great-grandchildren, and  one great-great-grandchild.   Earl is still an active member of the community. He makes sure to  attend all of his grandchildren's events and holds the longest  membership in Lifeline Baptist Church. Earl also is the oldest member  of the Little Rock VFW Post 9095.   When asked about this remarkable birthday, he said: ``I had no idea I  would live this long, but every morning when I wake up, I thank the  good Lord for another day.''   I thank Mr. Earl Smith for his service to our beloved Nation and  congratulate him for his 100th birthday.                            Honoring Dave Peresko     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  Dave Peresko.   Mr. Peresko is a longtime veteran who served our Nation in the  Vietnam war.   Continuing his service to our country, Mr. Peresko began working for  the U.S. Postal Service in Little Rock in 1973. During that work, Mr.  Peresko was no stranger to any of our community members. His lively and  kind spirit spread throughout our community, leaving a positive impact  on everyone he came across.   Completing over 45 years of service with the post office, Mr. Peresko  retired from the post office just a few years ago in 2019.   This very committed Kansas City Chiefs superfan brightened the city  of  [[Page H3137]]  Little Rock every day in the way he touched people and cared for them  in his public service.   We salute Dave in his retirement.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
