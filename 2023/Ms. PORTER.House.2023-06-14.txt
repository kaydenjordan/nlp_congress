 Madam Speaker, beware when Washington says it is getting  fiscally responsible. Too often that is code for cutting programs that  families rely on while throwing more money at defense contractors.   This year, my Republican colleagues want most government programs to  tighten their belts while defense spending increases without  accountability. Nowhere is this more evident than the F-35 program.   The Department of Defense expects to spend $1.7 trillion over the  life of the F-35 program, including the countless spare parts  contractors are losing. In fact, since May 2018, under the watch of  just one company, over 1 million parts have been lost, damaged, or  destroyed.   I came to Washington to protect taxpayer dollars, not flush them into  the Pentagon's black hole. As Congress considers the National Defense  Authorization Act, I encourage my colleagues to join me in cracking  down on waste, fraud, and abuse.                Orange County Eviction Diversion Collaborative     Madam Speaker, higher inflation and housing costs harm us  all, especially our most vulnerable neighbors who are on the brink of  losing their homes. Low-income families are struggling to make do,  falling behind on rent, and unable to find affordable housing.   One unexpected medical emergency or job layoff can be all it takes to  doom a family into eviction. Evictions are not momentary  inconveniences. They are long-term setbacks that make it harder to find  a new home, driving families deeper into poverty. Single moms and women  of color are disproportionately at risk of being evicted. Seventy-eight  percent of Orange County households that are behind on rent are headed  by females.   Thankfully, the Orange County Eviction Diversion Collaborative is  stepping in to help. By advocating for rental assistance and landlord  mediation services, they are saving tenants and families from the  destabilizing damage of an eviction. As a single mom myself, I am  grateful Orange County is looking out for women and children. Our  community is stronger, healthier, and safer when we take care of one  another.               Silicon Valley Bank Community Benefits Agreement     Madam Speaker, when banks make promises to the public, we  should expect that they are upheld. Disappointingly, First Citizens  Bank is falling short of this standard.   After purchasing Silicon Valley Bank's assets at a whopping $16.5  billion discount, First Citizens has been silent on whether it will  uphold Silicon Valley Bank's promise to invest $9 billion in  California's low-income communities. This investment promised to expand  affordable housing, small business loans, and other needed services in  underserved areas.   I led 15 of my California colleagues in a letter last month calling  on First Citizens Bank to honor this commitment. They have not  responded.   It is an injustice that communities of color and low-income  households stand to lose out more from First Citizens' purchase than  all of Silicon Valley Bank's billionaire depositors.   First Citizens has a responsibility to make sure that neighborhoods  with the least financial resources are not left behind.

All 29 Orange County school districts could use this funding to hire  additional staff, enhance training and development, and develop new  respite spaces for children in K-12 schools. This funding comes at such  a crucial time.   Children's mental health has declined since the start of the  pandemic. In California, young people between the ages of 14 and 18 are  suffering the most. CalOptima Health and the Student Behavioral Health  Incentive Program are doing important work by partnering with Hazel  Health, Children's Hospital of Orange County, and Western Youth  Services to improve behavioral health among our students.   Mental health care is healthcare, and I applaud Orange County for  prioritizing the health and well-being of our children.                            ____________________
