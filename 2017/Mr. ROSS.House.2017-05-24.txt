 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1293) to amend title 5, United States Code, to require that the  Office of Personnel Management submit an annual report to Congress  relating to the use of official time by Federal employees, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1293         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REPORTING REQUIREMENT.         (a) In General.--Section 7131 of title 5, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(e)(1)(A) Not later than March 31 of each calendar year,       the Office of Personnel Management, in consultation with the       Office of Management and Budget, shall submit to each House       of Congress a report on the operation of this section during       the fiscal year last ending before the start of such calendar       year.        ``(B) Not later than December 31 of each calendar year,       each agency (as defined by section 7103(a)(3)) shall furnish       to the Office of Personnel Management the information which       such Office requires, with respect to such agency, for       purposes of the report which is next due under subparagraph       (A).        ``(2) Each report by the Office of Personnel Management       under this subsection shall include, with respect to the       fiscal year described in paragraph (1)(A), at least the       following information:        ``(A) The total amount of official time granted to       employees.        ``(B) The average amount of official time expended per       bargaining unit employee.        ``(C) The specific types of activities or purposes for       which official time was granted, and the impact which the       granting of such official time for such activities or       purposes had on agency operations.        ``(D) The total number of employees to whom official time       was granted, and, of that total, the number who were not       engaged in any activities or purposes except activities or       purposes involving the use of official time.        ``(E) The total amount of compensation (including fringe       benefits) afforded to employees in connection with activities       or purposes for which they were granted official time.        ``(F) The total amount of official time spent by employees       representing Federal employees who are not union members in       matters authorized by this chapter.        ``(G) A description of any room or space designated at the       agency (or its subcomponent) where official time activities       will be conducted, including the square footage of any such       room or space.        ``(3) All information included in a report by the Office of       Personnel Management under this subsection with respect to a       fiscal year--        ``(A) shall be shown both agency-by-agency and for all       agencies; and        ``(B) shall be accompanied by the corresponding information       (submitted by the Office in its report under this subsection)       for the fiscal year before the fiscal year to which such       report pertains, together with appropriate comparisons and       analyses.        ``(4) For purposes of this subsection, the term `official       time' means any period of time, regardless of agency       nomenclature--        ``(A) which may be granted to an employee under this       chapter (including a collective bargaining agreement entered       into under this chapter) to perform representational or       consultative functions; and  [[Page H4529]]         ``(B) during which the employee would otherwise be in a       duty status.''.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Ross) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly) each  will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 1293, to amend  title 5 of the United States Code to require the Office of Personnel  Management to submit an annual report to Congress relating to the use  of official time by Federal employees.   Mr. Speaker, I am here today to talk about a bill that would provide  taxpayers with greater transparency of official time. ``Official time''  is that term that describes when Federal employees do union work on the  taxpayers' dime.   The only standard provided by the statute authorizing official time  is that the employees perform union work on official time in a manner  that is ``reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest.''  Currently, Federal law does not require agencies to report, annually,  on the amount of official time their employees perform.   Until March of this year, the Office of Personnel Management had not  reported on official time since fiscal year 2012. When the report was  released in March, the data was out of date, containing information  from fiscal year 2014.   While the Office of Personnel Management may request that agencies  provide data related to official time, OPM does not have any set of  standards or procedures prescribing the collection of official time  data. Considering the burden that official time puts on the taxpayer,  more stringent reporting is necessary.   The latest data provided by OPM shows that taxpayers paid $162  million for salary and benefits related to work done in official time  in fiscal year 2014, up from $157 million 2 years earlier in fiscal  year 2012.   Agencies reported that bargaining unit employees spent a total of 3.5  million hours performing representational activities on official time.   The current lack of stringent reporting requirements, as well as the  broad interpretation of the statute's sole requirement that official  time be carried out in a way that is reasonable, necessary, and in the  public interest, have clearly opened the door to abuse.   The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform identified several  cases where employees on official time engaged in all sorts of  inappropriate activities while on taxpayer-funded time, including  everything from leisure to criminal activities. With greater  transparency, employees will be less likely to abuse the system, which  will result in less waste of taxpayer dollars.   It is by far time we require agencies to provide this information to  Congress and to the public. Taxpayers deserve clear, reliable data on  how many employees are performing union work on official time in lieu  of their regularly assigned government duties.   To accomplish this, H.R. 1293 requires agencies to provide more  detailed information to OPM regarding what their employees are doing  related to official time. Specifically, the bill requires agencies to  report the total amount of official time granted to employees, the  average amount of time each employee spends on official time, the  specific types of activities for which official time was granted, and  the impact official time had on agency operations.   H.R. 1293 requires agencies to report the amount of compensation  employees received in connection with the time they spent on activities  in connection with official time.   Finally, the bill requires agencies to report a description of rooms  and spaces agencies use to conduct official time.   H.R. 1293 will provide taxpayers with the transparency they deserve  when it comes to official time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I might just suggest to my good friend from  Virginia that this is a reporting bill, that this is the same bill, as  amended by their amendment, that was passed out of committee  overwhelmingly, that I believe the gentleman from Virginia voted for.  So there has not been any change. It is still a transparency reporting  bill to make sure that we account for all the time spent in official  time on the taxpayer dime. That is it.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice).   Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Florida for yielding this time.   I agree with this great reporting bill. The American people have a  right to at least have a reasonable expectation that the Federal  Government knows what its employees are doing. Unfortunately, we all  know that doesn't always happen, particularly when it comes to the  practice of official time. It is amazing to me how little information  there is, particularly as it relates to the reporting aspect, as to  what is happening under official time.   For those who don't know what it is, Mr. Ross mentioned it well.  Established under the Carter administration, official time allows  Federal employee union members to conduct union activities during their  work-hours of the agency for which they were hired even if the union  activity has nothing to do with their job description. Surprisingly,  the Federal agencies are not required to report to Congress the amount  of time that employees are spending conducting union business.   Some of my colleagues may disagree about the value of official time.  I get that. The gentleman from Virginia and I see differently on this.  I certainly oppose the abuse of official time, so we see differently on  this.   But I think we can all agree that the American people at least have  the right to know the extent to which official time is being used. So,  although we may disagree somewhat on policy, I think we can certainly  find common ground to promote accountability and transparency within  the Federal Government.   As Mr. Ross mentioned a while ago, the OPM has come out with a study:  3.5 million work-hours spent on official time. That is a lot if it was  just dollars, but when you take 3.5 million work-hours multiplied by  dollars involved, this is a significant issue that needs to be  addressed.   This bill, H.R. 1293, grants the OPM the ability to get necessary  information from Federal agencies so that we have a more comprehensive  understanding of the official time usage. Currently, there are no  standards for OPM to find that kind of information.  [[Page H4530]]    So this bill does not eliminate, nor does it restrict, official time  usage; it simply shines light on the practice. Again, I believe we can  find common ground that the American people deserve to know how their  tax dollars are spent.   This is common sense. It is good governance. It is a bill that I  believe we should all be able to get behind. I am pleased to support  this bill. I am honored and pleased to do so in the House Oversight and  Government Reform Committee. I urge all our colleagues to support it  now.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  want to be clear here, because I want to make sure that we are talking  about the same bill.   This bill doesn't do anything about union dues. This bill doesn't do  anything other than require the transparency of reporting official  time. And I would be delighted to engage my good friend from Virginia,  whom I have a great deal of respect for, and I have worked very  diligently on this committee with for some time, and inquire as to what  transpired since this bill left committee until today that would cause  him and others who were supportive of it in committee to now say that  it is not?   I don't mean to misrepresent anything. While I might have opinions of  what I believe, I can tell you factually that this bill is merely, and  solely, and exclusively a reporting bill. If I were managing a company  and I wanted to know where my resources were, I would want to make sure  I managed those resources--including my human resources--so I would  like to know where the time of my employees is spent.   There is no prohibition of time being spent. There is no restriction  of time being spent. It is merely a reporting bill. It is requiring  reporting. It is something the OPM has done before. It was started  under President Carter's administration.   Mr. Speaker, I inquire of my good friend if there is anything that  has changed to make his opposition now come to the floor?    I yield to the gentleman from Virginia.    And I appreciate that.    And I appreciate that.    And I appreciate that.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, while I understand where  my colleague from Virginia is taking my comments from, I must submit  that at no time did I allege that the Federal employees, all Federal  employees, are committing crimes on official time.   I think just the opposite. A vast majority of our Federal employees  are probably some of the best workforce that we have out there. I think  that, in any workforce, you are going to have some people that don't  live up to the standards of their employment. So what I merely do in my  opening statement is to say that there has been a need for transparency  that includes the abuse of time by some, not by all.   Again, the vast majority of Federal employees are exceptional  employees, hardworking, and absolutely necessary to run this great  country.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my good friend from Virginia to please reconsider,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. If  I might just, again, clarify for the record, this is a reporting bill.  It is a transparency bill. The standard that my good friend from  Massachusetts discusses, and that I agreed with, is not affected at all  by this bill.   I would have no doubt whatsoever that in similar circumstances that  happened after 9/11 in those post offices, that those same employees,  regardless of the risk, would do exactly what they did, because that is  how valuable they are to the system. That is how valuable they are to  this country.   What I can't understand is what has transpired between voting this  out of committee to today that has changed the opinion.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, might I inquire how much time is remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida has 9\1/2\  minutes remaining. The gentleman from Virginia has 8\1/2\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I appreciate the comments from my friend from Virginia, and I will  reiterate my comments made earlier here on this floor that we are very  grateful for the Federal workforce that we do have and that they are,  by far, one of the best human resources in employment in the world. We  are grateful for their service.   As in any case, there might be some bad ones, but, more importantly,  all this bill requests is that we just report the transparency of their  services and official time. It is neither an indictment nor restriction  on Federal time whatsoever, and, in fact, can be used as a tool for  Federal employees to justify some of the official time they are doing  for the benefit of not only their colleagues, but also this great  country.   Mr. Speaker, I would again request that Members of this House support  my bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H4533]]    The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 624, the Social Security  Number Fraud Prevention Act of 2017, introduced by my good friend from  California, Representative David Valadao.   I want to start by thanking Chairman Brady and Subcommittee Chairman  Johnson from the Ways and Means Committee for their assistance in  getting this bill to the floor. Their work on addressing the  unnecessary use of Social Security numbers is well appreciated by all  Americans across the country and especially Members in this body.   Mr. Speaker, we live in an interconnected world. Personal  identifiers, such as Social Security numbers, are used for much more  than just Social Security benefits. Social Security numbers are widely  used to receive government services and to apply for services in the  private sector, like opening bank accounts, credit cards, and even  applying for college.   The extent to which Social Security numbers are a de facto national  identifier has heightened concerns about identity theft. In the wrong  hands, a stolen Social Security number can be used for devastating  effects.   This bill helps move the government closer to the goal of minimizing  unnecessary use of Social Security numbers. All entities in the Federal  Government will be prohibited from sending a Social Security account  number by mail, unless the head of the entity deems it necessary.   The 24 major CFO Act agencies will also have to issue regulations  specifying the circumstances under which inclusion of a Social Security  number is deemed necessary. They will have to ensure numbers are  redacted partially, where feasible, and to ensure no numbers are  visible from the outside of a mail piece.   Finally, agencies will be required to report to Congress on their  progress in implementing the requirements of the law.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is very important. The Social Security  Administration alone sends 223 million notices containing a full Social  Security number every year. We must take care to properly safeguard the  personally identifiable information of American citizens. The  consequences of failure can be dire.   In 2015, the Office of Personnel Management experienced a major data  breach where the personally identifiable information for 22 million  Americans was compromised.   The Oversight Committee majority staff report recommended Federal  agencies reduce the collection of Social Security numbers and other  personally identifiable information.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is a step in the right direction. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Valadao), who is the author of this  bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).   Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from  Florida, and I thank my colleague from Virginia for supporting this  piece of legislation put forth by our friend and colleague from  California, Congressman David Valadao.   The Social Security Number Fraud Prevention Act is a bill that should  gain unanimous support in this institution. According to the Justice  Department, identity theft affects nearly 18 million people, costing  more than $15 billion in 2014 alone. This represents roughly 7 percent  of all Americans age 16 or older. In my home State of Illinois alone,  in 2014, it was recognized that the FTC saw a 65 percent increase in  identity theft. More than 14 percent of the victims are elderly.   We all know that Social Security numbers are the link to a key piece  of information criminals use to steal people's identities. This  commonsense piece of legislation takes a very important step to ensure  that our Federal agencies, our government, funded by the hardworking  taxpayers of this country, are not making this problem even worse.   This bill, as you have heard today, would restrict the use of Social  Security numbers on documents sent via mail by the Federal Government  unless the head of a department or agency determines the inclusion of  such number is necessary--which I can't think of a single instance  where that would be necessary, but I guess we have to put that in there  anyway. This seems like a no-brainer, but we in this institution have  to pass a bill to make sure that it happens, which is why I am a proud  cosponsor of this bill.   I want to thank Congressman Valadao again. I also want to thank  Congress' newest father, our colleague from California, Eric Swalwell,  for being a cosponsor of this legislation, too. This bill will have a  real impact on reducing identity theft in this country, and I want to  commend, once again, everybody on the floor today for their support.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we here have an obligation to provide for the common  defense, and I would submit, Mr. Speaker, that includes that we provide  to defend our citizenry from such crimes as identity theft. This bill  is a step in the right direction.   I want to thank my good friend from Virginia (Mr. Connolly) for his  efforts. I want to thank Mr. Valadao from California for sponsoring  this bill.   This is a bipartisan measure that will allow us to address the  concerns of modern-day crimes of identity and of modern-day crimes of  privacy. It is a bill that moves in the right direction. While it is  not the panacea, it is a good first step to protecting our citizenry.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption by my colleagues, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Ross) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, H.R. 624, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to restrict  the inclusion of social security account numbers on Federal documents  sent by mail, and for other purposes.''.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
