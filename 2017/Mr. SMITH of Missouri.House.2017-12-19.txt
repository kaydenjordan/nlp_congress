 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent the folks  of southeast Missouri. The district that I represent, the average  median income is right at $40,000. It is one of the lowest average  median incomes in the country.   I have asked my folks back home, just last week, if they support this  tax bill, and, in fact, 67 percent say they support the Trump tax bill.  Mr. Speaker, $40,000 back home is a salary. It is not a Christmas bonus  that people get in New York City or California. $40,000 is their  salary.   Mr. Speaker, let me give you some facts: Mr. Speaker, the first  $24,000  [[Page H10208]]  that people earn in southeast Missouri will be at a zero percent tax  rate. A family of four that makes $55,000 will pay zero in income tax.   When you look at a median average income in southeast Missouri being  $40,000, we are winners. What you are hearing on the other side is  complete, false, and absolute lies.   Mr. Speaker, I ask this body to support the conference committee.
