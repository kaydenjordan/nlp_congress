 Mr. Speaker, we have a lot to be thankful for in this  country: the opportunity to raise our families, our freedom, our  servicemembers and law enforcement who protect us, and the opportunity  for prosperity and success. Many people come to America for exactly  these reasons, to pursue that dream.   This year, so many self-made Americans are struggling to keep their  small businesses afloat. COVID-19 relief and leftover PPP funds  continue to be held onto in this Chamber.   Next Saturday, November 28, is Small Businesses Saturday, an  opportunity for all of us to support the small businesses and the  dreams of our fellow citizens that own them. If we all collectively  make a conscious effort to shop small for our holiday gifts, we can  help these local store owners in our neighborhoods pull through these  difficult times this winter.   Our small businesses are doing everything they can to stay open for  their employees, and we really owe it to them and their futures to help  them do so. We can be part of that by patronizing their businesses, not  only this coming Saturday, November 28, but all through the year.                            ____________________
