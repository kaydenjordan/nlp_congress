 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania  for yielding the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Madam Speaker, over the past month, House Republicans have plunged  this Chamber into chaos. Whether it is the extremists who refuse to  honor the bipartisan budget deal negotiated with the White House and  voted into law by bipartisan majorities in both houses of Congress, and  then sought to shut down the government with their outrageous demands,  or whether it is House leadership who seem unable to prevent this  destructive behavior or perhaps to leave this Chamber at all.   As I and my Democratic colleagues push back against the majority's  cruel, extreme, and unworkable agenda, Members on the other side of the  aisle have been consumed with infighting and trying to distract from  the fact that their refusal to work in a collaborative or bipartisan  manner either with the Senate, Democrats, or even within their own  party, has resulted in their failing to perform Congress' most basic  job of funding the Federal Government.   Just this past weekend, they brought us within hours of a devastating  government shutdown. As the funding deadline approached, my office was  fielding calls from terrified constituents; people feeling that come  the end of month, their paychecks would no longer arrive and that  critical government services which they rely upon would be interrupted.   Parents wondered whether they would be able to make ends meet,  whether they would be able to pay the childcare bills that allowed them  to go to work and keep food on the table for themselves and their  children. Seniors worried about heat assistance as temperatures drop.  That is why Democrats stepped in to keep the government up and running  without the outrageous rightwing demands coming from the most extreme  and exotic fringes of the House Republican majority.   Now, we have 6 weeks before another funding deadline, and we have a  lot of work to do. The American people don't deserve this continued  uncertainty.   After the majority's reckless approach to government funding failed,  time and time again, on the House floor, we still only have 4 of the 12  appropriations bills passed through the House; 2 haven't even been  marked up, another one has failed, and more may go down this week.   One would think they would be willing to change tactics because after  all, the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over  again and expecting a different result.   You would think they would be willing to come to the table, honor the  agreements, pass the spending bills  [[Page H4964]]  that the American people should expect and certainly deserve, but  apparently not. Instead, we see them doubling down on the strategy of  jamming through unrealistic spending proposals that would devastate  children, families, seniors, and veterans all across this country.   That includes the two hyper-partisan bills they have brought to the  House floor today; bills that continue to break the pattern of the  bipartisan funding agreement that Congress approved last spring and  that both parties in the Senate have been willing to honor.   These bills slash vital services and include rightwing culture war  provisions; bills that are so extreme that the House Republicans may  not be able to pass them here, the Senate won't agree to, and the  President certainly won't sign.   The first of these is H.R. 4394, the Energy and Water Development  funding bill. With this legislation, we should be ensuring that the  U.S. is able to meet the challenges of today's and tomorrow's world.   Unfortunately, the bill in front of us doesn't do that. It is full of  harmful rescissions, repeals, and funding cuts. It attempts to impede  the progress we have made by increasing America's energy costs,  jeopardizing our energy security and hurting U.S. global  competitiveness.   It claws back important funding that supports programs to combat  flooding, improve wildlife habitat, and reduce pollution in our  drinking water. That includes millions in funding for the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers.   Let me zoom in on that for a minute and talk about all the important  work that the Army Corps does in my district alone.   It is responsible for the regular maintenance of two major rivers  running through and alongside Pennsylvania's Fifth district: the  Schuylkill and the Delaware. That maintenance includes tasks like  dredging, debris removal, and maintaining river embankments.   This river work is critical to our region's environmental, public,  and even economic health because it means boats can use our waterways  without interruption, and larger vessels can sail into and trade at the  port of Philadelphia.   The broader budget cuts included in this bill undermine the  importance and viability of all of these programs and means that  additional measures to improve the health of our communities, both in  my district and others, will go undone.   Critically, this bill also fails to meaningfully confront the climate  crisis. In southeastern Pennsylvania, we have already started to feel  the effects of climate change, more intense and frequent storms have  resulted in unprecedented, devastating flooding across our region.   For example, the Eastwick neighborhood of Philadelphia, which sits  adjacent to a flood-prone marsh, has experienced increasingly dramatic  floods in recent years. About 3 years ago, Tropical Storm Isaias  damaged more than 300 homes in this low-lying area. We have seen  tornados and flooding in the Brandywine River region in Norristown and  elsewhere.   It is important for everyone here to realize that none of our  districts are immune from the impacts of the climate crisis. Flooding,  hurricanes, rising sea levels, wildfires, and other climate disasters,  they affect us all.   My Republican colleagues' denial of this fact would only leave us  extremely unprepared and will prevent us from doing anything  proactively to address these growing threats and help our communities  be more resilient.   Ultimately, it is our constituents and future generations of  Americans who will suffer the consequences of these kind of policy  failures.   Additionally, just as families have started taking advantage of  provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act that reduce their home energy  costs, this bill would increase energy bills for hardworking Americans.   For all my Republican colleagues' talk, it is clear that Democrats  are the only ones here willing to take action to keep costs down for  American families, because with this bill, the majority is trying to  undo the work that we did with the Inflation Reduction Act. They want  to slash funding for programs that help people to weatherize their  homes, purchase efficient appliances, and be able to afford to heat  their homes.   These programs have the potential to save Americans thousands of  dollars a year. For the past several months, I have been holding  meetings across my district to talk to constituents about these  measures and help them access and improve their lives and their  budgets. Now House Republicans want to take this away.    This bill also blocks funding for initiatives that direct investments  to our underserved communities most overburdened by pollution. My  region has long struggled with dangerous air quality and its negative  health impacts leading to high rates of cancer and some of the highest  rates of childhood asthma in our Nation.   Federal investment is needed to ensure that kids in my district and  across the country can grow up healthy and have bright futures. In  kneecapping this important work, it seems that my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle are more concerned with catering to polluters  than the health of our children, and I find that incredibly  disappointing.   We are also considering today H.R. 4364, the legislative branch  funding bill.   Unfortunately, this legislation undermines the important work of this  institution and threatens Congress' ability to move into the future and  serve its constituents and America today rather than in the 19th  century or so.   I served on the bipartisan Select Committee on Modernization of  Congress for 2 years. Since then, I have followed its subsequent work  to produce recommendations on how to make Congress work better for the  American people.   Ultimately, that committee passed over 200 bipartisan  recommendations, including recommendations related to diversity and  inclusion among our staff here in Congress. Leading businesses around  the globe have embraced diversity and inclusion because they know that  a diverse workforce is more effective.   Despite the successes we have seen in other sectors, it seems my  Republican colleagues here in the House want to go backwards.   Troublingly, they want to eliminate the Office of Diversity and  Inclusion here on Capitol Hill. A well-functioning legislative branch  is critical our democracy, and I know our democracy is strongest when  Members of Congress and their staff look like the America we are here  to represent.                                time  1230    We should all want to serve our constituents in the best way we  possibly can, and we can only do that if we give our institution the  tools and the staff to achieve progress with the times and truly  represent our modern Nation.   Unfortunately, this bill would undermine that goal.   Even after flirting with a disastrous shutdown, my Republican  colleagues are still trying to force through spending bills written in  back rooms with no bipartisan agreement and riddled with culture war  poison pills and devastating cuts. They do so knowing that these bills  are so extreme that their passage is imperiled here in the House, and  it is a fiction if they think it is going through the Senate or that it  will be signed into law by the President.   This continued dysfunction only hurts America and throws our country  into chaos.   The bottom line is that the House needs to do better than this. The  American people deserve better than this.   Madam Speaker, I strongly oppose both of these bills, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the distinguished ranking member of  the Committee on Rules.    Madam Speaker, I wish that our colleagues across the  aisle were as concerned about the fact that this bill would increase  our dependence on Russian oil, Russian oil that is being used to fund  their illegal, inhumane war against the Ukrainian people.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to provide for consideration of a resolution  which clearly states that it is the people's House's duty to keep our  promise to American workers and seniors to protect and preserve Social  Security and Medicare and fight against any cuts to these vital  programs.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record along with any extraneous material  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Kamlager-Dove) to discuss our proposal.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez), a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Madam Speaker, funding the Federal Government is not a  game. The American people who elect us to Congress depend on us to  solve real problems. They don't send us here to play politics with  their lives and our country's future.   The incompetence, extremism, and infighting we have seen on display  from our Republican colleagues is not serious governance. It is  dangerous. It is destructive behavior, and it makes it wholly clear  that there are Members of this body who care more about making  headlines than the job they were sent here to do.   Madam Speaker, our budgets reflect our priorities. Democrats are here  to put people over politics, and these bills make it clear that my  Republican colleagues are prioritizing scoring political points over  working for American families or strengthening this body and our  democracy or protecting our planet.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question  and the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
