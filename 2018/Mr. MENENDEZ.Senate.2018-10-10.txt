 Mr. President, today I want to once again reaffirm that  the U.S. Congress stands firmly behind a strong U.S.-Israel  relationship. As threats to Israel continue to increase, as her enemies  continue to grow ever closer, the United States will stand firm in our  commitments.   Despite partisanship interfering with so many pressing policy issues  today, an overwhelming majority of members of all political parties  continue to reaffirm congressional support for this relationship.   Congress continues to fully fund the unprecedented $38 billion of  memorandum of understanding for military aid and will continue to do so  on a bipartisan basis.   Congress continues to authorize and fund missile codevelopment  programs, like Iron Dome, David's Sling, and Arrow 3, and will continue  to do so on a bipartisan basis.  [[Page S6768]]    Congress passed the Taylor Force Act, making clear that the United  States will not provide assistance that directly benefits the  Palestinian Authority until it stops incentivizing violence by paying  salaries to prisoners convicted of terrorism against Israeli or  American citizens.   Should there be any question about where the entirety of the U.S.  Senate--Democrats and Republicans--stand, all 100 Senators signed a  letter calling for Israel's inclusion in the Global Entry Program.   Our relationship with Israel is rooted in this bipartisanship. We are  stronger for it, and so is Israel. It is disappointing to see some try  to drive a political wedge in this historical support.   Those who would try to use Israel or support for the U.S.-Israel  relationship as a political football are not helping this relationship,  nor are they helping promote either American or Israeli security. Along  with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I will continue to be a  vocal advocate for a robust U.S.-Israel relationship rooted in strong  bipartisan support.                            ____________________
