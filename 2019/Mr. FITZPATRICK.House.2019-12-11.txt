 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Bucks  County Elite Girls basketball program and those who were recently  recognized by the Monroe Foundation for Youth and presented awards for  their service to our community as well as for their athletic and their  academic achievements.   Over the last year and a half, the team has won 11 tournaments. This  is an incredible achievement that speaks to their teamwork, their  coaching, and their dedication. Moreover, many of the team members are  also honor students, and many more are active community volunteers  throughout our region.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the Bucks County Elite  Girls basketball program for this amazing accomplishment, and we look  forward to their future success.                             Keystone Food Drive     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  incredible work of the students, the staff, and the families of Bristol  Township's Keystone Elementary School.   This holiday season, the Keystone community came together to help 27  local families in need. The students and staff at the school donated  nonperishable items throughout November, and Oldcastle Infrastructure  of Croydon, Pennsylvania, provided turkeys and pies to accompany the  meal baskets.   Mr. Speaker, this is the third consecutive year that Oldcastle  Infrastructure has partnered with the Keystone families. It is great to  see our communities come together to help those families who have  fallen on hard times, and that is what makes neighbors so great. They  are always there to help others in times of need.   Mr. Speaker, we hope to see this program continue in the future, and  we hope other communities will follow their lead.                               Salute 2 Service     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Salute 2  Service, a veteran outreach program based in Bristol, Bucks County,  Pennsylvania.   Founded by Langhorne's Rodney Wyatt, Salute 2 Service prides itself  on its ability to provide a multitude of services and resources for our  veterans in distress. In addition to extensive work towards career  growth and homeless outreach, they help veterans through local, State,  and national advocacy, community activism, and emergency assistance.    Mr. Speaker, the motto of Salute 2 Service is ``Leave No Veteran  Behind.'' With nearly a half million unemployed veterans across our  great Nation, Salute 2 Service has vowed to help find jobs for the  servicemen and servicewomen in our community.   I am proud to represent Salute 2 Service and Rodney, and I am glad to  see like-minded groups working together to help our veterans each and  every day.                            ____________________
