 Mr. Speaker, in California and in the Western States, we  see massive wildfires year in and year out due to the nonmanagement or  mismanagement of our forests.   The result here lately has shown that, in California, you are seeing  major insurers pulling out of the State. They are either no longer  offering new insurance policies to homeowners or are even withdrawing  old ones upon their expiration, which means costs go up for the  remaining companies, fewer choices for consumers, and even more  disaster in the fact that insurance will no longer be affordable at all  for any of them as they have seen skyrocketing costs.   What do we do about this? What should government do? Well, it  probably shouldn't be getting into the insurance business. Indeed, the  California one called FAIR is already expensive and hard to get, beyond  what the private ones are.   It comes down to forestry, having positive forestry that makes the  level of risk in line, as well as not fees and mandates on top of what  it takes to build a home already too costly in California, and making  land available instead of getting sued over using the land in order to  build new housing.   Now, you are going to hear the regulators say: It is all due to  climate change.   No, it is other government actions that are doing this.                            ____________________
