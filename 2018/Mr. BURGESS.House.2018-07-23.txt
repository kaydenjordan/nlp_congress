Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material into the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as the author of the Educating Medical Professionals and  Optimizing Workforce Efficiency and Readiness Act of 2018, I rise in  strong support of this bill. H.R. 3728 moved with strong bipartisan  support through regular order in the full Energy and Commerce Committee  and the subcommittee, which I chair. This legislation reauthorizes the  title VII health professions workforce program for fiscal years 2019  through 2023.   Title VII programs have expired but have continued to receive  appropriations. In fact, in fiscal year 2018, the appropriations levels  for the program actually increased. Reauthorizing these physician  workforce programs will provide much-needed stability for those who  depend upon this funding.   Title VII of the Public Health Service Act includes various programs  that are vital to building and maintaining a well-educated, well- trained physician workforce.   The EMPOWER Act reauthorizes funding for the Area Health Education  Centers at more than $38 million a year. These centers are critical in  providing both medical education and healthcare services to medically  underserved areas.   The bill also reauthorizes programs that incentivize diversity in the  physician workforce, including the Centers of Excellence Program, which  this bill authorizes at a level of $23 million per year. This  particular program provides grants to medical schools that have a  disproportionate number of minority students for the purpose of  expanding the schools' capacity or to improve curriculum.   Primary care is an important aspect of our Nation's healthcare system  and how many Americans receive the majority of their healthcare  services. H.R. 3728 reauthorizes funding for our Primary Care Training  and Enhancement Program at more than $48 million per year. This program  provides grants to hospitals and health professional schools to develop  and operate supplemental primary care training programs.   Lastly, this bill aims to strengthen our workforce that cares for the  geriatric population. The bill makes strides toward modernizing the  Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program and the Geriatric Academic  Career Award. With an aging population, our workforce needs to be  adequately trained in handling the unique needs of our seniors. These  two programs enable physicians and other providers to achieve that  training.   Lastly, I want to thank Representatives Schakowsky and Bucshon and  their staffs and the majority and minority staffs on the Energy and  Commerce Committee for their work on this legislation.   Reauthorizing title VII programs is long overdue, especially in a  time where our existing physician workforce is struggling to keep up  with the demands for healthcare services. I urge strong support of the  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I would just point out that reauthorizing these title  VII programs is long overdue. The House of Representatives in the last  Congress, the 114th Congress, did provide the reauthorization. It never  made it through the other body, unfortunately. It is time to do that  work now, and that is what this bill, today, purports to do.   Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill. It is long overdue. I urge  all Members to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5385) to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize  the program of payments to children's hospitals that operate graduate  medical education programs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5385         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Dr. Benjy Frances Brooks       Children's Hospital GME Support Reauthorization Act of       2018''.       SEC. 2. PROGRAM OF PAYMENTS TO CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS THAT                     OPERATE GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS.         Section 340E of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.       256e) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``and each of fiscal       years 2014 through 2018,'' and inserting ``each of fiscal       years 2014 through 2018, and each of fiscal years 2019       through 2023,'';        (2) in subsection (b)(3)(D), by inserting ``and the end of       fiscal year 2022,'' after ``fiscal year 2018,''; and        (3) in subsection (f)--        (A) in paragraph (1)(A)--        (i) in clause (iv), by striking ``; and'' and inserting a       semicolon;        (ii) in clause (v), by striking the period at the end and       inserting ``; and''; and        (iii) by adding at the end the following:        ``(vi) for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023,       $105,000,000.''; and        (B) in paragraph (2)--        (i) in subparagraph (D), by striking ``; and'' and       inserting a semicolon;        (ii) in subparagraph (E), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; and''; and        (iii) by adding at the end the following:        ``(F) for each of fiscal years 2019 through 2023,       $220,000,000.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H6601]]  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today we are considering H.R. 5385, the Dr. Benjy  Frances Brooks Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education Support  Reauthorization Act of 2018. This bill, which was submitted by  Representative Gene Green and myself, reauthorizes the Children's  Hospital Graduate Medical Education programs at $325 million per year  for the fiscal years 2019 through 2023. This is an increase of $10  million above the enacted fiscal year 2018 level. This bill recently  moved through regular order in the Energy and Commerce Committee and  its Subcommittee on Health.   Congress created the Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education  program in 1999 as part of the Healthcare Research and Quality Act,  which authorized funding to directly support medical residency training  at children's hospitals for 2 years.   Prior to the establishment of Children's Hospital Graduate Medical  Education, children's hospitals received minimal graduate medical  education funding because Medicare is the primary funding source of  graduate medical education programs, and children's hospitals have few  Medicare patients.   Since the establishment of this program, Children's Hospital Graduate  Medical Education funding has provided critical support to our  pediatric workforce, which still is struggling to keep up with the  demands for their services. The Children's Hospital Graduate Medical  Education program is especially crucial in training pediatric  subspecialists.   Children's hospitals have a unique patient population with medical  conditions from which pediatric medical residents can learn and develop  critical skills. The experience gained from such a residency helps to  prepare and train physicians for the complex reality of pediatric  medicine that they will face in the future of their medical careers.   I can say as an OB/GYN who did his residency at Parkland Hospital in  Dallas, residency programs play a vital role in shaping our Nation's  physician workforce. Our pediatric workforce is no exception.   According to the Children's Hospital Association, almost half of  children's hospitals reported vacancies for child and adolescent  psychiatry, in addition to developmental pediatrics. The Children's  Hospital Association also reports that pediatric specialists in  emergency medicine, physical medicine, rehabilitation, endocrinology,  rheumatology, hospitalists, pain management/palliative care, and  adolescent medicine are frequently reported as experiencing vacancies  longer than 12 months.   The workforce shortage is something that I am concerned about, and  that is why passing this legislation is an integral part of maintaining  and sustaining our workforce.   In 2016, Children's Hospital Graduate Medical Education funding  helped to support over 7,000 residents at 58 hospitals across the  country.   Mr. Green and I agreed to name this bill after Dr. Benjy Frances  Brooks, who was born and raised in my district in north Texas, in  Lewisville, Texas. Dr. Brooks went on to become the first female  pediatric surgeon in the State and to establish pediatric surgery as a  separate division at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston.  It is an honor to move this bill in Dr. Brooks' name.   Our children deserve the best care available to them, and ensuring  that we have an adequately prepared workforce is the first step in  providing quality healthcare to children. Passing H.R. 5385 is vital to  the maintenance and growth of this workforce and to the health of our  Nation's children.   I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden), chairman of the full committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I only want to point out that 2018 is the 100-year anniversary of the  birth of Dr. Benjy Brooks, so it seemed an appropriate time to  recognize her contributions to the fields of pediatric surgery and  medicine in general.   Again, she was born in the town in which I practiced medicine for a  number of years. I first encountered her at the University of Texas  Medical School at Houston when I was a medical student back there in  the 1970s. Surely, hers is a legacy of which all Texans can be proud.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 959) to amend title VIII of the Public Health Service Act to  extend advanced education nursing grants to support clinical nurse  specialist programs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 959         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H6606]]            SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 959, the Title VIII Nursing  Workforce Reauthorization Act of 2018, which was introduced by the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Joyce).   The bill reauthorizes the title VIII Nursing Workforce Development  Programs for fiscal years 2019 through 2023. Title VIII programs, in  addition to the title VII physician workforce programs, expired several  years ago, but have continued to receive appropriations. This bill  reauthorizes title VIII programs at the fiscal year 2018 level.   While our appropriations process has continued to fund these programs  without a reauthorization, there remains uncertainty regarding how much  money the programs will receive each year.   These programs range from providing our advanced practice nurses with  additional educational opportunities to increasing the nursing  workforce diversity.   The bill includes grants for nurses at different levels of education  to obtain further education so that they can advance within the nursing  profession. Additionally, this legislation reauthorizes loan repayment  scholarships and grants for education, practice, quality, and  retention. These provisions are essential in educating and retaining a  qualified nurse workforce.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support H.R. 959, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Joyce), the author of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and  only to point out that this bill did pass in the previous Congress, in  the 114th Congress, both in subcommittee and full committee, but was  never enacted into law.   The author of that bill in the last Congress was our colleague, Lois  Capps, on the Energy and Commerce Committee, and I know she will be  grateful to see that her work has finally cleared the floor of the  House and on to the Senate, and we will be successful.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I urge an  ``aye'' vote.
