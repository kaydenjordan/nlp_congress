 Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to commend Vicki  Christiansen, the Forest Service Chief, for proposing a new rule to add  to our fire danger mitigation that we need to do in California and  across the West.   Building upon my bill from a year and a half ago, the Electricity  Reliability and Forest Protection Act, this allows the streamlining of  the process to clear trees and brush, et cetera, around power lines,  that make it a fire hazard.   We have certainly suffered enough fire loss in California. I had the  Camp fire right in my own district, the Carr fire last year as well  and, this year, already 54,000 acres burned in Plumas County.   As it is right now, our utilities have a hard time being able to get  out and do the work because the permit process can be difficult. So  they resort to lately, right in the middle of my district, what is  known as the public safety power shutoff as a precaution, with the wind  conditions and heat perhaps being able to cause additional wildfire.   We shouldn't put the utilities in that position of being cursed if  they do or cursed if they don't for a possible fire. We need to get the  work done around the power lines. So I hope this rule put through by  the U.S. Forest Service will help us accomplish that.                            ____________________
