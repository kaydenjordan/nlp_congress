 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my objection and  disappointment with the decision that was made to disinvite the  President of the United States to address this Chamber for the State of  the Union.   I would like to commend Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, who, just  yesterday, said he would welcome the President here to the Chamber this  upcoming Tuesday.   This decision that was made is not one to bring this House together.  That is a decision that is not one to move our country forward. I  object. And many others in this Chamber do as well, and I believe many  Democrats do.   Then I hear that we are about to leave again? I say we stay here. We  should all be in one room. No phones, no pay, no one is leaving the  room until we have a deal and there is white smoke.   That is how to lead, not to set us backward, as we are seeing again  by the Speaker's decision today.                            ____________________
