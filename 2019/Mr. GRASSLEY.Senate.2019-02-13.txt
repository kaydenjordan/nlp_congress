 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor for two reasons: No.  1, to speak about the tax bill of 1 year ago, and then, for a longer  period of time, to address the issue before the Senate, which is the  nomination of Mr. Barr.   The tax filing season began just over 2 weeks ago. Despite the  disruption of the temporary partial government shutdown, the IRS is  reporting to the Nation that all systems are go. Tax returns are being  processed as normal, and refunds are being sent out. While there are  lingering effects from the shutdown, overall, the IRS and Treasury have  done a pretty good job of minimizing the effects of the shutdown on tax  filers.   This season is receiving additional scrutiny as it is the very first  time that tax filers are filing under the tax cuts and reforms enacted  last year. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle and some in the  media appear to be obsessed with finding anything they can manufacture  to declare the filing season under the new law a failure. Of course,  that is after only 2 weeks of tax filing--not a long enough period of  time to draw too many conclusions.   Case in point: Last week the IRS released preliminary filing data  covering the first weeks of the filing season. Immediately, naysayers  began focusing on data that suggests that tax refunds in the first week  were down slightly over last year, as well as focusing on anecdotal  social media posts. Never mind that the current refund numbers are  based on only a few days of data, or that refund statistics can vary  widely from one week to the next. Never mind that most of the social  media posts are unverified. Many have the markings of a coordinated  effort by liberal activists who have regularly used hashtag ``GOP tax  scam'' to attack the law on Twitter, despite a vast majority of  taxpayers paying less in taxes.    Yet our journalists, who are well educated and ought to know better,  fall for it--hook, line, and sinker--including such tweets in articles  with no questions asked or verifying the veracity of these claims.   To be fair, oftentimes buried deep in such articles, well below a  sensational headline, is an attempt to demonstrate some semblance of  unbiased reports, noting that under the tax law, most taxpayers will  see tax cuts. That is right. Most taxpayers will see tax cuts. You most  assuredly wouldn't know this from the headlines bemoaning a reduction  in tax refunds, but the vast majority of taxpayers experienced a tax  cut last year, and will this year, as well.   Every analysis--from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation to  the right-leaning Tax Foundation, to the liberal Tax Policy Center-- demonstrates that taxpayers are sending less of their hard-earned money  to Washington this year.   As an example, an Iowa family of four with the State's family median  income of around $75,000 stands to see their tax bill cut by more than  half, or about $2,100 in savings. This is real tax relief that began  appearing in many taxpayers' paychecks at the start of 2018. That is a  very important point. The government could have chosen to deprive this  taxpayer of this extra $2,100 last year until they filed their taxes  during this tax season.   This may have been the best thing to do if you are someone who starts  with the assumption that their money would be better off in the hands  of the government interest-free. But I do not believe that is the best  thing to do.   I believe taxpayers know better how to spend their hard-earned money  than Washington does. It should be up to the individual taxpayer  whether it is in his or her interest to put that extra $2,100--or about  $175 a month--in a savings account or spend it on buying school  supplies for their children or maybe even making a car payment. That is  a decision 157 million taxpayers can make and not 535 Members of  Congress or the bureaucrats who are out spending the money.   In early 2018, Treasury and the IRS implemented updated withholding  tables to give taxpayers that option of deciding whether to save or  spend and what to spend it on or how to save it.   A chief priority for the new withholding tables was accuracy. The  IRS' goal was to help taxpayers get the right amount withheld from  their paycheck. However, common sense ought to tell us that no  withholding table will ever be perfect--at least not perfect for 157  million different taxpayers. If they were, there would be no need for  tax refunds. Only what was necessary to satisfy a taxpayer's tax  obligation would need to be taken from their paychecks.   But that is unlikely. Every taxpayer is affected a little differently  under the Tax Code based on their personal circumstances, and some  taxpayers' incomes may fluctuate throughout the year. This makes exact  withholding based on general tables nearly impossible. As a result, the  amount of a taxpayers' refund is unlikely to be exactly the same as it  was under the old law compared to our new law. Yes, some taxpayers may  see a smaller refund, but others may see a larger refund. The size of  one's refund tells you nothing about whether a specific taxpayer  benefited from last year's tax law.   Given this fact, the best way for any taxpayer to see how tax reform  affected their bottom line is to compare this year's tax return with  last year's tax return, rather than making that judgment based upon  what the refund is.   Tax preparers and tax return software often will provide an analysis  comparing the current and previous year's tax return. I encourage  taxpayers to compare the total amount of taxes paid this year with the  total taxes paid last year, or, if your income materially changed from  last year, compare your effective tax rate. That is the taxes paid as a  percentage of your adjusted gross income. If your tax preparer does not  already provide you with this information, simply ask them for that  information.   If taxpayers take this approach, the vast majority will see that  their tax bill has gone down. This is what matters, not the size of  their refund. The size of the refund tells you nothing beyond the  degree to which a taxpayer has overpaid their taxes over the course of  the year. I hope Americans will take the time to check so they know the  real effects that last year's tax cuts had on their lives and their  family.    Mr. President, I do not object to the nomination of  Donald W. Washington, PN202.                            ____________________
