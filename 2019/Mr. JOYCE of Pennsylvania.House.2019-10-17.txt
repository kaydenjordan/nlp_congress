 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to shed light on  House Democrats' impeachment inquiry, a scheme that has been devised in  the dark.   From day one of this Congress, my colleagues have sought to use their  new majority to undermine President Trump every step of the way. The  majority has chosen to break precedent and deprive Republicans of the  ability to do our job.   Today, I went down to the SCIF to read the classified Volker  testimony for myself, and, sadly, I was turned away. It is remarkable  that elected officials have been blocked from reading material, parts  of which have already been leaked to the press in selective and  incomplete pieces. Simply, this is wrong.   The House of Representatives has been reduced to obsessing over a  perpetual Ground Hog Day cycle of relitigating the 2016 election.   For the sake of our Nation, it is time to remove what the obstacles  we face  [[Page H8209]]  are and return to our constitutional duty of being legislators.                            ____________________
