 Mr. President, Kay Hagan was a kind and passionate public  servant. She fought from the heart for women, children, students,  servicemembers, and working people in North Carolina and across the  country.   In 2013, when interest rates on Federal student loans were about to  double so that the government could increase profits off of the backs  of our students, Kay said no. Together, with our colleague Senator Jack  Reed, we put forward commonsense legislation to keep interest rates low  for students across the country. In this instance and so many others,  Kay stood for fairness and served as a voice for those who needed it  most.   Kay and I may not have agreed on every issue, but on those key issues  that matter to working families--like equal pay, raising the minimum  wage, and helping students getting crushed by debt--we were proud to  fight side by side.   My thoughts are with her husband Chip, their children and family, and  the people of North Carolina as they mourn Kay's loss and celebrate her  memory.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it is my deep honor and privilege  to celebrate the career and legacy of Massachusetts resident, Wick  Sloane of Bunker Hill Community College, or BHCC, as he retires this  year.   Wick Sloane came to BHCC in 2006 and retires this year from his  ``official'' job of helping students transfer to 4-year colleges. Wick  leaves behind an unwavering commitment to the students--from their  success in the classroom to ensuring that all of their basic needs are  met.   Wick has worked tirelessly over the years to address even the most  basic needs of low-income students, like student hunger and  homelessness. His work touched the BHCC community in Massachusetts but  also college communities far beyond BHCC throughout Massachusetts and  across the country.   Due in large part to Wick's steadfast advocacy and voice, I  successfully led several of my Senate colleagues in requesting the  Government Accountability Office, or GAO, to conduct a study on food  insecurity at colleges and universities. The GAO agreed to complete the  study, which it published in January 2019. The groundbreaking study  confirmed that food insecurity is a widespread issue on American  college campuses and made recommendations for Federal action to address  hunger issues for students in higher education. This study led  lawmakers at the local level and at the national level--myself  included--to introduce legislation to address hunger on college  campuses.   Wick saw a problem impacting his community in Massachusetts and took  action, resulting in immediate support  [[Page S91]]  for our most vulnerable students in the BHCC community and Federal  action that will begin to create change for millions of vulnerable  students across this country.   Wick was one of the first BHCC professors to teach late-night classes  through the college's nationally recognized Midnight Classes Program.  In 2017, Wick's contributions were recognized by Governor Baker, who  awarded him the Manuel Carballo Governor's Award for Excellence in  Public Service.   As Wick retires, we thank him for his years of service at Bunker Hill  Community College and to students across the Commonwealth. I know Wick  will keep fighting on behalf of our students in Massachusetts and  beyond as he begins this next chapter.                            ____________________
