 Mr. Speaker, obviously, on behalf of  our entire delegation, Republicans and Democrats both, we welcome our  new colleague to this Chamber and look forward to serving with her. We  are pleased to have her here.    Mr. Speaker, on Veterans Day, I had the  privilege of being in St. Marys, Pennsylvania. The American Legion  recognized Colonel Vic Straub for his service, and I was honored to be  there.   As part of the celebration, I presented Colonel Straub with a flag  that had been flown over our United States Capitol.   Colonel Straub's personal qualities share a lot in common with the  colors of our Stars and Stripes. The red symbolizes his courage, dating  back to sitting in the cockpit of a range of experimental planes as an  airman. The white symbolizes his purity of purpose and being selfless  in all his work. The blue symbolizes his loyalty to his family, his  community, and to his country.   And the stars, well, what more can I say? Colonel Straub is a  talented and proud Air Force guy.   Mr. Speaker, one of the privileges of this job as a U.S.  Representative is that we are able to meet, help, and thank many people  throughout the congressional district. As we honored our veterans  throughout the Nation this weekend, let us all remember that freedom is  not free. And for that, we can thank a veteran.                            ____________________
