 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and public  service of Janet Bosley. Janet has been a caseworker in my district  office and previously served my predecessor, Congressman Matt Salmon.  She is a wife, a mother, a grandmother, and I am very happy to call her  my friend.   Janet will soon be retiring. She faithfully served the constituents  of Arizona's Fifth Congressional District for the past 5 years, and her  steady presence in the district has been invaluable.   My staff and I are going to miss Janet's infectious smile and her  witty stories. She is one of the most engaging people I have known, and  my life has been blessed because of her friendship and example.   I wish her the best of luck and happiness as she moves into this new  chapter in her life.   Thank you, Janet. May God bless you.                            ____________________
