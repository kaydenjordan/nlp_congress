 Madam Speaker, our veterans deserve the best care and  attention, including when it comes to treating unseen wounds. That is  why I am honored to be part of this effort to expand mental health  services to our veterans in rural areas.   The Sgt. Ketchum Rural Veterans' Mental Health Act is named in honor  of Sergeant Brandon Ketchum, an Iowan and a Marine Corps veteran who  served in Iraq and Afghanistan.   After serving overseas, he suffered from a number of physical and  mental conditions. Tragically, Sergeant Ketchum took his own life after  failing to receive the mental healthcare he needed from the VA.   It is clear, mental healthcare shortcomings for our veterans need to  be addressed, and that is what this bill does.   I thank my colleague from Iowa, Congresswoman Axne, for her work on  this important bill. I also thank my colleagues, Congresswoman Miller- Meeks and Congresswoman Hinson, for their work as well.   God bless all those who have fought to protect our country. We owe  them our help.    Mr. Speaker, in this era of scientific and  technological innovation, it has never been more important to ensure  our students have access to quality STEM education programs, especially  in rural communities.   Implementing high-speed, reliable broadband goes hand in hand with  this goal.   This is why I urge my colleagues to support the Rural STEM Education  Research Act. Both STEM education and quality broadband access are  critical to the future success and revitalization of rural America.                                time  1630    I am hopeful that this legislation will break down barriers rural  Iowans face in receiving STEM education that is both forward-thinking  and long-lasting for our rural communities. This bill will also help us  identify the technological and logistical challenges we still must  overcome to provide broadband to every last acre of land.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma, Ranking Member  Lucas, for this outstanding bill and important piece of legislation.
