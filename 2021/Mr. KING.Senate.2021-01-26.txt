 Mr. President, if you ask 100 Americans what qualities they  want in a public servant, I would bet there are a few common words that  would come up. Smart. Dedicated. Bipartisan. Honest. Trustworthy.  Humble. Simply put, they will describe Chad Metzler--my legislative  director for the past 8 years and one of the finest public servants I  have ever met. That is why today I rise with a heavy heart to wish Chad  well as he prepares to embark on a new adventure .   Each of us in this body understands that the Senate's work is not  entrusted solely to Senators. Our names may be on the door, but we  can't claim successes on our own. Our staffs play a critical role in  our efforts to navigate the complex challenges facing the Nation and  serve the American people. That is why hiring the right people is one  of the most important decisions any Senator makes. If a Senator is  lucky, they will find staffers who have extensive experience and  knowledge of the legislative process; who aren't afraid to challenge  their boss's preconceived notions in the pursuit of better policy; who  are kind, level-headed public servants; who are generous colleagues;  who understand the importance of the faith placed in us by the American  people and work ever day to live up to this enormous responsibility. If  a Senator is lucky, they will find staffers who check a few of those  boxes. If they find someone who can do all of the above, they have hit  the jackpot. When Chad Metzler joined my team as legislative director  in 2013, I and the people of Maine hit the jackpot because he is all of  those things and more.   Over the past 8 years, I have had the privilege to have Chad lead my  legislative team. Sadly, good fortune only lasts for so long. As Chad  transitions into a new, exciting opportunity, I am confident that he  will continue to make vital contributions to the American people in his  new role, but before he leaves us, I want to take a moment to reflect  on all his contributions to the Senate and the country.   From my early days in the Senate, Chad's experience was invaluable.  Prior to joining my office, he spent 17 years working for Senator Herb  Kohl, from his home State of Wisconsin. Throughout that tenure, Chad  spearheaded a number of important, varied responsibilities--from  serving as the Senator's legislative director, to holding the position  of staff director on the Senate Special Committee on Aging, to  [[Page S149]]  managing Senator Kohl's portfolio on the Appropriations Committee. That  combination of skills made Chad a rare breed--an experienced Senate  staffer who possessed both a generalist's understanding of the big  picture and a specialist's ability to get into the weeds of thorny  policy issues.   Chad's background was invaluable in helping to bring me up to speed  on the Senate's parliamentary procedures and the body's unique,  frustrating quirks. As a former Governor, I faced the unenviable task  of shifting from the executive role to being just 1 of 100. As an  Independent used to relying on bipartisan coalitions, the Senate's  often rigid partisanship presented its own challenges. Chad responded  with creative thinking and dogged persistence, and the results were  quickly apparent.   Just a few short months after I came to Washington, Chad helped me  lead a bipartisan compromise on student loan rates that is projected to  save taxpayers $715 million over the next 10 years and an estimated $30  billion for students over the following 4 years. That legislation set  the tone for our office--a focus on rolling up our sleeves, bipartisan  work, coalition building, and commonsense solutions to the problems  that plague the American people.   In the years that followed, Chad and his legislative team helped to  build on that mission through level-headed, analytical thinking. Among  other successes, we have worked across the aisle to pass legislation  that confronts the opioid epidemic sweeping our communities; improves  America's insufficient cyber defenses; helps more working families  access childcare; and addresses the $12 billion maintenance backlog at  America's national parks. Each of these legislative successes came  about through hard work and bipartisan discussions. More importantly,  each made life better for our constituents.   Obviously, Chad is a talented legislative craftsman, but somehow, he  was an even better leader and person. For the past 8 years, Chad has  guided my legislative team with a steady hand, helping dozens of young  public servants in my office grow and thrive. He treats everyone he  meets with respect and kindness, never once talking down to someone  with less experience or a different perspective. Just as important, his  sense of humor has remained intact through a quarter century of Senate  service, ensuring that even in the midst of serious work, we don't take  ourselves too seriously.   When I was Governor, I said I always was looking for staff who  demonstrate both competence and kindness. You can have some with one  trait, some with the other, a few with neither, but when you find folks  with both, you invite them onboard immediately. Chad doesn't just have  those qualities; he personifies them.   As you can gather from my remarks, Chad is an irreplaceable part of  my team, and the Senate is poorer for losing him. But, as Chad always  does, I feel the need to take a step back and analyze the entire  situation. In doing so, I find a few key reasons for gratitude.   I am grateful that even though Chad is moving on, he leaves behind a  team that is well-educated in the Metzler School of Public Service. His  years of mentorship have crafted our team into one of the sharpest,  most dedicated staffs on Capitol Hill, and I know his influence and  example will be felt in our office for years to come.   I am grateful that although our body is losing a dedicated public  servant, the country is not. In the days ahead, Chad will begin a new  opportunity that will put his skills to good use. This new role will  allow him to continue fighting for pragmatic, principled solutions that  move our country forward. Now more than ever, we need folks like him  working on tough problems.   Finally, I am grateful that even though Chad will no longer be on my  staff, he will forever remain a trusted adviser and friend. Chad's  intellect, professionalism, and warmth are rare attributes; to possess  all of these qualities, while still remaining humble and even-keeled,  is even rarer. I consider myself extremely fortunate to know him and  look forward to continuing that association.   Mr. President, I have a simple philosophy of leadership that has  guided me throughout my life: Hire good people, and take credit for  what they do. When I hired Chad Metzler, I made one of the smartest  leadership decisions of my life--bringing on the ideal partner to break  bipartisan logjams and make life better for the people of Maine. I am  saddened to say goodbye to my adviser and friend today, but I know that  his best is yet to come. I can't wait to see what is next.                            ____________________
