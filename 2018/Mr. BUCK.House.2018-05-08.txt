 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 872 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 872         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 5645) to       amend the Clayton Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act to       provide that the Federal Trade Commission shall exercise       authority with respect to mergers only under the Clayton Act       and only in the same procedural manner as the Attorney       General exercises such authority. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the       Judiciary; (2) the amendment printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution, if offered       by the Member designated in the report, which shall be in       order without intervention of any point of order, shall be       considered as read, shall be separately debatable for the       time specified in the report equally divided and controlled       by the proponent and an opponent, and shall not be subject to       a demand for division of the question; and (3) one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 2152) to       require States and units of local government receiving funds       under grant programs operated by the Department of Justice,       which use such funds for pretrial services programs, to       submit to the Attorney General a report relating to such       program, and for other purposes. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The amendment in the       nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on the       Judiciary now printed in the bill shall be considered as       adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read.       All points of order against provisions in the bill, as       amended, are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary; and (2) one motion       to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 3.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the joint resolution (S.J.       Res. 57) providing for congressional disapproval under       chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule       submitted by Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection relating       to ``Indirect Auto Lending and Compliance with the Equal       Credit Opportunity Act''. All points of order against       consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The joint       resolution shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the joint resolution are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the joint       resolution and on any amendment thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Financial Services; and       (2) one motion to commit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to my friend, the gentlewoman from California  (Mrs. Torres), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the  underlying legislation.   The rule makes in order two bills reported favorably by the Judiciary  Committee and a Senate joint resolution that gives this House an  opportunity to utilize the Congressional Review Act to repeal the  CFPB's onerous regulation on indirect auto lenders.   The first proposal we will consider today is the Citizens' Right to  Know Act of 2018. This piece of legislation, offered by my friend and  colleague from Texas, Judge Ted Poe, will bring much-needed sunlight to  the Federal pretrial services programs.   We will also consider legislation offered by my fellow Judiciary  Committee member, Representative Handel from Georgia, which ensures  companies entering into merger proceedings will receive equal  treatment, whether their case is reviewed by the Department of Justice  or the Federal Trade Commission.   Finally, the House will consider a joint resolution that will repeal  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's burdensome guidance on  indirect auto lending. Senator Moran's legislation previously passed  the Senate 51-47 on March 22, 2018. President Trump has also signaled  his support for this legislation.   The rule makes in order one amendment to the Standard Merger and  Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules, or SMARTER, Act.   Why?   Because all other amendments offered were not germane to the subject  matter being discussed in these important pieces of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, today, we have an opportunity to debate a crucial  component of the criminal justice system: federal pretrial release  programs. Before the 1960s, defendants had three options to be released  prior to trial. Individuals were either released upon one's own  recognizance, or if they posted commercial bail, or the individual  would remain in prison until his or her hearing date.   However, in the 1960s, the Johnson administration established a  fourth option: pretrial services programs. These programs were  originally intended to assist nonviolent, indigent individuals who did  not possess the means to post commercial bail. The program captured  information about the alleged offender's community ties and released  low-risk individuals without financial obligations. The program only  required a signature and a promise to appear in court.   While pretrial release programs were created to serve those  individuals who do not pose a threat to the community and could not  afford to post commercial bail, these taxpayer-funded programs have  quickly expanded and overgrown their original intent.   Today, more than 300 pretrial release programs exist across the  United States. These programs are being used to slowly eliminate a  successful service that operates independently of Federal tax dollars:  the commercial bail system.   In fact, a number of major cities across the country are exploring  the potential of moving completely to a pretrial release system while  significantly reducing the use of commercial bail.  [[Page H3791]]    However, the problem with this expansion and these federally funded  pretrial release programs is that they allow violent individuals and  repeat offenders to participate even when many of these defendants are  perfectly capable of posting a commercial bond and have previously done  so.   Offenders are not required to post any collateral for their release.  There is no supervision to ensure that they show up in court on their  hearing date. Worst of all, there is no incentive to prevent a criminal  from committing another crime in the meantime.   If you have ever watched an episode of the popular television show  ``Dog the Bounty Hunter,'' you know that this is not how the commercial  bail system works. These professionals ensure that defendants show up  for trial on the correct date, or they will physically bring the  individual in question to the courthouse for their hearing.                                time  1230    On top of these issues, federally funded pretrial release programs  are not required to report to the Department of Justice any information  regarding an offender's past criminal history, utilization of the  pretrial release program, failure to appear before a court, and any  other relevant compliance data. A judge is essentially releasing  potentially dangerous individuals back into the community with so  little as a wink and a promise that they will appear in court.   We cannot allow this practice to continue. Mr. Speaker, our  constituents deserve to know whether their tax dollars are being spent  responsibly.   Judge Poe's bill, the Citizens' Right to Know Act, will address these  significant concerns by ensuring that the Department of Justice and  Congress have the information we need to determine whether these  programs that receive millions of dollars from the Federal Government  are operating effectively.   The legislation requires the Attorney General to submit a report to  Congress annually that includes information regarding each defendant  participating in a pretrial release program. The report will include  the individual's name, each occasion the individual failed to appear  for court, and the individual's previous arrest record.   Additionally, this proposal ensures that local jurisdictions will  submit required data to the Department of Justice by establishing that  any failure to produce this report will result in forfeiture of a  portion of the jurisdiction's Federal grant funds for the following  year.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is a good government solution that will  provide much-needed oversight for pretrial services programs and give  communities an incentive to ensure we are not allowing violent repeat  offenders back on the streets without the correct level of supervision.   Finally, this important legislation will also ensure that the  millions of taxpayer dollars we spend annually on those programs are  being utilized in the best way possible.   We owe it to our constituents to make sure that we know how their  hard-earned money is being spent. It is about time that we brought a  little sunlight to these programs that allow potentially violent  offenders to go free in our communities.   Mr. Speaker, the Judiciary Committee also moved an important piece of  legislation that will bring parity to the merger and acquisition  process no matter which Federal agency takes charge of the antitrust  review process.   Currently, both the Federal Trade Commission and Antitrust Division  of the Department of Justice have authority to enforce section 7 of the  Clayton Act, which prohibits mergers and acquisitions that could  undermine competition in the marketplace or create a monopoly. Both  agencies receive notice of proposed mergers and are given an  opportunity to review the transaction, while only one agency ends up  taking custody of the transaction.   However, the FTC and DOJ maintain different standards when seeking a  preliminary injunction against a proposed merger. This disparity  manifests itself in multiple ways. However, one main difference is that  the DOJ will often seek both a preliminary and permanent injunction  before a district court, while the FTC has fought against this  consolidation of injunctions. That means that two separate Federal  agencies with two different legal standards oversee the merger process  without any clear guidance determining which agency and standard will  be used to examine the transaction.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot continue fostering this double standard  surrounding merger and acquisition review. Businesses need certainty  before attempting to enter into major transactions, and Federal  regulatory bodies must be as transparent as possible when making  decisions that can create major ripples in the country's economy.   Representative Handel's bill, the SMARTER Act, gives businesses  certainty about how their merger will be reviewed before entering into  a major deal. This important piece of legislation harmonizes the  Federal antitrust review process by ensuring mergers and acquisitions  will be treated identically no matter what Federal regulatory agency  reviews the transaction. This bill will treat businesses in a way that  will encourage continued economic growth, build market stability, and  ensure the review process will be the same no matter which Federal  agency reviews the transaction.   Mr. Speaker, while we are debating the topic of financial stability  and economic growth, we are also here to discuss an important piece of  legislation the Senate recently passed and we will consider on the  House floor this week.   The House will debate S.J. Res. 57, Senator Moran's legislation that  offers a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act  that would overturn the CFPB's onerous regulation of the indirect auto  lending industry. In fact, despite being expressly prohibited from  overseeing auto dealers in the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, the  CFPB promulgated and issued guidance regulating the indirect auto  lending industry.   To make matters worse, the CFPB tried to disguise this harmful  regulation by issuing it in the form of a guidance document, which does  not need to go through the typical notice and comment process. This  arduous regulatory scheme sought to disrupt third-party lending,  especially from small community banks and credit unions in the auto  loan market. The CFPB did so by issuing guidance stating that, in order  to avoid liability under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, institutions  with indirect lending relationships with auto dealers must either place  controls on dealer compensation or forbid dealers from offering a  marked-up rate on loans.   The CFPB overstepped its statutory authority once again in what the  agency described as an attempt to reduce discrimination in the  marketplace. However, as Chairman Hensarling testified before the Rules  Committee yesterday, the House sent 13 letters to the CFPB questioning  the rationale for the rule and science the agency used to determine  that there was discrimination occurring in the marketplace. Not  surprisingly, the CFPB could not point to sound science that led to  this decision. In fact, new evidence shows that the CFPB's expected  outcomes could be off by as much as 20 percent.    To make matters worse, Chairman Hensarling also testified that this  rule is expected to increase the per person cost of purchasing an  automobile by $586 per loan. I know that in eastern Colorado, $586  makes a big difference. That is the difference between being able to  put money aside for taking a family vacation or making much-needed home  repairs.   This guidance has only resulted in removing options from consumers,  reducing the ability to find affordable auto financing, and setting a  dangerous precedent in how to dance around Federal rulemaking  processes.   Mr. Speaker, it is time that this Congress takes steps to rein in the  CFPB's unaccountable, overbroad regulatory powers. One agency should  not have the ability to significantly curtail an entire facet of the  lending market. Additionally, no agency should be able to skirt formal  rulemaking procedures when issuing guidance of this magnitude.   The CFPB's indirect auto lending rules create an unworkable situation  where an independent agency, manned by unaccountable bureaucrats,  flagrantly ignored Federal statute to do what it thinks is best for the  American people. Instead of benefiting the American people, though,  this guidance  [[Page H3792]]  threatens to raise the cost of credit, cut back opportunity for  indirect lending, and has created disincentives for financial companies  to provide customers with discounted auto loans.   Congress must take this opportunity to overturn a detrimental  guidance that is not only circumventing the rule of law by disguising  new regulations in an effort to draw less scrutiny, but is also raising  rates and providing fewer choices for consumers.   This resolution of disapproval will accomplish all of these goals.  The legislation, which recently passed in the Senate 51-47, will  utilize the Congressional Review Act process to overturn the CFPB's  guidance while also sending a clear message that agencies should not be  circumventing congressional oversight.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Zeldin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We have before us a rule that makes three pieces of legislation in  order: a bill that increases transparency for pretrial release  programs, legislation that streamlines the review process for mergers  and acquisitions, and a resolution of disapproval for the CFPB's  harmful indirect auto lending rule.   The Federal Government's greatest responsibility to its citizens is  to secure their safety and security. Congress has a duty to recognize  when there is a security problem that is putting people in jeopardy,  especially when it is a Federal pretrial release program that is  putting potentially violent offenders onto the streets without any  supervision. The American people deserve to know that their hard-earned  tax dollars are being spent in the most responsible way possible. We  cannot continue pushing millions of dollars into broken programs that  release dangerous individuals back on the street.   Additionally, Congress has a statutory duty to ensure that businesses  are not pursuing anticompetitive mergers and acquisitions. However,  that does not mean that we should continue fostering the current  climate that features the DOJ and FTC maintaining two distinctly  different processes for reviewing these transactions. We have the  unique opportunity to create certainty for businesses while harmonizing  the review process with the SMARTER Act.   Finally, the House must take advantage of this opportunity to rein in  the CFPB utilizing the Congressional Review Act's power to overturn  harmful regulations on the indirect auto lending industry. Not only  will this resolution of disapproval end a detrimental piece of  guidance, but it will also send a strong message to regulatory agencies  that they cannot overstep their statutory boundaries and will not get  away with attempting to cloak major regulatory actions merely as  guidance documents.   I urge support of the rule and the underlying legislation.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Torres is as follows:             An Amendment to H. Res. 872 Offered by Ms. Torres         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec.4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       2933) to promote effective registered apprenticeships, for       skills, credentials, and employment, and for other purposes.       The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not       exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and       the Workforce. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived. At       the conclusion of consideration of the bill for amendment the       Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with       such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and       amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec.5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 2933.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member  [[Page H3795]]       who led the opposition to ordering the previous question.       That Member, because he then controls the time, may offer an       amendment to the rule, or yield for the purpose of       amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.                                time  1300
