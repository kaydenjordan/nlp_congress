 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in strong support of  Kate's Law and the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act.   This Saturday, July 1, marks 2 years since the tragic death of 32- year-old Kate Steinle, who was shot and killed by an illegal immigrant  who had seven prior felony convictions and who had also been deported  five times.                                time  1315    Kate's death is a clear reminder that we must do more to stop the  abuse of our immigration laws by criminals who repeatedly flaunt the  rule of law by illegally reentering the United States.   Kate's Law puts in place new guidelines for stiffer penalties for  criminal aliens who continue to reenter the United States illegally.  Kate's Law is desperately needed to protect the residents of the State  of Texas.   Nicodemo Coria-Gonzalez--who had been deported five times to Mexico  for crimes, including three DWIs--reentered the United States illegally  and was charged with committing multiple sexual assaults and kidnapped  a woman solely for the purpose of setting her on fire.   Current policy enables criminals to roam American streets--no matter  [[Page H5313]]  where they come from--with little fear of arrest and deportation.  Kate's Law imposes stronger consequences and is an important step in  restoring law and order. It will protect American lives.   Sadly, there are local and State officials in our great Nation who  put the interests of criminal aliens before the safety of American  citizens. These officials should take the time to meet with the  families of the many victims of these criminal aliens, like I have.  They will see the resulting tragedy of sanctuary city policies.   To rein in such States and localities, we need to pass the No  Sanctuary for Criminals Act, which will impose consequences on State  and local jurisdictions that ignore Federal immigration law by refusing  to work with Federal immigration officials to remove criminal aliens  from the United States.   In the first month of the Trump administration, Immigration and  Customs Enforcement issued over 3,000 detainers. These are orders for  local authorities to keep criminal aliens in custody for 48 hours to  enable ICE agents to come and get them for deportation. Remarkably, 206  of these detainers were declined by sanctuary city jurisdictions. In  other words, local authorities deliberately ignored ICE's detainer  request and released these dangerous individuals onto American streets.   These weren't just petty criminals, folks. Their crimes included  homicide, rape, assault, domestic violence, indecent exposure to a  minor, sex offenses against a minor, aggravated assault with a weapon,  vehicle theft, kidnapping, driving under the influence, hit and run,  and sexual assault.   Passing the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act is common sense, as it  cuts off certain Federal Department of Justice grants to these  sanctuary cities. Our bill redirects these funds to States and  localities that are cooperating with Federal immigration authorities  and making America safer.   The message of this legislation is clear: American taxpayers are  tired of footing the bill for States and localities that threaten their  safety.   Criminal aliens with final deportation orders make up more than 50  percent of foreign-born inmates sitting in our prisons right now. Our  streets will be made safer by deporting these criminal aliens, rather  than letting them loose onto American streets.   Local law enforcement officials should work with Federal law  enforcement agencies to keep criminals out of our country and off of  these streets. This is why we must pass Kate's Law and the No Sanctuary  for Criminals Act to prevent other deaths like Kate Steinle's.   I am proud to support these two commonsense, law and order bills, and  strongly urge my House colleagues to vote in favor of them today.
