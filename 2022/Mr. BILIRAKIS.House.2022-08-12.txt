 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from the great  State of Kentucky as well.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the inflation,  recession, IRS army act.   As the American people struggle to put food on their tables and gas  in their cars, Democrats bring us here today to raise Americans' taxes  and destabilize our prescription drug market.   My colleagues across the aisle want everyone to believe that this  bill will drive down the cost of drugs, but they fail to mention that  this policy will severely stifle innovation, unfortunately.   As a proud advocate for individuals suffering with cancer, rare  diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS, Alzheimer's, and  Parkinson's, I am committed to seeing cures come to market. But  policies like this one will heartlessly jeopardize the likelihood of  these breakthroughs.   I would like to see my Democratic colleagues work with us on the  productive policy solutions found in the Lower Costs, More Cures Act,  which would drive down the cost of drugs for the American people but  would not destroy the innovative research and development that is  uniquely American.   Sadly, it seems more thought was put into targeting average Americans  with an IRS army and over 1 million new audits than in helping them  find cures for their life-threatening ailments, unfortunately.   Floridians deserve better. And the American people deserve better  than this bogus piece of legislation that will raise taxes and reduce  the number of cures and treatments coming to market.
