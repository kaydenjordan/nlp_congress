 Mr. Speaker, I rise to say thank you to a friend  and a great warrior.   I thank you, dear brother, for being the sermon you preached. You  walked your talk. It is said that a great person will always rise to  the occasion, but it is also said that the greater person makes the  occasion.   He was an occasion-maker, and he rose to the occasion on the Edmond  Pettus Bridge. And for this, many of us who are here tonight are here  because he marched into brutality.   So tonight, I thank you, dear brother, for being able to withstand  what many of us could not and would not. I rise to just say thank you  and to let you know that we will never forget you, and we will always  make it perspicuously clear that we are here because you were there.
