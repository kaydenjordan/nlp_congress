 Mr. President, today I would like to honor the  life and service of a distinguished Montanan and Korean and Vietnam war  veteran, the late Ms. Ethel B. LaRock.   Ethel was a native daughter of Montana, born on September 23, 1930,  in Wolf Creek. She was raised alongside her nine older siblings in the  Sixth Ward in Helena. Never one to shy away from service or sacrifice,  Ethel left Montana to serve her country in the  [[Page S2285]]  Korean and Vietnam wars as a nurse in the U.S. Army. Her time in  uniform took her all across the world, from Southeast Asia to Europe. A  decorated servicewoman, she was awarded a Bronze Star in the Korean war  and the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross in the Vietnam war for her  heroic actions.   After retiring from the Army as a lieutenant colonel, Ethel returned  to civilian life, where she was an accomplished watercolor artist, a  member of the Archie Bray Foundation in Helena, and enjoyed music,  literature, and researching her family history. She was happiest  surrounded by generations of her nieces and nephews, spanning all the  way to great-great-nieces and nephews. She loved playing cards with  them, sharing stories, and watching old movies.   On June 22, 2023, Ethel passed away at the age of 92 at the Fort  Harrison VA Hospital. Today, it is my honor to commemorate her service  and life as an outstanding Montanan. On behalf of myself and a grateful  nation, I commend Lieutenant Colonel Ethel LaRock and extend our  deepest appreciation to her and her family. She is a true patriot who  made Montana proud, and she will be sorely missed.                            ____________________
