 Madam Speaker, I remember over the period of the last  Presidency joining my colleagues on both sides of the aisle at various  times when statements were made that we are just going to leave Iraq or  we are going to leave the Kurds in Syria, and I think that was  shortsighted, those statements, so I joined my colleagues on both  sides.   But, yet, today, we are debating the repeal of the 2002 AUMF as if we  all somehow believe that we are going to magically repeal this and then  come up with some narrow replacement that is going to authorize, when  we can't really agree that the sky is blue in this group.   But I want to, for a second, look back and say what would have  happened when this was introduced originally. So in January of 2014  this repeal was introduced. Let's say we passed it.   What happened since January of 2014? Well, I will tell you. In June  of 2014 we began airstrikes against ISIS. Because of the 2002 AUMF, we  were able to assist our allies to defeat ISIS in their capital of  Raqqa, their stronghold in Mosul, and we even destroyed their caliphate  throughout the region.   I know my colleagues who support this legislation have the right  intentions in mind, but even President Biden's own Statement of  Administration Policy admits that this repeal would have an impact on  our military operations. That is why we don't call for a blanket  repeal, but a narrowly crafted replacement. Let's do that first.    The bleak reality is that without an authorization to fight terror,  more innocent human beings will suffer. Let us not forget the horrors  that ISIS perpetrated on innocent men, women, and children. Men were  beheaded for practicing their faith, women were stoned to death for  trying to flee abusive relationships. Children were made foot soldiers  and suicide bombers. Without this AUMF, this would still be happening.   Today, we have militia groups attacking the American Embassy in  Baghdad. We have malign forces trying to destabilize the democratically  elected Iraqi Government. We have dozens of terror organizations,  including ISIS, that want to revive the caliphate which brought so much  pain and suffering to so many in the region.   Before we hastily pass this ill-thought-out and ill-timed political  legislation, I urge every Member to meet with Intel, to meet with the  Department of Defense to hear about the realities of the threats we  face in this world, and maybe once that happens and we put aside these  partisan stripes for a moment, we can have an honest debate about what  a replacement would look like. Short-term political gain has no impact  on what foreign actors make in terms of their policy decisions. ISIS  and terrorists don't change based on what we debate here, and they  certainly didn't give up yet.   We made a decision; the President made a decision to leave  Afghanistan. While I disagree with that, I certainly hope he is  successful and that my predictions are wrong, but I do know that that  sent a message. It sent a message that America is disengaging in the  war on terror. What would this send as well, right on the heels of  this?   What message would this send to the terrorists who are on the ropes,  who haven't attacked in the United States, not because they don't want  to, but because we haven't let them because we have fought them on  their territory, before they have the ability to organize and attack us  here?   What does that message send? Because to a terrorist, all they need is  the ability to go out and say, ``We are winning,'' to recruit somebody,  to give their life for that terrorist cause.   Madam Speaker, I understand where this is coming from. I deeply would  love an AUMF that replaces this the right way, but this is the wrong  process and the wrong order to do that. So I urge my colleagues to join  me in opposing this.                                time  0945
