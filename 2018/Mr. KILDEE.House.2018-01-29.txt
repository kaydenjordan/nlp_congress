 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow President Trump will give his first  State of the Union Address. It is an opportunity for the President to  demonstrate leadership and bring to this floor a discussion for both  parties to come together and pass, number one, a long-term budget that  reflects the priorities of the American people.   I have come to this floor many times to express my disagreement with  this President on a number of issues. I have disagreed on his efforts  to take away healthcare for millions of people, adding costs to people  I represent who have health insurance. I have disagreed with his tax  policies and disagree vehemently with the policies enacted here, and I  am going to continue to speak up when I find disagreement.   But I also look for areas where we can work together, and it is my  hope that tomorrow the President will articulate one of those: a plan  to deal with America's crumbling infrastructure, especially in  America's older cities. It has been over a year since the President was  here and laid out his plan for a big investment plan and a strategy on  infrastructure.   Words are cheap. We need action. We need something specific. And I am  hoping and willing to work with the President if he lays forward such a  vision.                            ____________________
