 Madam President, we have been working all day to get  consent to let us move forward on the minibus. We are not there yet,  but we hope we can get there tomorrow.   In the meantime, for the information of Senators, we are going to  have a vote on the motion to proceed to the minibus at 10:30 tomorrow  morning. Again, thank you to the appropriators, particularly Senators  Murray and Collins, and all the committee on both sides of the aisle.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
