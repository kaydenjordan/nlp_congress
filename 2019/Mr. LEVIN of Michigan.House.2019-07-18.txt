 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter  to all Members of the House from the AFL-CIO.                                                            AFL-CIO,                                                     July 12, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I am writing       to urge you to vote for the ``Raise the Wage Act of 2019''       (H.R. 582) scheduled for floor consideration this week. This       legislation would gradually raise the federal minimum wage to       $15 an hour by the year 2024. In addition to indexing future       increases to the growth in the median wage, the bill would       gradually eliminate the subminimum wage for tipped workers,       which has been stuck at $2.13 since 1991.        Because Congress has not raised the minimum wage in more       than 10 years, millions of our Nation's full time workers       live in poverty. If the minimum wage had risen at the same       pace as productivity growth since 1969, it would be over $20       an hour today.        Phasing in a $15 minimum wage would benefit 41 million       workers and begin to address the growing crisis of wage       inequality. More than half of the workers who would benefit       are adults between the ages of 25 and 54, and nearly two-      thirds work full time. More than half (56 percent) are women,       nearly 30 percent of whom have children.        According to the Economic Policy Institute, by 2024 a       single adult without children will need at least $31,200 ($15       per hour on an annual basis) to achieve an adequate standard       of living in all parts of the country. Allowing for a lower       regional minimum wage, as some have suggested, would lock       millions of workers into poverty, and would be especially       harmful to people of color and women who would benefit most       from a minimum wage increase.        Multiple studies have shown that modest increases in the       minimum wage have not resulted in significant job loss, and       the income boost experienced by low-income families benefits       the country overall by reducing both poverty and income       inequality.        Raising the minimum wage to $15 has the support of an       overwhelming majority of Americans, and the benefits far       exceed any potential cost. Once again, we urge you to vote       YES on the Raise the Wage Act and NO on any weakening       amendments. In addition, since any Motion to Recommit would       be the equivalent of voting against the Raise the Wage Act,       we urge you to vote no on the MTR.            Sincerely,                                                    William Samuel,                                      Govemment Affairs Department.     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman  Bobby  Scott for his incredible leadership on this bill, and I rise in strong  support of the Raise the Wage Act.   Mr. Speaker, I would remind the previous speaker and the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Allen) that we are proposing precisely zero more  regulation than exists. In fact, the Federal Government has set a  minimum wage in this country since 1938, all the great growth years of  this economy. We are just saying that the rate should be sensible.   I came to Washington to raise the standard of living for working  people in Michigan's Ninth District and all across this country, and  that is exactly what this bill does.   Working a full-time job should guarantee that you can provide for  your family, and a $7.25-an-hour minimum wage doesn't cut it,  especially while worker productivity has increased exponentially, and  executive salaries have skyrocketed.   The gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) said the CBO score  said a minimum of 1.3 million jobs would be lost. I want to correct the  record. They said a minimum of zero would be. The median projection is  that 1.3 million might be.   Mr. Speaker, I want to remind all of my colleagues that in 2018, the  Bureau of Labor Statistics said that 7,769,000 American workers were  working multiple jobs because one job didn't cut it, it didn't pay  enough for them. And that is almost certainly an undercount, according  to all experts.   If just one in five of those people being forced to work multiple  jobs could quit their second and third job because one job paid enough,  that would take care of 1.6 million jobs we wouldn't need, because  workers were being paid a living wage.   We have waited more than 10 years to give American families a raise.  And I can tell you that the people of Michigan's Ninth District, where  about 104,800 people would get a raise under this bill, have waited  long enough.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this historic  legislation.
