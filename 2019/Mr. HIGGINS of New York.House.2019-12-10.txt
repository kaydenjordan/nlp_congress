 Mr. Speaker, drug prices in the United  States have been rising at rates significantly faster than anywhere  else in the world for the past 25 years, according to the Commonwealth  Fund.   Investments by the Federal Government and research form the  foundation of advances in new treatments and cures. The Federal  Government does all the costly basic research; the pharmaceutical  industry does all the profitable distribution and marketing.   Now, the Federal Government should use its considerable leverage to  negotiate fair drug prices so the American people can truly benefit  from their taxpayer investments. I am pleased to see the House moving  forward this week with H.R. 3 that will do just that.   We must create leverage whenever we can. Despite promises from  President Trump last year that drugmakers would announce massive  voluntary price decreases on their products, patients continue to face  enormous year-over-year drug price increases on the drugs they need. In  the first half of 2018, for every drug that saw a price decrease, 96  drugs saw a price increase.   We also know that drug price hikes are almost never connected to any  evidence of innovation and improved benefit.   Why do drug companies raise the price of existing drugs? Because they  can.   It is imperative that we protect patients from unaffordable drug  prices and unjustified price increases on those drugs.                            ____________________
