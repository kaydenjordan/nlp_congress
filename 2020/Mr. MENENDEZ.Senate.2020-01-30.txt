 Mr. Chief Justice, I have a question, which I send to  the desk and ask the House managers to respond to it.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. The question for the House managers  from Senator Menendez:         The President was seeking investigations from a foreign       power based partly on what Fiona Hill called ``a fictional       narrative perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security       services.'' The US Intelligence Community has warned that the       Russian government is already preparing to attack our       election in 2020, and the President has said publicly he       would welcome foreign interference in our elections. Why       should Americans be concerned about foreign interference and       why does it matter that the President continues to solicit       foreign interference in our elections?    Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice and Senator, thank you for the  question.   Let's outline the facts that we do know about today. None of the 17  witnesses who testified as part of the House's impeachment inquiry were  aware of any factual basis to support the allegations that it was  Ukraine and not Russia that interfered in the 2016 election. FBI  Director Christopher Wray, who was nominated by President Trump and  confirmed by this body, stated as recently as this past December that  we have no reason to believe that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S.  election. He said: ``We have no information that indicates that Ukraine  interfered with the 2016 Presidential election.''   President Trump's own Homeland Security advisor, Tom Bossert, said  about this allegation: ``It's not only a conspiracy theory, it is  completely debunked.'' He added: ``Let me just repeat here again, it  has no validity.''   And, of course, Ms. Hill, as the question indicated, said ``fictional  narrative that is being perpetrated and propagated by the Russian  security services themselves.''  [[Page S711]]    The U.S. intelligence community has unanimously determined that there  is no validity to this--our own intelligence and law enforcement.  Special Counsel Mueller found that Russia's interference was ``sweeping  and systematic.''   But don't take our own law enforcement and intelligence community's  word for it; let's hear what Vladimir Putin himself said recently about  this. In November of 2019, Mr. Putin was overheard saying: ``Thank God  no one is accusing us of interfering in the U.S. elections anymore. Now  they are accusing Ukraine.''   Let me end with that one because that one demonstrates to me why this  matters. That one demonstrates to me why anyone in the United States  should matter. Vladimir Putin could care less about delivering  healthcare for the people of Russia and building infrastructure in  Russia. Vladimir Putin, as many people in this Chamber know well-- because I have worked with some of you on this--wakes up every morning  and goes to bed every night trying to figure out how to destroy  American democracy, and he has organized the infrastructure of his  government around that effort.   This is a battle over resolve. It is the battle over the hearts and  minds of our people. It is the battle over information and  disinformation. And if a message from the very top of our government,  from the very top of our leaders--if the message from some folks over  the last couple of weeks is that facts don't matter, that our law  enforcement doesn't matter, that our intelligence communities'  unanimous consensus doesn't matter, that is dangerous. That is what  Vladimir Putin and Russia are looking for, and that makes us less safe.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Wisconsin.
