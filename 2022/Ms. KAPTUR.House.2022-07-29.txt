 Mr. Speaker, Americans want their freedom back, and I  would say to my colleague from Ohio (Mr. Jordan), your freedom stops  where mine and that of my constituents begin.   Schools, shopping malls, grocery stores, and Independence Day parades  shouldn't be scenes of mass carnage and bloodshed. Weapons of war have  no place on the streets of America.   An experienced Ohio sheriff says it well: Assault weapons and large- capacity magazines should only be utilized by the military and law  enforcement. A proposal to ban their use is common sense, supported by  a majority of Americans. Until such time that Members of Congress start  to care about the safety of children in our schools more than their  next reelection, mass shootings will continue to occur, and innocent  people will die.   One of the most experienced chiefs of police I represent says the  following: The connection between guns and illicit drugs is 100  percent.   So let's take the two most important steps, remove large-capacity  assault weapons from our streets and arrest the drug dealers who are  creating death and destruction across our country.   Let's give freedom back to the American people.
