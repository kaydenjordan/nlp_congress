 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the great State of  Michigan, and I guess, I would thank Paul for all of the service he has  given this body, has given our country, has given our State.   The morning when I was supposed to first meet Paul, was the same  morning that he announced that he was not running for reelection. He  defined that spirit of making decisive moves.   It is no secret that for the freshman class who have entered, the  past 6 months have been less than normal. I take the assurances of my  colleagues, who have been in this body for many terms, that what we  have seen so far has been atypical. But I cannot thank Paul enough for  the example that he set, for the wisdom that he shared, and for his  perennial, ever-blunt honesty.   All too often people, especially politicians, can walk and dance and  do a jig around the truth. And Paul was always incredibly clear about  where he stood and what he believed. So I am grateful for the  friendship that I have been able to develop with him as a freshman, and  I look forward to many more of those moments.   I want Paul and his family to know that he is in our prayers. My  wife, Gabrielle, and I will keep him in our prayers. The challenges  that he is dealing with are being felt by too many, but I am proud to  call him a friend as he continues to fight on.
