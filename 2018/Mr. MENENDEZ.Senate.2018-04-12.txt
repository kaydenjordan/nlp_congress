 Mr. President, today I want to wish a lifelong  citizen of New Jersey the happiest of birthdays. Grover Connell, Jr.,  celebrates his 100th birthday today. That alone is an accomplishment  that not many people are able to achieve and is worthy of recognition.   Grover Connell, Jr., was born on April 12, 1918, to joyous parents,  Mr. and Mrs. Grover Connell, Sr., who were the founders of a rice  distribution and export business, Connell Rice & Sugar Co. After  serving in the Navy as an officer on a Fletcher Class destroyer from  1942 to 1946 during WWII, Grover succeeded his late father and moved  the business to a modern building near their family residence in  Westfield, NJ, in 1950. There, he expanded his business, and by the  1970s, Connell Rice & Sugar Co. became one of largest exporters of  domestically grown rice, serving over 100 countries around the world.  With the growing success of the family-owned business, Grover extended  his scope of operations and became involved with a vast variety of  services and products, and the business was renamed the Connell  Company.   The Connell Company has provided thousands of jobs to New Jersey  residents with its business of leasing, distributing, and selling  construction equipment; brokering and selling canned food products;  offering asset management services in the technology sector; and  arranging financing of leased equipment and commercial property  development. Today, under the leadership of Grover Connell, Jr., the  Connell Company is one of the greatest known brokers of domestically  grown rice. Thanks to love and support of his late wife, Patricia, his  two daughters, Terry and Toni, and his three grandsons, Shane, Duane,  and Sean, the Connell Company continues to grow while remaining a  privately held, family-run company.   I applaud and honor the exemplary life of Grover Connell, Jr., for  his sacrifice and service to our Nation and nations around the world  and for his ambition and humility throughout his life. New Jersey is  better today for his relentless hard work and dedication. I am  immensely proud to have him as a constituent, and I hope that his 100th  year is the best one yet.                            ____________________
