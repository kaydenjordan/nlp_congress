 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Buck) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, last week, many of us spent our time in the district  working, meeting with our constituents, seeing the good work that  people are doing, and learning what issues people want us to take up  when we return to voting.   I wish I were before you lauding the majority's leadership for  finally taking up the most important and pressing work for our  constituents, but, unfortunately, that is not the case. Instead, this  rule brings three bills to the floor, three bills none of my  constituents have been pleading for, three bills that don't require  immediate action, bills that may not even see Senate consideration.   Last year, this majority set the record for the most closed rules in  a session, and it seems that nothing has changed.   The first bill considered in this rule is H.R. 2152, the Citizens'  Right to Know Act. While I understand the goal of this legislation, by  attempting to improve the pretrial services programs to keep dangerous  criminals off the streets, this bill fails to accomplish the real need  to improve how our Nation's flawed bail systems operate. While this  bill received a markup, it received no hearings and was reported out of  the Judiciary Committee on a straight party-line vote. Surely, we can  do better than this.   The second bill we are considering is H.R. 5645, the Standard Merger  and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act, or SMARTER Act. Quite  simply, this bill aims to weaken the Federal Trade Commission's ability  to carry out the agency's antitrust responsibilities.   Maybe things are different elsewhere in the country, but I have not  had one constituent call my office complaining about the need to weaken  the FTC's antitrust enforcement abilities. No. People in southern  California are more concerned about good wages, finding affordable  housing, and getting their children a good education. However, again,  we will take up this legislation, which already died in the Senate last  Congress. This legislation undermines the independence of the FTC and  undercuts the congressional intent and purpose for the agency's  creation.   There are far more important issues under the jurisdiction of the  Judiciary Committee that we should be considering instead, including  bipartisan gun safety measures and legislation to protect Dreamers.  However, instead of considering these very important issues facing our  Nation, we are debating a bill to make technical changes to antitrust  laws that, if enacted, would only be used in exceedingly rare  situations.   Finally, the third legislation included in this rule is S.J. Res. 57,  a Congressional Review Act disapproval resolution of a CFPB rule  relating to ``Indirect Auto Lending and Compliance with the Equal  Credit Opportunity Act.'' Unlike the other two bills included in this  rule, this joint resolution hasn't seen a single hearing or markup in  the House.   If the majority is fine with bringing up legislation that has yet to  have a hearing, why not bring up the Dream Act?   Two weeks ago, I spoke about some of the more important issues our  constituents care about, and nothing about my time back home in  California changed my beliefs of what we should be working on. In fact,  over the past 2 weeks, we have seen even more Members sign on to  Representative Denham's Queen of the Hill resolution. Three more  Members of the majority now support an open process.   For those who may not understand what Queen of the Hill means, it is  really quite simple: let the best idea win.   If Speaker Ryan allows us, Queen of the Hill would give all the  competing immigration proposals in Congress a vote on the floor. All of  us would have an opportunity to vote on the four most well-known  proposals: the Dream Act, Chairman Goodlatte's bill, the USA Act, and  any other bill the Speaker sees fit for a vote. This is how the House  should work: an open process where we take up the most important issues  of the day.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule we have before  us.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my Republican friends like to claim that their tax scam  bill they jammed through Congress last year, skewing all the benefits  to the wealthy and rich corporations, is some sort of panacea that will  eventually trickle down all of its benefits to American workers, curing  all the ills in our economy. That tired idea hasn't worked before, and  it isn't working now.   But don't take my word for it. Just ask the Republican Senator from  Florida, Marco Rubio, who said in a recent interview: ``There is still  a lot of thinking on the right that, if big corporations are happy,  they're going to take the money they're saving and reinvest in American  workers. In fact, they bought back shares; a few gave out bonuses;  there's no evidence whatsoever that money's been massively poured back  into the American worker.''   All this Republican majority seems intent on doing is bringing up  bills that benefit large banks and big businesses. When are we going to  do something for workers?   As we toil on rolling back the Wall Street regulations and cutting  taxes for the richest corporations, the 21st century economy is  changing. Mr. Speaker, over the next decade, approximately 45 percent  of all jobs will be in middle-skill occupations, which require more  than a high school diploma but less than a bachelor's degree.  Registered apprenticeship programs are a vital element of training for  these middle-skill occupations and helping individuals contribute to an  effective workforce.   A highly skilled workforce is necessary to compete in today's global  economy, but this Republican majority has given working Americans a raw  deal instead of extending a helping hand. Luckily for my Republican  colleagues, today we will give them an opportunity to vote on  legislation that will actually benefit American workers and finally  help them get a better deal.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Pocan's LEARNS Act,  H.R. 2933, which would promote effective registered apprenticeships  that would give students and workers the skills they need to find well- paying jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As I mentioned, this rule includes three bills. One of those is H.R.  2152, the Citizens' Right to Know Act. The Citizens' Right to Know Act  fails to address the real problems in our Nation's bail system and,  instead, threatens to make things much, much worse.   I don't think many of us disagree with the need to assist our local  governments in keeping dangerous criminals off the streets while  respecting the rights of those who may be innocent of crimes and have  yet to have had their day in court. This legislation makes things  worse. It threatens Federal assistance and would encourage local  governments to lean more on high bail demands.   Unlike many bipartisan proposals in Congress which seek to make real  improvements to bail, this bill will likely result in more low-income  individuals being kept in jail simply because they aren't one of the  fortunate who can afford to pay bail. This is a real issue in southern  California and why I have worked with my colleagues on legislation to  implement ``ability-to-pay'' rules to bail demands. Your income  shouldn't determine your freedom.   In our community, bail was so excessive that private companies found  a way to get rich off people who couldn't afford to pay the high costs.  We ended up with people stuck in permanent contracts, paying hundreds  of dollars a month to companies that found ways to skirt the rules of  bail bondsmen.   We support greater transparency in our criminal justice system;  however, this bill falls short of that goal. Rather than shedding the  light on our trial system, this bill undermines Americans' privacy  rights and exposes defendants to vulnerability.   The American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU, has come out in strong  opposition to this bill, citing privacy concerns due to the personally  identifiable information that will be collected and publicly reported  by the Federal Government.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the text of the ACLU's position  letter.                                 American Civil Liberties Union,                                      Washington, DC, March 7, 2018.      Re ACLU Opposes H.R. 2152, the Citizens' Right to Know Act of           2017.       Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Nadler: On       behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), we write       to express our opposition to H.R. 2152, the Citizens' Right       to Know Act of 2017,'' as the House Judiciary Committee       considers this bill. This legislation raises privacy concerns       for the ACLU given the personally identifiable data that is       to be collected and publicly reported by the federal       government. The bill also undermines efforts to eliminate or       reduce jurisdictions' reliance on money bail systems. We urge       the Committee to instead consider H.R. 1437, the ``No Money       Bail Act of 2017,'' and H.R. 4019, the bipartisan ``Pretrial       Integrity and Safety Act of 2017,'' two bills endorsed by the       ACLU.        For nearly 100 years, the ACLU has been our nation's       guardian of liberty, working in courts, legislatures, and       communities to defend and preserve the individual rights and       liberties that the Constitution and the laws of the United       States guarantee everyone in this country. The ACLU takes up       the toughest civil liberties cases and issues to defend all       people from government abuse and overreach. With more than       two million members, activists, and supporters, the ACLU is a       nationwide organization that fights tirelessly in all 50       states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, DC, for the principle       that every individual's rights must be protected equally       under the law, regardless of race, religion, gender, sexual       orientation, disability, or national origin. The Citizens'       Right to Know Act is inconsistent with the ACLU's mission.           The Citizens' Right to Know Act Raises Privacy Concerns         The Citizens' Right to Know Act requires jurisdictions       receiving funds from the Department of Justice (DOJ) to       report to the Attorney General the names, arrest records, and       appearance failures for those participating in DOJ funded       pretrial services programs. The legislation allows the       Attorney General to make public the names, arrest records,       and failure appearances that jurisdictions report. Except for       a clause that subjects the data ``to any applicable       confidentiality requirements,'' the bill does not provide any       explicit privacy protections for those whose personally       identifiable information has been collected by the federal       government and is subject to public release. The bill       requires that the Attorney General penalize noncompliant       jurisdictions by denying them 100% of the DOJ grant program       funds that are used to support pretrial services programs.        While the ACLU appreciates the need for the federal       government to collect and report data, personal privacy       interests must be balanced with public interests. When       personally identifiable information is being collected and       publicly reported, the ACLU largely believes that such       information should be obtained and disseminated only with       individuals' informed consent. We also believe that the       potential to harm individual reputations should be considered       when arrest records are publicly shared. We are troubled that       the Citizens' Right to Know Act would collect and publicly       report personally identifiable information of individuals       participating in pretrial services programs--individuals who       have not been convicted of a crime given their pretrial       status.  [[Page H3794]]             The Citizens' Right to Know Act Undermines Bail Reform Efforts         The Citizens' Right to Know Act is inconsistent with       bipartisan efforts to reform money bail systems, like the       Pretrial Integrity and Safety Act, which the ACLU endorses.       By collecting and reporting only certain data about pretrial       services programs and those participating in them, the       Citizens' Right to Know Act will depict a one-sided picture       of pretrial services programs and participants. For example,       the legislation's focus on when an individual has failed to       appear promises a negative narrative around the pretrial       stage. If this bill were serious about measuring the true       impact of pretrial services programs, it would collect a more       robust data set and not that which is of interest only to the       bail bonds industry.        The ACLU supports bail reform that corrects the injustice       of basing a defendant's release on how much money the person       has. Instead of considering the Citizens' Right to Know Act,       the Committee should take up the Pretrial Integrity and       Safety Act. This legislation would incentive jurisdictions to       reform their money bail systems through federal resources       rather than penalize them like the Citizens' Right to Know       Act, which denies DOJ grants to noncompliant jurisdictions.       The Pretrial Integrity and Safety Act would build safer       communities, stronger families, and a fairer criminal justice       system by ensuring that people who are innocent in the eyes       of the law are not deprived of their freedom because they       cannot afford money bail.        For the above described reasons, the ACLU urges Members of       the House Judiciary Committee against favorably reporting out       the Citizens' Right to Know Act. Instead, we encourage the       Committee to give serious consideration to bail reform bills       through legislative and oversight hearings on the issue. If       you have any questions, please contact Kanya Bennett,       Legislative Counsel with the ACLU.            Sincerely,      Faiz Shakir,        National Political Director.      Kanya Bennett,        Legislative Counsel.     Mr. Speaker, this bill fails to provide explicit privacy  protections for the individuals whose personal information will be  collected and subject to public release, and jurisdictions that fail to  comply with these reporting requirements face the severe penalty of  losing 100 percent of their DOJ pretrial services grant funding.   Not only does this bill fail to require consent from the defendants  to publicly release information about their alleged crimes and their  private information, but it also poses the very real threat of  destroying their reputation. These individuals have not been convicted  of a crime nor have they had their day in court, given their pretrial  status.   These are the concerns that could have been raised if this  legislation was given a full, robust debate through committee hearings.   I am disappointed that my amendment to this bill, which would have  addressed one of the many abuses perpetrated by the money bail system,  was not made in order. My amendment would have prohibited predatory  companies from locking people into seemingly lifetime contracts of  monthly fees.   We can do better. These are bipartisan issues. For this reason and  many other concerns I have with the closed process we are operating  under, I must oppose this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question and  the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
