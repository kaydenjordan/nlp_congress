 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   H.R. 6800 is anything but a wish list for Democrats. Instead, the  HEROES Act means everything to the people in all of our congressional  districts.   States and cities across our country are losing revenue that will  lead to a loss of services and our safety. The funding in this bill  shores up those services and our security, especially for our small  cities.   The PPP benefits small businesses, but it needs to be expanded and  easier to understand. This bill provides those improvements, as well as  more testing and tracing, help for renters and owners, broadband for  kids, purchases for farmers, and protections for farmworkers.   So when you call this a wish list, know that it is our constituents  who are wishing for funding so that they can fight and defeat this  pandemic.
