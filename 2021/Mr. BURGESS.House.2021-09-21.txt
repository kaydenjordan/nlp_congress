 Mr. Speaker, the National Defense Authorization Act  includes a provision requiring women now to register for the Selective  Service. We all know that men have 30 days from their 18th birthday to  register for the Selective Service in case a draft becomes necessary.  Of course, we also know the last draft was during the Nixon  administration in 1972.   We are fortunate to have an all-volunteer military force, and we know  that our citizens unite in times of need. The Selective Service System  has outlived its necessity.    However, since it remains a requirement, we must not fundamentally  change the relationship between the government and the governed by  adding a provision to add women to the draft in this massive defense  bill.   A change of this magnitude requires its own vote by every Member  representing their constituents. I supported an amendment to strike  this language from the bill by the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs.  Greene), but unfortunately the Democrats are not permitting its  consideration on the floor.   I think this is a mistake. I think we should be heard. I think we  should be transparent, we should be recorded, and then let's get on  with the business of replacing the Selective Service System.
