SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Stop, Observe, Ask, and       Respond to Health and Wellness Act of 2018'' or the ``SOAR to       Health and Wellness Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

CUT-GO COMPLIANCE.         Subsection (f) of section 319D of the Public Health Service       Act (42 U.S.C. 247d-4) is amended by striking ``through       2018'' and inserting ``through 2017, and $118,300,000 for       fiscal year 2018''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material into the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 767, the Stop, Observe,  Ask, and Respond to Health and Wellness Act of 2018, introduced by our  colleague, Representative  Steve Cohen from Tennessee.   This bill will help in the fight against human trafficking.  Worldwide, nearly 21 million people are victims of human trafficking,  forced labor, or exploitation. This bipartisan initiative expands and  further codifies the Department of Health and Human Services' Stop,  Observe, Ask, and Respond program, which enhances the healthcare  system's response to human trafficking by requiring the program to  provide grants to healthcare sites, to work with stakeholders to  develop flexible training modules, and to provide technical assistance  to health education programs. This legislation will teach health  professionals to identify and to respond to victims of human  trafficking.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger), a valuable member of the Committee on Energy  and Commerce and, in fact, the vice chairman of the Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, this is a worthwhile bill. I urge my  colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 880) to amend the Public Health Service Act to facilitate  assignment of military trauma care providers to civilian trauma centers  in order to maintain military trauma readiness and to support such  centers, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 880         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Military Injury Surgical       Systems Integrated Operationally Nationwide to Achieve ZERO       Preventable Deaths Act'' or the ``MISSION ZERO Act''.       SEC. 2.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material into the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, 40 years ago I was an intern and resident at Parkland  Hospital in Dallas. Any intern or resident will tell you the month of  July is significant in the life of an intern or resident. You were last  week's medical student, and you are this week's intern managing the  emergency room; or you were last year's intern, and you are this week's  house officer managing perhaps a busy practice, perhaps a busy  emergency room. As such, every intern and resident remembers the end of  that first week of their internship or residency. It is just something  that you do. You got through the first week of what was a very trying  time. So I remember well July 7 of my internship, July 7 of my  residency.   Mr. Speaker, in 2016, July 7 also took on additional significance in  Dallas, Texas. Five police officers were killed and 9 more were injured  during a shooting in downtown Dallas. In the immediate aftermath of the  attack, area hospitals sprang into action and activated their disaster  plans. I am proud to say that the staff at Parkland Hospital, the staff  at Baylor University Hospital, and other medical professionals provided  excellent emergency care to the victims of the attack.   Mr. Speaker, it is critical that we have people who are able to  respond when called. Now, additionally, I have long believed that the  American military is the arsenal of democracy and that it is critical  for upholding freedom in the world. Each member of the United States  Armed Forces has an important role in a collective team effort. This is  especially true in a combat zone, where trauma surgeons are some of the  most crucial members of the Armed Forces. These medical professionals  are trained to save the lives of soldiers who sustain traumatic  injuries on the battlefield, and they are some of the best in the  business.   However, as wars wind down and our soldiers come home, the experience  that military trauma surgeons have gained overseas may be diminished or  lost unless these surgeons continue to train and to prepare for their  next possible deployment. To let this expertise and skill drift away  would be a significant loss to trauma patients, both at home and  abroad. Trauma, Mr. Speaker, is not limited to the battlefields and  active conflicts. Unfortunately, no community is immune from the threat  of traumatic injury, and community doctors must be prepared to give  lifesaving care to trauma victims.   However, there is a way that we can ensure trained combat surgeons'  skills are utilized to help American patients here in the homeland who  need it. The MISSION ZERO Act seeks to connect American patients with  battle-tested trauma care through the craft of military trauma care  providers. The bill provides grants to allow military trauma care  providers and teams to offer care in our Nation's leading trauma  centers and systems.   Here is the bottom line: the MISSION ZERO Act is a win for both  civilian patients and military trauma doctors.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that this bipartisan legislation has  finally come  [[Page H1238]]  to the floor. Along with my fellow Texan, Mr. Gene Green, I introduced  this bill in 2016 following that particularly traumatic incident that  struck so close to home.   Texas is not unique in its need for this expertise. Over the last few  months alone, our Nation has witnessed a need for trauma care hospitals  across the country. One such incident was the Amtrak derailment near  Dupont, Washington, on December 18, 2017. That incident resulted in 3  passenger fatalities and 70 injuries over a busy freeway.   As we have seen, having access to experienced trauma care can become  the difference between life and death for a critically injured patient.  There is no doubt that integrating military physicians into the trauma  and disaster system is beneficial not only for American patients, but  also for American soldiers.   I am encouraged by the bipartisan effort to support both our  servicemen and our Nation's trauma system, and I thank the cosponsors  from both sides of the aisle for their support of this important  legislation.   Quite simply, the MISSION ZERO Act is common sense, and I urge  Members to join me in supporting this lifesaving legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill. I urge my  colleagues to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1222) to amend the Public Health Service Act to coordinate  Federal congenital heart disease research efforts and to improve public  education and awareness of congenital heart disease, and for other  purposes, as amended.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1222, the Congenital  Heart Futures Reauthorization Act, introduced by my Energy and Commerce  colleague, Representative Gus Bilirakis from Florida.   This important initiative will enhance current Federal efforts  addressing congenital heart disease, which is the most common birth  defect and leading cause of mortality in infants. This bipartisan  legislation enhances research and surveillance at the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention, awards grants to further study  congenital heart disease, and directs the National Institutes of Health  to report on their current research efforts in this space.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), the principal author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, having no further speakers, I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2410) to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize  a sickle cell disease prevention and treatment demonstration program  and to provide for sickle cell disease research, surveillance,  prevention, and treatment.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous material into the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2410, the Sickle  Cell Disease Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment Act of  2017, introduced by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis).  This reauthorizes the sickle cell disease prevention and treatment  demonstration program.   Sickle cell disease causes blockages of small vessels leading to  various health complications. By improving research, surveillance,  prevention, and treatment, along with enhancing collaboration with  community-based entities focussing on sickle cell disease, this  important legislation will help improve outcomes in patients suffering  from this inherited blood disorder, which currently affects 1 in 500  African-American births.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I was surprised to learn at the legislative hearing that  we had on this bill--and it has been now several months ago--that there  had not been a new FDA-approved treatment for sickle cell in 40 year's  time. Now, my understanding is that may have changed recently, but that  is way too long. We do need to improve research, surveillance,  prevention, and treatment, and really take care of those patients who  are suffering with this disease.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill, and I thank Mr. Davis for bringing  it to our attention.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2422) to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve  essential oral health care for low-income and other underserved  individuals by breaking down barriers to care, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2422         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Action for Dental Health Act       of 2017''.       SEC. 2. VOLUNTEER DENTAL PROJECTS AND ACTION FOR DENTAL                     HEALTH PROGRAM.         Section 317M of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.       247b-14) is amended--        (1) by redesignating subsections (e) and (f) as subsections       (f) and (g), respectively;        (2) by inserting after subsection (d) the following new       subsection:        ``(e) Action for Dental Health Program.--        ``(1) In general.--The Secretary, in consultation with the       Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention       and the Administrator of the Health Resources and Service       Administration, may award grants to or enter into contracts       with eligible entities to collaborate with State, county, or       local public officials and other stakeholders to develop and       implement initiatives to accomplish any of the following       goals:        ``(A) To improve oral health education and dental disease       prevention, including through community-wide prevention       programs, through the use of dental sealants and fluoride       varnish, and by increasing oral health literacy.        ``(B) To reduce geographic barriers, language barriers,       cultural barriers, and other similar barriers to the       provision of dental services.        ``(2) Eligible entity.--In this subsection, the term       `eligible entity' means an entity that is--        ``(A) a State or local dental association;        ``(B) a State oral health program;        ``(C) a dental education, dental hygiene, or postdoctoral       dental education program accredited by the Commission on       Dental Accreditation; or        ``(D) a community-based organization that--        ``(i) partners with an academic institution;        ``(ii) is exempt from tax under section 501(c) of the       Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and        ``(iii) partners with public and private stakeholders to       facilitate the provision of dental services for underserved       populations.''; and        (3) in subsection (g), as redesignated by paragraph (1), by       striking ``such sums as may be necessary for each of the       fiscal years 2001 through 2005'' and inserting ``$18,000,000       for each of the fiscal years 2018 through 2022''.       SEC. 3. GRANTS FOR INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS.         Section 340G of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.       256g) is amended--        (1) in subsection (b)(5)--        (A) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``and'' at the end;       and        (B) by adding at the end the following:        ``(D) the establishment of dental homes for children and       adults, including for the aged, blind, and disabled       populations;        ``(E) the establishment of initiatives to reduce the use of       emergency departments by individuals who seek dental services       more appropriately delivered in a dental primary care       setting; and        ``(F) the provision of dental care to nursing home       residents;''; and        (2) in subsection (f), by striking ``$25,000,000 for the 5-      fiscal year period beginning with fiscal year 2008'' and       inserting ``$13,903,000 for each of fiscal years 2018 through       2022''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material into the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 2422, the Action for  Dental Health Act of 2017, introduced by Representative Robin Kelly.   The bill reauthorizes the oral health promotion and disease  prevention programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  and permits the CDC to award grants or enter into contracts with  stakeholders to develop projects to improve oral health education and  dental disease prevention. This bill also reauthorizes HRSA's Grants to  States to Support Oral Health Workforce Activities and permits States  to establish dental homes, mobile or portable dental clinics,  initiatives to reduce the use of emergency departments by patients  seeking dental services, and initiatives to provide dental care to  nursing home residents.   Good oral health is an important component of good overall health,  and this bill takes important steps to help improve the dental care in  underserved communities.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill, and I urge passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 443) recognizing the importance and  effectiveness of trauma-informed care, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 443         Whereas traumatic experiences affect millions of people in       the United States and can affect a person's mental,       emotional, physical, spiritual, economic, and social well-      being;        Whereas adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) can be       traumatizing and, if not recognized, can affect health across       the lifespan and, in some cases, result in a shortened life       span;        Whereas ACEs are recognized as a proxy for toxic stress,       which can affect brain development and can cause a lifetime       of physical, mental, and social challenges;        Whereas ACEs and trauma are determinants of public health       problems in the United States such as obesity, addiction, and       serious mental illness;        Whereas trauma-informed care is an approach that can bring       greater understanding and more effective ways to support and       serve children, adults, families, and communities affected by       trauma;        Whereas trauma-informed care is not a therapy or an       intervention, but a principle-based, culture-change process       aimed at recognizing strengths and resiliency as well as       helping people who have experienced trauma to overcome those       issues in order to lead healthy and positive lives;        Whereas adopting trauma-informed approaches in workplaces,       communities, and government programs can aid in preventing       mental, emotional, physical, and/or social issues for people       impacted by toxic stress and/or trauma;        Whereas trauma-informed care has been promoted and       established in communities across the United States,       including the following different uses of trauma-informed       care being utilized by various types of entities:        (1) The State of Wisconsin established Fostering Futures, a       statewide initiative partnering the State with Tribes, State       agencies, county governments, and nonprofit organizations to       make Wisconsin the first trauma-informed State. The goal of       Fostering Futures is to reduce toxic stress and improve       lifelong health and well-being for all Wisconsinites.        (2) The Menominee Tribe in Wisconsin improved educational       and public health outcomes by increasing understanding of       historical trauma and childhood adversity and by developing       culturally relevant, trauma-informed practices.        (3) In Chicago, Illinois, schools of medicine provide       critical trauma-informed care, including the University of       Illinois at Chicago Comprehensive Assessment and Response       Training System, which improves the quality of psychiatric       services provided to youth in foster care, and the University       of Chicago Recovery & Empowerment After Community Trauma       Initiative, which helps residents who are coping with       community violence.        (4) In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, service providers,       academics, and local artists use art to engage their       community to educate and involve citizens in trauma-informed       care activities.        (5) In San Francisco, California, the city's public health       department aligned its workforce to create a trauma-informed       system.        (6) In Kansas City, Missouri, schools worked to become       trauma-informed by encouraging teachers and children to       create their own self-care plans to manage stress. They have       implemented broad communitywide, trauma-informed culture       change.        (7) In Tarpon Springs, Florida, the city crafted a       community effort to gather city officials, professionals, and       residents to coordinate multiple trauma-informed activities,       including a community education day.        (8) In Worcester, Massachusetts, community members worked       with the Massachusetts State Department of Mental Health to       create a venue with peer-to-peer support to better engage       individuals dealing with trauma or extreme emotional       distress.        (9) In Walla Walla, Washington, the city and community       members launched the Children's Resilience Initiative to       mobilize neighborhoods and Washington State agencies to       tackle ACEs.        (10) The State of Oregon passed the first law to promote       trauma-informed approaches to decrease rates of school       absenteeism and understanding and promoting best practices to       leverage community resources to support youth.        (11) The State of Massachusetts passed a law to promote       whole-school efforts to implement trauma-informed care       approaches to support the social, emotional, and academic       well-being of all students, including both preventive and       intensive services and supports depending on students' needs.        (12) The State of Washington implemented the ACEs Public-      Private Initiative, a collaboration among private, public,       and community organizations to research and inform policies       to prevent childhood trauma and reduce its negative       emotional, social, and health effects;        Whereas the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services       Administration provides substantial resources to better       engage individuals and communities across the United  [[Page H1245]]       States to implement trauma-informed care; and        Whereas numerous Federal agencies have integrated trauma-      informed approaches into their programs and grants and could       benefit from closer collaboration: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) recognizes the importance, effectiveness, and need for       trauma-informed care among existing programs and agencies at       the Federal level; and        (2) encourages the use and practice of trauma-informed care       within the Federal Government, its agencies, and the United       States Congress.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material into the Record on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of Representative  Mike  Gallagher's H. Res. 443, which recognizes the importance and  effectiveness of trauma-informed care.   According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration, trauma results from an event or a series of events that  cause intense physical and psychological stress reactions. The  individual's functioning and emotional, physical, social, and spiritual  health can be severely affected. It is important that health providers  understand the nature and impact of trauma when caring for their  patients.   H. Res. 443 highlights the work of States in trauma-informed care and  encourages the Federal Government to build on the States' momentum by  identifying opportunities to embed this approach to care within current  Federal health operations.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher), the principal author of this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This is an important resolution. I urge its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   1986 was the last time our Tax Code was refined. I had been  practicing medicine for 5 years. Now, some 31 years later and after 15  years in Congress, the reformation of our Tax Code has made a profound  difference in our country.   Mr. Speaker, it is not lost on me that the rhetoric prior to the vote  on the conference report on the tax bill was pretty negative. The idea  was to sow doubt in the minds of people who would be affected by the  tax bill, to sow doubt in the minds of people who would otherwise be  wanting to vote for tax relief for tax improvement.   And I will have to tell you something: after that vote--and Mr.  Mitchell referenced Southwest Airlines and American Airlines--I cannot  remember having ever had the positive feedback for a vote that I have  taken here in this Congress like there was for this tax vote.   In my own Walmart, the week after Christmas, people were coming up to  me saying, ``I work for American Airlines,'' or ``I work for Southwest  Airlines.'' I have a lot of families in the 26th District of Texas who  work for American Airlines or Southwest Airlines, and they all got  $1,000 bonuses because of the tax relief that we had provided. Again, I  cannot ever remember having that much positive reinforcement on a bill  that, quite honestly, the rhetoric going into it was pretty negative.   The benefits have been immediate, as indicated by the increases in  salaries and bonuses paid to employees. And Southwest Airlines, in  addition to the bonuses to their employees, donated $5 million to  charity, as well as made some capital improvements.   FedEx, which, of course, employs people all over the country, but has  a big hub in the district that I represent, is going to spend $133  million increasing hourly wages, as well as $67 million on programs for  salaried employees, and, get this, $3 billion on their pension plan and  capital improvements. That is a pretty big turnaround.    The good folks at Peterbilt trucks, located in the 26th District of  Texas, received over $170 million in tax benefits in the fourth quarter  of 2017, as a direct result of this tax bill. Peterbilt also estimates  that its 2018 effective global tax rate will be reduced by up to 8  percent and that the lower corporate tax rate and accelerated  depreciation will, indeed, stimulate capital investment.   The increased prosperity of these and other companies will  subsequently improve the financial situation of their employees.  Coupled with a nearly doubled standard deduction, income for most  individuals and families will, in fact, increase.   Chairman Brady mentioned filing taxes on a postcard. Mr. Speaker,  when I first came to Congress, I really wanted us to enact a flat tax.  I still do. But I will take the improvement that we have gotten, the  gift of time, back to, what, 85 to 90 percent of tax filers who no  longer are going to have to keep up with that shoebox full of receipts  and spend quality time with their accountants every March and April as  they prepare their Federal tax return. We are going to allow people to  pay for necessities, without having to worry about other discretionary  items and services, often provided by small businesses.   Local improvements in economic condition will not only benefit Main  Street business owners, but I like to say it is going to benefit Elm  Street business owners. That is the small business off of Main Street.  It is going to allow people to spend money across State lines.  Increased financial mobility will inject capital into the market and  continue the growth of our economy.                                time  2130    Look, we are right on the verge of some pretty significant and  profound economic changes that are going to be beneficial, I predict,  to all Americans. This is an important time in this country, time for  us to get to work and deliver for the American people.
