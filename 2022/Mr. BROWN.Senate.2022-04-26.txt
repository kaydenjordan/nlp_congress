 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up  to 90 seconds.    Madam President, as America faces rising prices caused by  corporate greed in a global pandemic and Putin's war, having a full Fed  Board has never been more vital. Today, we take the first step.   Dr. Brainard is a highly qualified economist with decades of  experience. She served as a member of the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve since 2014. She championed efforts to modernize and  strengthen the Community Reinvestment Act. She is committed to  addressing and staying ahead of financial risks to our economy. She has  a long history of bipartisan support and collaboration. She served in  administrations of both parties.   I urge my colleagues to support the nomination and to vote for Lael  Brainard to the Federal Reserve.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture vote with respect to the Cook  nomination occur at a time to be determined by the majority leader  following consultation with the Republican leader; further, that prior  to April 29, 2022, the  [[Page S2143]]  Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following two  nominations: Calendar No. 807, Jerome H. Powell, and Calendar No. 809,  Philip Nathan Jefferson; that there be 60 minutes for debate, equally  divided in the usual form, on each nomination; that upon the use or  yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote without intervening  action or debate on the nominations in the order listed; that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order;  that any related statements be printed in the Record; that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; and that the  Senate then resume legislative session.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3  minutes.    Madam President, I understand that the objection holds-- that the ranking member of the Senate's Banking, Housing, and Urban  Affairs Committee is essentially saying he is not willing to vote on  all three of these--two of them right now, the other one a bit later. I  mean, it could be right now. Again, we have tried to move on these  nominations.   My friend from Pennsylvania launched a boycott of a committee that I  have never seen or a boycott which actually, because of the 50-50  Senate, stopped us--literally stopped us--from holding a vote. He knows  that, and he knows they have done everything they can to stop Lisa  Cook's nomination--everything.   I would point out also that it is not exactly an accurate version of  history. Judy Shelton, whom my colleague mentioned, would have gone  down if everybody had been there. He forgets that part. It wasn't just  one Republican Member who was sick; it was another Republican Member  who was going to vote no, and he understood the array of people in both  parties who were opposed to Ms. Shelton.   In understanding that, my colleague is saying let's not vote on any  of the three of them--on either the two of them today and then Lisa  Cook later. I understand the rules of the Senate, and that is the way  it will be.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I reserve the right to object.   I was going to say it is disappointing--I guess ``appalling'' would  be the better word--but it is not at all surprising because I have  watched my colleagues do everything they can to slow and delay, even  boycott actual votes en bloc. I have watched what they have done to  these nominees and watched them continue to play politics with our  economy.   They have been AWOL on the fight against inflation for months. They  talk about it a whole lot, but they don't really have solutions. Yet  they haven't abandoned their tax cuts for the corporations that are  raising people's prices, as the Presiding Officer knows and has spoken  passionately about the companies that are making more and more and more  money all the time--the biggest profits in American history. These  companies continue to raise prices because they can; but my colleagues,  when they have had opportunities to get talented, qualified women on  the job to fight inflation at the Fed, they have blocked them.   Today, about an hour and a half, 2 hours ago, we offered to vote,  right now, to get Chair Powell and Dr. Philip Jefferson on the Fed  Board immediately, and part of that motion was to delay the vote on Dr.  Lisa Cook until all of our Members are here and healthy.   My colleague on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee  understands that a number of Senate Democrats were sick today and  couldn't come and vote. So we just said in our motion: Yes, let's go  ahead and vote on Chair Powell--I am going to vote for him--and let's  go ahead and vote on Dr. Jefferson. I am going to vote for him, too,  and virtually all of my colleagues are, but let's just hold off on Dr.  Cook because it is a close vote.   Every single Republican is voting against a very qualified and the  first African-American woman to be on the Federal Reserve in its 109- year-old history, but Senator Toomey objected to those two votes and  with the request to just delay Dr. Cook for a time until Members could  come back. He would rather play politics. He continues to denigrate  this distinguished nominee--again, the first Black woman to ever be  nominated to the Fed. For some reason, the Republican members of my  committee take great joy in trying to embarrass this nominee by saying  she is not qualified.   Not qualified? Spelman College.   Not qualified? A Marshall Scholar.   Not qualified? A Truman Scholar.   Not qualified? Studied at Oxford.   Not qualified? Has a Ph.D. from Berkeley.   These are all some of the greatest schools in the country.   Not qualified? An economist at Michigan State University--one of the  great State institutions in my part of the country. That is not  qualified? Dr. Cook is a leading economist, with years of research and  international experience in monetary policy on banking and financial  crises.   Maybe this is what my colleagues don't like: She has seen how  economic policy affects all kinds of different people in different  parts of the country--from the rural South, where she grew up, to the  industrial Midwest, where she built a career. These are two parts of  the country that have been particularly affected in a negative way by  globalization.   Again, she is a Spelman College alumna, a Marshall Scholar, a Truman  Scholar; studied at Oxford; has a Ph.D. from Berkeley; is a tenured  professor for economics and international relations in the State just  north of me--in East Lansing, MI, at Michigan State University.   Yet, despite this extensive experience and her broad support, a small  but excruciatingly loud--if I could use that adverb--minority, far  outside the mainstream, has engaged in a smear campaign against Dr.  Cook, the same sorts of attacks that Black Americans and women have  faced for far too long.   I won't recite the litany of votes in my committee against very  qualified women and very qualified African-American women. Senate  Republicans buy into these attacks and in some cases are making these  attacks.   These naysayers absurdly claim that Lisa Cook doesn't meet the  standards for this position, standards that seem to apply only to  certain nominees who happen to be women, particularly Black women.   It is sort of a game of Whac-A-Mole. Each time these assertions and  these allegations are rebutted, a new, more untethered one seems to  arise.   Dr. Cook would be--and I would assert. I don't just assert. I am  certain she will be the first Black woman on the Federal Reserve in its  more than 100-year history.   Think about that. This is a country that in my State--the ranking  member's State--10 to 15 percent are African Americans. In this  country, about 12 or 13 percent are Black. The Federal Reserve is made  up of seven people. In 1913, it was founded. In 109 years, there has  never been a Black woman. We have a chance to put an outstanding, very  qualified Black woman on, and for some reason, they say no.   We are going to confirm her once our Members are healthy. There are a  couple of Members who missed it. I believe it is two because of COVID.  They are  [[Page S2145]]  going to come back, and we are going to confirm her. But for some  reason, the ranking member of the committee would like to just  embarrass Dr. Cook a little bit more.   First, they make all these unwarranted attacks. Then they block her  in committee. Then they--well, they called a boycott to stop any  committee action on another very qualified woman. And I might add,  parenthetically, because the oil industry didn't like her.   One of the things I particularly like about Dr. Cook is she  understands--and maybe this is the objection. They want a Federal  Reserve that is more sort of corporate-dominated, corporate-oriented  instead of putting workers at the center of our economy.   I know Senator Merkley has been one of the leaders here, always  understanding that workers should be the center of this economy. That  is what Dr. Cook will do in the Federal Reserve.   She understands the smalltown South. She understands the industrial  Midwest. She has worked on the west coast. She has worked all over this  country. She is international in the way she looks at things. But,  fundamentally, she comes down to ordinary, middle-class people and  those who aspire to the middle class.   She is ready to get to work to protect Americans from rising prices.  We need her. We need all of President Biden's nominees on the job right  now.   But, again, Senate Republicans could have earlier said yes--he didn't  have to object--yes, we will go forward with Powell; we will go forward  with Jefferson, but we want to embarrass Dr. Cook first. We want to  show that we have the political muscle to defeat a really, really,  really accomplished Black woman first.   That is what they decided, that scoring political points is more  important than serving the public and bringing down prices.   So today, once again, a qualified Black woman is going to have to  wait. A qualified Black woman is going to have to wait and wait and  wait. We are going to confirm her, but she is going to have to wait a  little bit longer until the two Members of the Senate who are sick can  return.   The American people are going to have to wait, all because Senate  Republicans have decided their political gamesmanship is more important  than the constituents they are supposed to serve.   I, one last time, say: Make no mistake, we will confirm all of these  Federal Reserve nominees. We could do it a lot faster if my colleagues  wanted to cooperate.   I object.    Mr. President, just to be clear, we did offer just an  hour, maybe 2 hours ago--the ranking member and I have spoken for maybe  20 minutes, more or less.   Just to be clear, we offered in that unanimous consent request that  we vote on both Chair Powell and Dr. Jefferson and simply delay the  vote on Dr. Cook because several Members who wanted to vote for her  were not here.   Instead, the ranking member decided he wanted to just, one more time,  try to embarrass Dr. Cook. It is not really going to work because we  are going to confirm her. But just to be clear, my motion, only 2 hours  ago, was let's move forward on those two. That was rejected by Senator  Toomey.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
