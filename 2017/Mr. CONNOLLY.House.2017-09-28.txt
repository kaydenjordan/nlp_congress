 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call upon President Trump  to certify that Iran is in full compliance with the JCPOA, otherwise  known as the Iran nuclear agreement. To decertify at this time will  destabilize the ability of the United States to engage in international  agreements, especially those we initiated ourselves.   Our credibility is on the line, especially given the fact that the  IAEA and the United Nations and the United States Government have  certified that Iran is in compliance. It is in compliance on its  centrifuges, enriched uranium, the production of the plutonium reactor  itself.   We want to make sure that we don't have a second nuclear front by  decertifying Iran. It is important to the United States' interests, to  the security of the world, and the security of Israel that this  agreement be certified as in compliance.                            ____________________
