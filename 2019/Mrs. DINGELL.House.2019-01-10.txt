 Mr. Speaker, today, I stand before this House  heartbroken.   This past weekend, tragedy struck our Dearborn community as we  learned of the death of all five members of the Abbas family. They were  killed by a drunk driver while driving back from a family vacation in  Florida, and their loss has devastated our community in ways that you  cannot imagine.   In every sense of the word, they were our community. The parents were  born and raised there. Rima served many as a respected doctor at  Beaumont and had just been promoted to head all of the doctors at the  hospital. And Issam had a successful career as a lawyer and real estate  agent. Their children--Ali, age 13; Isabelle, age 12; and Giselle, age  7--were gifts from God and the center of their parents' lives, and so  many other families in Dearborn.   Their family, their very extended family was devoted to everything  that they did. Their absence stunned this community and is felt deeply  and emotionally.   Thousands attended one of the memorial services this week and then  the funeral. Many in attendance chose to remember the good memories-- the smiles, the laughs, their careers, their deep connections to  friends, neighbors, coworkers, classmates, and friends--but some came  up to me and spoke very honestly. I was struck by the children and  grown men who came up to me in tears, asking me why we hadn't done  something to stop drunk driving.   A young girl, a classmate, who will never see her friend again, had  channeled her grief into research. She came up to me and asked why,  when the technology exists, has Congress never done anything to mandate  interlock breathalyzers to prevent this kind of senseless accident from  ever happening again.                                time  1030    She wasn't alone.   Elders in the community had also researched this subject, and the  senior men, in their very deep way, asked me why nothing had been done,  why weren't we using and mandating technology that would save lives.  And I had no good answer.   Too many lives across this country are taken because of drunk  driving. In 2016, 10,497 people died in alcohol-impaired driving  crashes. That is 28 percent of all traffic-related deaths.   The young girl was right and the elders of the community were correct  that technology does exist to stop drunk driving once and for all, and  Congress has never had the will to take it on.   I have to go home tomorrow to a community that is still grieving. I  can't look them in the eye unless we are really willing to try to do  something.   This week I am introducing legislation in memory of the Abbas family  that would mandate all new vehicles be equipped with interlock  breathalyzer devices. This will stop intoxicated drivers from ever  starting a vehicle and keep them off the roads.   If we can keep one person from dying on the roads and make people  think twice before getting behind the wheel when they shouldn't, even  when they are buzzed and think they will be okay, then won't we have  been successful?   I know that some will say: ``This is too much of a burden. It won't  work. Why should we have to do that?''   Well, I am going to look them in the eye and tell them why no  community should ever have to feel what our community is still feeling  this week.   I will work with all my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, and  the auto industry to save lives. It is our moral imperative.   Nothing will bring back the Abbas family, but their lives were too  important to forget. Our community will deeply miss them, but we need  to make sure that their death was not in vain. We must dedicate  ourselves in their memory and those of others we know to try to prevent  another life being lost this way senselessly.
