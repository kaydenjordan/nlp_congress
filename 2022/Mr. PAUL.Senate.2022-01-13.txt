 Mr. President, I rise today to speak against the  sanctioning of German and Russian businesses over the transport of  natural gas between their countries.   Proponents of sanctions say: Sanction this, sanction that. The  Department of the Treasury is currently administering dozens of  sanctions programs designed to change the behavior of certain  countries. Yet, no one seems to ask the important questions: Do  sanctions promote peace and understanding, or do they escalate tension  between nations? What behavior has China modified since the United  States began sanctions? Has Russia changed  [[Page S209]]  her behavior? Has Russia given back Crimea? Sanctions, although lacking  in proof of effectiveness, are very popular with both parties.   Embargoes, sanctions' big brother, also garner bipartisan enthusiasm.  The U.S. embargo of Cuba has now gone on for more than 60 years without  any evidence of a change in regime or even a change in the regime's  policy.   Embargoes are often described, especially by the embargoed country,  as an act of war. Many historians say that the U.S.'s embargo of 1807  ultimately led to the War of 1812. President Jefferson's embargo was  intended to punish France and England for their aggressions, but  instead the embargo crippled American shipping exports. Exports  declined by 75 percent.   Some historians also blame the U.S. embargo of Japan for the ensuing  war. Roosevelt seized many of Japan's assets, and Japan lost access to  much of its international trade and over 80 percent of its imported  oil. Effectively, at least from the perspective of Japan, the embargo  was an act of war.   Yet enthusiasts for embargoes and sanctions still clamor for more.  Sanctionistas point to the international sanctions against Iran as the  lever that brought about the Obama-era nuclear agreement with Iran.  Perhaps, but an equally valid argument could be made that it was the  extension of carrots rather than sticks that brought Iran to the table.  It is funny how diplomacy seems to require give-and-take, not just  take, take, take.   Our interaction with Iran should illuminate today's debate over  sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline between Russia and Germany, but  the shade of mercantilism is dimming the light of experience.   Opponents of the pipeline, not surprisingly, are largely from States  that compete in the sale of natural gas. This is more about  protectionism than it is national security. Reports are that the  pipeline will cause a significant reduction in U.S. exports of liquid  natural gas; hence the keen interest by people representing States that  sell natural gas. This is not so much about national security; it is  about protectionism.   Acknowledging that this debate is only superficially about national  security and really more about provincial protectionism helps us better  understand the dynamics.   History demonstrates that trade and interconnectedness between  nations is a barrier to war. Engaging in mutually beneficial commerce,  coupled with a potent military deterrence, is the combination that best  promises peace.   Over the past decade, Congress and Presidents have heaped sanctions  on Russia and China. When I have asked the State Department officials  who come before our committee to reveal what behavioral changes have  come about as a result of sanctions, I have often gotten blank stares.   Now, the sanctionistas want to sanction an already completed  pipeline. Last year, they said that if we put sanctions on, we will  stop them. Well, the Senate and the House overwhelmingly passed  sanctions. We got sanctions, and they still completed the pipeline.   But what behavior are they now asking Russia to change? What  specifically has Russia been asked to do? What Russian action is  necessary for these sanctions to end?   I have asked the sponsor of this bill: The sanctions that you want to  do to Russia, what behavior--what do you want from Russia? The response  is that they don't want any behavioral changes from Russia. The word- for-word response from the sponsors of this bill is that they just want  Russia not to ship oil to Germany. It is about trade. It is about trade  that might compete with certain natural gas-producing States. It has  nothing to do with national security.   If Nord Stream 2 sanctions were really about changing Russian  behavior or deterring aggression in Ukraine, then NATO, including  Germany, could threaten sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine. Now,  that--the threat of sanctions, with Germany as an ally--might actually  have deterring value.   In fact, last summer, the United States and Germany did just that.  The United States and Germany announced an agreement in which they said  jointly that any attempt to use energy as a weapon or commit further  aggressive acts against Ukraine will be met with sanctions. This is  Germany and the United States together. That has power. Our little  pinprick sanctions saying ``We don't like you, and we are going to  punish the companies that are involved'' will do nothing.   If we actually work with Germany, we have deterring value. Germany  could turn off the spigot to the natural gas like that. If it is a  valid threat from Germany with us, together, we might be able to deter  Russia. But simply turning the gas pipeline off now and sanctioning it  is like being a hostage taker and saying ``We don't want you to do  this, and we have your hostage'' and then going ahead and shooting the  hostage before you get what you want.   We should threaten sanctions. The threat of sanctions has power. Once  you turn them on and you have no plan to turn them off, you have no  leverage over Russia and you do nothing.   The commitment or the agreement between Germany and the United  States--the agreement says, ``This commitment is designed to ensure  Russia will not misuse any pipeline, including Nord Stream 2, to  achieve aggressive political ends'' or they will be met with sanctions.  This could be a deterrence.   The more countries that got together and said this--an international  community of sanctions can have some effect. One-country sanctions,  particularly against its ally, Germany, will have no effect.   The rush to impose sanctions now undermines the threat of sanctions  to deter Russian aggression against Ukraine. When you put sanctions on  now and you offer them nothing and no way to remove the sanctions, how  are you deterring anything? In fact, you might well make them angry  enough that they actually do act in response to the sanctions in the  opposite of what you have intended.   As today's debate unfolds, I think you will find that sanctions  against Nord Stream 2 are more about mercantilism and protectionism  than national security.    Mr. President, during the early morning hours of  December 11, 2021, Kentucky endured a series of tornadoes that proved  to be the deadliest storms in the Commonwealth's history. There was  damage throughout Southern Kentucky and beyond. Roofs were ripped off  and trees snapped like twigs, but in this difficult time our community  continues to come together and help one another. Immediately after,  volunteers from all around Kentucky and even outside the Commonwealth  showed up to help clean up the debris. Despite the devastation, I am  reminded that the unbridled spirit of our Commonwealth shines its  brightest during these times of adversity.   Of the many heroes that emerged during this crisis were the people of  Bowling Green Municipal Utilities who immediately responded to the  destruction and worked collectively to restore electricity to countless  homes. Bowling Green Municipal Utilities reported 24,000 of its 31,500  customers were initially without power and 52 transmission polls had  been severely damaged. By the next morning half of these powerless  homes had their electricity restored. This should have been time for  the men and women of BGMU to enjoy the upcoming holiday season.  Instead, they responded to the call of duty, working long shifts in the  freezing cold. Because of their efforts, they were able to restore  power to countless members of the community and provided relief to  those most in need. We have a long road to recovery, but if we all  display the perseverance our linemen and Kentuckians demonstrated, the  Commonwealth will soon be back better than ever. I would like to  personally thank people of Bowling Green Municipal Utilities for their  continued service to all the impacted communities.                            ____________________     Mr. President, during the early morning hours of  December 11, 2021, Kentucky endured a series of tornadoes that proved  to be the deadliest storms in the Commonwealth's history.
