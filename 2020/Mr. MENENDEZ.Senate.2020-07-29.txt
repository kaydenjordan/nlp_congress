 Mr. President, I rise to speak about the campaign  currently underway to select the next president of the Inter-American  Development Bank in September of this year.   The IDB has served as the preeminent development bank in the Americas  since 1959. For more than six decades, it has brought together the  United States, Canada, and our partners from Latin America and the  Caribbean to advance an agenda for development and inclusive economic  growth in our hemisphere. The United States has proudly been a leading  voice to strengthen the IDB's critical mission in the Americas, and  donors from the European Union to Japan and South Korea, have provided  enduring support to the institution.   In September, the IDB will hold elections to select its next  president. Last month, the United States announced it would nominate  Mauricio Claver Carone, the current National Security Council senior  director for the Western Hemisphere, as our candidate to be the next  president of the IDB. Since Mr. Claver Carone's nomination was  announced, more than 15 governments in the region have offered their  support for his candidacy. These governments represent a wide range of  ideological perspectives, levels of economic development, and different  historic relationships with the IDB. In recent weeks, the Secretary  General of the Organization of American States, our hemisphere's other  premier multilateral institution, offered words of support for Mr.  Claver Carone's candidacy.   I have known Mr. Claver Carone for over two decades. During this  time, Mr. Claver Carone has demonstrated a commitment to inclusive  economic development in Latin America and the Caribbean, and he has  been an outspoken advocate for democracy and human rights in our  hemisphere. In his more recent roles at the National Security Council,  the International Monetary Fund, and the Treasury Department, he has  worked with governments across the region and across the ideological  spectrum to advance United States' partnerships in the Americas. He has  also worked to address the political, economic, and humanitarian crisis  in Venezuela, and counter the agendas of governments that seek to  counter U.S. interests in the region, from Cuba's authoritarian regime  to Putin's Russia to China's Government. Of equal importance, he has  shown the ability to work in a bipartisan manner with Democrats and  Republicans in the United States, including in the U.S. Congress.   While I have been and remain an ardent critic of many aspects of the  Trump administration's foreign policy towards Latin America and the  Caribbean and I have not always agreed with every policy decision that  Mr. Claver Carone has made during his service to our government, I  recognize his consistent commitment to advancing U.S. national  security, our foreign policy interests, and an agenda of shared  priorities with our partners in the hemisphere.   For these reasons, I support Mr. Claver Carone's candidacy and would  welcome the opportunity to continue working with him as the next  president of the Inter-American Development Bank.   I recognize that selection of the next IDB president is taking place  2 months before the United States holds general elections and that some  have concerns about the implications of this timing. Given that the  United States is the IDB's largest shareholder, the next IDB president  must commit to working in a bipartisan manner with the next U.S.  President and their administration, regardless of party. This is an  essential task for the success of the IDB. As the senior Democrat in  the Foreign Relations Committee, I would look forward to working with  Mr. Claver Carone to ensure that this happens.   As COVID-19 continues to spread across the Americas and severe  economic impacts follow, the IDB will play an absolutely essential role  in the recovery of countries across the region. This makes the  selection of the IDB's next president of the utmost importance. The IDB  needs leadership that can achieve consensus across the Western  hemisphere and set the stage for a decade-long recovery effort. The  task is formidable, but I remain confident that the United States can  and will play an integral part in supporting the IDB's efforts and our  partners in the region.                            ____________________
