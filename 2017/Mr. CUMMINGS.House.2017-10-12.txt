 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as the ranking member of the Oversight and Government  Reform Committee, the committee with oversight jurisdiction over  Federal workers and agencies, I am one of the staunchest supporters of  whistleblower protections in the Congress. I strongly support enhancing  protections for the brave men and women who put their careers on the  line to speak out against waste, fraud, and abuse.   I fully support the intent of S. 585 to protect whistleblowers who  face investigations in retaliation for their disclosures. But I am  disappointed that the Republican leadership chose not to consider this  measure under regular order.   House Republicans rushed this legislation directly to the floor,  bypassing any consideration by the Oversight Committee or the Veterans'  Affairs Committee, which have jurisdiction over the bill. It is  especially disappointing that my committee was not given the  opportunity to address constitutional and privacy concerns raised by  the Trump administration's Office of Personnel Management about the  bill. That is what I said: the Trump administration's concerns about  it.   It is even more disheartening that the Rules Committee issued a  closed rule for this bill. They blocked all three germane amendments  that I submitted, including an amendment to fix the problems identified  by the OPM.   The measure before us today would change the procedures for  disciplining Federal supervisors who retaliate against employees who  blow the whistle. It would require agency heads to impose suspensions  of at least 3 days for a first offense, and termination for a second  offense whenever an agency head, administrative law judge, the Merit  Systems Protection Board, a Federal judge, or an inspector general  finds that a supervisor retaliated against an employee who blew the  whistle.   It also would reduce the length of the notice requirement for  proposed disciplinary action from 30 days to 14 days. It would  eliminate the option to hold a hearing if a supervisor contests a  proposed disciplinary action. It would change the current burden of  proof for demonstrating retaliation from a preponderance of the  evidence to require agency heads to impose disciplinary action in any  case in which a supervisor does not furnish evidence or if the head of  the agency determines that such evidence is not sufficient to reverse  the proposed action.   The bill also would require an agency head, when an employee may have  committed suicide, to refer any information to the Office of Special  Counsel indicating that the employee had blown the whistle and that the  agency took personnel action against the employee.   The OPM has questioned whether some of the provisions in the bill  would withstand constitutional scrutiny if challenged in court, and I  agree with the OPM on that issue.   For example, the OPM explained that the bill's requirement to propose  minimum penalties of 3 days' suspension for the first offense and  termination for second offenses could violate due process protections.  These protections require agencies to notify employees of factors they  will consider regarding proposed penalties for findings of wrongdoing  and to provide employees with meaningful opportunities to respond. The  United States Supreme Court and Federal Circuit Courts have ruled that  Federal employees are entitled to these protections. After all, they  are Americans.    But according to the OPM, the bill would eliminate agency  consideration of many of the 12 factors that were set force by the  Merit Systems Protection Board in Douglas v. Veterans Administration in  1981. The Board uses these so-called Douglas factors to assess the  reasonableness of penalties, and agency officials who propose or decide  adverse actions against employees must concurrently consider these  factors.   Concerns have also been raised that by reducing the current  requirement for 30 days' notice of adverse action to 14 days, lowering  the existing burden of proof, and eliminating the option for hearings,  the bill could be challenged on the basis that it does not give  supervisors sufficiently meaningful opportunities to respond to  accusations of retaliation.   In addition, although the intent of the bill is to enhance  protections for whistleblowers, there is some concern that it would be  misused to harm whistleblowers. For example, an agency head could  utilize the bill's abbreviated disciplinary processes in bad faith to  retaliate against supervisors who blow the whistle on high-level waste,  fraud, or abuse.   Lastly, the provision requiring agency heads to refer information to  the Office of Special Counsel regarding employees who may have  committed suicide raises important privacy questions. The bill does not  include any provision requiring agencies to obtain permission from  family members before sharing information about an employee's death. It  is unfortunate that the House has failed to take the opportunity to fix  these flaws in this measure.   The second amendment that I presented would have protected the  privacy interests of employees who commit suicide by requiring written  permission from their next of kin before agency heads disclose the  details about the death.   And another amendment that I submitted would have made corrections in  the underlying bill to ensure that managers who violate whistleblower  rights will be held accountable, while safeguarding due process rights.   Finally, the third amendment was the text of my bipartisan bill, H.R.  702, the Federal Employee Anti-Discrimination Act of 2017, which passed  the House by a voice vote under suspension of the rules earlier in this  Congress, and also passed the House by a vote of 403-0 in the last  Congress.   This amendment would have expanded the protections for employees who  suffer retaliation and discrimination. It also would have prohibited  the use of nondisclosure agreements to prevent employees from  disclosing waste, fraud, or abuse to Congress, to the Office of Special  Counsel, and inspector generals.   I expect the bill, as it now stands, to engender substantial  litigation that may have to be addressed by the courts. It would,  indeed, be unfortunate if that litigation resulted in overturning  disciplinary action against an employee who retaliated against a  whistleblower, when we could have acted today to address the  constitutional concerns.   As I said before the Rules Committee, sometimes I think we can get so  caught up in our partisan battles, that even when we come with good  suggestions as to how to make a piece of legislation better and more  effective and certainly come within the bounds  [[Page H8001]]  of the Constitution, we are blinded by what we see; and that is this  battle between Republicans and Democrats, Mr. Speaker, and we don't  come up, sometimes with the very best product.   But even with all that, because I am so concerned about  whistleblowers, I plan to vote for the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Kind).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), the ranking member of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee and one who has been a staunch supporter of  whistleblowers.   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I would agree with many of the gentleman's  concerns and comments regarding the lack of a real legislative process  here. The bill could be better. But nonetheless, like the ranking  member, I will be supporting the legislation despite those concerns  because it is absolutely urgent.   I have a totally dysfunctional management at the VA hospital in  Roseburg, Oregon. A number of years ago, a whistleblower came to me and  said that substandard care was being provided. We asked the Office of  Inspector General to look into it. They whitewashed it, and then it  came out in the Senate testimony that the Office of Special Counsel had  found that this doctor had been penalized as a whistleblower because he  was pointing to substandard care.   I asked for another investigation and ultimately found, yes, indeed,  substandard care was being provided by the head surgeon. He was  suspended from his duties but is still the head surgeon. Now he has run  another very accomplished doctor, under very dubious circumstances, out  of my Eugene clinic. This is a surgeon who served 29 years, honorably,  in the military, 10 years at my regional hospital with rave reviews,  and, after 30 days at my new VA clinic in Eugene, was dismissed in the  most unusual way with no allegations put forward.   Mr. Speaker, again, it seems that we are having issues here when the  quality is substandard that this one person is able to basically just  get rid of the folks who are raising concerns about the care of  veterans. Again, this shouldn't happen.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the record two letters regarding the  dismissed doctor.                                                  October 17, 2017.        Dear Mr. DeFazio: I am a contracted physician in the       emergency department at the Roseburg VA. I have been working       at this facility since 2010. During that time I have truly       enjoyed providing care for the veterans. However, I have       significant concerns regarding the administration and       inefficiencies in healthcare, in the VA system.       Unfortunately, it seems that advancement of careers and the       fluffing of numbers supersede patient care.        Despite the build up of these concerns over the years, I       have recently became aware of an action that compels me to go       beyond the normal chain of command. One of the surgeons       working at the Eugene campus--still under the Roseburg       administration--was fired recently under very concerning       circumstances.        Dr. Scott Russi was working at the Eugene VA for less than       1 month when he was pushed out and fired. I know Dr. Russi       from the private sector. In addition to working at the       Roseburg VA, I have worked for the last ten years at Sacred       Heart RiverBend--a trauma, stroke, and cardiac center--and       one of the largest hospitals in the state. I worked alongside       Dr. Russi for many years at RiverBend and I found him to be       not only extremely competent and hardworking, but always very       professional. I was sad to see him leave RiverBend, but I was       encouraged that he would be working in the VA system as I       felt he would significantly improve the quality of care for       the veterans.        I find it very disheartening that a group of administrative       physicians, who rarely practice medicine, are able to strike       down such a promising figure simply because they seem to have       felt threatened by him. I know there are many people who are       upset by this firing and who have concerns about this system       in general. I have tried many times to discuss my concerns       with people in the administration and have been met with, at       best, excuses and, at worst, threats. It is clear to me as       somewhat of an outsider and observer (as I am not actually a       VA employee) that physicians who are dedicated to patient       care and most skilled are threatening to the administration.       These physicians are often ostracized and pushed out--and       when they can't be pushed out, false rumors are spread about       them. I have considered stepping away from the VA system due       to these continuing frustrations. It is disheartening to see       these veterans treated with such carelessness. However, I       feel that someone has to stay and actually care for them,       but, if I stay, I also want to try to make the system a       better place for them. For many, this is their only health       care.        I wish this was as exaggerated as it may sound, but       unfortunately this is only a small piece of a huge problem.       If you are interested in more details, I am more than happy       to discuss this further. In general, I keep my head down and       do what I think is best, but this presents itself as a moment       when speaking out is necessary and right.            Thank you,      Charlotte Ransom, MD.                                   ____         Congressman DeFazio: I am writing to ask for your help. I       am a surgeon and a veteran having attended the Usafa and       graduating in 1984, completing medical school on Hpsp       scholarship and spending the next 29 years on active duty. I       deployed four times as a combat surgeon and once as a       hospital commander, my last deployment in 2012 was as the       Dccs of Craig Joint Theater Hospital, Bagram Ab, Afghanistan.       I retired in October of 2013 and settled in Oregon as a       trauma surgeon eventually becoming the Trauma Medical       Director at Riverbend. I was the on-call surgeon the tragic       day Ucc suffered the active shooter event. I recently left my       civilian practice to serve our Veterans, for reasons I think       you would understand; I have seen the care my comrades have       been given and found it wanting, and serving my Vets is       therapeutic for my Ptsd and the sorrow I carry for not being       able to save more soldiers. I am the new surgeon at the Va       Eugene Hcc and have been working there part-time since       January of this year and full time since 23 July. Today I was       handed a summary suspension of clinical privileges as a       surgeon by the parent Va, Roseburg and Dr. Dinesh Ranjan the       chief of surgery. I have been denied the opportunity to       defend my reputation, denied the opportunity to stand before       my peers, and denied any opportunity to see the allegations.       And tonight, I have spoken with two Va physicians (Dr. Lisa       Brandenburger and Dr. Philo Calhoun) whose lives were       dedicated to serving Veterans but were irreparably damaged by       Dr. Ranjan. I am now being targeted by Dr. Ranjan because he       recruited me with the promise of a salary of $385,000, I       signed a contract for that  [[Page H8002]]       amount but I am being paid $280,000. Because I expressed to       the Eugene Hcc administrator I felt I was misled about the       salary, Dr. Ranjan has gone after my clinical privileges, had       them summarily dismissed and placed me at risk of being       reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank (Npdb). I       have been suspended from patient contact for 30 days for an       investigation. If the investigation finds me deficient, I       will be reported to the Npdb. If the investigation extends       beyond 30 days, I will be reported to the Npdb. If I am fired       or quit my job, I will be reported to the Npdb. If I am       reported to the Npdb I will never work again as a surgeon.        I know it all sounds unbelievable, I think it is       unbelievable as I try and wrap my head around the events of       these last few days. I ask you not to send a congressional       inquiry to Mr. Paxton, as that would make my life worse. What       I thought would be my dream job, now has become a nightmare.            Respectfully,                                                       Scott Russi.    Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, since this has come out, I have had dozens  of calls from nurses and doctors and other workers in the VA system in  my region--in Eugene, Springfield, and southern Oregon, down to  Roseburg, at those two facilities--because of this mismanagement. They  say that the care is not up to standards, just like this particular  physician was not providing modern care when he did colonoscopies.   We need--vitally need--this legislation and the strongest protection  for whistleblowers. This isn't about protecting bad managers. It is  about promoting qualified and keeping qualified employees, which we are  having a hard time doing in my area. It is about providing the best  care to our veterans, and that isn't going to happen if people can be  intimidated or just shown the door when they raise concerns.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster).   Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member  Cummings for yielding me time to speak about this important legislation  to protect whistleblowers.   Mr. Speaker, I share the concerns that were brought up yesterday in  the Rules Committee and today on the floor about the procedure for  bringing this bill to the floor without full House committee process.  However, I will support the bill because it is so important.   The Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act will provide  protection for employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs who blow  the whistle on wrongdoing in the agency.   As the ranking member of the House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on  Oversight and Investigations, I know full well that whistleblowers are  vital to the VA to protect the health and well-being of the men and  women who have so bravely served our country. Although we have numerous  protections currently in place for whistleblowers, those who are  committed to silencing them still manage to find ways to retaliate,  which we saw with tragic consequences at the Phoenix VA Health Care  System and in Dr. Kirkpatrick's case.   In addition to serving on the House Veterans Affairs' Committee, my  role as the founder and co-chair of the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force  makes VA's retaliation against another VA doctor, Dr. Kirkpatrick, an  especially troublesome tragedy. When he tried to raise the alarm over  concerns that another VA doctor was overprescribing opioids that may  have led to patient deaths, he was aware that doing so could be harmful  to his own position at the Tomah VA Medical Center.   Dr. Kirkpatrick's action was laudable. Veterans have been acutely  impacted by the opioid epidemic, and his efforts to reduce prescription  rates for veterans is not only a good example for VA physicians, but  for all physicians in the U.S. today.   Title II of this bill puts in place a number of requirements for the  VA to protect VA employees from several retaliatory measures. It  requires the Secretary to put in place a plan to prevent unauthorized  access to medical records of VA employees, along with outreach to  ensure that VA employees are aware of mental health services available  to them.   These and other improvements in title II will not only help prevent  the type of retaliation that Dr. Kirkpatrick suffered, they will  improve care for veterans to also help make the VA a better place to  work.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this bill, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As I close, I take the opportunity to reiterate that I strongly  support the objectives of S. 585. If there is anything that we agree on  in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, it is that we must  protect whistleblowers.   Many of the investigations that we have conducted have been as a  result of somebody who saw something and said something. Like Dr.  Kirkpatrick, I am sure, in most of those instances, it was very  difficult for them because they, on the one hand, wanted to improve a  situation or address a problem, but at the same time, they knew that it  was possible that they, themselves, might be harmed and their families  might be harmed. So they make a very, very difficult choice, a very  difficult choice.   I am horrified that Dr. Kirkpatrick was so agonized by the treatment  he endured at the Veterans Administration that he saw no options for  himself. In other words, Mr. Speaker, he saw no way out. I worry that  there are civil servants today who are enduring that same agony.   But we say to them that we will protect you with all we have got, and  that is why I appreciate Senator Johnson's work on S. 585, and I share  his commitment to protecting whistleblowers. For that reason, as I said  earlier, I will vote in favor of this legislation.   That said, I wish that the Republican leadership had taken the  opportunities that my amendments provided to improve this bill. These  issues of equal protection are nothing to play with because we begin to  chip away and chip away and chip away at employees' rights, and the  next you know, those rights begin to disappear. Those are the kind of  rights that are a part and the fabric of this thing we call a  democracy. I think we have to be very, very, very careful. It is going  to be interesting to see what the courts have to say about this  legislation.   My amendments would have addressed the constitutional concerns raised  by OPM--and I emphasize OPM. This was not the Obama OPM. This was the  Trump OPM.   My amendments would also have protected the privacy of employees who  take their own lives.   My amendments would have added to the underlying bill additional  protections for employees who suffer retaliation or discrimination,  protections that the House has already approved.   I believe this is a missed opportunity and it is sad. I truly hope  that future litigation does not undo the advances that this bill seeks  to make in the protections provided for the courageous men and women  willing to blow the whistle on wrongdoing. In this day and age, we need  the whistleblower more now than we have ever needed them.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the Members to support this bill to protect some  of the boldest, most courageous people in our Nation, the  whistleblowers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
