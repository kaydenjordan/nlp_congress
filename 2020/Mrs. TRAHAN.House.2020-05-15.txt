 Mr. Speaker, this public health crisis has been  devastating. Nearly 1.5 million Americans have contracted COVID-19 and,  tragically, more than 85,000 people have died.   We have asked small business owners and workers in our districts to  close up shop and stay home for months to do their part to slow the  spread of this virus.   Across the country, workplaces are innovating and figuring out how to  operate while keeping pace with commonsense public health guidelines.   Like them, Congress has an obligation to do the same. This moment  requires us to lead by example, to show that in the face of a highly  infectious disease we can change how we do business and still get our  constituents the much-needed relief they desperately need, while also  conducting proper oversight.   I support this rule change to temporarily allow committees to conduct  meetings remotely and to provide my colleagues with the opportunity to  make their constituents' voices heard.   This is the 21st century. We have an opportunity to show that we can  use the tools at our disposal to continue congressional operations at  full capacity while also practicing what we preach.   This is common sense, and I would urge my colleagues to support this  change as well.
