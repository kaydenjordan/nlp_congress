 Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the  opportunity.   I stand in support of this CR. This measure will provide $28.6  billion in emergency funds for communities and Federal agencies  affected by the recent hurricanes, wildfires, and other natural  disasters; including $10 billion for the Agriculture Department to  cover crop losses that occurred during the '20 and '21 storms. Of that  amount, $750 million will be provided to livestock producers.   Madam Speaker, $5.68 billion is for the Army Corps of Engineers. Of  that amount, $3 billion would be used to accelerate flood and storm  risk reduction projects, and $2.08 billion would be used to repair  disaster-related damages.   Madam Speaker, $5 billion would be for the Housing and Urban  Development Department's community development fund for major disasters  that occurred during the '20 and '21 hurricane seasons; $2.6 billion  for Transportation Department reimbursements to States and territories  to repair damage to roads and bridges caused by natural disasters;  $1.36 billion for the U.S. Forest Service to address damage caused by  natural disasters; $1.2 billion for the Small Business Administration's  disaster loans programs; and $565 million for the Navy to repair  facilities damaged by the storms that occurred in 2020 and 2021.   The American people deserve the security of knowing that their  government will continue to function. America deserves to know that the  Representatives they send to Washington will rise above politics and  partisanship and fight for the American people  [[Page H5581]]  and make sure that at its core that we will maintain the full faith and  credit of our country, that we will pay our bills, and that we will  fight for the security of our people abroad. We must make sure that  everywhere else understands that America is open for business, will  continue to be open for business, and we will remain the superpower  that we are because we are responsible.
