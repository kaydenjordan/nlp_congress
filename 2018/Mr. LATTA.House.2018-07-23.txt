 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4881, the Precision  Agriculture Connectivity Act, as amended, to help improve high-speed  broadband access for our Nation's farmers.   I represent the largest farm income-producing district in the State  of Ohio; therefore, I am fortunate to visit farms across the region and  learn about new technologies, like the Internet of Things equipment,  that are helping to improve farm productivity and sustainability.   But the unfortunate reality is that lack of high-speed broadband in  rural areas, specifically in farm communities, hinders the use of  advanced technologies in agriculture operations. That is why I  introduced H.R. 4881, along with my friend, the gentleman from Iowa  (Mr. Loebsack).   Our bill would require the Federal Communications Commission to  establish a task force, in collaboration with the Department of  Agriculture, to review the connectivity and technology needs of  precision agriculture in the United States.   I believe by combining minds from these two expert agencies, along  with relevant private stakeholders, the task force will be able to  offer tangible solutions that will promote rapid, expanded deployment  of broadband in unserved areas, creating a pathway for precision  agriculture in our rural farmlands.                                time  1430    The true benefits of precision agriculture cannot be realized without  the availability of reliable broadband internet access service. For  example, with broadband, farmers can use connected tractors and other  advanced technologies to collect field data in realtime to help with  crop management. This type of technology helps farmers maximize  resources, which can reduce costs and increase crop yields by up to 70  percent by 2050, helping to maintain America's long-term leadership in  global food production.   Two farming seasons ago, I drove a tractor with GPS capabilities. My  mom was raised on a farm in northwest Ohio, and, early on, my  grandfather still used a team of horses. My grandfather would be amazed  at how straight the furrows I made that day were, thanks to the  connected tractor. I never touched the steering wheel. Because of  broadband, the connected tractor was able to go down an entire row,  without human control, and place fertilizer in furrows within one inch  of where those seeds would be planted in the spring. It is technology  like this that helps farmers maximize resources and promote  environmentally sustainable practices.   My bill will encourage this type of technology by bringing much- needed broadband to rural, agricultural areas.   Not only do I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4881, but I would  also like to quote the support of FCC Commissioner Carr. He said:         In my time on the Commission, I have seen firsthand the       difference that broadband connectivity makes for America's       farmers and ranchers.    He goes on to say:       . . . running agriculture operations today requires expertise       in agronomy, technology, and data analytics. Bringing all of       those skills together to improve crop yields and efficiency       increasingly requires a high-speed broadband connection. So I       am pleased to see this bill move forward and hope that it       becomes law.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his handling of the bill  today, and I urge support of the bill.
