 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1957,  the Taxpayer First Act, which I wasn't expecting to rise in support of;  but this act improves taxpayer service, modernizes IRS infrastructure,  helps low- and middle-income taxpayers, and really creates critical  reforms that my colleagues like the Honorable   John Lewis have been  fighting to pass for years. They have finally gotten Senate Republicans  to work with them and, for the first time, could enact critical  provisions that will help consumers and become law, despite a divided  government.   But that means that Senate Republicans fit in some bitter pills and  some problematic provisions. One of these is a piece that came to my  attention today--which the corporate tax lobby has spent years and  millions of dollars to get--which would bar the IRS from creating a  simple, free filing system that would compete with their own.   Analysis shows that, through these corporate programs, U.S. taxpayers  eligible for free filing pay about $1 billion a year in unnecessary  fees.   In this freshman class, I and many of my colleagues were sent to  reject corporate influence and stand up for people. This puts us in a  difficult spot.   But the rest of this bill is too important. Champions for low-income,  working people say that this is an opportunity that will not come again  and will help 150 million taxpayers. Therefore, I support it, and,  separately, I will introduce legislation with some of my colleagues to  address the problems that have been inserted by special interests.   We have to continue the fight to get big money out of politics, and  this is the beginning of the fight, not the end.    Mr. Neguse, I am pretty excited to be here  today because we get to brag a little, and I get a little tired with  bragging about myself. I think that is something we do a lot as a  Member of Congress, and today we get to brag about our friends.    That is a lot of events, and if you recall,  the colleagues that many of us replaced, the former colleagues that  many of us replaced, were criticized for not having townhalls. But, in  fact, during the February recess alone, freshman Members made up 51  percent of the Members of Congress holding townhalls, even though we  make up just 18 percent of Congress.    Five thousand letters is a lot of letters.   Congressman Dean Phillips actually started holding townhalls before  he was even sworn in.    At her first townhall in Virginia Beach,  Congresswoman Elaine Luria, whom I am proud to sit on the Armed  Services Committee with, brought the Beach's voter registrar and police  chief, the head of its affordable housing efforts, and one of the State  delegates with her and heard from more 250 people who were attending.    That is absolutely right. Congressman  Brindisi's Working for Rural New York plan focuses on solving problems  rural communities face in his district.  [[Page H3198]]         Well, let me tell you about my friend Josh  Harder from the great State of California, who is fighting for  broadband in rural areas through the Save the Internet Act.    And Congresswoman Jahana Hayes, who was  Teacher the Year before, is now fighting to keep guns out of our  classrooms.    Oh, we are indeed. Eighteen freshmen are  leading House subcommittees, as my colleague, Ms. Stevens mentioned,  including: Congresswoman Kendra Horn, Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill,  Congressman TJ Cox, Congressman   Mike Levin, Congressman Harley Rouda,  Congresswoman Susie Lee, Congresswoman Xochitl Torres Small, and  Congresswoman Lizzie Fletcher.   That is a lot of people. And what is so exciting about that is that  there has never been a freshman class with this many people with the  gavel.    Congressman   Andy Levin, who we just heard  from, has introduced six pieces of original legislation. That is a lot.    Well, we really want that foreign  interference not happening in any future elections, so I am glad to  hear that.   Just this week, Congresswoman Kim Schrier introduced bipartisan,  bicameral legislation to help prevent child abuse.    Congresswoman Abby Finkenauer was the first  freshman to have legislation pass the House, a bill to bring Federal  investment to small businesses in rural America.    My other friend, Congresswoman Katie Porter,  a fellow member of the Katie Caucus, has introduced bipartisan  legislation to make childcare more affordable.    A truly sweeping Democratic reform package.    The Paycheck Fairness Act and reauthorization  of the Violence Against Women Act.    End corruption in Washington.    Invest in our Nation's infrastructure and  public education system.    Above all, we are going to stand up for the  people, again, with the full force of this freshman class; and I am so  excited to do it with you, Mr. Neguse, and with all of my fellow  freshman colleagues.
