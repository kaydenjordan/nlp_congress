 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, which I  authored, to authorize the Daughters of the Republic of Texas to  establish this commemorative work here in the District of Columbia  honoring the Republic of Texas Legation.   This is a bipartisan effort supported by a number of my colleagues  from Texas, as well as Representative Holmes Norton, who represents the  area where the memorial will reside. And it has the approval,  initially, of the subcommittee which my colleague, Ms. Haaland, chairs.   The history of the Texas Legation and its significance to American  history is as broad as the pride held by present-day Texans over a time  when we were once an independent Republic. The district that I now  represent includes the historic Alamo in San Antonio. With the battle  cries of ``Remember the Alamo,'' and ``Remember Goliad,'' Texas won its  independence on March 2, 1836. And as most Texans are aware, for almost  a decade thereafter, Texas was a whole other country, an independent  Nation with the same independent spirit that pervades our State today.   What are frequently less discussed are the diplomatic efforts  stretching over almost a decade by this young new Nation, sending  emissaries to Europe and to Washington. At multiple times from 1836 to  1845, the Texas Legation negotiated the terms by which Texas would  become a part of the United States.   While everything is still bigger in Texas, the territory of the  Republic of Texas, as a sovereign independent Nation, was much more  than the current State of Texas. Indeed, it included parts of New  Mexico, including Albuquerque, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and even  Wyoming. How different America would be today had not this huge part of  the center of our country been incorporated into the United States.   The young Republic of Texas had many debts and many challenges from  abroad. My own home in East Austin is only a few blocks away from the  historic French Legation, this is the place that the diplomats from  France used to establish their formal diplomatic relations with the  Nation of Texas. Texans in turn established legations abroad to  negotiate terms of trade and recognition with multiple European  countries. Most importantly, the Texas delegation came here on the very  difficult journey to Washington.   Today, we find the plaques about the work of the Texas Legation in  London and Paris, but not yet here in Washington, where the Legation's  effort had its most profound effect.    Here in this area the Legation operated from a number of houses,  boarding houses, some near the present-day National Archives and the  Navy Memorial, which is appropriate since one of the diplomats  involved, Mr. Memucan Hunt, who also served as secretary of the  fledgling Republic of Texas Navy.   In Washington, the diplomats left their most significant legacy by  negotiating the terms of annexation in 1845 when Texas became the 28th  State to join the Union. That is why this bill approves a commemoration  here.   Most appropriately, this commemoration is spearheaded by the  Daughters of the Republic of Texas, our State's oldest patriotic  women's organization committed to the preservation of Texas heritage  and historic sites. They will work together with our National Park  Service to develop and design a location here that is appropriate  within Washington D.C.   Madam Speaker, I would like to extend a special thanks to Kitty  Hoeck, she has led the way as the historian of the Elisabet Ney  Chapter, that includes the Daughters in the District, Virginia, and  Maryland, for her commitment to this effort. I ask that she be  particularly recognized in connection with this work, along with other  representatives of the Daughters.   The history of the Texas Legation did not end with the annexation of  Texas in 1845. Today, it lives on in the strength of multicultural and  multilingual communities across the Lone Star State. They have made our  State so dynamic.   With this commemoration, those who visit our capital will have the  opportunity to learn about a turning point in the history of Texas and  in the history of the United States, and reflect on the sacrifices by  the diplomats who made this possible.   Madam Speaker, I urge approval of the resolution, and thank both of  my colleagues for their support.                                time  1230
