 Madam Speaker, as we head into the 6-or 7-week break,  it is important that Americans and Congress not forget the number one  crisis facing this Nation, and that is the takeover of our southern  border by Mexican drug gangs.   Right now, the drug gangs, because we are kind of tardy at guarding  the border, escort people into Mexico, escort people through buses and  trains to the Rio Grande River, put wristbands on these people so they  know which gang they are associated with and which type of tour they  bought, and have them carry drugs across the Rio Grande.   If our Border Patrol tries to stop people crossing the river, they  throw little children in the Rio Grande so our Border Patrol has to go  there. They eventually turn these people over to Border Patrol on the  southern border, where they are turned over to nongovernmental  organizations that put them in hotels. These hotels are not secure, so  even if you have COVID, you are let out into the country.   They hold relatives hostage in Central America and Mexico so that the  people who come here have to pay money to get their entry into this  country, from $3,000 to $20,000.
