 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania,  Congressman Dwight Evans, for allowing me this time to speak.   Mr. Speaker, I heard Mr. Evans talk about Dr. King's roots and  influence in Pennsylvania. I just want to note, and this would only be  a small moment of my remarks, that as a Morehouse man, we remind  everyone that Dr. King started at the age of 16 in his matriculation  through college and his embarking on the world knowledge that he had at  Morehouse College, which I spent just a few years at and graduated from  myself.   I hope that there are a number of young people watching today, as  well as those seniors whose backs I stand on, because a lot of people  talk about Dr. King's dream, but I just want to say here publicly, and  I have said it  [[Page H10]]  privately so many times, we don't honor the dream. Everybody has a  dream. The question becomes whether you have the courage, the  fortitude, and the willingness to sacrifice your future to make that  dream come true.   In this body, and as chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, which  now represents almost 78 million Americans in serving with real icons  who paved the way to make this a more perfect union, I appreciate now  more than ever the sacrifice that went into making this country what it  is, and because of that and because of this time, let me just give 30  seconds of my history.   My mother is from the poorest place in the United States. She had 15  brothers and sisters, and all she had was a mother, a very dedicated  mother who was a housekeeper we call a domestic or some other fancy  term now. She was a woman who woke up every day, who would clean other  people's houses to make sure that her 15 kids had an opportunity at a  better future. You know what created that better future? Historically  Black Colleges and Universities.   My mother went to Southern University. She shared a jacket with her  sister, who was still in Lake Providence, which is about 200 miles  away. I don't know how you do it, but they did it.   My mother, in that HBCU, because of the work of many people, was able  to achieve an education, which is the best way to lift yourself out of  poverty. She instilled in me two things: one, Cedric, you have to work  hard, you have to do everything twice as good as everyone else so you  can make it; and two, once you make it, you have an obligation to give  back.   That is what is so special about Dr. Martin Luther King and the dream  and the day that we celebrate. A lot of young people sit around and  say: Oh, when I make it, I am going to give back. Oh, when I grow up, I  am going to do something.   Well, Dr. King did everything that he did at a young age. If you talk  about the Montgomery bus boycott, if you talk about our leaders in the  civil rights movement, they didn't wait to grow into leadership. They  created their own path. The remarkable thing is many of them sacrificed  not only their future but their life.   When you talk about Dr. King, and to a lot of my middle class African  Americans, let me say this, Dr. King could have sat back and said: I  have mine, you get yours, or my family is comfortable, so I will take  the easy path.                                time  1930    So for all of us who are doing well, remember, there are a whole  bunch of people who are not. We have this ice storm all across the  country right now where we are hunkering down in our homes with heat.  We have to remember that there are people who are hunkering down on the  street, sleeping outside under a blanket because that is all they have.   So we have to, in the spirit of Dr. King, remember that we are the  greatest country on Earth; and if we don't think it is a perfect Union,  we have to make it a more perfect Union. Even if it costs us our life,  like it did Dr. King, and it cost him his life in Memphis, fighting for  sanitation workers; we have to fight for the least among us because  this country is only as great as is the least among us.   As long as there are people sleeping on the streets during this  blizzard, that means this country is failing. When there are kids in  public school that are destined for failure because we have not funded  our public schools, this country is failing.   So I would just say that, of all of the great things about Dr. King,  the one thing that we should remember is his sacrifice, his courage,  and the fact that he gave his life to make our lives a better life.   Let me just say that, as I grew up going to some of the best schools  in the country, integrated schools because of Dr. King and because of  the person whom I am going to introduce, I know I stand on their backs,  and I know that I have a lot of work to do to make sure that the  generation behind me has that ability.   But sacrifice is not easy, and when I think of it, I think of people  that I read about in my textbooks, people I studied, people I admired,  people whose autograph I sought. And now I actually get to call this  gentleman, this distinguished gentleman from Georgia, a friend.   But he is more than a friend: he is an icon; he is a trailblazer; he  is a person who saved this country; and he, as a teenager, started his  civil rights fight. He marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, knowing  that there was hatred on the other side; and he met hatred with love,  and he was beaten because he loved and they hated.   But do you know what he did? He marched again.   Do you know what he did? He ran for Congress.   Do you know what he did? He welcomed me into this Congress, and he  paved a better way for generations so that we could go to some of the  best schools in the country.   Mr. Speaker, I have an opportunity to present, introduce, one of the  greatest Americans to ever walk on the face of this Earth, one who has  sacrificed blood, sweat, tears, and who has stayed on his knees  constantly, praying for a better country.   He reminds us all that the Lord will order your steps, but you have  to move your feet. He moved his feet across that Edmund Pettus Bridge,  and he was beaten so that I could vote without counting how many  bubbles in a bar of soap or how many jellybeans in a big tub.   Mr. Speaker, the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Evans) will now yield to one of the greatest Americans and the greatest  Member serving in this House of Representatives, the Honorable John  Lewis from Georgia.
