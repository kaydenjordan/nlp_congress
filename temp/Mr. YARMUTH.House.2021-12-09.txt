 Madam Speaker, democracy is not static. It is not self- effectuating. It requires a concerted effort to keep and a willingness  to stand up against those who would seek to undermine it.   The bill before us reaffirms our commitment to democracy,  transparency, accountability, and a strong system of checks and  balances.   Our Founders knew that the power of the purse would be fundamental to  the separation of powers and to our democratic government itself, and  they explicitly gave that power to Congress, the branch most responsive  to the will of the people.   However, over the past few decades, the executive branch has  encroached on our constitutional spending authority, and dangerous  precedents have been set. Presidents and agencies of both parties have  pushed the boundaries, seeking more control of spending powers. The  previous administration's disregard for the rule of law and contempt  for institutional norms made even more clear the need for laws that can  withstand a lawless executive.   The commonsense reforms in this landmark legislation will restore  Congress' central role in funding decisions, increase executive  transparency, and add teeth to our budget laws. None of these  provisions or the many others in this legislation is partisan. After  all, this bill was introduced during the Trump administration, and it  is being advanced during the Biden administration. It is solely about  shoring up the separation of powers and maintaining the rule of law.   Therefore, I encourage my colleagues on both sides to uphold our  sworn duty to defend the Constitution and vote ``yes'' on the  Protecting Our Democracy Act.
