 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because, when we  talk about the Tax Code, it is easy to get bogged down in numbers. But  tax reform isn't about percentages, it is about people.   It is about small-business owners like Sean Register, in Georgia's  First Congressional District, who wants to grow his business that has  been his passion for much of his life.   Mr. Register is the sole owner of Register International, a shipping  business in Bryan County, Georgia: a type of business very important to  the Coastal Empire's economy.   Mr. Register worked hard to guide his business through the 2008  financial crisis, but, in the economic downturn, was forced to lay off  employees, leaving himself as the only one remaining. Now, he would  like to hire employees but needs a little push to be able to afford the  extra help.   With our tax reform plan, Mr. Register will have the ability to grow  his business and provide much-needed jobs to citizens in the First  District.   Tax reform has many faces, more than 300 million, and every single  one of them inspires our work in Congress as progrowth tax reform. We  will get this done for them.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding  and for his outstanding leadership on this very important committee.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to implore my colleagues to put politics  aside for the sake of the 232,000 children in my State of Georgia and  the 8.9 million children across our Nation who are counting on us to  reauthorize CHIP. Twelve States will run out of CHIP funding before the  end of this year. So the idea of waiting around another 2 months before  acting on CHIP is simply unacceptable.   Let's be clear why we are here today. Instead of having this  discussion 2 months ago, we had to delay the Energy and Commerce  Committee markup of the CHAMPIONING HEALTHY KIDS Act, the CHIP bill,  because the other side of the aisle refused to even consider reasonable  offsets to pay for the program.    I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: How was that  objection related to fighting for the middle class?   Even President Obama supported the change for high-income Medicare  beneficiaries in his annual budget.   How are we supposed to look parents in the eye back home and tell  them that we choose politics instead of choosing to relieve their  concerns about coverage?   Mr. Speaker, let's do our job and let's reauthorize CHIP.
