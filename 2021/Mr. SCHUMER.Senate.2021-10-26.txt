 Well, Mr. President, today is going to be a busy day on  the floor of the Senate. Last week, I filed cloture on five of  President Biden's nominees to serve as U.S. district judges, and today,  we are going to begin working on these nominees.   Even as Senate Democrats proceed on our agenda to help working and  middle-class families and tackle the climate crisis, we will not relent  on speedily filling the vacancies in our Federal judiciary with  qualified, mainstream, and diverse jurists.   Yesterday, we took a big step forward towards achieving that goal by  confirming Myrna Perez to serve on the Second Circuit, one of the most  important courts in the land, and the judges we will begin considering  today continue that effort: more civil rights lawyers, more diverse  candidates, more Federal defenders.   To date, the Senate has now confirmed 13 nominees to serve on our  district courts, with 20 overall lifetime appointments to the Federal  bench. Many of these individuals are knocking down longstanding  barriers to the halls of justice: the first Native American judge, the  first Muslim-American district judge. And among all of the President's  nominees to date, over half--over half--are women. We are proud of  that.   In a broader sense, President Biden's judicial nominees are also  expanding and rewriting the rules of who merits consideration for the  bench. Our Federal courts have long been presided over by former  corporate lawyers and prosecutors and men. To be sure, many of these  individuals have served admirably as judges, and I have been proud to  support many of them over the years. But our Federal judges, more than  ever--more than ever--are an essential component of our democracy, and  they should better reflect the richness and diversity of our Nation-- not just demographic and cultural diversity, as important as that is,  but professional diversity, too.   We need more judges who know what it is like to defend people who  normally can't afford attorneys. We need more judges who have fought  for those who have faced discrimination in the workplace or because of  the color of their skin. We need more judges who understand the  economic hardship that so many people have and when they are forced to  sign documents and other things that will hurt them economically. And  we need judges who have been in the fight against these efforts-- stronger than they have ever been, unfortunately--to undermine our  democracy.   We need our Federal bench, in other words, to mirror our country as a  whole. That is how we restore balance to the bench and strengthen  people's trust in the Federal judiciary.   So, as a Democratic majority, we are going to keep working this week  to make sure these nominees are confirmed by this Chamber. I hope both  sides can work in good faith to move the process along quickly and in a  bipartisan fashion.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on Build Back Better, this week,  Democrats are continuing to make important progress toward finalizing  President Biden's Build Back Better plan, and we remain confident that  a final deal is within reach.  [[Page S7350]]    When Democrats first set out to pass historic legislation to boost  our economy and invest in everyday Americans, we knew that the task  wouldn't be easy. The challenges that our country faces are manifold  and they are severe--from the hardship of raising a family to securing  a good-paying job, to affording something as basic as healthcare and  the cost of prescription drugs.   Tackling these issues head-on was sure to be an immense challenge.  Doing big things in Congress is always hard. But we didn't choose  elected office just to pursue the easy things. We came here to do the  hard things, the important things, the things that will impact  Americans--working-class Americans, middle-class Americans, those  struggling to get into the middle class and those struggling to stay  there--that will impact those people for generations.   That is what these negotiations have been about: doing the hard work  to deliver something big for the American people.   Nobody--nobody--is going to get everything they want, but we all know  we need to keep our promise to the American people.   We need to tackle the climate crisis head-on, and the programs we are  trying to enact will empower us to meet the President's emission goals.   We need to help working parents and give every child in America a  chance to succeed in school and in life, and programs being discussed  will help improve countless of lives.   And we need, I believe, to strengthen vital services, like Medicare-- relied on by millions of Americans--and to make healthcare more  affordable. I believe this is so important, and we are working to get  it done.   Democrats will continue fighting until we are able to pass this  transformational legislation. The progress of last week illustrated  how, if we stick together, work towards finding that legislative sweet  spot, then we can succeed.   That is worth a few hard days. In fact, it is worth many hard days.  We have some more work to do, but we remain committed to forging ahead  until we reward the trust the American people have placed in us.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nominations en bloc: Calendar No. 429, Jeffry  Lane Flake, of Arizona, to be Ambassador Extraordinary and  Plenipotentiary of the United States of America to the Republic of  Turkey; Calendar No. 430, Tom Udall, of New Mexico, to be Ambassador  Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United States of America to  New Zealand, and to serve concurrently and without additional  compensation as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the  United States of America to the Independent State of Samoa; and  Calendar No. 459, Victoria Reggie Kennedy, of Massachusetts, to be  Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United States of  America to the Republic of Austria; that the Senate vote on the  nominations en bloc without intervening action or debate; that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate; that any statements related to the  nominations be printed in the Record; and that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.
