 Mr. Speaker, we should not split hairs. We need to  reaffirm our policy with this resolution because Congress in the past  has not been clear enough. In my visits to Israel I have been struck  how young people, Palestinian and Jews alike, believe passionately in a  two-state solution, but, increasingly, they doubt that it is possible.   Unfortunately, the Trump administration's reckless policies are  increasing that doubt. The latest is giving a green light to the  destructive settlement policy and its expansion. Make no mistake: Trump  and Netanyahu are currently careening towards a one-state solution, one  that will challenge the ability of Israel to be both a democracy and a  Jewish state.   Jimmy Carter said in his book that we are choosing between democracy  and apartheid. This resolution suggests that we choose for democracy a  negotiated solution; and reaffirming our longstanding goals, correct  the ambiguity, get us back on track, and give hope to those young  people in Israel, both Jew and Palestinian.
