 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Maloney for  yielding.   Across our country, the Asian-American and Pacific Islander community  has felt deeply under attack. Over the past year, xenophobic political  leaders used dangerous rhetoric to stir up hatred against many  immigrant communities, including the Asian-American community during  the COVID-19 pandemic.   Soon, words became action, and on March 16, 2021, the Atlanta area  saw  [[Page H2524]]  the tragic and, in some ways, inevitable result when eight lives were  taken from us.   The victims of this attack included mothers and grandmothers, fathers  and sons, teachers and veterans. These are lives that cannot be  restored, leaving pain that cannot be forgotten.   Today, we honor their memories. Tomorrow, the House will vote on a  bipartisan and bicameral resolution that I coauthored with Chair Judy  Chu of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. It calls on  Congress to affirm our commitment to combat hate and bigotry against  the AAPI community and condemns the hateful actions taken in Atlanta.   It is a step in the right direction, but only a step. America is and  has always been a nation of immigrants, a fact that deserves to be  celebrated. I proudly represent one of the most diverse districts in  the Nation, with about a quarter of my constituents having been born in  another country.   When one group of Americans is hurting, we are all hurting. Watching  my son grow up in our diverse community reminds me that none of us are  born with hatred in our hearts. Rather, it is something that is taught.   As we vote today, let's teach compassion, let's teach acceptance,  let's teach empathy. I rise in support of this resolution.
