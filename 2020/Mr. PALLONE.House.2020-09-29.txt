 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 362) to amend the Department of Energy Organization Act with  respect to functions assigned to Assistant Secretaries, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 362         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Energy Emergency Leadership       Act''.       SEC. 2. FUNCTIONS ASSIGNED TO ASSISTANT SECRETARIES.         (a) In General.--Subsection (a) of section 203 of the       Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7133(a)) is       amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(12) Energy emergency and energy security functions,       including--        ``(A) responsibilities with respect to infrastructure,       cybersecurity, emerging threats, supply, and emergency       planning, coordination, response, and restoration; and        ``(B) upon request of a State, local, or tribal government       or energy sector entity, and in consultation with other       Federal agencies as appropriate, provision of technical       assistance, support, and response capabilities with respect       to energy security threats, risks, and incidents.''.        (b) Coordination.--The Secretary of Energy shall ensure       that the functions of the Secretary described in section       203(a)(12) of the Department of Energy Organization Act (as       added by this Act) are performed in coordination with       relevant Federal agencies.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 362.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation and the two bills that will follow it  are bipartisan bills that will help protect our energy grid from  cyberattacks.   In hearings before our Energy Subcommittee last year, we heard from  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, from the members of  FERC, that our energy grid is being attacked each and every single day  by state actors or their entities.   Former Energy Secretary Perry started to address this important issue  by creating the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency  Response, or CESER. He further enhanced its stature by making its  leader an Assistant Secretary.   We agree with those decisions, and this legislation would help  elevate the importance of this issue while putting Congress' bipartisan  stamp of approval on these executive actions.   H.R. 362 would simply amend section 203(a) of the Department of  Energy Organization Act by establishing a new assistant secretary  position responsible for cybersecurity and emergency response issues.   The Department of Energy is the lead agency for ensuring the  cybersecurity of the electric grid, and the newly created assistant  secretary would have jurisdiction over all energy emergency and  security functions related to energy supply, infrastructure, and  cybersecurity.   This bill would also authorize the new assistant secretary to provide  DOE technical assistance, as well as support and response capabilities  with respect to energy security risks to State, local, or Tribal  governments upon request.   The bill would also require the assistant secretary and the  Department of Energy to coordinate with the Department of Homeland  Security and other relevant Federal agencies in carrying out the bill's  provisions.   This bill would go a long way, in my opinion, in helping to protect  the Nation's electric infrastructure from hackers who would attempt to  disrupt our energy grid and cause untold harm to our economy, our daily  lives, and our overall national security.   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Representatives Walberg and Energy  Subcommittee Ranking Member Upton for their leadership and for working  with Chairman Rush and me on the Energy Emergency Leadership Act. I  also want to thank Ranking Member Upton and full Committee Ranking  Member Walden for their ongoing partnership with us over the years on  cybersecurity matters. That partnership was essential in getting these  three critical bills to the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), the chairman of the  Committee on Homeland Security.    Will the gentleman yield?    Yes, Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely my intent and the  intent of the Energy and Commerce Committee that these bills be  implemented in coordination with the Secretary and the Department of  Homeland Security. In fact, the sole reason we are amending these bills  is to make clear that the Department of Energy must implement these  bills in coordination with other Federal agencies.   I want to make clear that we intend, first and foremost, DOE to  coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security. We have made that  clear to DOE at the highest levels, and the Department has acknowledged  that it will coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security in  implementing these bills.    If the gentleman continues to yield, yes, Chairman  Thompson, it is correct, and I thank my friend, the chairman of the  Homeland Security Committee, for that question and the opportunity to  further clarify what these bills do and do not do.   These bills completely confine themselves to codifying or further  specifying authorities and obligations the Secretary of Energy already  has as the sector-specific agency for electricity under the FAST Act,  the Federal Power Act, and the Department of Energy Organization Act.   So let me make this clear: Nothing in these bills is intended to  infringe, curtail, or otherwise affect the authorities of the  Department of Homeland Security as they exist at this moment. And I  will go even further to say that nothing in these bills actually  affects, in any way, shape, or form, the existing authorities or  prerogatives of the Department of Homeland Security or its Secretary in  any area. Any interpretation to the contrary is simply incorrect.    If the gentleman continues to yield, that is correct,  Mr. Chairman.    If the gentleman continues to yield, yes, and I would be  pleased to do so.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and understand that  he continues to have concerns, and I know I may not be able to address  them all today, but I commit to working with my friend from Mississippi  and my Republican colleagues to try to further address these concerns  going forward.     Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 360) to require the Secretary of Energy to establish a  voluntary Cyber Sense program to test the cybersecurity of products and  technologies intended for use in the bulk-power system, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 360         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Cyber Sense Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. CYBER SENSE.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of Energy, in coordination       with relevant Federal agencies, shall establish a voluntary       Cyber Sense program to test the cybersecurity of products and       technologies intended for use in the bulk-power system, as       defined in section 215(a) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C.       824o(a)).        (b) Program Requirements.--In carrying out subsection (a),       the Secretary of Energy shall--        (1) establish a testing process under the Cyber Sense       program to test the cybersecurity of products and       technologies intended for use in the bulk-power system,       including products relating to industrial control systems and       operational technologies, such as supervisory control and       data acquisition systems;        (2) for products and technologies tested under the Cyber       Sense program, establish and maintain cybersecurity       vulnerability reporting processes and a related database;        (3) provide technical assistance to electric utilities,       product manufacturers, and other electricity sector       stakeholders to develop solutions to mitigate identified       cybersecurity vulnerabilities in products and technologies       tested under the Cyber Sense program;        (4) biennially review products and technologies tested       under the Cyber Sense program for cybersecurity       vulnerabilities and provide analysis with respect to how such       products and technologies respond to and mitigate cyber       threats;        (5) develop guidance, that is informed by analysis and       testing results under the Cyber Sense program, for electric       utilities for procurement of products and technologies;        (6) provide reasonable notice to the public, and solicit       comments from the public, prior to establishing or revising       the testing process under the Cyber Sense program;        (7) oversee testing of products and technologies under the       Cyber Sense program; and        (8) consider incentives to encourage the use of analysis       and results of testing under the Cyber Sense program in the       design of products and technologies for use in the bulk-power       system.        (c) Disclosure of Information.--Any cybersecurity       vulnerability reported pursuant to a process established       under subsection (b)(2), the disclosure of which the       Secretary of Energy reasonably foresees would cause harm to       critical electric infrastructure (as defined in section 215A       of the Federal Power Act), shall be deemed to be critical       electric infrastructure information for purposes of section       215A(d) of the Federal Power Act.        (d) Federal Government Liability.--Nothing in this section       shall be construed to authorize the commencement of an action       against the United States Government with respect to the       testing of a product or technology under the Cyber Sense       program.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 360.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 360, the Cyber Sense Act of  2020.   Grid security is a national security issue and one that is clearly  and properly delegated under law to the Secretary of Energy to manage  together with the industry. We must give the electric sector the tools  and technologies necessary to protect our grid from malicious harm.   Fortunately, there has not yet been a broad cyberattack that has  taken down large parts of the grid in the United States, but we must  not let our guard down.   H.R. 360 gives the Department of Energy important and new authorities  to facilitate more secure technologies and equipment in our Nation's  grid. It also now requires the Secretary to coordinate with the  Department of Homeland Security and other relevant Federal agencies in  order to ensure smooth and seamless implementation across the Federal  Government.   This bill requires the Department of Energy to set up a voluntary  Cyber Sense program to identify cyber-secure products that could be  used in the bulk-power system.   This program would also provide technical assistance to electric  utilities and product manufacturers to assist them in developing  solutions to mitigate cyber vulnerabilities in the grid.   I thank my colleagues, Representative McNerney and Representative  Latta, for their hard work on this critical issue. Their partnership  and bipartisan leadership on cybersecurity matters continues to benefit  us all.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional Members that wish to  speak.   Mr. Speaker, I enter into the Record a letter to the Speaker and the  minority leader from the American Public Power Association, Edison  Electric Institute, and the National Rural Electric Cooperative  Association in support of this legislation.                                                September 28, 2020.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy: We are       writing in support of full House consideration of three       electric grid security bills passed by the House Energy and       Commerce Committee: H.R. 359, the Enhancing Grid Security       through Public-Private Partnerships Act; H.R. 360, the Cyber       Sense Act of 2020; and H.R. 362, the Energy Emergency       Leadership Act.        APPA is the national service organization for not-for-      profit, community-owned utilities that power 2,000 towns and       cities nationwide. Public power utilities account for over 15       percent of all electric sales to over 49 million customers in       every state but Hawaii. EEI is the association that       represents all U.S. investor-owned electric companies. EEI       members provide electricity for about 220 million Americans,       and operate in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.       NRECA is the national service organization representing the       interests of cooperative electric utilities and the consumers       they serve. More than 900 not-for-profit rural electric       utilities provide electricity to over 42 million people in 48       states.        Protecting and maintaining electric sector security and       reliability is a top priority for our associations and our       members. To keep up with evolving threats, the industry       welcomes close coordination with government partners. The       bills scheduled for consideration by the House this week are       aimed at strengthening our shared responsibility to protect       the nation's critical infrastructure. We are particularly       supportive of H.R. 359 and H.R. 362. H.R. 359 directs DOE to       establish a program to facilitate and encourage public-      private partnerships to promote and advance the physical and       cybersecurity of the electric power sector. H.R. 362 would       amend the DOE Organization Act to include energy emergency       and energy security among the functions that the Secretary       assigns to an Assistant Secretary, with the intent to clarify       and codify the functions of DOE's Office of Cybersecurity,       Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER).        Thank you for your consideration. We appreciate your       leadership and efforts to help improve the security of our       nation's electric grid.            Sincerely,      American Public Power Association.      Edison Electric Institute.      National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.     Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this  important bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 359) to provide for certain programs and developments in the  Department of Energy concerning the cybersecurity and vulnerabilities  of, and physical threats to, the electric grid, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 359         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H4970]]            SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Enhancing Grid Security       through Public-Private Partnerships Act''.       SEC. 2. PROGRAM TO PROMOTE AND ADVANCE PHYSICAL SECURITY AND                     CYBERSECURITY OF ELECTRIC UTILITIES.         (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of Energy, in       coordination with relevant Federal agencies and in       consultation with State regulatory authorities, industry       stakeholders, and the Electric Reliability Organization, as       the Secretary determines appropriate, shall carry out a       program to--        (1) develop, and provide for voluntary implementation of,       maturity models, self-assessments, and auditing methods for       assessing the physical security and cybersecurity of electric       utilities;        (2) provide training to electric utilities to address and       mitigate cybersecurity supply chain management risks;        (3) increase opportunities for sharing best practices and       data collection within the electric sector;        (4) assist with cybersecurity training for electric       utilities;        (5) advance the cybersecurity of third-party vendors that       work in partnerships with electric utilities; and        (6) provide technical assistance for electric utilities       subject to the program.

SEC. 4. ELECTRICITY INTERRUPTION INFORMATION.         (a) Interruption Cost Estimate Calculator.--The Secretary       of Energy, in coordination with relevant Federal agencies and       in consultation with State regulatory authorities, industry       stakeholders, and the Electric Reliability Organization, as       the Secretary determines appropriate, shall update the       Interruption Cost Estimate Calculator, as often as       appropriate and feasible, but not less than once every 2       years.        (b) Indices.--The Secretary of Energy, in coordination with       relevant Federal agencies and in consultation with State       regulatory authorities, industry stakeholders, and the       Electric Reliability Organization, as the Secretary       determines appropriate, shall, as often as appropriate and       feasible, update the following:        (1) The System Average Interruption Duration Index.        (2) The System Average Interruption Frequency Index.        (3) The Customer Average Interruption Duration Index.        (c) Survey.--The Administrator of the Energy Information       Administration shall collect information on electricity       interruption costs, if available, from a representative       sample of owners of electric grid assets through a biennial       survey.       SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.         In the Act, the following definitions apply:        (1) Electric reliability organization.--The term ``Electric       Reliability Organization'' has the meaning given such term in       section 215(a)(2) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C.       824o(a)(2)).        (2) Electric utility.--The term ``electric utility'' has       the meaning given such term in section 3 of the Federal Power       Act (16 U.S.C. 796).        (3) State regulatory authority.--The term ``State       regulatory authority'' has the meaning given such term in       section 3 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 796).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 359.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by acknowledging the leadership of two  of my Energy and Commerce Committee colleagues, Representative McNerney  of California and Representative Latta of Ohio, for introducing H.R.  359, the Enhancing Grid Security Through Public-Private Partnerships  Act.   This bill will go a long way in addressing both the physical and  cybersecurity of the Nation's utilities.   H.R. 359 directs the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the  Electric Reliability Organization, States, other Federal agencies, and  industry stakeholders, to create and implement a program to enhance the  physical and cybersecurity of electric utilities.   Now, some of the critical provisions within this bill include the  voluntary implementation of self-assessments, maturity modeling, and  auditing.   This bill also includes cybersecurity training in order to help  mitigate supply chain risk.   Utilities would also be encouraged to share best practices and data  collection within the electric sector, while also improving the  cybersecurity of third-party utility vendors.   H.R. 359 also directs the Secretary of Energy to deliver a report to  Congress on general cybersecurity concerns and distribution systems.   Any information that is provided to the Department of Energy under  this program would be protected to ensure the confidentiality of this  sensitive information. And like the other two cybersecurity bills we  already have passed today; this legislation requires the Secretary of  Energy to coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security and other  relevant Federal agencies to ensure good communication and smooth  implementation across the government.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, the bill instructs the Secretary of Energy to  update the Interruption Cost Estimate, or ICE, Calculator at least once  every 2 years.   The ICE Calculator, which was developed through a partnership between  the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley Lab and Nexant, Inc., is  an electric reliability planning tool that can be used for estimating  electricity interruption costs and the benefits associated with  reliability improvements.   So, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 359 is an important piece of legislation that  will help address the security of America's electric utilities, and I  urge all my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).    Mr. Speaker, I also ask all Members to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1289) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to provide for  a moratorium on number reassignment after a disaster declaration, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1289         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Preserving Home and Office       Numbers in Emergencies Act of 2020'' or the ``PHONE Act of       2020''.       SEC. 2. MORATORIUM ON NUMBER REASSIGNMENT AFTER DISASTER                     DECLARATION.

(c) Applicability.--Paragraph (4) of section 251(e) of the       Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 251(e)), as added by       subsection (a), shall apply with respect to a major disaster       declared by the President under section 401 of the Robert T.       Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42       U.S.C. 5170) after the date that is 180 days after the date       on which the Commission announces that the Commission is       capable of publicly identifying a designated area on the       website of the Commission under subparagraph (D) of such       paragraph (4).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1289.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong support of Representative Thompson's legislation,  H.R. 1289, the Preserving Home and Office Numbers in Emergencies Act of  2019, or the PHONE Act.   Mr. Speaker, after the Atlas and Tubbs fires in October 2017 in  northern California, Representative Thompson's constituents returned to  what was left of their homes. In the rebuilding process, many of them  were frustrated to learn that their phone numbers, which they had had  for years, had been given away by the phone company.   It was as if their phone number, of all things, went up in smoke with  the rest of their lifelong possessions. This issue just continues to  grow as natural disasters like fires and hurricanes have become all too  common and more severe as a result of climate change.   So, just this past weekend, hundreds of homes in Napa and Sonoma  Counties had to be evacuated because of another fast-moving fire, and  this bill aims to fix the problems that relate to phone numbers during  these crises.   First, if the President has issued a major disaster declaration, and  a Governor has designated an area to the Federal Communications  Commission under the PHONE Act, the phone numbers in that designated  area cannot be reassigned for 1 year.   Second, if a consumer needs more time, this legislation allows them  to get another yearlong extension. We know this is important because,  in some disasters, like Superstorm Sandy in my district, for example,  the home-rebuilding process took, in some cases, over 6 years.   Third, the legislation would allow consumers whose homes are  inaccessible or uninhabitable to cancel their service without a  cancelation fee or resubscription fee when they get phone service  somewhere else in the area during that covered period.   Now, I am glad we could reach an agreement with our Republican  colleagues on this part of the bill to ensure this policy makes sense  in practice. This was a compromise, and, therefore, I know there are  some things that they would do differently. At the same time, there are  a few things that we on this side of the aisle may have done  differently. But with this compromise, this policy is simple yet, I  believe, powerful.   In the age of robocalls, dialing our friends and loved ones from  phone numbers we have always had is how we get through. A lot of people  simply will not pick up the phone if they don't recognize the phone  number, and that is why this legislation is so important.   The legal effect and intent of this bill are designed purposely to be  narrow, but it plugs a small gap in the law, which will mean the world  to the consumers who will have one less thing to worry about as they  face rebuilding in the aftermath of a devastating natural disaster.   Again, I want to thank Representatives Thompson and Rooney for their  bipartisan leadership on this bill. The PHONE Act is a commonsense  bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).    Mr. Speaker, I will do the same. I urge support of this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1754) to improve the integrity and safety of horseracing by  requiring a uniform anti-doping and medication control program to be  developed and enforced by an independent Horseracing Anti-Doping and  Medication Control Authority, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1754         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(5) The administration of medications and treatment methods       to covered horses should be based upon an examination and       diagnosis that identifies an issue requiring treatment for       which the medication or method represents an appropriate       component of treatment.        (6) The amount of therapeutic medication that a covered       horse receives should be the minimum necessary to address the       diagnosed health concerns identified during the examination       and diagnostic process.        (7) The welfare of covered horses, the integrity of the       sport, and the confidence of the betting public require full       disclosure to regulatory authorities regarding the       administration of medications and treatments to covered       horses.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1754.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise to speak in support of H.R. 1754. Horseracing in the United  States is more than just a sport; it is a tradition. But far too often,  the joy of the races is marred by accidents that endanger both the  horses and the riders.   Last year, nearly 450 thoroughbred racehorses in the United States  suffered fatal injuries. The fatality rate in the U.S. is between 2\1/ 2\ to 5 times greater per race start than the fatality rates in Europe  and Asia. Some of the key reasons for these higher fatality rates are  our drug policies, training and race protocols, and racetrack  standards.   In the United States, racehorses are commonly administered pain  medications to ease discomfort and reduce inflammation. These  medications may mask relatively minor injuries, making prerace  detection of injuries more difficult.   The stress and pressure generated by a 1,100-pound racehorse  sprinting at speeds up to 40 miles per hour can cause minor injuries to  become catastrophic breaks that ultimately lead to a horse's death.  That is why only a limited number of pain suppressors are permitted to  be administered to racehorses internationally and in the U.S.   While many permitted pain suppressors are banned from being  administered several days or even weeks before an international  horserace, many of those same medications are permitted to be  administered to racehorses a day or two before most races start in the  United States.   Racehorses need appropriate time to recover after intense physical  activity and should not train or race if suffering from soreness,  swelling, or pain indicative of a more severe ailment. And racehorses  should not race or train on unsuitable, treacherous tracks.   Mr. Speaker, horseracing currently has no national governing body and  is, instead, regulated independently by each of the 38 States in which  the sport is legal. Therefore, implementing change to address these  issues is difficult.   The bill, the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act, addresses these  challenges head-on. The bill establishes uniform standards for  antidoping and medication control and racetrack safety for thoroughbred  horseracing. This will help ensure that we can maintain a safe,  thriving horseracing industry.   It also applies stronger safeguards and enforcement against  performance-enhancing drugs, or PEDs.   For a sport in which fans place billions of dollars of bets, trust in  the authenticity of competition is crucial. The very legitimacy of the  sport is undermined if the competitors and public cannot trust that all  racehorses are competing on a level playing field.   I am pleased that the Humane Society, the Jockey Club, the Breeders'  Cup, Animal Welfare Action, several racetracks, and many horsemen  support this bill.   I want to thank Representative Tonko and Consumer Protection and  Commerce Subcommittee Chair Schakowsky for their tireless leadership on  this issue.   The bill is the first step toward a safer, fairer horseracing  industry, and that is a bill I am proud to support.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).   Mr. Speaker, let me say how proud we are, both he, for representing  Saratoga, and I, for representing Monmouth Park, two very historic race  tracks that we are very proud of.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the chairwoman of the  Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce, who has been a  tireless leader on this issue, and, in particular, for the protection  of animals.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank everyone who spoke. I know that Ms. Schakowsky  is such a champion for animals--horses and other animals. And, of  course, Mr. Tonko has worked so hard and aggressively--I guess is the  best way to put it--on this legislation. But also, when I listen to Mr.  Barr, my colleague from Kentucky, talk about Kentucky and racetracks, I  could just as easily have substituted Monmouth Park, which is my  thoroughbred track, for almost everything he said.   Monmouth Park is less than a mile from my district office in my  hometown. My father, my uncle--so many people in my family--either  worked there or bet there or enjoyed the horses there. But particularly  when you talked about the industry, in my home county, which is  Monmouth County, it is not only a question of jobs, which there are so  many that depend on the track, but also open space.   As you know, New Jersey is the most densely populated State. And we  are in part of the State that still has a lot of farms, but most of  them are horse farms. And without those horse farms, the very character  of Monmouth County would not be the same. Whether it is the economics,  whether it is open space, or it is just a tradition, this bill makes it  possible, in my opinion, for that to continue. And, hopefully, as Mr.  Barr said, open up to new fans as well.   Madam Speaker, this is a very important piece of legislation, and I  urge my colleagues to support it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8134) to support the Consumer Product Safety Commission's  capability to protect consumers from unsafe consumer products, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8134         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 6. SAVINGS CLAUSE.         Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit, affect, or       conflict with any other authority of the Commission or any       other statutory requirements governing the Commission.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 8134.    Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 8134,  the Consumer Product Safety Inspection Enhancement Act, and I yield  myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, this bipartisan legislation was introduced by Consumer  Protection and Commerce Subcommittee chair Jan Schakowsky and  Representative Jeff Duncan and advanced out of the Committee on Energy  and Commerce on September 9 by a voice vote.   This important legislation will empower the Consumer Product Safety  Commission with the data it needs to protect Americans from the flood  of unsafe products entering our Nation from overseas, especially e- commerce shipments entering under the de minimis value exemption. It  will also help ensure the Commission has adequate staffing to support  these efforts.   Madam Speaker, e-commerce spending has risen steeply during the  COVID-19 pandemic as Americans turn to online shopping to safely get  needed goods or to find scarce supplies. Even before the pandemic,  however, the CPSC was projecting that the number of e-commerce  shipments to the United States would soon reach 60 million per year and  represent well over 50 percent of the total volume of imports under the  agency's jurisdiction.   Despite the rapid growth in e-commerce, these shipments entering the  U.S. from overseas continue to face little scrutiny at our ports and  often contain fake or dangerous products.   Currently, CPSC inspectors are present at only 6 percent of U.S.  ports and concentrated only at seaports that receive large, high-value  shipping containers. The agency virtually has no presence at the kinds  of ports where millions of e-commerce shipments enter the United  States, such as express courier facilities, international mail  facilities, and airports.   We need CPSC inspectors stationed in all these types of places to  prevent unsafe products from entering the U.S. and harming Americans.  CPSC will also need more data and more advanced IT infrastructure in  order to properly assess risk and target potentially unsafe e-commerce  shipments.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 8134 addresses all these issues. It expands  CPSC's presence at ports, to include the type of ports where e-commerce  shipments enter. It also empowers the CPSC to collect the data it needs  to identify and block e-commerce shipments that disregard our consumer  product safety laws and standards.   This bill would protect American consumers from unsafe consumer  products, at the same time an expanded and enhanced import surveillance  program will also protect manufacturers and retailers from having to  carry out costly recalls.   Madam Speaker, I, again, commend Chairwoman Schakowsky and  Representative Duncan for introducing this bill. I also thank Ranking  Member Walden and subcommittee Ranking Member Rodgers for working with  us to move this bill through the Committee on Energy and Commerce on a  bipartisan basis.   Madam Speaker, I call on my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the subcommittee  chairwoman.    Madam Speaker, I would ask my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8128) to direct the Consumer Product Safety Commission to  establish a pilot program to explore the use of artificial intelligence  in support of the consumer product safety mission of the Commission, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Congress finds that--        (1) it is important that the United States remains a leader       in innovation;        (2) digital tokens and blockchain technology are driving       innovation and providing consumers with increased choice and       convenience;        (3) the use of digital tokens and blockchain technology is       likely to increase in the future;        (4) the Federal Trade Commission is responsible for       protecting consumers from unfair or deceptive acts or       practices, including relating to digital tokens;        (5) the Commission has previously taken action against       unscrupulous companies and individuals that committed unfair       or deceptive acts or practices involving digital tokens; and        (6) to bolster the Commission's ability to enforce against       unfair or deceptive acts or practices involving digital       tokens, the Commission should ensure staff have appropriate       training and resources to identify and pursue such cases.       SEC. 303. REPORTS ON UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE ACTS OR PRACTICES IN                     TRANSACTIONS RELATING TO DIGITAL TOKENS.         Not later than one year after the date of enactment of this       Act and each year thereafter until fiscal year 2024, the       Federal Trade Commission shall transmit to the Committee on       Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the       Senate, and make publicly available on its website, a report       of--        (1) any actions taken by the Commission relating to unfair       or deceptive acts or practices in transactions relating to       digital tokens;        (2) the Commission's other efforts to prevent unfair or       deceptive acts or practices relating to digital tokens; and        (3) any recommendations by the Commission for legislation       that would improve the ability of the Commission and other       relevant Federal agencies--        (A) to further protect consumers from unfair or deceptive       acts or practices in the digital token marketplace; and        (B) to promote competition and promote innovation in the       global digital token sector.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 8128.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8128, and I want to begin by  thanking Representatives McNerney and Burgess for their leadership on  H.R. 8128, the Consumer Safety Technology Act. This bill advanced out  of the Energy and Commerce Committee earlier this month, on September  9, by voice vote.   The legislation will help modernize our consumer protection agencies  and encourage the use of advanced technologies, like artificial  intelligence and blockchain, in support of product safety and consumer  protection. These technologies can help the Consumer Product Safety  Commission and the Federal Trade Commission improve their operations  and more effectively carry out their mission.   Technological advances and globalization have greatly expanded the  range of consumer products on the market, and as consumers shop online,  more and more of these products are being shipped directly to homes. AI  could help the CPSC oversee the increasingly complex range of products  under its jurisdiction by helping identify new injury trends and  emerging hazards.   AI can also help the CPSC monitor online marketplaces for the illegal  sale of recalled products. The persistence of recalled products on  online third-party marketplaces is a particularly pernicious problem  that puts Americans needlessly at risk.   For example, months after the dangerous Fisher-Price Rock `n Play and  other infant inclined sleepers were recalled, a Consumer Reports  investigation found that these products were still being sold on sites  like Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist, even though they had been  linked to dozens of infant fatalities. I am hopeful that AI can be  harnessed here to help eradicate the sale of recalled products in these  online marketplaces.   Madam Speaker, the CPSC could also use AI to assess the risk of the  growing number of imported consumer products entering our country and  being sent directly to consumers.   I want to thank Representatives Soto, Guthrie, and Matsui for  introducing the Blockchain Innovation Act, which was incorporated into  H.R. 8128 during the full committee's consideration of the bill. So,  too, was the Digital Taxonomy Act, which was introduced by  Representatives Davidson and Soto.   Together, these bills will help identify ways blockchain technology  can be used to further support consumer protection. It will also make  sure that scammers and fraudsters don't get ahead of consumers and law  enforcement in the realm of blockchain and digital tokens.   Finally, I want to thank Ranking Member Walden and subcommittee  Ranking Member Rodgers for working with us to move this bill through  the Energy and Commerce Committee on a bipartisan basis.   Madam Speaker, I call on my colleagues to support the measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 8132.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 8132.   This bipartisan legislation was introduced by the ranking member of  the Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee, Cathy Rodgers, and  Representative   Bobby Rush. I thank them for drafting this measure to  help the U.S. thrive and stay competitive in this global economy. It  advanced out of the Energy and Commerce Committee on September 9 by a  voice vote.   This bill calls on relevant Federal agencies to examine the state of  various industries in the U.S., helping protect America's leadership  with respect to emerging technology. For small business, this  legislation will help them take advantage of different kinds of  emerging technologies, like quantum computing and 3D printing.   The bill will also protect Americans, ensuring that we have a full  understanding of the effect unmanned delivery services will have on  road safety, traffic congestion, and labor, including how any negative  effects can be mitigated.   I am also pleased that this bill requires the Federal Trade  Commission to examine how artificial intelligence can be used to combat  online harms. With disinformation proliferating on the internet and  foreign meddling in our elections picking up once again, we need to be  using all the tools at our disposal to put a stop to wrongful online  abuses that endanger Americans and undermine our democracy.   Madam Speaker, I call on my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,             and Technology,                                Washington, DC, September 25, 2020.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       8132, the ``American Competitiveness of a More Productive       Emerging Tech Economy Act'' or the ``American COMPETE Act.''       This legislation involves various aspects of technology       development. However, in an effort to expedite consideration       of this measure, I agree to not seek a sequential referral so       that the bill may be considered expeditiously.        I take this action with our mutual understanding that by       foregoing consideration of H.R. 8132 at this time, we do not       waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in       this or similar legislation. I ask to be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding and ask that a copy of our       exchange of letters on this matter be included in the bill       report filed by the Committee on Energy and Commerce, as well       as inserted in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration, to memorialize our understanding.            Sincerely,                                          Eddie Bernice Johnson,                                   Chairwoman, Committee on Science,      Space, and Technology.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                 Washington, DC, September 28, 2020.      Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Chairwoman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Johnson: I am writing concerning H.R. 8132,       the ``American Compete Act,'' which was referred to the       Committee on Energy and Commerce on August 28, 2020.        I appreciate you not seeking a sequential referral of H.R.       8132 so that the bill may be considered expeditiously. I       acknowledge that forgoing your referral claim does not waive,       reduce, or otherwise affect the jurisdiction of the Committee       on Science, Space, and Technology over this legislation, or       any similar legislation. I will appropriately consult and       involve the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology as       this bill progresses.        I will ensure our letters on H.R. 8132 are included in the       bill report filed by the Committee on Energy and Commerce and       entered into the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. I appreciate your cooperation       regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to       work together as this measure moves through the legislative       process.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the chairwoman of the  subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1400     Madam Speaker, I guess I should say that, I don't know,  maybe because I don't want Mr. Walden to retire or maybe because it is  only September, I am not ready to say good-bye yet, so even though some  wonderful comments have been made by Ms. Schakowsky, I am going wait a  while.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4764) to reauthorize the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research  Act of 2005, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4764.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the C.W. Bill Young Transplantation Program was first  established through a partnership with the Navy in 1986, transferred to  the National Institutes of Health for oversight in 1987, and then  authorized by the Energy and Commerce Committee in 1990. The program  has since been reauthorized four times, and every time it has been  accomplished with strong bipartisan support.   I believe that bipartisan support will continue today with H.R. 4764,  the TRANSPLANT Act of 2019, which will reauthorize the C.W. Bill Young  Transplantation Program for the fifth time.   Year after year, this program provides lifesaving bone marrow and  umbilical cord blood transplants to help patients suffering from over  70 diseases. The program assists transplant patients by providing  additional information about bone marrow and cord blood transplants,  maintaining an efficient process for identifying donor matches,  increasing the number of unrelated donors available for transplant, and  collecting data and expanding research to improve patient outcomes.   I thank my committee colleagues, Representatives Matsui and  Bilirakis, for their leadership on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I also ask for bipartisan support for  this legislation. I mention that I do intend to seek a recorded vote.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5373) to reauthorize the United States Anti-Doping Agency,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5373         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``United States Anti-Doping       Agency Reauthorization Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. PROMOTION OF YOUTH SPORTS.         Section 701(b) of the Office of National Drug Control       Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006 (21 U.S.C. 2001(b)) is       amended--        (1) in paragraph (4), by striking the period at the end and       inserting ``; and''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(5) promote a positive youth sport experience by using a       portion of its funding to provide educational materials on       sportsmanship, character building, and healthy performance       for athletes, parents, and coaches participating in youth       sports.''.       SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.         Section 703 of the Office of National Drug Control Policy       Reauthorization Act of 2006 (21 U.S.C. 2003) is amended to       read as follows:       ``SEC. 703.

SEC. 4. COORDINATION AND SHARING OF INFORMATION WITH USADA.         (a) Information Sharing.--Except as otherwise prohibited by       law and except in cases in which the integrity of a criminal       investigation would be affected, in furtherance of the       obligation of the United States under Article 7 of the       Convention, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland       Security, and the Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall       coordinate with the United States Anti-Doping Agency with       regard to any effort to prevent the use of performance-      enhancing drugs or prohibit performance-enhancing methods by       sharing with the United States Anti-Doping Agency all       information which may be relevant to preventing the use of       such performance-enhancing drugs or prohibiting such       performance-enhancing methods.        (b) Convention Defined.--In this section, the term       ``Convention'' means the United Nations Educational,       Scientific, and Cultural Organization International       Convention Against Doping in Sport done at Paris October 19,       2005, and ratified by the United States in 2008.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5373.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 5373, the United States Anti-Doping  Agency Reauthorization Act of 2020.   For two decades, Madam Speaker, the United States Anti-Doping Agency,  or USADA, has worked to ensure integrity in our American Olympic and  Paralympic sporting activities.   In the 1990s, countries around the world viewed American athletes as  dirty and only winning because they were doping.   In an effort to bring credibility back to the United States, an  Olympic committee task force recommended that an independent  organization be created to conduct a comprehensive antidoping program.  In 2000, Congress acted on this recommendation and gave USADA the  authority to manage this comprehensive antidoping program.   Since then, USADA has performed hundreds of thousands of tests and  contributed to the advancement of clean sports through scientific  research, antidoping education, and outreach programs.   In order to enable USADA to continue this work, H.R. 5373 would  extend and increase the authorization level and empower the  organization to encourage a positive sporting environment for youth by  way of promoting educational materials on sportsmanship, character  building, and healthy performance. By advancing this bill, we will send  a strong message to young athletes about the importance of integrity,  respect, and responsibility in sports.   The bill also improves antidoping efforts in the U.S. by encouraging  Federal agencies to coordinate and share  [[Page H4999]]  information with the USADA to prevent the use of performance-enhancing  drugs and methods.   Taken together, these actions will make positive improvements to the  good work USADA is already doing. And passage takes on additional  importance as USADA gears up for the 2028 Summer Olympic and Paralympic  Games in Los Angeles.   Before I conclude, Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues,  Representatives   Mike Thompson, Bill Johnson, and Diana DeGette, for  leading this important legislation. I also thank our Ranking Member  Walden and all the members and staff of our committees for their  efforts to move this legislation forward in a bipartisan manner.   So, Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge support for the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4078) to reauthorize the Young Women's Breast Health  Education and Awareness Requires Learning Young Act of 2009, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4078         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``EARLY Act Reauthorization of       2020''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF THE YOUNG WOMEN'S BREAST HEALTH                     EDUCATION AND AWARENESS REQUIRES LEARNING YOUNG                     ACT OF 2009.         Section 399NN(h) of the Public Health Service Act (42       U.S.C. 280m(h)) is amended by striking ``$4,900,000 for each       of fiscal years 2015 through 2019'' and inserting       ``$9,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2021 through 2025''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4078.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, tragically, one in eight women in the United States  will be diagnosed with breast cancer over their lifetime. Breast cancer  is the most common form of cancer in women and the second leading cause  of cancer death in women. From 2013 to 2017, breast cancer death rates  in older women declined. However, breast cancer death rates have  remained steady in younger women.   We know that breast health education, awareness, and screening saves  lives.   The bill we are considering today, H.R. 4078, the EARLY Act  Reauthorization, reauthorizes initiatives at the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention to increase knowledge of breast cancer and risks  of breast cancer among young women. This bill nearly doubles the  investment Congress is making in this program, because we believe it is  crucial that we stop losing young moms, daughters, sisters, and  friends, to breast cancer.   This program is critically important, and I want to thank  Representatives Wasserman Schultz and Brooks for their bipartisan  leadership on this program.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4078, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the sponsor of  the legislation.    Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4996) to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to  provide for a State option under the Medicaid program to provide for  and extend continuous coverage for certain individuals, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4996         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Helping Medicaid Offer       Maternity Services Act of 2020'' or the ``Helping MOMS Act of       2020''.       SEC. 2. MODIFICATIONS TO CERTAIN COVERAGE UNDER MEDICAID AND                     CHIP FOR PREGNANT AND POSTPARTUM WOMEN.

(2) Optional coverage of targeted low-income pregnant       women.--Section 2112(d)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act (42       U.S.C. 1397ll(d)(2)(A)) is amended by inserting after ``60-      day period'' the following: ``, or, in the case that section       1902(e)(16) applies to the State child health plan (or waiver       of such plan) pursuant to section 2107(e)(1), the 1-year       period''.        (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section       shall apply with respect to State elections made under       paragraph (16) of section 1902(e) of the Social Security Act       (42 U.S.C. 1396a(e)), as added by subsection (a), under title       XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) on or       after the first day of the first fiscal year quarter       beginning at least one year after the date of the enactment       of this Act.

(2) An analysis of barriers to covering doula services       under State Medicaid programs.        (3) An identification of effective strategies to increase       the use of doula services in order to provide better care and       achieve better maternal and infant health outcomes, including       strategies that States may use to recruit, train, and certify       a diverse doula workforce, particularly from underserved       communities, communities of color, and communities facing       linguistic or cultural barriers.        (4) Recommendations for legislative and administrative       actions to increase access to doula services in State       Medicaid programs, including actions that ensure doulas may       earn a living wage that accounts for their time and costs       associated with providing care.        (b) Stakeholder Consultation.--In developing the report       required under subsection (a), MACPAC shall consult with       relevant stakeholders, including--        (1) States;        (2) organizations representing consumers, including those       that are disproportionately impacted by poor maternal health       outcomes;        (3) organizations and individuals representing doula       services providers, including community-based doula programs       and those who serve underserved communities, including       communities of color, and communities facing linguistic or       cultural barriers; and        (4) organizations representing health care providers.

Section 1941(b)(3) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C       1396w-1(b)(3)) is amended--        (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``for fiscal year 2025       and thereafter, $1,960,000,000'' and inserting ``for fiscal       year 2022 and thereafter, $9,286,000,000''; and        (2) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``fiscal year 2025''       and inserting ``fiscal year 2022''.       SEC. 8. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4996.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4996, the Helping Medicaid  Offer Maternity Services Act, or the Helping MOMS Act of 2020.   The U.S. has some of the world's leading healthcare providers. We  have cutting-edge researchers and first-class facilities for those who  can afford it.   At the same time, women are more likely to die from complications  from  [[Page H5002]]  childbirth here in the U.S. than in other nations in the developed  world. Maternal mortality especially affects women of color. Black  women and American Indian and Alaska Native women are three times more  likely than White women to die from pregnancy-related causes. Even more  tragically, most of these deaths are preventable.   These statistics are unacceptable. They are an indictment of our  healthcare system, Madam Speaker, and I believe we can do better.   Ensuring that women have access to health insurance for the first  year postpartum is an obvious first step that we can take to ensure  that all women, regardless of income, have access to the care they need  for the critical first year after giving birth.   Currently, Medicaid covers pregnant women for 60 days postpartum.  After that, many women lose eligibility and go without a consistent  source of care. The Helping MOMS Act would build on this coverage by  giving States the option to extend Medicaid coverage to women to a full  year postpartum.   This bill is endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and  Gynecologists, the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs,  the National Birth Equity Collaborative, the March of Dimes, and many  more organizations.   I want to commend Representative Robin Kelly for her passion and  commitment to this bill and to improving the lives of new mothers.   I also want to thank and recognize Representative   Michael Burgess,  the ranking member of the Health Subcommittee, for his steadfast  leadership on the Republican side.   Finally, I want to recognize the efforts of Representatives Lauren  Underwood, Cathy Rodgers, Ayanna Pressley, and Buddy Carter for their  leadership on this issue and their commitment to bipartisan solutions.   Too many children in this country, Madam Speaker, grow up knowing  their mothers only as a fading picture on the wall or as someone whose  name brings a bittersweet smile and a tear to friends and loved ones.  It doesn't have to be this way.   This bill will not singlehandedly fix the maternal health crisis in  this country, but it will mean that more of these children will have a  mother to take care of them, tuck them in at night, comfort them in  moments of need, and share in their moments of joy and sorrow. I urge  my colleagues to support this bill for these children and their  mothers.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Kelly), the sponsor of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I would urge support for the bill, and I  also yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3131) to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for  research and improvement of cardiovascular health among the South Asian  population of the United States, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3131         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 3. HEART HEALTH RESEARCH.         Part B of title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42       U.S.C. 284 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the       following new section:       ``SEC. 409K. HEART HEALTH RESEARCH.         ``(a) In General.--The Secretary may--        ``(1) conduct or support research and related activities       regarding cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and other       heart health-related ailments among at-risk populations,       including South Asian communities in the United States; and        ``(2) establish an Internet clearinghouse to catalog       existing evidence-based heart health research and treatment       options for communities disproportionately affected by heart       disease, such as South Asian communities in the United       States, to prevent, treat, or reverse heart disease and       diabetes.        ``(b) Authorization of Appropriations.--For purposes of       carrying out this section, there is authorized to be       appropriated $1,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2021 through       2025.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3131.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the  United States, and tragically, the risk of heart disease death differs  dramatically by race and ethnicity.   Overall, racial and ethnic minorities have an elevated risk of  morbidity and mortality due to heart disease. Racial and ethnic  minorities confront more barriers to heart health care than White  Americans, including higher comorbidity rates, less culturally  competent care, and fewer proactive heart health interventions.   This bill, the South Asian Heart Health Awareness and Research Act of  2020, directs the Department of Health and Human Services to build on  current heart disease programs to improve further heart health  awareness, education, training, and research for groups  disproportionately affected by heart disease.   In November 2019, the American Heart Association and other medical  groups issued updated cholesterol guidelines that, for the first time,  urged doctors to consider ethnicity when determining a patient's  cardiovascular risk and treatment options.   This bill builds upon the work of determined medical partners like  the American Heart Association to provide more resources for States  that wish to expand their heart health programs.   This bill would not be on the floor today without the determined  effort of Congresswoman Jayapal, and I commend her for her leadership  on this. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3131.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), who is the sponsor of  the bill.    I urge support of this the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time, Madam Speaker.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2468) to amend the Public Health Service Act to increase the  preference given, in awarding certain allergies and asthma-related  grants, to States that require certain public schools to have allergies  and asthma management programs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2468         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``School-Based Allergies and       Asthma Management Program Act''.       SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL PREFERENCE TO CERTAIN STATES THAT REQUIRE                     CERTAIN PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO HAVE ALLERGIES AND                     ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS.         Section 399L(d) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.       280g(d)) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1)(F)--        (A) by redesignating clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) as       subclauses (I), (II), and (III), respectively, and moving       each of such subclauses (as so redesignated) 2 ems to the       right;        (B) by striking ``epinephrine.--In determining'' and       inserting ``epinephrine or school comprehensive allergies and       asthma management program.--        ``(i) In general.--In determining'';        (C) by striking ``in the State--'' and inserting ``in the       State satisfy the criteria described in clause (ii) or clause       (iii).        ``(ii) Criteria for school personnel administration of       epinephrine.--For purposes of clause (i), the criteria       described in this clause, with respect to each public       elementary school and secondary school in the State, are that       each such school--''; and        (D) by adding at the end the following new clause:        ``(iii) Criteria for school comprehensive allergies and       asthma management program.--For purposes of clause (i), the       criteria described in this clause, with respect to each       public elementary school and secondary school in the State,       are that each such school--         ``(I) has in place a plan for having on the premises of the       school during all operating hours of the school a school       nurse or one or more other individuals who are designated by       the principal (or other appropriate administrative staff) of       the school to direct and apply the program described in       subclause (II) on a voluntary basis outside their scope of       employment; and        ``(II) has in place, under the direction of a school nurse       or other individual designated under subclause (I), a       comprehensive school-based allergies and asthma management       program that includes--         ``(aa) a method to identify all students of such school       with a diagnosis of allergies and asthma;        ``(bb) an individual student allergies and asthma action       plan for each student of such school with a diagnosis of       allergies and asthma;        ``(cc) allergies and asthma education for school staff who       are directly responsible for students who have been       identified as having allergies or asthma, such as education       regarding basics, management, trigger management, and       comprehensive emergency responses with respect to allergies       and asthma;        ``(dd) efforts to reduce the presence of environmental       triggers of allergies and asthma; and        ``(ee) a system to support students with a diagnosis of       allergies or asthma through coordination with family members       of such students, primary care providers of such students,       primary asthma or allergy care providers of such students,       and others as necessary.''; and        (2) in paragraph (3)(E)--        (A) in the matter preceding clause (i), by inserting ``,       such as the school nurse'' after ``individual''; and        (B) in clause (i), by inserting ``school nurse or'' before       ``principal''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in  [[Page H5005]]  which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous  material on H.R. 2468.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, more than 8 percent of children in the U.S. under the  age of 18 live with asthma. For these children and children with  respiratory issues caused by asthma, access to appropriate treatment  and trained personnel can mean the difference between life and death in  emergency situations.   In 2004, Congress authorized children's asthma treatment grants to  expand access to medical care for children who live in areas with a  prevalence of asthma. Today, CDC provides financial assistance to  health departments in 24 States and Puerto Rico to ensure that  guidelines-based medical management and pharmacotherapy for those with  asthma are both available and accessible. The CDC also offers funding  to State programs and national organizations promoting asthma quality  measures and informing policymakers about the burden of asthma.   H.R. 2468, the School-Based Allergies and Management Program Act,  takes the most recent data and builds on this program to make it work  best for kids and schools today. To achieve this, preference will be  given for certain grants to States that require schools to have a  school-based allergies and asthma program, as well as the presence of a  school nurse or other trained personnel who can support students and  staff treat those with allergies and asthma.   Helping States and schools to better support students and families  treat asthma and allergies is critical to the health and well-being of  our students, and this bill will go a long way towards achieving this  goal.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Majority Leader Hoyer for his  leadership on this bill as well as our colleague, Representative Roe. I  urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who is our majority leader.    Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5572) to establish a grant program for family community  organizations that provide support for individuals struggling with  substance use disorder and their families, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5572         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,  [[Page H5007]]            SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Family Support Services for       Addiction Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. FAMILY SUPPORT SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS STRUGGLING                     WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER.         Part D of title V of the Public Health Service Act (42       U.S.C. 290dd et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the       following:       ``SEC. 553.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5572.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5572, the Family  Support Services for Addiction Act of 2020.   According to new data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health  Services Administration, nearly 20 million Americans live with a  substance use disorder. While we are making progress in connecting  Americans with treatment, the reality is that only a fraction of those  Americans receives the care they really need.   The Family Support Services for Addiction Act builds upon recent  congressional efforts, such as the 21st Century Cures Act and the  SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, to help close the treatment  gap and get Americans on the road to recovery. We know that families  can play a significant role in helping an individual find treatment,  yet there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution to ensuring a family  member or loved one can get the care they need. We also know that  substance use disorders affect more than just the individual. It  affects the family in its entirety.   Madam Speaker, as my colleagues and I heard during our hearings on  this bill, getting families evidence-based guidance and connecting them  with other community support systems can dramatically influence the  trajectory of an individual's path to recovery. That is exactly what  this bill sets out to do.   H.R. 5572 would authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to award grants to family community organizations that would work to  develop, expand, and enhance evidence-based family support services.  These family community organizations can use the grant to reduce stigma  around substance use disorder and build connections between families  and providers, foster care services, and other peer-support services.   Madam Speaker, given the impact of this drug epidemic, chances are  that many of us know someone--whether it be a loved one, a neighbor, a  co-worker, or a classmate--who has a substance use disorder. And while  we know that substance use disorders are complex, they are treatable.  An individual's road to treatment can be driven by family supports  encouraged through this legislation.   I commend the lead sponsor of this legislation, Representative    David Trone and also Representative   Daniel Meuser, and their staff,  for advocating for additional support for families. I also thank the  Democratic and Republican members of our committee, as well as  bipartisan committee staff, for working together to move this bill, and  I hope the Senate will act on it swiftly.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Trone).    Madam Speaker, I also urge support for the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2075) to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize  school-based health centers, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2075         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``School-Based Health Centers       Reauthorization Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF SCHOOL-BASED HEALTH CENTERS.         (a) Elimination of Limitation on Eligibility of Health       Centers.--        (1) Repeal.--Section 399Z-1(f)(3) of the Public Health       Service Act (42 U.S.C. 280h-5(f)(3)) is amended by striking       subparagraph (B).        (2) Conforming change.--Section 399Z-1(f)(3) of the Public       Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 280h-5(f)(3)) is amended by       striking  [[Page H5009]]       ``Limitations'' and all that follows through ``Any provider       of services'' and inserting ``Limitation.--Any provider of       services''.        (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 399Z-1(l) of       the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 280h-5(l)) is       amended by striking ``2010 through 2014'' and inserting       ``2021 through 2025''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2075.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2075, the School-Based  Health Centers Reauthorization Act, which reauthorizes school-based  health centers.   These centers serve as critical access points that provide  comprehensive care to children and adolescents in their school, a  location that is safe, convenient, and accessible. They provide this  care through partnerships with community health providers, such as  federally qualified health centers, public health departments,  hospitals, schools, and other community institutions.   School-based health centers serve primarily low-income and medically  underserved populations of children and adolescents. These centers,  Madam Speaker, are a powerful tool for achieving health equity among  children and adolescents who unjustly experience disparities in health  outcomes because of ethnicity, race, or family income.   While many communities struggle with ways to keep students healthy,  school-based health centers are more important than ever. H.R. 2075  would reauthorize school-based health centers through fiscal year 2024,  ensuring continued access to these centers for the children and  families who need them most.   I want to thank Representatives Sarbanes, Tonko, Upton, and Stefanik  for their bipartisan leadership on this legislation.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7948) to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect to  the collection and availability of health data with respect to Indian  Tribes, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7948         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(b) Data Reporting and Dissemination.--Section 3101(c) of       the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300kk(c)) is       amended--        (1) by amending subparagraph (F) of paragraph (1) to read       as follows:        ``(F) the Indian Health Service, Indian Tribes, Tribal       organizations, and epidemiology centers authorized under the       Indian Health Care Improvement Act;''; and        (2) in paragraph (3), by inserting ``Indian Tribes, Tribal       organizations, and epidemiology centers,'' after ``Federal       agencies,''.        (c) Protection and Sharing of Data.--Section 3101(e) of the       Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300kk(e)) is amended by       adding at the end the following new paragraphs:        ``(3) Data sharing strategy.--With respect to data access       for Tribal epidemiology centers and Tribes, the Secretary       shall create a data sharing strategy that takes into       consideration recommendations by the Secretary's Tribal       Advisory Committee for--        ``(A) ensuring that Tribal epidemiology centers and Indian       Tribes have access to the data sources necessary to       accomplish their public health responsibilities; and        ``(B) protecting the privacy and security of such data.        ``(4) Tribal public health authority.--        ``(A) Availability.--Beginning not later than 180 days       after the date of the enactment of the Tribal Health Data       Improvement Act of 2020, the Secretary shall make available       to the entities listed in subparagraph (B) all data that is       collected pursuant to this title with respect to health care       and public health surveillance programs and activities,       including such programs and activities that are federally       supported or conducted, so long as--        ``(i) such entities request the data pursuant to statute;       and        ``(ii) the data is requested for use--         ``(I) consistent with Federal law and obligations; and        ``(II) to satisfy a particular purpose or carry out a       specific function consistent with the purpose for which the       data was collected.         ``(B) Entities.--The entities listed in this subparagraph       are--        ``(i) the Indian Health Service;        ``(ii) Indian Tribes and Tribal organizations; and        ``(iii) epidemiology centers.''.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 7948.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the health of American Indian and Alaska Native  populations lags behind all other races in the United States. Economic  adversity and poor social conditions have contributed to  disproportionate disease burden, lower life expectancies, and other  health inequalities in Tribal communities. Tragically, Tribal members  are expected to live 5.5 fewer years than other races.   Now, the coronavirus pandemic has further highlighted these  longstanding health inequalities. According to CDC data, more than one- third of nonelderly American Indians and Alaska Natives are at high  risk of developing a serious illness resulting from a COVID-19  infection, compared with one-fifth of the White nonelderly adults.   Today, we are taking an important step in improving health outcomes  by improving data access for Tribal Epidemiology Centers. These centers  manage regional public health information systems, disease prevention  and control programs, and coordinate with other public health  authorities in the collection and study of epidemiological data. None  of these functions work if Federal, State, and local partners are not  sharing relevant data in a secured manner.   H.R. 7948, the Tribal Health Data Improvement Act, ensures that  Tribal Nations are equipped with the necessary public health data to  operate public health programs and improve health outcomes within their  communities. It does this by clarifying the Federal role in collection  and availability of health data with respect to Indian Tribes.   The legislation also mandates ways of improving health statistics  reporting with respect to Indian Tribes, such as requiring the  Secretary to release all applicable public health data on Tribal  Epidemiology Centers within 180 days of enactment and requiring the CDC  to expand and improve their assistance to States with respect to  sharing data with Tribal entities.   Finally, the bill reauthorizes the National Center for Health  Statistics with additional funding for the new programs that are  established by the bill.   I want to thank Representatives Gianforte, Lujan, Rodgers, Mullin,  O'Halleran, and Ruiz for the excellent bipartisan work on this  legislation.   I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Lujan), a leader on Tribal issues.    Madam Speaker, I also urge support of the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5469) to address mental health issues for youth,  particularly youth of color, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5469         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 203. TECHNICAL CORRECTION.         Title V of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290aa       et seq.) is amended--        (1) by redesignating the second section 550 (42 U.S.C.       290ee-10) (relating to Sobriety Treatment And Recovery Teams)       as section 553; and        (2) by moving such section, as so redesignated, so as to       appear after section 552 (42 U.S.C. 290ee-7).     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5469.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5469, the Pursuing  Equity in Mental Health Act.   We have long known that people of color experience inequities in  healthcare in the United States. While we have made progress to close  these gaps in recent years, including with the passage of the  Affordable Care Act, people of color in America continue to experience  inequities in care and worse health outcomes compared to White  Americans.   These long-term trends are rooted in several social determinants that  are often driven by structural discrimination and institutionalized  racism, which has created systemic health inequity.   The tragic results of these long-term trends are that people of color  are more likely to suffer from underlying health conditions and have a  much harder time getting access to care, and when they do, they are far  more likely to experience bias, discrimination, and poor health  outcomes.   The Congressional Black Caucus' Emergency Task Force on Black Youth  Suicide and Mental Health reiterated these points in a report last year  that raised concerns about the increasing rates of suicide and mental  health trends among Black children. The need to address these increased  suicide rates has been recognized by public health experts, including  the National Institute of Mental Health Director, Dr. Joshua Gordon. He  recently wrote about mental health inequities, saying these gaps ``lead  to worse mental health outcomes in underserved and minority  communities.''   In testimony before our committee, the American Psychological  Association president, Dr. Arthur Evans, also underscored the need to  diversify our mental health workforce if we are to improve care for  communities of color.   The bill before us today, H.R. 5469, is aimed specifically at  addressing equity in mental health. The bill would invest resources  into better understanding racial and ethnic minority mental health  disparities, improve outreach and support for racial and ethnic  minorities, and expand provider support for students of color entering  the mental health workforce.   I am hopeful, Madam Speaker, that this bill will help reduce the  inequities in mental health. Before I conclude, I want to thank my  colleague from New Jersey, Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman, and  her staff for leading this important bill. I also thank Ranking Member  Walden and his staff for working with us in a bipartisan manner to move  this bill forward.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I also urge support for the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1109) to amend the Public Health Service Act to revise and  extend projects relating to children and to provide access to school- based comprehensive mental health programs, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1109         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1109.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1109, the Mental  Health Services for Students Act of 2020.   Research shows that half of all lifetime mental illness begins by the  age of 14. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  about three in four children between the ages of 3 and 17 suffer from  depression and anxiety, and nearly half have behavioral problems. In  fact, recent data from Mental Health America show that youth between  the ages of 11 and 17 are now at higher risk of moderate to severe  anxiety and depression.   For many students, schools are a critical place to get mental health  support. Now, with added public health concerns, economic pressures,  online learning, and the social isolation that comes with these things,  experts worry about the added repercussions we will be seeing on the  well-being of students across the country.   The data and the effect of the pandemic make clear that we must do  more to invest in preventative mental health services and training in  schools to give our kids and teens a brighter future.   The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on School Health  recognized the increasing mental health needs of children and  adolescents when it said that ``school-based mental health services  offer the potential for prevention efforts as well as intervention  strategies.'' H.R. 1109 does just that.   This bill would support comprehensive mental health programs at  schools across the Nation by encouraging partnerships between State and  local educational agencies and mental health providers. Funding would  be made available through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health  Services Administration to support prevention screening, treatment, and  development of evidence-based programs for social, emotional, and  mental and behavioral issues among students. This bill will also help  us better understand the student, family, and educational outcomes of  services provided to students.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the lead sponsors of this bill,  Representatives Grace Napolitano and   John Katko, for their leadership  and their work. I also thank, of course, Ranking Member Walden and the  members of our committee for their bipartisan support for this bill.   Madam Speaker, it is critical that we support preventative mental  health services and training in schools for our kids and teens,  particularly at a time when mental health risks are exacerbated by the  COVID-19 pandemic.   I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge support for the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2519) to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human  Services, acting through the Director of the Center for Mental Health  Services of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration, to award grants to implement innovative approaches to  securing prompt access to appropriate follow-on care for individuals  who experience an acute mental health episode and present for care in  an emergency department, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2519         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Mental Health       Access from the Emergency Department Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. SECURING APPROPRIATE FOLLOW-ON CARE FOR ACUTE MENTAL                     HEALTH ILLNESS AFTER AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT                     ENCOUNTER.         The Public Health Service Act is amended by inserting after       section 520J of such Act (42 U.S.C. 290bb-31) the following       new section:       ``SEC. 520J-1. SECURING APPROPRIATE FOLLOW-ON CARE FOR ACUTE                     MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESS AFTER AN EMERGENCY                     DEPARTMENT ENCOUNTER.         ``(a) In General.--The Secretary may award grants on a       competitive basis to qualifying health providers to implement       innovative approaches to securing prompt access to       appropriate follow-on care for individuals who experience an       acute mental health episode and present for care in an       emergency department.        ``(b) Eligible Grant Recipients.--In this section, the term       `qualifying health provider' means a health care facility       licensed under applicable law that--        ``(1) has an emergency department;        ``(2) is staffed by medical personnel (such as emergency       physicians, psychiatrists, psychiatric registered nurses,       mental health technicians, clinical social workers,       psychologists, and therapists) capable of providing treatment       focused on stabilizing acute mental health conditions and       assisting patients to access resources to continue treatment       in the least restrictive appropriate setting; and        ``(3) has arrangements in place with other providers of       care that can provide a full range of medically appropriate,       evidence-based services for the treatment of acute mental       health episodes.        ``(c) Use of Funds.--A qualifying health provider receiving       funds under this section shall use such funds to create,       support, or expand programs or projects intended to assist       individuals who are treated at the provider's emergency       department for acute mental health episodes and to       expeditiously transition such individuals to an appropriate       facility or setting for follow-on care. Such use of funds may       support the following:        ``(1) Expediting placement in appropriate facilities       through activities such as expanded coordination with       regional service providers, assessment, peer navigators, bed       availability tracking and management, transfer protocol       development, networking infrastructure development, and       transportation services.        ``(2) Increasing the supply of inpatient psychiatric beds       and alternative care settings such as regional emergency       psychiatric facilities.        ``(3) Use of alternative approaches to providing       psychiatric care in the emergency department setting,       including through tele-psychiatric support and other remote       psychiatric consultation, implementation of peak period       crisis clinics, or creation of psychiatric emergency service       units.        ``(4) Use of approaches that include proactive followup       such as telephone check-ins, telemedicine, or other       technology-based outreach to individuals during the period of       transition.        ``(5) Such other activities as are determined by the       Secretary to be appropriate, consistent with subsection (a).        ``(d) Application.--A qualifying health provider desiring a       grant under this section shall prepare and submit an       application to the Secretary at such time and in such manner       as the Secretary may require. At a minimum, the application       shall include the following:        ``(1) A description of identified need for acute mental       health services in the provider's service area.        ``(2) A description of the existing efforts of the provider       to meet the need for acute mental health services in the       service area, and identified gaps in the provision of such       services.        ``(3) A description of the proposed use of funds to meet       the need and gaps identified pursuant to paragraph (2).        ``(4) A description of how the provider will coordinate       efforts with Federal, State, local, and private entities       within the service area.        ``(5) A description of program objectives, how the       objectives are proposed to be met, and how the provider will       evaluate outcomes relative to objectives.        ``(e) Authorization of Appropriations.--To carry out this       section, there is authorized to be appropriated $15,000,000       for each of fiscal years 2021 through 2025.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2519.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 2519, the Improving Mental Health  Access from the Emergency Department Act of 2020.   I thank Representative Raul Ruiz, a member of our committee, and his  staff for their work on this important legislation. As an emergency  room physician himself, Dr. Ruiz knows firsthand the needs of both the  medical professional and the patients in the ER.   One of these increasing needs is support for mental health services.  Research has shown that one in every eight emergency department visits  in the U.S. is related to a mental health issue. Since 2009, mental  health emergency room visits have substantially increased, most of  which were driven by adolescents and young adults.   This is especially concerning, given recent data from the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention that found that, in 2019, more than one  in seven Americans experienced some level of anxiety and nearly one in  five reported depression.   These studies were conducted before COVID-19, and we know that this  pandemic is likely to have both long- and short-term implications for  mental health, and this anticipated increase in need is reason to act  now. H.R. 2519 would help to provide increased access to care for  people who report to the emergency department for acute mental health  episodes.   Under the bill, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is  authorized to award grants to support innovative approaches for  providing follow-on care for individuals treated in the emergency  department for acute mental health issues. This includes increasing the  number of inpatient psychiatric beds and alternative care settings,  supporting a patient's transition to appropriate mental health  services, or the use of telepsychiatric support or other remote  psychiatric consultation methods.   Madam Speaker, emergency departments can sometimes feel like a  stressful place, especially for people in crisis; however, they are  often the last remaining safety net in many communities. We know that  follow-up care for people with mental illness is linked to fewer repeat  emergency room visits and improved mental and physical health. Let's do  our part to support the emergency room staff and patients in need.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge support of the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4861) to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a  program to improve the identification, assessment, and treatment of  patients in the emergency department who are at risk of suicide, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4861         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

PROGRAM TO IMPROVE THE CARE PROVIDED TO PATIENTS IN                     THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WHO ARE AT RISK OF                     SUICIDE.         Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42       U.S.C. 280g et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the       following new section:       ``SEC. 399V-7. PROGRAM TO IMPROVE THE CARE PROVIDED TO                     PATIENTS IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WHO ARE AT                     RISK OF SUICIDE.         ``(a) In General.--The Secretary shall establish a program       (in this section referred to as the `Program') to improve the       identification, assessment, and treatment of patients in       emergency departments who are at risk for suicide, including       by--        ``(1) developing policies and procedures for identifying       and assessing individuals who are at risk of suicide;

Madam Speaker, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death, now  claiming more than 47,000 American lives each  [[Page H5018]]  year. Despite national efforts to lower the suicide rate, a number of  reports show a steady increase in suicides in recent years. In fact,  over the last two decades, the suicide rate in the U.S. increased 35  percent. These are clearly alarming trends.   Like other health crises, the emergency room is often a place where  people at risk for suicide go for help. Data shows us that the risk of  a suicide attempt or a death is highest within 30 days of discharge  from an emergency department or inpatient psychiatric unit.   Further, over a third of individuals without a diagnosis who died by  suicide made an emergency room visit within a year of their death. That  is why we have to act to equip our emergency rooms with better training  and tools to screen and assess patients at risk for suicide.   This bill would create a grant program to help emergency departments  develop policies and procedures for identifying and assessing people  who are at risk of suicide and enhancing the coordination of care for  them after discharge. These improvements would be made possible by  better training, sharing of best practices, and hiring of behavioral  health professionals in the emergency room who specialize in suicidal  ideation.   This bill has support from the American Foundation for Suicide  Prevention, the American Association of Suicidology, and the American  College of Emergency Physicians, groups that know these issues up  close.   I thank my colleagues, Representative Eliot Engel, who is here, and  also Representative Gus Bilirakis. They led this important legislation  to the floor.   I also thank Ranking Member Walden and all members and staff of our  committee for their efforts to move the bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel).   I do want to say I appreciate, again, Mr. Walden's comments about the  excellent career of Mr. Engel, but I am also not ready to say good-bye  to either Mr. Engel or Mr. Walden at this time because we are going to  be here for a while the next few months.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7293) to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide best  practices on student suicide awareness and prevention training and  condition State educational agencies, local educational agencies, and  tribal educational agencies receiving funds under section 520A of such  Act to establish and implement a school-based student suicide awareness  and prevention training policy, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7293         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Suicide Training and       Awareness Nationally Delivered for Universal Prevention Act       of 2020'' or the ``STANDUP Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. STUDENT SUICIDE AWARENESS AND PREVENTION TRAINING.

SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.         The amendments made by this Act shall only apply with       respect to applications for assistance  [[Page H5020]]       under section 520A of the Public Health Service Act (42       U.S.C. 290bb-32) that are submitted after the date of       enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 7293.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 7293, the Suicide Training and  Awareness Nationally Delivered for Universal Prevention Act of 2020, or  the STANDUP Act.   As we have heard, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the  U.S. However, it is the second leading cause of death for young  Americans age 10 to 14, which has tripled since 2007.   Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic is already exacerbating these  trends. Sandy Hook Promise's 24/7 crisis center, which allows people to  identify and help at-risk students, has seen a more than 10 percent  increase in suicide tips thus far.   During our hearing on this bill, Arriana Gross, a high school student  from Covington, Georgia, testified that: ``In our school, a year  doesn't go by without a student dying by suicide. I've even known of  elementary kids who died by suicide. I am concerned that youth suicide  has become so common that my school community and our Nation is stuck  in a pattern of mourning and accepting these deaths as something that  is normal, instead of seeing them as preventable and tragic.''   Again, Mr. Speaker, those are the words of Arriana Gross, a high  school student.   Like Arriana, I am concerned.   Despite data that suicide is on the rise, we can act now to help  equip students and the communities around them to identify risk factors  so they can play an active role in preventing suicide or self-harm.   Now, this bill, H.R. 7293, would encourage schools to expand  evidence-based suicide prevention training to students and make public  best practices for such training as a condition of receiving funds  under the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  Project AWARE grant program.   The STANDUP Act would also support technical assistance resources for  schools and encourage the collection and reporting of data to track  implementation of these policies and practices.   Research, Mr. Speaker, shows that training students on suicide  prevention makes an impact on student suicide rates and improves the  students' willingness to seek help or to help a peer.   Much of this training is already taking place across thousands of  schools nationwide, but the STANDUP Act will help ensure that this good  work is expanded to more schools across the country.   So for these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I stand up in support of the  STANDUP Act. This is good, bipartisan legislation. I thank the lead  sponsors, Representatives Scott Peters, Gus Bilirakis, Ted Deutch,  Brian Fitzpatrick, and their staffs for their work on this critical  issue.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank Mr. Walden and the committee staff for  working with us on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Peters).    Mr. Speaker, I also urge passage of the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3539) to amend the Public Health Service Act to direct the  Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop best practices for  the establishment and use of behavioral intervention teams at schools,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3539         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Behavioral Intervention       Guidelines Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. BEST PRACTICES FOR BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION TEAMS.         The Public Health Service Act is amended by inserting after       section 520G of such Act (42 U.S.C. 290bb-38) the following       new section:       ``SEC. 520H. BEST PRACTICES FOR BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION                     TEAMS.         ``(a) In General.--The Secretary, acting through the       Assistant Secretary, shall develop and periodically update--        ``(1) best practices to assist elementary schools,       secondary schools, and institutions of higher education in       establishing and using behavioral intervention teams;

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3539.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 3539, the Behavioral Intervention  Guidelines Act of 2020. The champions of this legislation,  Representatives Drew Ferguson,   Michael Burgess,  Joe Kennedy, and    Jimmy Panetta, worked together to help provide improved behavioral  health prevention tools to schools and colleges across the country, and  I applaud them for their bipartisan efforts.   Behavioral intervention teams are multidisciplinary teams that  support students' mental health and emotional well-being by detecting  patterns, trends, and disturbances in behavior, and by conducting  outreach to students who are unable to manage distress in healthy and  constructive ways.   These teams are already active in some educational settings, such as  the University of California, Los Angeles; Texas A&M University; and  Virginia Tech.   H.R. 3539 requires the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration to develop best practices for schools that have or want  to have behavioral intervention teams. These best practices would cover  the proper use of these teams and how to intervene and avoid  inappropriate use of mental health assessments and law enforcement.   These best practices would then be required to be posted publicly on  the Department of Health and Human Services website, and HHS would help  to provide technical assistance to entities implementing these best  practices.   As we have heard, Mr. Speaker, three in four children aged 3-17 with  depression also have anxiety. Anxiety and depression are two top mental  health concerns among college students as well. Unfortunately, recent  data found that over 80 percent of young people with mental health  needs did not receive the care they needed.   Young people in crisis should be able to access the care they need or  be able to find support from peers who can direct them toward  appropriate services, and this bill helps bridge that gap.   Again, I want to thank the Democrats and Republicans on my committee,  including Ranking Member Walden, for working together to put this  legislation in shape, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I don't have any additional speakers, but I do want also to praise  Mike Bloomquist.   He is now the Republican staff director, but he has had several tours  with the committee. He worked on some major legislation in the  committee. I think of 21st Century Cures, robocalls, and, even today,  getting the cyber bills passed, which was not an easy task, as you  know, Mike.   I know that our Ranking Member Walden mentioned your family. I don't  know how your family puts up with any of the things we do because I  know the many hours that you have to spend. So, again, thank your  family for sharing you.   I wish you well in your future endeavors as well.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H5023]]         Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4439) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to  make permanent the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human  Services to issue priority review vouchers to encourage treatments for  rare pediatric diseases, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4439         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Creating Hope       Reauthorization Act''.       SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY TO ISSUE PRIORITY REVIEW                     VOUCHERS TO ENCOURAGE TREATMENTS FOR RARE                     PEDIATRIC DISEASES.         Section 529(b)(5) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic       Act (21 U.S.C. 360ff(b)(5)) is amended--        (1) by striking ``December 11, 2020'' each place it appears       and inserting ``September 30, 2024''; and        (2) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``December 11, 2022''       and inserting ``September 30, 2026''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4439.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4439 would extend the pediatric rare disease  priority review voucher program at the Food and Drug Administration.  This priority review voucher, or PRV, was originally created in 2012  with the intent to create an incentive for drug manufacturers to  develop therapies for rare pediatric diseases that affect neonates,  infants, children, and adolescents.   The program requires FDA to award a PRV to the sponsor of an  application that receives approval as a drug or biologic to treat a  rare pediatric disease. Since the program's creation, 22 of these PRVs  have been awarded, with five awards in 2019.   Now, I have long been a supporter of increased research and  development of treatments for rare diseases, and I am proud that our  committee was able to come to consensus on a reasonable extension of  this program. Nevertheless, some observers of this program have shown  our committee evidence that the PRV program has not provided the  incentive value intended by Congress when it was first enacted.   This program was supposed to incentivize new development of pediatric  products that would not otherwise have occurred. However, the  Government Accountability Office reviewed the program and concluded  that the agency could not find definitive evidence that the program is  incentivizing pediatric drug development. Additionally, FDA has said  that PRVs drain agency resources away from the agency's public health  mission and have a negative impact on the morale of agency staff.   For these reasons, I could not support a permanent reauthorization of  the program. But I recognize that many pharmaceutical developers have  argued that the PRV provides an incentive for drug development, with  one going so far as to say that the PRV was a pivotal consideration for  making investments. I worked with Representatives Butterfield, the  bill's sponsor, and Ranking Member Walden, as well, to support a  reauthorization of the program for 4 years.   Mr. Speaker, the Energy and Commerce Committee will continue to  provide oversight to examine the effectiveness of this program and its  effect on FDA resources. The committee will also carefully scrutinize  it with hopes that it serves its intended purpose and leads to new  treatments and cures for rare pediatric diseases.   With this hope, Mr. Speaker, I ask Members to support this bipartisan  bill. I urge the Senate to swiftly take action on H.R. 4439, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    I have no additional speakers, and I reserve the balance  of my time, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I also urge support for the legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Committee on Energy and Commerce. H.R. 8132.
