 Madam President, I rise today in recognition of the 100th  anniversary of the Department of Maine, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Maine  VFW. Maine VFW was founded in 1921 as a nonprofit organization  dedicated to serving U.S. veterans of overseas conflicts, advocating  for all veterans, their families, and their communities, and  recognizing the sacrifices America's servicemen and women have made for  this great country. Maine VFW, alongside its sister chapters across the  United States, represents the oldest war veterans' organization in  America. Every year for the last century, it has made a positive and  tangible impact for Maine veterans. Maine VFW deserves not only our  admiration, but also our gratitude.   Since its founding, Maine VFW has secured an array of remarkable  victories for its membership and the many communities it serves.  Through the Veterans Affairs office at Togus, Maine VFW helps recoup  more than $5 million in earned benefits every year. Maine VFW also  advocates for veterans and their families at the State and National  level and has helped shape national security and veterans' policy for  generations of Americans. In 2020, for example, Maine VFW helped expand  the VA's list of conditions for which there is a presumptive service  connection for veterans exposed to Agent Orange and has made important  strides to support veterans exposed to toxic chemicals in the first  Gulf War and the Global War on Terror. Additionally, Maine VFW has  worked tirelessly to improve mental healthcare for American veterans  and successfully advocated for the John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental  Health Care Improvement Act, landmark legislation to increase the VA's  mental health workforce and strengthen rural veterans' access to care,  which was signed into law last year. Pursuant to its commitment to  patriotic service, stewardship, and education, Maine VFW also  spearheads a variety of community advocacy initiatives, food and blood  drives, and Homeless Veterans Stand Downs to respond  [[Page S6997]]  to the needs of Maine's most vulnerable populations.   On the national level, Veterans of Foreign Wars and each of its State  chapters have played a central role in the passage of nearly every  important piece of veterans' legislation over the last 100 years,  including the GI bills that have helped millions of veterans pursue  education and training opportunities since 1944. VFW champions several  major youth education and scholarship programs, such as Voice of  Democracy, a competitive audio-essay scholarship that awards nearly $2  million annually to students in grades 9-12. VFW and Auxiliary members  participate in thousands of community service initiatives and major  philanthropic campaigns each year. VFW also performs important work  abroad, advocating for prisoners of war and servicemembers who remain  missing in action.   Throughout our Nation's history, America's veterans have put  themselves in harm's way overseas so that we may enjoy freedom at home.  A testament to Maine's dedication to this cause is the number of  veterans per capita in our State, which consistently ranks as one of  the highest in the Nation. Day in and day out, the Maine VFW works to  support these veterans and their communities and has done so for a  century. On behalf of a grateful nation, I would like to honor and  thank the Maine VFW for these 100 years of service. Its steadfast  support for servicemembers, veterans, and their families continues to  change the lives of Americans at home and abroad.                            ____________________
