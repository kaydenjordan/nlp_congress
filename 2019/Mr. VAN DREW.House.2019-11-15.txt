 Madam Speaker, today, I would like to commend William  McLees of south Jersey on achieving the admirable rank of Eagle Scout.   William led his fellow boy scouts of Troop 79 in his Eagle Scout  project to install an information kiosk at Somers Mansion. This  information booth will educate visitors about the past of this old  historic building, which is one of the oldest buildings in the region,  dating back to 1725.   McLees carefully outfitted the kiosk with solar panels for lighting  and a waterproof exterior so the structure will now be as long-lasting  as Somers Mansion itself.   Madam Speaker, I applaud William's craftsmanship and his leadership  in coordinating this project, and I thank him for this informative  addition to our entire south Jersey community. I congratulate him on  his high title of Eagle Scout, and I wish him the very best.   Americans look for heroes all over the world. Our hero is William  McLees. He truly deserves our praise.                            ____________________
