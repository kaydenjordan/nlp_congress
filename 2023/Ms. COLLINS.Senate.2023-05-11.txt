 Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Carbon  Removal and Emissions Storage Technologies Act, the CREST Act. I want  to thank Senator Cantwell for her partnership in working on this bill.  Our bipartisan bill would direct the Department of Energy to research  and evaluate the feasibility of innovative carbon removal and storage  pathways. The name the ``CREST Act'' alludes to the fact that we have  reached the ``crest'' of our emissions, and we must work to reduce  them.   With more and more private and public sector commitments to reach  net-zero emissions within certain timeframes, companies are scrambling  to invest in quantifiable, durable, and verifiable carbon removal  solutions. Microsoft, for example, has made a commitment to be carbon  negative by 2030. Even though Microsoft plans to reduce its greenhouse  gas emissions by more than half, it will need to remove the rest of its  carbon emissions. In order to do this, Microsoft plans to invest $1  billion in carbon removal technologies, such as direct air capture,  forestation, and carbon mineralization.   Despite the growing number of companies that are looking to offset  their emissions, current cost estimates show that private sector  investment alone will not be sufficient to research and deploy carbon  removal pathways. I supported the Energy Act of 2020, which authorized  the first comprehensive Federal carbon removal research and development  program, and the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which invested $3.6  billion in direct air capture. Although these investments have been  significant, more work is needed in further research, increased  testing, and enhanced public-private partnerships to help aid in  scaling carbon removal technologies.   The CREST Act would expand the Department of Energy's carbon removal  research and development programs to include carbon removal pathways  that can permanently sequester carbon dioxide or use carbon dioxide to  produce biofuels or products. The key areas of focus for research and  development in our legislation are biomass carbon removal and storage,  geological removal, atmospheric and aquatic removal, carbon dioxide  storage, and carbon dioxide removal quantification.   Our legislation also aims to accelerate the commercialization of  innovative carbon solutions through a pilot program at the Department  of Energy. This pilot program would be charged with accelerating the  deployment of affordable and proven carbon removal technologies. This  reverse-auction style pilot program would position the government to  purchase innovative and promising technologies, subject to certain  criteria, and reduce the costs of those technologies. This would allow  companies that may not have as much purchasing power as Microsoft to  participate in carbon removal to help offset emissions.   This pilot program could also support companies that are leading the  way in carbon removal technology, like Running Tide in Maine, in  bringing down the cost of its product. Running Tide captures carbon  dioxide using kelp microforests, sun, ocean currents, and gravity. This  new and exciting company grows floating kelp microforests attached to  biodegradable buoys that sink as they break down. The carbon captured  through the floating microforest is effectively removed for hundreds of  years once it hits the ocean floor. Running Tide hopes to soon be  selling ``kelp carbon credits'' to help offset private entities'  emissions. They are currently working to commercialize quickly. These  innovative approaches are the kinds that our new pilot program could  encourage.   Climate change is a significant environmental challenge that requires  innovative and global solutions to reduce greenhouse gas pollution.  While carbon removal is only a small part of the solution, it is  critical that we promote innovation in this area. Our bipartisan bill  has earned endorsements from Bipartisan Policy Center Action,  [[Page S1629]]  ClearPath Action, Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, and many  others. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Cantwell and me in  supporting this legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mrs. Blackburn, Mr. Braun, Mr. Budd,          Mrs. Capito, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Daines, Mrs. Fischer,          Mr. Graham, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hawley, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. Kennedy,          Mr. Scott of Florida, Mr. Scott of South Carolina, Mr. Risch,          and Mr. Rubio):   S. 1583.
