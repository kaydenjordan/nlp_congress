 Mr. President, it is now Wednesday morning of the week  the Senate set aside to debate DACA, border security, interior  enforcement, and other immigration issues. I promised I would clear the  way to debate these matters this week, and I have. I promised I would  ensure a fair amendment process in which both sides could offer  legislation for discussion and votes, and I have. Just yesterday, the  Congressional Hispanic Caucus released a letter thanking me for keeping  my commitment and urged the Senate to resolve this issue quickly.   But we haven't even been able to get started yet. We haven't even  been able to get started. Yesterday, I tried twice to open the debate  and start the voting. Both times, my Democratic colleagues objected. I  am a little perplexed, frankly, by the holdup.   My Democratic colleagues have spent months--months, as we all know-- demanding that the Senate take up this issue. They even shut down the  government--shut down the government unnecessarily, I might add--in  order to secure this very week for this discussion. But now that the  time has come to make law instead of just making points, they are  stalling. Why? Why, after months and months spent demanding that the  Senate take up this issue, do they now object to even starting the  debate? Because they know, no matter how long they spend in closed-door  negotiations, they can't change the fact that the President has spelled  out a fair and generous framework that will be necessary to earn his  signature. These guys can't take yes for an answer. So instead of  moving to fulfill our promises and address the DACA issue, they haven't  even allowed the debate to begin.   There is a widespread desire in this Chamber to find a resolution for  the illegal immigrants who were brought to this country as children-- widespread agreement on that--but common sense dictates that we cannot  simply treat one symptom of our broken immigration policy in complete  isolation. We must address the underlying problems as well. That means  fixing broken parts of our legal immigration system.   We must also ensure the safety of the American people. That is why a  DACA resolution should be paired with new security measures at our  borders and commonsense steps to improve security inside our borders,  steps like fixing the loophole that forces us to release thousands of  criminal aliens whose home countries won't take them back, steps like  enacting Kate's Law to put criminal offenders who repeatedly and  illegally cross our borders behind bars, cracking down with stiffer  penalties for human trafficking, and updating the removability grounds  for drug traffickers, repeat drunk drivers, gang members, sex  offenders, and other violent and dangerous criminals. Why in the world  would those ideas be controversial?   Keeping Americans safe does not need to be a partisan issue, and  addressing these important safety issues along with DACA, border  security, and  [[Page S930]]  other parts of our broken immigration system is our best chance to  produce legislation that can pass the House, pass the Senate, and earn  the President's signature. This is why the proposal put forward by  Senator Grassley and others, which draws on the President's generous  framework and which the President has officially endorsed, has my  support, because presumably we will actually make a law here.   I have made no effort--none--to tell Democrats what amendments they  should offer. Of course, they shouldn't try to dictate Republican  amendments either.   The longer my colleagues across the aisle refuse to come to the  table, the longer they are unable to produce any legislation they  actually support, the lower the odds that we can arrive at a  legislative solution this week.   Yesterday alone, the Senate was open for 9 hours--yesterday alone, 9  hours. Nine hours we could have spent processing amendments and  proceeding to votes. Nine hours down the drain because Democrats won't  let us start the debate they have spent months demanding.   Now that we can finally proceed to consider the underlying bill this  morning, I hope my colleagues across the aisle will come to the table.  The President has made clear what principles must be addressed if we  are going to make a law instead of merely making political points.   While our Democratic colleagues can no longer prevent the Senate from  starting the debate, they can continue to delay votes on amendments. I  hope that won't happen.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on Monday, President Trump unveiled his  proposal to improve America's infrastructure. Today he will host  committee chairmen and ranking members at the White House for a  bipartisan, bicameral meeting on that subject. I am grateful the  President is prioritizing this and reaching across the aisle.   Experts agree that America's aging infrastructure needs a lot of  help. Nationwide, 9.1 percent of our bridges are considered  structurally deficient, and 13.6 percent are considered functionally  obsolete. One recent study suggests that road congestion costs us $160  billion a year--for road congestion. The answer is not simply to throw  new money at old problems.   It took American workers less time to build great skyscrapers, start  to finish, than it now takes bureaucrats to review--not even build, but  review--proposals for new bridges and roadways. We need to streamline  regulations, reform the permitting process, and get government out of  the way wherever possible. Once projects are proposed, they should be  reviewed in a safe but reasonable amount of time and then completed as  quickly and cost effectively as possible.   This is a prime opportunity for bipartisan cooperation. Our last  three highway bills, our last three WRDA bills, and our last three FAA  bills all passed the Senate easily, averaging more than 80 votes. I  hope we can renew that consensus when the time comes.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, for 8 years under  President Obama, our economy didn't perform as well as it should have.  America's wages and salaries hardly grew. Many job creators sat on the  sidelines, wary of new tax increases or heavy-handed regulations.  Washington had its foot on the brake. Last year, all that changed.   President Trump and this Republican Congress set out to make life  easier for workers and for job creators. We cut regulations and passed  tax reform to give middle-class families immediate relief and set the  stage for more hiring and more wage growth in the years ahead.   I recently heard from a small family-owned inland river shipyard in  Ashland, KY, along the Ohio River. They build and repair commercial  barges. Here is what their president wrote. He said: ``Thanks to the  tax change and optimism of our customers, we are at long last able to  replace equipment which has been used way past [its] life expectancy  and possibly add two more production workers.''   Last week a Louisville employer dropped by to tell me how he is using  his tax reform savings: $1,000 bonuses for more than 100 Kentucky  employees.   Small companies and big business alike are thrilled that they finally  have a 21st-century tax code. It makes them more competitive with  overseas rivals and frees up more money to invest right here at home,  and middle-class workers are reaping the rewards. Major national  companies like Pfizer and Home Depot, which together employ more than  half a million Americans, have announced hundreds of millions of  dollars in employee bonuses--again, thanks to tax reform.   Just this week, MetLife announced a major new investment in 50,000- plus employees. The company is raising its minimum wage, enhancing  benefits, boosting retirement contributions, and creating a skills  development fund. In short, MetLife is betting big on U.S. workers, and  so are the more than 300 other companies that have already announced  major investments in their employees and in their facilities--right  here in America, right here, thanks to historic tax reform.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I call up the Toomey amendment No. 1948  to the Grassley amendment No. 1959.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  amendment No. 1955.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  amendment No. 1948.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk for  amendment No. 1958, as modified.    Mr. President, I send a cloture amendment to the desk  for amendment No. 1959.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session for the consideration of the following  nomination: Executive Calendar No. 586.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on the  nomination with no intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; that no  further motions be in order; and that any statements relating to the  nomination be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation be discharged from  and the Senate proceed to the consideration of PN474-2; that the  nominations be confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; that no  further motions be in order; that any statements related to the  nominations be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative  session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business,  [[Page S966]]  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the  distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a  resolution authorizing representation by the Senate Legal Counsel and  ask for its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, this resolution concerns a subpoena  from the defendant in a criminal case pending in Arizona Federal court.  The defendant is charged with various crimes alleging his assistance to  an Iraqi insurgent group by supplying parts for use in improvised  explosive devices. The defendant issued a trial subpoena to Senator  Graham for testimony and documents arising out of his Senate duties. As  any information Senator Graham would have in this matter would have  been acquired as part of his legislative duties, the information sought  would be privileged under the Speech or Debate Clause. This resolution  would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent Senator Graham  and move to quash the subpoena.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs be discharged from further consideration  of S. 2246 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    I further ask unanimous consent that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 406, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, February 15; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; finally, I ask  that following leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of H.R.  2579.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:37 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, February 15, 2018, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
