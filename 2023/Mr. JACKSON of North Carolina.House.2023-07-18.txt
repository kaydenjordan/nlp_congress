 Madam Speaker, recruitment is down in  the military. Fewer young people are joining, in part because  unemployment is low and they have higher paying options elsewhere.   I would love to show young people that the military is still a good  option for them, as it was for me. In order to do that, I need some  help from my friends across the aisle. I need them to put the dog  whistle down.   Each year's class of new recruits to our military is now the most  diverse in the history of our Nation. Every time they blow the dog  whistle against diversity, it is not just their political base that  hears it, it is young people who are trying to decide whether to enlist  in our All-Volunteer Force.   Last week's debate over the defense bill featured a series of very  clear dog whistles. There was one for gay people, one for transgender  people, one for Black people, and one for women. Don't remember? They  ran amendments on Pride flags, diversity programs, books in libraries,  and abortion. Those were all dog whistles for their base. Our generals  asked for none of that.   One of our colleagues even went so far as to say that the military's  strength ``is not its diversity.'' Someone in this building explicitly  defended white nationalism in our military.   When it comes to recruitment, I assure you, that is not helping.   Caring about the military means caring about the people who serve in  it, not using them as a political punching bag. If you want to help  solve the recruitment problem, the first thing you need to do is stop  attacking the people we need to enlist.                            ____________________
