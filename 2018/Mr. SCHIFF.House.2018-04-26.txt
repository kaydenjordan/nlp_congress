 Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the world marked the 103rd  anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, the systematic murder of 1.5  million Armenians and the displacement of millions more in the Ottoman  Empire from 1915 to 1923.   In my district in Los Angeles, I joined tens of thousands of  descendants of genocide survivors and others to march through the  streets, a living testament to the resilience of the Armenian people.  Yet, in our Nation's Capital, the White House and Congress were once  again sadly silent, failing to properly recognize the genocide.   More than a century after the Armenian Genocide, it is our solemn  responsibility to remember those who were lost, to seek justice and  restitution, and to educate Americans and the world about the crime of  genocide.   A recent poll of Americans found that the details of the Holocaust  are increasingly fading from memory, particularly among younger  generations. Two-thirds of millennials do not know what Auschwitz is or  what happened there, and many others of all ages couldn't answer basic  questions about the Holocaust. As someone who lost family members in  the Holocaust, I find these results horrifying.   There is no doubt that public understanding of the Armenian Genocide  is far lower, and that is due, in part, to the silence of those who  should be leading the conversation about it and to Turkey's nefarious  campaign of denial.   How many Americans know of Red Sunday, the day in 1915 in which  Armenian leaders and intellectuals in Constantinople were rounded up to  be sent to camps from which many would never return?   How many know of the concentration camps in Deir ez-Zor, where  Armenians were tortured, raped, and starved?   How many Americans know that, in the years after the genocide,  through  [[Page H3583]]  the Near East Relief effort, the generosity of the American people  saved the lives of thousands of survivors and helped secure the future  of the Armenian people?   And finally, how many Americans know that the Congress and the  President have refused to acknowledge the Armenian Genocide,  intimidated into silence by Turkey?   Turkey has invested heavily in the cause of denial, and to our shame,  the U.S. Government has been intimidated into silence. Though Turkey  remains a member of NATO, under the autocratic and repressive rule of  President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkey has become the leading jailer of  journalists in the world and discussion of the genocide can bring  criminal punishment.   U.S. citizens have also been the victims of Erdogan's crackdown on  free expression. Last year, Erdogan's security detail brutally  assaulted peaceful protesters in Washington, D.C. Charges against 11 of  the 15 Turkish nationals charged have been dropped, and there is little  indication that Turkey will pay any diplomatic price for this attack.   In northern Syria, where the United States has worked closely with  partners to devastate ISIS, Turkey has chosen to place its paramount  focus on fighting the Kurds, even launching a military offensive into  Syria that threatens our own soldiers and those of our allies. Erdogan  has even gone so far as to threaten the United States with an ``Ottoman  slap.''   These are not the actions of an ally. They are the actions of a  nation that feels emboldened to act with indifference to the United  States. And who can blame them? For over a quarter century, Presidents  and Congresses of both parties have been bullied into genocide denial  for fear Turkey will withdraw their already transactional and fleeting  cooperation.   It has never been in our national security interest to be complicit  in another country's denial of human rights, let alone denial of  genocide. It is time for America to speak plainly about the Armenian  Genocide and the violation of human rights anywhere in the world.                            ____________________
