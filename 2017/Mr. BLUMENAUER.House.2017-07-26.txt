 Mr. Speaker, this is really an amazing time on  Capitol Hill. The Republican internal battles and inability to deliver  a coherent, effective alternative to fulfill all their contradictory  campaign promises on healthcare has done more than just expose their  political and policy dysfunction. They are obviously flirting with a  serious political backlash.   They have managed to make the Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, with  all of its shortcomings, popular with the majority of the American  public for the first time ever, including so many small business  people.   They made the public more aware and concerned about Medicaid, that  has expanded and made such a difference in Kentucky, in Oregon, in  States all across the country, providing care for people otherwise who  had not had it.   They have managed to accelerate the move towards single payer by more  than a decade: Medicare for all, Medicaid for more. I don't know the  exact form, but we are going to be moving in that direction, and the  Republicans have helped raise the awareness and accelerate that  progress, but I hope that we are going to be able to take steps to make  progress sooner.   In the meantime, I suspect that the Affordable Care Act, the core  reforms and structure, are going to, in fact, stay in place. This is  because there aren't the votes in the Senate to do anything more; and  frankly, it doesn't look like there are votes to do much in the House,  the so-called skinny bill notwithstanding.   But I hope that we can pivot towards modest, bipartisan actions that  are consistent with the Affordable Care Act, but don't depend on it. We  have a number of bipartisan initiatives that are teed up and ready to  go.   I have worked for years with Congresswoman Diane Black from  Tennessee, on value-based insurance design. This bipartisan legislation  would reward value over volume and make insurance much more effective  in paying for what we need.   I have an initiative with Congressman Jason Smith and with Senator  Todd Young dealing with kidney health. This would enable providers to  leverage those weekly sessions for dialysis for some of our most  vulnerable Americans in terms of their health. Dialysis costs 1 percent  of the entire Federal budget. We should be able to use that time and  attention to deliver wraparound services, more care and less strain on  people with multiple health needs.   We ought to be able to act on empowering our citizens and their  families to know what they are facing at end of life. I have bipartisan  legislation with my friend and colleague, Congressman Roe from  Tennessee, along those lines.   Congress ought to accept the challenge from President Trump to deal  meaningfully with prescription drug costs. There is support on both  sides of the aisle. We can save billions of dollars for Americans and  the taxpayers, and we can provide better care.   There are mental health initiatives with our friend Tim Murphy.  Bipartisan progress was made in the last Congress, but there is much  more that needs to be done.   In fact, we can work together to overcome the opposition of Chairman  Sessions and the Rules Committee denying the House the right to vote on  extending our veterans access bill to allow consultation about medical  marijuana. No one can listen to the heartbreaking stories of veterans  and their families about what medical marijuana has done to sufferers  of PTSD, chronic pain, traumatic brain injury. It is legal in 29  states, but the Rules Committee denied the right of the House to vote  on extending that service to our veterans and their doctors, despite  the horrible record that the VA has in preventing veteran suicide, and  where the opioid addiction rate for the VA is twice the general  population.   These are things we can do tomorrow, not dealing with denying  millions of people care through the Affordable Care Act and the various  permutations that are spinning around now.   Do our job, work together, follow regular order, deal with bipartisan  initiatives that will benefit the American people, save the taxpayer  money, and improve the health of all Americans.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today, Donald Trump announced via  Twitter, how else, that he is going to reverse the Obama-era decision  and deny transgender people the right to openly serve in our military.   I think it is shameful to divide Americans, in the face of their  service and sacrifice, for his political gain.   This is not about national security, it is not about saving money,  and it is not about fabricated claims of disruption. What is disruptive  is discrimination against an entire class of Americans who are or who  want to protect and defend America. That is the same argument that was  used against women in the service, against gays and lesbians.   We ought to welcome any American who is qualified and willing to  serve to protect our great country, to protect America and our values,  even as the President undermines both.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule. I had a real  bipartisan amendment that had been in order repeatedly in recent  sessions, gaining bipartisan support, to be able to deal with the  crisis that our veterans face in terms of addiction, opioids.   The VA, sadly, has a horrible record in terms of how they deal with  these veterans. They suffer suicide 50 percent higher than the general  public. The opioid addiction rate is twice the general population.   Mr. Speaker, I have been working for years in the area of medical  marijuana. Twenty-nine States have now legalized it. I wish my friends  on the Rules Committee had taken the time to listen to the stories of  veterans and their families about what difference it made for people  suffering from PTSD, chronic pain, and traumatic brain injury.   Medical marijuana has helped change their lives, and it is not  addictive and doesn't kill them the way the abuse of opioids has. Yet  the VA, in its infinite wisdom, doesn't even allow VA doctors to talk  to veterans about medical marijuana in the States where it is legal.   Our amendment is simple. It would eliminate that prohibition. It  wouldn't dispense marijuana on public land. It allowed the VA doctor to  work with the patients--the people who know them best.   It passed last year with 40 votes on a bipartisan basis. There were  18 bipartisan cosponsors for the amendment, 9 and 9, Republican and  Democrat. It has already passed the Senate by a 3-to-1 margin in  committee.   It was actually approved by the House last Congress, but in  conference committee, it was stripped out, led by former Senator Kirk.  I sincerely believe that one of the reasons he is a former Senator is  because Illinois veterans and their families were outraged about that  action to reverse what Congress did.   Now we are not even allowed to vote on it. I think that is  incomprehensible. I don't think it is fair to our veterans. My friends  on the Rules Committee are on the wrong side of history. In Florida,  last November, 71 percent of the people voted for medical marijuana.   Our veterans deserve the right to work with their VA physicians to do  what is right for them and their families and, hopefully, avoid the  epidemic of opioid overdoses, overprescriptions, and not being able to  treat them with a methodology that is not highly addictive and not  dangerous.   Mr. Speaker, there is no reason on God's green earth that we  shouldn't have been allowed to at least vote on this bipartisan  amendment to protect our veterans.    Mr. Speaker, I would just say this was an opportunity  to bring us together. It passed last Congress on the floor of the House  with a 40-vote margin. There is more support now, today, in the public  and in the other body.   This was an opportunity to avoid unnecessary controversy, to send a  signal to our veterans, to change a destructive policy from the  Veterans Administration that is overwhelmingly supported by the  American public. If you would have allowed us to vote on the floor of  the House, I will guarantee you we would have had even more votes this  time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, when Speaker Ryan took the gavel, he promised to have  ``a process that is more open, more inclusive, more deliberative, and  more participatory.''   My friends like to highlight a number of amendments made in order  today as if this is a good process. I would remind you, Mr. Speaker,  that, rather than taking up one issue at a time, this is a rule for  three appropriations bills. I say to my friends, you guys are worse  than you used to be.   There are 10 amendments allowed for the Legislative Branch. Last year  you made in order 13. We have fewer amendments this year.   For the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill, there are 16  amendments. Just a short time ago, in fiscal year 2016, we had a  modified open rule. This rule is clearly much worse.   We have the same situation with the Energy and Water bill. We have a  structured rule this year, while we had a modified open rule just 2  years ago. The process in the House is getting worse.   For the first time in history, we have a Speaker of the House who has  never allowed a truly open rule. Now, we were not perfect, Mr. Speaker,  but Speaker Pelosi allowed the Rules Committee to report open rules.  Speaker Boehner allowed open rules. Every Speaker in modern history  allowed some open rules, but we don't even get modified open rules  anymore.   Mr. Speaker, we are seeing an alarming rise in the number of self- executing rules, what Republicans used to call ``deem and pass rules.''  Now, let me explain what that is.   In his book, ``Young Guns: A New Generation of Conservative  Leaders,'' our dear Speaker, Mr. Ryan, described the self-execution  process. This is on page 98, if you are following along. But he called  this process, ``legislative trickery to enact legislation that does not  have majority backing.''   Now, sometime today we are going to go back up to the Rules Committee  to do a little legislative trickery to fund the President's border  wall.   News flash: Mexico is not paying for the wall. The language that the  Speaker intends to deem passed without a vote uses good old-fashioned  American greenbacks to pay for Trump's wall. The American taxpayers are  going to be stuck with this bill for this ridiculous wall.   Mr. Speaker, this process is not good; it is not a better way; it is  rotten; and the rule the majority will put on this floor tomorrow will  be even worse. We are jamming through these important appropriation  bills together, limiting debate, and moving further away from regular  order.                                time  1315    We don't need this rule, and we don't need a self-executing rule  tomorrow. Now, if we defeat the previous question on this rule, I will  offer an amendment to open up this process and consider the Department  of Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Energy and  Water Appropriation bills each under an open rule.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Luetkemeyer). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?   There was no objection.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me just conclude with this, Mr. Speaker: Members have a chance to  vote for an open amendment process on these appropriations bills. That  is what this PQ vote is about. Republicans will not control this House  forever, and I hope that no Member who votes against this open rule  amendment today will have the audacity to criticize any future  Democratic majorities.   If they do, Mr. Speaker, I assure you, we will remind them of this  vote.   To discuss our proposal, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren).
