 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. Cheney) for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes for debate, and I rise to debate  the rule for H.R. 3180, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2018.   I was somewhat dismayed earlier this week when my friends across the  aisle attempted to jam today's bill through this body by jettisoning  regular order and bringing the bill up under suspension.   Luckily, we can add this shortsighted attempt at governing to their  long list of legislative failures. And although I may be pleased that  their suspension shenanigans failed, my frustration was born anew when  we were informed that the bill would come to the floor under yet  another closed rule.   This is all bad enough, and I will come back to it in a moment, but  first we need to discuss the blanket martial law provision that my  friends on the other side put into this rule.   This move, especially when considered in the context of those  mentioned  [[Page H6529]]  above, truly elevated poor governing to an art form.                                time  0945    I want the American people, Republican and Democrat and Independents  alike, to be crystal clear on what is happening here today. By putting  a blanket martial law provision into this rule, my friends across the  aisle were trying to make it as easy as possible for them to pass a  healthcare bill that they had never seen. The bill would have surely  ripped healthcare away from millions of Americans and unceremoniously  upended one-sixth of our economy.   Thankfully, Senators Collins, Murkowski, and McCain, and tens of  thousands of regular Americans-turned-activists ensured that this  effort failed.   Since day one, the approach of my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle on healthcare or, for that matter, any number of other important  issues has been horrendous. It has been rushed; it has been secretive;  it has been chaotic; and it has been inspired by the desire for a cheap  win rather than the desire to make our healthcare system stronger and  more widely available to all Americans.   Truly, whether it is healthcare, veterans, or the authorization of  funding for something as important as our intelligence community, the  approach leaves some of us bewildered, dismayed, and gravely concerned  for the well-being of our country.   Indeed, when discussing something as important as the authorization  for funding for the intelligence community, we ought to proceed in a  manner that allows all Members of this body the opportunity to weigh in  with their concerns. This closed process does a disservice not only to  those of us who do not sit on the committee of jurisdiction, but also  the intelligence community and the American people.   As an example, when I did sit on this committee, I was vice chair of  the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and I worked  diligently to ensure that minorities were given equal opportunity to  break into the upper ranks of the intelligence community.   Since leaving that committee, I have continued this important work  and introduced an amendment to a previous iteration of the underlying  bill that called for the Director of National Intelligence to put forth  a plan that would encourage diversity hires throughout the intelligence  community. Frustratingly, I am stripped of such an opportunity today  because of the Republican leadership's unyielding devotion to  perpetuating a closed process.   Additionally, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), my  friend, has also offered amendments to the underlying bill in the past  that call for an increase in the recruitment and training of minorities  as officers and employees of the Central Intelligence Agency. She, like  the majority of our colleagues, will not be afforded a similar  opportunity this time around.   This is troublesome because diversity is a mission imperative for the  intelligence community. Not only do we need to see minorities have more  opportunities to climb the ranks, but we also need to recruit Americans  who will be able to blend in, speak foreign languages, and understand  the cultures in countries that are now central to our foreign policy  interests.   At the end of the day, such diversity is achieved through the hiring  process, and, therefore, we need to ensure that we are hiring Arab  Americans, Iranian Americans, Pakistani Americans, Chinese Americans,  Korean Americans, women, gays, and many other Americans from diverse  backgrounds as we confront a myriad of threats and work harder to  better understand our adversaries, wherever they may lurk. We do not  seek this diversity in the name of political correctness but, rather,  in the name of national security. As I have said before, if the  intelligence community is to succeed in its global mission, it must  have a global face.   I have no doubt that scores of Members would like to have offered  amendments addressing the issues I have just mentioned as well as many  other issues that are of particular concern to them and their  constituents. Unfortunately, under this rule, they will not be afforded  such an opportunity today.   Those who work in the intelligence community serve our country  faithfully and bravely, knowing that they will never receive the public  recognition they so richly deserve. In fact, they have served and  continue to serve knowing that not only will they not receive well- earned accolades, but that they will, upon occasion, have to endure  unfounded and offensive statements from this administration. These  statements began before the current administration even moved in down  Pennsylvania Avenue.   I quote the following from the administration's, President's, Twitter  account: ``Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake  news to `leak' into the public. One last shot at me. Are we living in  Nazi Germany?''   I find that shameful and absolutely unfounded in making such a  statement. Comparing these brave and patriotic Americans to Nazis? You  really have to be kidding me.   As a former member of HPSCI, I will not sit idly by while anyone  maligns the honorable work these proud Americans do day in and day out  to protect our country. But it seems that, with this closed process and  their continued support of President Donald John Trump, even as he  slowly erodes the foundation of our democracy one tweet at a time, is  exactly what my friends and the Republican Congress are doing.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The brazen and reckless manner in which this bill was first brought  to the floor is evidence that my friends across the aisle have still  not figured out how to govern. The learning curve may be steep, but it  is not that steep.   Quite simply, my friends, it is time for you to start governing  responsibly, not with closed rules and martial law, without hearings,  and without CBO scores, but through regular order, with an opportunity  for all Members and, through them, their constituents to take part in  legislating. The White House may be in chaos, but that is no reason for  the House to legislate in a similar manner.   For the good of the country, we must return to regular order. We must  work to ensure that those serving in the intelligence community are  able to do their best work, to do it as safely as possible, and to do  it knowing that they will receive the respect they deserve from all  branches of their government. I worry that they, increasingly, do not  receive this respect, and that this disrespect, should it continue,  will make it more difficult for us to retain and recruit the talent we  so desperately need to protect our national security.   Of course, the intelligence community is only one part of our  national security apparatus. The men and women in our military are an  equally important part of maintaining our national security. And,  unfortunately, we learned just yesterday that these brave  servicemembers are not immune from baseless attacks from the  administration.   It was announced, on the 69th anniversary of President Truman's  issuing an executive order that desegregated the Armed Forces, that  transgender servicemembers would no longer be able to serve in the  military. Were these individuals, numbering between 10,000 and 15,000,  banned because they are not brave, because they are not patriotic,  because they are incapable of meeting the rigorous requirements of  being in the military? No, they have been banned because bigotry  defeated decency yesterday, and they have been banned because of who  they are.   As I mentioned the other evening, I had three uncles who were in the  Army. They served proudly. They served bravely. They served in a  segregated Army. Two of them received purple hearts.                                time  1000    It was a great offense that they had to serve in a segregated Army in  which they were made to feel that somehow their bravery, their  patriotism, and their devotion to their brothers in arms was somehow  less because of the color of their skin.   President Truman knew this was wrong, and he ended it. Simply put,  President Truman knew then what our current President is incapable of  understanding today: the strength of our military is not found in the  race or the religion or the creed or the sex or the gender identity of  its servicemembers, but rather in the bravery and honor exhibited by  these individuals on a daily basis. They, like all of us here today,  are proud citizens of this country. They, like all of us here today,  are God's children. I thank them for their service to our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
