 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Thornberry  and Chairman Smith for their leadership in this essential process to  ensure America's security.   This bill takes important steps forward to confront China by  establishing the Indo-Pacific Deterrence Initiative. It is vital that  we support and strengthen our allies and partners in the region in  order to deter the growing threat from China.   This NDAA also funds critical investments here at home that will  enable us  [[Page H6926]]  to confront the sophisticated threats we face from China and Russia.    The NDAA also includes provisions implementing a number of Cyber  Solarium recommendations. These changes will continue to modernize our  military and civilian cybersecurity efforts. I think that we have only  begun our work in this area.   In addition to these cutting-edge needs, this conference report also  reauthorizes the pay to troop deployed in combat zones.   Most importantly, this bill adheres to the budget agreement and fully  funds the President's budget request.   Now more than ever, we must reject calls for blanket defense cuts  from partisans who are using the current crisis as an opportunity to  push their agenda.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague Mac Thornberry  for his years of service and dedication to the Armed Services  Committee. No one cares more about our men and women in uniform and has  been a better leader for our conference. We are going to miss his  passion and dedication for these issues, and we wish him and Sally  nothing but the best as they go forward.
