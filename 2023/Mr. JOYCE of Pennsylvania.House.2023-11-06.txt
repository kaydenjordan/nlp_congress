 Mr. Speaker, this Veterans Day, we  recognize the 6 percent of Americans who have put on a uniform, raised  their right hand, and sworn an oath to defend our Nation.   Now, after more than 20 years of war, it is time for us to follow the  words of President Abraham Lincoln and ``to care for him who shall have  borne the battle.''   Congress must recommit itself to standing for these men and women who  have served our great country, making sure that physicians are  recruited to serve at VA hospitals in rural areas and ensuring that the  PACT Act is fully implemented to protect veterans who have been exposed  to toxic chemicals.   Veterans Day holds a special meaning for the 50,000 veterans and  their families who call Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District  home. From deploying overseas to assisting with border security and  disaster relief here at home, our Nation's servicemembers have been at  the heart of operations that ultimately protect all Americans.   With more veterans than any other district in Pennsylvania,  Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District has a unique connection to  those who have served in the Armed Forces.   This Veterans Day, let's all join in thanks for the soldiers, the  sailors, the airmen, and marines who have fought and who have  sacrificed to keep our Nation safe and our Nation free.               the world is falling apart under president biden     Mr. Speaker, this weekend, The New York  Times quoted Spencer Weiss, a Pennsylvania electrician who said: ``The  world is falling apart under Biden.''   As prices spiral out of control, as illegal immigrants continue to  surge at our southern border, and adversaries like China and Iran  spread their influence abroad, President Biden has failed to lead.  President Biden has failed to keep Americans safe.   Instead of working across the aisle to fight inflation, Joe Biden has  proposed billions in new spending. Instead of passing critical  legislation like the Secure the Border Act, Joe Biden has welcomed  illegal immigrants into towns and cities across our country. Instead of  standing with Israel, our greatest ally in the Middle East, Joe Biden  has threatened to veto legislation that would resupply the Iron Dome  and keep Israeli citizens safe from Hamas rockets.   Mr. Speaker, it is now more clear than ever that President Biden's  policies have failed our families, failed our communities, and  ultimately failed our Nation.                            ____________________
