 Mr. Chairman, I would first like to thank the  gentlewoman from Tennessee for her leadership during this budget  process. She has done an amazing job of showing wisdom and patience and  negotiating this all through this process. My sincere thanks are given  to the gentlewoman.   This budget is a critical step in getting our economy growing and our  national debt under control. Not only does it balance in 10 years and  put our country on the path to fiscal stability, it also lays the  groundwork for tax reform.   With this budget, we are demonstrating that it is possible to have  fiscal discipline and keep our promises to the American people. We can  no longer continue to kick the can down the road on our mandatory  spending crisis. We are leaving behind more and more debt for our  children and grandchildren, and it is morally wrong.   We must put politics aside and have tough conversations to ensure  that we can keep the promises that we have made to Americans and to  future generations.   This budget does not solve our mandatory spending crisis overnight,  but it begins that process by achieving a $203 billion savings in  mandatory spending.   By passing this budget, we will also kick-start tax reform. I have  said time and time again that America should be the best place in the  world to do business, yet we have a Tax Code that tells our businesses  that they should take their jobs and their profits overseas.   Every American benefits from lower taxes and growing the economy. The  tax reform framework we released last week will do just that. Americans  will get to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks, companies will  have the freedom to reinvest in their businesses and workers, and more  people can move to the American Dream.  [[Page H7789]]    Before we can make these changes, we must pass the budget. The  reconciliation instructions in the budget will set us on a path to  comprehensive tax reform in both the House and the Senate.   This is not just a conversation about dollars and cents. It is about  Americans who are counting on us to keep our commitments. We must do  the tough work of reforming our mandatory spending programs and  reforming our Tax Code.   I am excited to support this budget to build a better America and  pledge to continue working toward comprehensive mandatory spending  reform.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 15  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I want to start by saying that I appreciate the  opportunity to have this discussion today because it is an important  one. I know that the gentleman from Virginia and I both want to address  the challenges facing our Nation and our fellow Americans.   We agree that the status quo is insufficient to meet the needs of the  future, and we share a passion for protecting the vulnerable, breaking  the cycles of poverty, and lifting Americans up.   But I must oppose this budget because it will not accomplish those  things. This budget raises taxes by $4 trillion, increases spending by  $1.4 trillion, and it never balances.   It proposes more Washington-mandated answers to problems that States  and communities are better equipped to solve. It makes no effort to  control Federal deficits and debt, and it will leave our country  bankrupt.   I want to be clear what this means. This budget will double down on  generational theft--spending more and more money that we don't have  today and leaving our children and grandchildren to foot the bill  tomorrow.   In contrast, the Republican budget confronts our Nation's fiscal  challenges head on by requiring mandatory spending reductions of at  least $203 billion and balancing within 10 years.   While this budget measures success on how much the Federal Government  spends, the Republican House budget proposes to measure success by  outcomes. If we have learned nothing from decades of spending on  Federal welfare programs, it is that more money cannot resolve the  complex issues underlying systemic poverty.   We must change our approach, and this starts with changing how we  measure results.   This budget also fails to address a critical piece of the upward  mobility agenda: reforming our broken Tax Code. Instead, it calls for  tax increases that would stifle economic growth that the country so  desperately needs.   America should be the most competitive place in the world to do  business, but everything in our Tax Code today tells companies to take  their jobs and their investments overseas and to leave them there.   Higher taxes on job creators and small businesses is the exact  opposite of what we need to bring workers back into the labor force and  get our economy growing again. Now is the time for comprehensive tax  reform that unleashes the entrepreneurial spirit of America, increases  business and personal investment, and promotes job creation. By failing  to move the ball forward on tax reform, this budget leaves the American  workers and families behind.   Lastly, Mr. Chairman, I want to note what this proposal does make  cuts in, and that is in our national defense. In a time when we face  increasingly complex and evolving international threats from places  like North Korea, Russia, and Iran, this budget would cut overall  [[Page H7830]]  defense spending and compromise the readiness and safety of our  servicemembers and our national freedoms.   The first job of the Federal Government is to provide for our  national security. We need to reinvest in our military to deter global  threats and protect our homeland. That is why the Republican budget  fulfills Congress' commitment to ensure robust funding for our  country's national defense.   Mr. Chairman, we will have a lot of conversations today about  priorities, because that is what budgets are: clear illustrations of  our priorities.   We want to leave our Nation better for our children and  grandchildren. We all want every person, regardless of their  socioeconomic status or ZIP Code, to have the opportunity to realize  the American Dream.   I oppose this budget proposal because it will not help us achieve  these goals. It avoids the tough questions and substitutes more  spending for better results.   It does nothing to promote vibrant economic growth, and it doubles  down on bad ideas that stifle ingenuity and the spirit of  entrepreneurism that we need. We have a responsibility to secure our  Nation's fiscal future and improve the lives of our citizens, but this  budget is not the way forward.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Lewis).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Gaetz).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Gaetz).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I certainly understand our colleagues' desire to fight poverty. I  would like to share a little bit of my experience and what we have done  to fight poverty at the local level.   For generations now, we have continued to throw more and more money  towards eliminating poverty, with fewer and fewer results.   Yes, we have succeeded in alleviating the effects of poverty, but we  have made very little progress in actually lifting people out of  poverty. Instead of giving people a hand up, we are giving them a  handout and essentially telling them life can't get any better than  where they are. That is morally wrong, and I think that we can do  better.   The key to solving poverty isn't just simply throwing more money at  the problem. It is to try something different and find innovative ways  to fix our welfare entitlement system, improve our education system,  and return the dignity of work to our fellow citizens.   The proposed amendment does none of these things. It simply  perpetuates the cycle of generational poverty that has been passed down  from parent to child.   I saw the same situation in my hometown of West Point, Georgia. In  fact, it is what motivated me to enter public service and run for  mayor.   We had a community that was dying. Folks were trapped in generational  poverty and had been stripped of the dignity of work.   Instead of continuing the current system, we made changes. We worked  to get the government out of the way and allow the job creators to  innovate and grow their businesses to hire more workers. We invested in  our infrastructure and we were able to create over 15,000 advanced  manufacturing jobs.   For the first time in a generation, we saw more people moving into  the middle class than moving into poverty.   We made changes to our education system, working to break through the  generational cycle of poverty and prepare today's students to work in a  21st century workforce.   With all of these changes, we saw our community come back to life.  People had jobs and opportunity. They took advantage of it. They had  the advanced manufacturing sector spring back to life, and we saw a  revitalization of not only our community, but of our people.   These lessons are from the folks in the Third District. They sent me  here to push those same type of ideas here in Congress.   The Republican budget puts us on a path to this type of reform, and I  believe my colleagues and I share the desire to fight poverty in this  country. However, I do not believe that the CBC budget proposal does us  that justice.   I look forward to passing the House budget.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to urge my colleagues to  join me in opposing the budget presented by the gentleman from  Virginia. This budget does nothing to address our mandatory spending  challenges. It never balanced. It raises taxes, it increases spending,  it cuts funding to our military. We can do better, we must do better,  and the House budget is the way forward.   The American people sent us here to get our fiscal house in order.  This budget does not accomplish that goal. I urge my colleagues to vote  against it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a  substitute offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Norman) having assumed the chair, Mr. Duncan of Tennessee, Acting Chair  of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the concurrent  resolution (H. Con. Res. 71) establishing the congressional budget for  the United States Government for fiscal year 2018 and setting forth the  appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2019 through 2027, had  come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
