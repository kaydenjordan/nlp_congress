 Madam Chair, I rise today to urge a vote in support of the  CHOICE Arrangement Act to enhance the flexibility and affordability of  healthcare options for small businesses. Competition is the only way to  drive down costs.                                time  1630    Democratic policies like ObamaCare have led to consolidation in the  marketplace, skyrocketing premiums, and a broken individual health  market that costs taxpayers more than $1 trillion a year while covering  only 4.6 percent of the population. Make no mistake, Madam Chair, the  Federal Government owns healthcare, and there is no private system to  compete with it.   As a small business owner, I was fortunate to be able to offer my  employees private health insurance without having to send them to the  ACA exchange, and I understand how much employers want to be able to  offer their employees quality healthcare coverage at a low cost. I  guarantee you, Madam Chair, that the business community will figure out  healthcare and how to lower costs.   Unfortunately, many small businesses lack the economies of scale  needed to negotiate lower prices with insurance companies. This  commonsense package aims to reduce administrative burdens and empower  small employers to be able to provide healthcare coverage to their  employees by removing barriers and implementing innovative solutions  like association health plans.   Small businesses and private employers can band together in  association health plans to be in a better bargaining position to  reduce healthcare costs for their employees. As an original cosponsor  of the Association Health Plans Act, I am pleased it was included in  the package we have before us today.   This legislation will also expand association health plans by  allowing self-  [[Page H3030]]  employed individuals to participate in an ERISA-covered health plan.   I was proud to work with Congressman Hern on the Healthy Future Task  Force Affordability Subcommittee last Congress, and the legislation we  are debating today is a culmination of our hard work. We were able to  produce solutions to provide high quality, affordable, and personalized  healthcare for workers and their families, as well as innovative  policies so more small businesses can offer healthcare benefits.   I am proud to have worked on the solutions included in the CHOICE  Arrangement Act which will give small businesses the freedom to focus  on serving their customers and employees.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
