 Mr. President, this week, thousands of law enforcement  officers have gathered in Washington to honor their fallen brothers and  sisters in blue.   Every year since 1962, Peace Officers Memorial Day has called our  Nation to pay special tribute to heroic men and women in our  communities who have made the ultimate sacrifice to keep us safe.  Throughout Police Week, peace officers and families from around the  country mourn loved ones and find shared strength. Today, we remind the  families and comrades of these fallen heroes that a grateful Nation has  their backs.   As always, I am honored to welcome the Kentuckians who traveled to  Washington for this week's events. My staff continue to work closely  with Kentucky law enforcement and to listen to their concerns. Like  many in my home State, I am thinking especially of the Kentuckians we  lost in the line of duty this past year: Officer Logan Medlock of the  London Police Department, who was fatally struck by a drunk driver  while patrolling on duty; Sheriff's Chief Deputy Jody Cash of the  Calloway County Sheriff's Department, who was shot and killed while  interviewing a suspect; Captain Ralph Frasure and Officer Jacob  Chaffins of the Prestonsburg Police Department and Deputy William Petry  of the Floyd County Sheriff's Department, who were shot and killed in  an ambush while attempting to serve a warrant; and the seven other  Kentuckians whose names are being enshrined today on the National Law  Enforcement Memorial: James Critchelow, Travis Hurley, Oliver Little,  Gregory Means, Mark Pike, David Ragle, and Dixon Allen Sasser.   I also want to pay special tribute to Officer Nickolas Wilt who was  shot in the head while responding to last month's bank shooting in  downtown Louisville. Officer Wilt was just 11 days out of the Academy,  but he never shied away from his duty, even in the face of imminent  danger.   Today, Officer Wilt has continued to show signs of improvement and  the city of Louisville stands behind him on his road to recovery.   As we honor officers in Kentucky and across the country who have been  injured or killed in the line of duty, I know my colleagues join me in  thanking the peace officers who continue to run toward danger to keep  us safe.  [[Page S1636]]    Mr. President, Police Week is an important and solemn occasion every  year. America's peace officers deserve our respect and recognition  every single day. But in recent years, Peace Officers Memorial Day has  taken on an especially urgent situation. In 2021, President Biden's  first year in office, the number of law enforcement officials  feloniously killed in the line of duty reached its highest level in 20  years.   Just last year, 331 officers were shot on the job; 62 of them were  killed. That is a 32-percent increase from just 2 years earlier. Brave  men and women in blue swear to uphold law and order, to run toward  danger, even to give their lives to protect their communities. But as a  radical, soft-on-crime movement has taken hold of elected Democrats at  every level of government, peace officers have been forced to bear an  even heavier burden.   Brave police officers have faced down a historic wave of violent  crime from the frontlines, even as defund-the-police radicalism forced  them to do it with fewer resources and thinner ranks.   They have continued to risk their lives to enforce our laws, even as  soft-on-crime liberal prosecutors do everything they can to avoid  holding criminals accountable.   So this week--this week--we honor men and women whose tough job is  only getting tougher on Washington Democrats' watch. But thanks to the  leadership of Senator Cornyn and Senator Cassidy, Senate Republicans  are ready to take action to protect law enforcement officers in the  line of duty.   Our colleagues from Texas and Louisiana have introduced legislation  to raise the stakes for criminals who resort to violence against  police. Their bill would deliver new Federal mandatory sentencing for  killing a police officer, higher consequences for assault, and new  separate penalties for fleeing such crimes across State lines.   So as our Nation observes Police Week, I am proud to cosponsor our  colleagues' work and to continue to back the blue.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor an exceptional  officer of the U.S. Army, MG Trevor J. Bredenkamp, chief legislative  liaison for the Office of the Secretary of the Army. Major General  Bredenkamp has faithfully served our Nation for over 31 years. He has  been a voice of reason and sound professional judgment on countless  issues of enduring importance to the Army, Congress, and the American  people. This Nation and the Commonwealth of Kentucky thank Major  General Bredenkamp as he prepares to leave his current post.   Born into an Air Force family, Major General Bredenkamp has had a  strong sense of duty from the outset. In 1992, he received his  commission as an infantry officer from the U.S. Military Academy at  West Point. Like so many brave patriots in the aftermath of September  11, Major General Bredenkamp deployed to combat in Afghanistan and  Iraq. He served in multiple staff and command positions in the fight to  defend our freedoms abroad, and would go on to command our country's  skilled soldiers across the Nation.   On the home front, Major General Bredenkamp has strengthened  strategic partnerships between the Army  [[Page S1646]]  and Congress. He has improved relationships with both legislative  Chambers and buoyed congressional support for Army priorities,  navigating complicated issues through multiple legislative cycles. As a  result of his efforts, the Army has accomplished generational  modernization, led our Nation's response to an unprecedented land war  in Europe, and enhanced the quality of life of its soldiers, Army  civilians, and their families.   Major General Bredenkamp's impressive list of staff and special  assignments includes platoon leader, scout platoon leader, and  battalion S-1 in the 3rd Battalion, 505 Parachute Infantry Regiment,  82nd Airborne Division; platoon/company/battalion observer/controller  at the Joint Readiness Training Center; G3 Training Officer, 82nd  Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, and deployed as part of Operation  IRAQI FREEDOM; operations officer, 2nd Battalion, 504th Parachute  Infantry Regiment; operations officer, 1st Brigade Combat Team, 82nd  Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, and deployed as part of Operation  ENDURING FREEDOM; aide-de-camp to the commander, US Army Forces Command  and subsequently the commander, International Security Assistance  Force, North Atlantic Treaty Organization; deputy director, Soldier for  Life; executive officer to the Secretary of the Army; and the chief,  programs division, Office of the Chief, Legislative Liaison, Office of  the Secretary of the Army. He has earned numerous military awards and  decorations for his selfless service to our country. These honors  include the Defense Superior Service Medal, four Legions of Merit, four  Bronze Stars, six Meritorious Service Medals, five Army Commendations,  and five Army Achievement Medals.   Major General Bredenkamp is fortunate to have the support of his wife  of 25 years, MG Michele Bredenkamp. They are the proud and loving  parents of two children. Military families are the backbone of our  Nation's defense, and we thank the Bredenkamp family for their enduring  support and for molding the man we recognize today.   Major General Bredekamp's years of steady leadership and dedication  to his country remind us of the sacrifice our men and women in uniform  make on the battlefield and at home each day. Congress and the American  people thank Major General Bredenkamp and his family for their  continued commitment and sacrifice to our country. His 31 years of  service embody the very best traditions of our armed forces: duty,  honor, and selflessness in defense of our Nation. I join my colleagues  in wishing Major General Bredenkamp future success as he continues to  serve.                            ____________________
