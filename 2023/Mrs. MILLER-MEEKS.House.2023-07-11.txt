 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  conservative priorities included in the Fiscal Year 2024 National  Defense Authorization Act.   In recent years, our military has struggled with a severe recruiting  crisis that will have enormous implications for our strategic position  in an increasingly unstable global stage. There are several factors  exacerbated by the Biden administration that have made military service  less compelling to young Americans, and I say this as a 24-year Army  veteran.   For instance, discharging servicemembers who declined to take the  COVID-19 vaccine, despite requesting an exemption, upended careers and  negatively impacted many servicemembers and their hard-earned benefits.   This year's NDAA provides critical steps to gut the administration's  political agenda that has no place in our  [[Page H3180]]  military. For instance, it provides a pathway back to the Armed Forces  for servicemembers who declined to take the COVID vaccine. It also  continues to prohibit the DOD from mandating that servicemembers take  an emergency use vaccine.   Additionally, this legislation includes an extremely important  provision of a 5.2 percent increase in servicemember pay. This is  tremendously important for our enlisted ranks, and it is the largest  pay raise in over 20 years.   I urge all my colleagues to support this important legislation that  supports our military families and ensures our national security.                    Congratulating the Quad City Strikers     Madam Speaker, I will use this time as a chance to  congratulate the Quad City Strikers U15 Soccer Club who represented the  State of Iowa in the 2023 US Youth Soccer National Presidents Cup,  which took place in Wichita, Kansas, from July 6-11.   This is the third year in a row that they competed in the Midwest  Regional, and this year, after a runner-up finish in the regional, they  successfully clinched their place in the national tournament. They were  one of eight teams who qualified for the tournament and the only one  that represented the State of Iowa.   These boys worked hard all year long and were able to represent Iowa  at the highest amateur level. I congratulate every player on the team  and their coach, Juan Nuci.   We thank him for his dedication and for making Iowa, and especially  the First District, proud.                         Congratulating Caitlin Clark     Madam Speaker, today, I congratulate Ms. Caitlin  Clark of Des Moines, Iowa, for winning the National Player of the Year  award for her performance this past season for the University of Iowa  Hawkeyes Women's Basketball Team.   Caitlin is a junior at the University of Iowa and averaged almost 28  points a game, while leading the Hawkeyes to the NCAA Women's  Basketball championship game. While averaging 28 points a game, she  also averaged seven rebounds and almost nine assists through her  historic season, where she swept the National Player of the Year award.   Caitlin Clark is a prime example of our constituents in Iowa,  extremely talented and hardworking, while also remaining humble through  all of their success. We congratulate Caitlin, and we thank her for  making Iowa, the University of Iowa, and the Hawkeye nation proud.                      Congratulating Judge William Kelly     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Judge  William Kelly on his selection to be a magistrate judge of the United  States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. Judge Kelly is  a member of the Iowa National Guard and will now serve our country in a  different way.   Judge Kelly has an accomplished legal and judicial career. He  obtained an undergraduate degree from Brown University. After  graduation, he moved to Iowa to attend Drake University Law School in  Des Moines. For 8 years he served as a State District Court Judge for  District 5C in Iowa State courts, serving Polk County.   Becoming a magistrate judge happens after a rigorous selection  process, and candidates are selected based on their merit by the  district judges to help assist with the smooth and speedy legal process  that we enjoy in the United States. Good judges in our U.S. court  system are vital to keeping our constitutional republic together. I  applaud Judge Kelly for taking the position, and I wish him luck in  serving southeast Iowa.   Madam Speaker, I also extend a happy birthday to my sister, Mari- Eleanor Martino. Happy birthday Mari-Eleanor.                            ____________________
