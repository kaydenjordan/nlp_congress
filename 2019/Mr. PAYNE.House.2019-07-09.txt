 Mr. Speaker, serial sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein has been  arrested again. Federal prosecutors have charged him with running a sex  trafficking ring where he paid to have sex with girls as young as 14  years old.   More than that, officials said Epstein's abuse happened between 2002  and 2005, 3 years before he received a sweetheart deal to spend a mere  18 months in prison and avoid Federal trial for sexual abuse of 36  underaged girls.   The prosecutor who made that deal is our current Secretary of Labor,  Alexander Acosta.   That is why I am calling for Secretary Acosta to resign. His actions  in the Epstein case prove that he prefers to protect sex offenders over  teenage abuse victims.   He prefers to protect millionaire criminals over the common man, so  how can we trust him to protect millions of American workers from  corporate abuse when he clearly supports the abusers? We can't.   That is why he needs to resign. Then, we can let the FBI conduct a  thorough investigation of his actions to ensure that nothing like this  ever happens again.
