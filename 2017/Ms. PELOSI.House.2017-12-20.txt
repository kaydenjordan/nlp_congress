 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time,  and, once again, I commend him for being a champion of middle class  families.   I want my colleagues all to hear the esteem in which we hold our  Democratic members of the Ways and Means Committee. I thank you. Thank  you very much, Mr. Neal, for being our ranking member and for your  extraordinary leadership on behalf of America's middle class working  families, and that includes millions of veterans. Thank you.   Mr. Speaker, today is a very sad day in the history of America  because we have, on the floor, probably the worst bill in recent time  to come to the floor. That doesn't mean it doesn't have stiff  competition from other legislation the Republicans have brought to the  floor, but this is the worst because so many people are affected in  such a negative way and because trillions of dollars of impact on our  economy have been voted upon without any hearing, without any hearing  from the people who will be most affected by it--no hearings, no  experts, no listening to the American people.   Yesterday, our Republican colleagues stood on this floor and voted  for a GOP tax scam that the American people oppose 2 to 1. Our  Republican colleagues stood on the floor and cheered. They  [[Page H10309]]  cheered a bill that will raise taxes on 86 million middle class  families and hand a staggering 83 percent of its tax cuts to the  wealthiest 1 percent.   Shamefully, the Republicans were cheering against the children as  they robbed from their future and ransacked the middle class to reward  the rich.   Today, the Republicans take their victory lap for successfully  pillaging the American middle class to benefit the powerful and the  privileged.   I come to the floor with stories of men and women and children that  Republicans shamefully cheered against yesterday.   Yesterday, I wish the Republicans had heard, as we did, the story of  Ady Barkan, 30 years old, father of a beautiful baby son, and Ady is  suddenly stricken with ALS, 30 years old.   From his wheelchair, with a strong but wavering voice, he begged  Congress not to pass this bill. He pleaded with anyone who would listen  not to vote for this tax scam that will raise his health benefits and  condemn Medicaid to devastating cuts as the logical next step. He has  been lobbying on Capitol Hill against this bill for a while. Ady said  yesterday it would do so much damage.         It would deprive me of the Medicaid I need to stay alive a       little longer and see baby Carl learn to read and teach him       how to play chess and watch him go to first grade.    But Republicans didn't listen, said ``no,'' and cheered.   Yesterday, we heard the story, and I wish our Republican friends  could have heard it, of Laura Hatcher, mother of sweet and kind 11- year-old Simon, one of the Little Lobbyists.   Simon has a rare disease and cerebral palsy. His mother spoke of how  their family watches the Muppet version of ``A Christmas Carol'' and  how Simon sees himself in Tiny Tim, another kind boy with braces on his  legs. Unfortunately, this story, as of today, does not have the same  kind of happy ending as ``A Christmas Carol.''   But the story is not over, and like Tiny Tim, Simon and his family  now find their future in danger because of the greed of those with  power, the cruelty that is in the heart of the tax scam.   As Simon's mother, Laura, said:         Very soon I could, once again, be facing a future where I       don't know how I will be able to care for my child. This is a       thought I simply find too difficult to bear.    Since you didn't hear yesterday, I will go on to say what she said.         We parents of medically complex kids understand       consequences. We know what will happen if this tax bill       passes, if our country does not turn from this destructive       and immoral path.    But the Republicans didn't listen. They said ``no,'' and they  cheered. They cheered against Simon because Republicans value the  wishes of the special interest lobbyists over the Little Lobbyists, the  voices of Little Lobbyists, sick children standing up for themselves  and for their siblings, children standing with their siblings.    Yesterday, we heard from faith leaders, too. They implored Congress  to reject this bill that punishes working families and rewards the  wealthiest 1 percent.   I repeat: 83 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent; 86  million American working middle class families will have their taxes  raised.   Sister Simone said she wept for the fact that our Representatives are  not weeping over the damage they are doing to families across America.   They challenged us to honor our faith in this holy season, to  remember that our first responsibility is to those who have the least,  not to enrich those who are already privileged and powerful.   They challenged us to heed not only the message of Christmas, but to  remember the words of Jesus enshrined in the Gospel of Matthew.   But Republicans didn't listen. They said ``no.'' They cheered. They  cheered. They cheered against little Simon. They cheered against Ady  Barkan. They cheered against people in need.   The GOP tax scam is a monumental con job, but who got conned?  President Trump will sign the bill whenever he signs it. I know it is  supposed to be today, but I hear the special interests are weighing in  for him to delay it for some reason or another.   President Trump will sign a bill that betrays the promises he made in  the campaign.   President Trump promised to eliminate the carried interest loophole;  yet the Republicans wrote a tax scam that not only continues this  outrageous loophole, but it gives even more loopholes to the wealthy  and well connected.   President Trump promised to stop corporations from shipping jobs  overseas, but Republicans wrote a tax scam that gives corporate America  even bigger incentives to ship jobs overseas.   President Trump promised tax reform focused on middle class families,  tax breaks for middle class families. Republicans wrote a tax scam that  raises taxes on 86 million middle class families in our country.   President Trump promised he would protect Medicare, Medicaid, and  Social Security, but Republicans wrote a tax plan to explode the  deficit and use it as an excuse to cut Medicare and Medicaid. They have  made no secret of their plans. They have even said this week, to raise  the Social Security age.   So who got conned? Did the people get conned by the promises? Did the  President get conned by the Republicans? Is he signing a bill that  betrays his promises to the American people?   It is all about the Republicans in Congress. They have in their DNA  trickle-down economics. Tax breaks for the rich, tax breaks for  corporations, and the former Speaker even said: If trickle-down creates  jobs, that would be good. If it doesn't, so be it. That is the free  market.   As Republicans head to the White House for their victory lap,  hopefully they won't trip over the wheelchair of Ady Barkan and other  Americans with preexisting conditions.   I caution them not to trip over the wheelchair of Simon Hatcher and  other children with severe medical needs. They will be in the path of  your victory lap.   Don't trip over the sisters and brothers and mothers and fathers who  tend to the health and well-being of their sick children and their  siblings and who will not stop fighting to protect them.   I told you yesterday in a public forum:         I caution you not to get in the way of a mother and father       of a child with special needs and disabilities or extreme       medical conditions. They will do anything to protect that       child, and they notice what you are doing here.    As you are on this victory lap, you will probably have to put on  earphones so you can block out the pleas of faith leaders speaking up  for hardworking American families.   I know the Republicans want to talk so they can't hear the truth  about their bill, but the American people won't forget the false  representations you have made. They won't forget how loudly you cheered  when you hurt their families, their children with special needs, their  families struggling to attain some financial stability.   And why? These people say to me: How could they be so cruel as to put  the health provision in this bill that would possibly eliminate 13  million people from the rolls of health insurance? How could they do  that? Why did they do that?   Why? The answer is always the same: to give them room to give tax  breaks to the wealthiest people in our country and to corporate  America, unpaid for, permanently.   Our distinguished colleague from Massachusetts will show his credit  card again today. They are putting this bill on a credit card that our  children are going to have to pay for, robbing from their future.   This holiday they are talking about giving people a Christmas  present? Well, Joe Sixpack, whom the President said he was there to  help, and I hope that that is true, Joe Sixpack will be delivering the  champagne to their parties. That is how this is. This isn't about  anything better for working class families. This is about champagne  glasses clinking and wealthy families across the country.   I don't begrudge them their success or their wealth or their  achievement. I just don't want to see it at the exploitation of  America's working families.   Shame on you for voting for this outrageous theft from the American  middle class.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I urge my colleagues to do the right thing  in this people's House and vote ``no'' on behalf of the American  people.
