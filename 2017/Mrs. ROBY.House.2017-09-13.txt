 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the underlying  legislation, H.R. 3697, the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act.   I want to thank Chairman Goodlatte and my fellow Judiciary Committee  colleagues for prioritizing cracking down on illegal immigration in the  committee this year. All the time, I hear from constituents who are  frustrated by this country's unwillingness to address our illegal  immigration problem. They are also fed up with hearing politicians  promise to do something about it, only to offer excuses later.   Mr. Speaker, I believe this Congress and this administration have  shown, over the last 9 months, that we are willing to do something  about illegal immigration, and this legislation is a great example of  our commitment to addressing this problem.   When it comes to cracking down on illegal immigration, I believe most  of us agree that we should start by targeting dangerous criminals who  put Americans at risk. H.R. 3697 is a commonsense measure that does  just that by amending existing law to combat gang violence by criminal  aliens.   Many Americans may hear this and wonder: ``What gang violence?'' The  most notorious Latin-American gang is known as MS-13, which began in  the 1980s, and has grown to an estimated 8,000 members in the United  States. They have a violent history of organized crime in the areas of  drug trafficking, kidnapping, human smuggling, sex trafficking, murder,  assassinations, blackmail, and extortion.   To give you an idea of just how violent MS-13 is, the English  translation of their motto is: ``Kill, steal, rape, control.''   Mr. Speaker, gangs of criminal aliens are terrorizing American  communities, and it is our responsibility to do something about it.  H.R. 3697 will amend the law to finally make a person's history of  involvement in a criminal gang grounds for inadmissibility into this  country--that means involvement in drugs, sex trafficking, kidnapping,  murder, or any other awful crime spelled out in the law.                                time  1245    This bill would also allow law enforcement agents to automatically  detain and deport anyone found to be a criminal alien gang member.   Our first priority must be to keep Americans safe. Our laws and  policies should reflect our commitment to this responsibility. H.R.  3697 makes it crystal clear that criminal alien gang members are not  welcome in this country, and if they should find themselves here, we  are dedicated to getting them off the street.
