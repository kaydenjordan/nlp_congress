 Mr. Speaker, I rise as a tireless advocate for the most  vulnerable. I continue to fight for the Born-Alive Act to mandate  lifesaving care for abortion survivors. And I also am proud to support  H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, which will  permanently prohibit taxpayer funding for abortions by enshrining the  bipartisan Hyde amendment into law. Sadly, both the Born-Alive Act and  the Hyde amendment are under attack by my Democrat colleagues.   The Hyde amendment protects taxpayers from paying for abortions and  has saved hundreds of thousands of lives.   No one should be forced to financially support the abortion industry.  I stand with the majority of Americans who believe in this essential  conscience protection.  [[Page H3248]]    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, and I ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
