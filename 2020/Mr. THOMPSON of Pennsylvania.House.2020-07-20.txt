 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring  awareness to our Nation's abandoned mine lands.   Our abandoned mine lands desperately need to be reclaimed to prevent  harm to our communities and to our environment. When these sites are  cleaned up and mines reclaimed, it improves the quality of our air,  soil, and water.   Pennsylvania has more abandoned mine sites than any other State in  the country. In fact, my district, Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional  District, has more abandoned mine sites than each of the remaining 434  congressional districts combined.   This past September, my Democratic colleague from Pennsylvania's  Eighth Congressional District, Matt Cartwright, joined me to introduce  H.R. 4248, the Abandoned Mine Land Reauthorization Act.   The abandoned mine land trust fund is set to expire in September  2021, and this bill will not only reauthorize the fund for the next 15  years but help spur economic growth in coal communities impacted by  mine closures.    For more than 40 years, this program has properly closed more than  46,000 open mine portals. To continue this momentum, the AML trust fund  must be reauthorized.   There is still work to be done.   This past month, I had the pleasure of visiting the Anderson Creek  watershed in Clearfield County. Reed Johnson, a constituent of mine who  has owned property in that area for 30 years, has been working  tirelessly ever since to clean up the abandoned mine site on that  property.   Mr. Speaker, what was mined on that site was clay, and it was clay  that was made to manufacture kiln bricks, the kiln bricks that were  used to produce the steel that allowed the industrial revolution to  occur and allowed us to provide the arsenal of democracy to win World  War I and World War II. But we have a legacy that we need to clean up  there.   During that visit, Reed welcomed me, as well as State and local  officials, for a tour of the property. One of the other attendees was  Clearfield County Conservation District's Watershed Specialist Kelly  Williams.   The impact of abandoned mine lands on our environment is obvious, but  there are community and economic considerations as well. Ms. Williams  underscored the impact that abandoned mine lands have, not only on the  environment, but on our communities as a whole.   Outdoor recreation is very popular in the area, specifically, boating  and fishing. When abandoned mine lands are left untouched for too long,  they have  [[Page H3098]]  an incredibly damaging impact on local waterways.   When outdoor recreation is a big part of the local economy, our  communities feel that financial loss. Ms. Williams estimated that  Clearfield County could lose as much as $3 million a year due to this  impact.   Reed continues to work to raise awareness about abandoned mine lands.  The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection says the  project would take years to finish, but I know Reed won't stop  fighting.   In the meantime, Congress needs to reauthorize the AML trust fund to  ensure abandoned mine land sites are reclaimed, our environment is  protected, and our communities are safe.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  July 20 as Pennsylvania Day.   Since the inception of our Nation, Pennsylvania has played a  transformative role in United States history.   In our foundational years, Pennsylvania was the site of many  important battles and military milestones, like the Battle of Valley  Forge in the Revolutionary War and the Battle of Gettysburg during the  Civil War.   Pennsylvania is home to a lot of firsts, including: our Nation's  first capitol, Philadelphia; the American flag sewn by Betsy Ross; and  the first commercial oil well, in my district, giving birth to the  modern petroleum industry.   Pennsylvania has a proud history of American craftsmanship and work  ethic, from our steel mills and coal mines to farmlands and forests.   I am encouraged each and every day by Pennsylvania's rich history,  and I am grateful for our industrious residents who continue to build a  bright future for the Commonwealth.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to call Pennsylvania my home, today and  always.                            ____________________
