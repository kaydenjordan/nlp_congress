 Madam Speaker, President Trump is forcing  more than 37,000 Californians, including many veterans, to go without  pay. From Coast Guard members at Naval Base Ventura County and Channel  Islands Harbor to local air traffic controllers, Ventura County  residents and their families are trying to make ends meet without their  paychecks.   On the first day of this Congress, I joined my Democratic colleagues  to pass legislation to reopen the government and provide for sensible  border security.   The President should not use people's lives and our economy as  hostages to build a campaign slogan. The President closed the  government. A shutdown is not the answer.   Mr. President, reopen our government now.                            ____________________
