 HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my  colleagues for the comments that have been made regarding this very  important piece of legislation.   We all know that securing American energy independence is absolutely  critical to the future prosperity of this Nation, and nuclear power  plays a major role in that mission.   At the Vogtle plant in Georgia, thousands of engineers and craftsmen,  many of whom live in my district, are hard at work putting the United  States at the forefront of advanced nuclear technology. The Vogtle  plant and its sister plant in South Carolina, V.C. Summer, have four  new, state-of-the-art reactors under construction. The clean, low-cost,  safe energy that is produced from both Vogtle and V.C. Summer will pave  the way for future reactors and mark a new era for nuclear power in the  United States.   H.R. 1551 makes relatively small changes to already established tax  credits, but this legislation will have an enormous impact on ensuring  nuclear power remains a viable source of energy.   So I, again, just want to thank my good friend, Mr. Rice, for  introducing this sincerely important piece of legislation, and I urge  all of my colleagues here to support H.R. 1551.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to support this bill.    HICE of Georgia:        H.R. 2945.
