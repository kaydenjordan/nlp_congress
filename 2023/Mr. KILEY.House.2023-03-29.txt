 Madam Speaker, currently, California businesses are facing  a significant tax increase, thanks in part to a high-ranking State  official who allowed the tax dollars they had already paid to be  stolen. It is an incompetence tax, a price private citizens are being  forced to pay for their government's failures.   I would like to take a moment to explain how this happened, but I  will lead with the punch line: The State official who squandered these  funds, allowing a fraud of historic proportions, is somehow now up for  a major promotion.   President Biden has nominated Julie Su, former head of the California  Labor and Workforce Development Agency, to be the next U.S. Secretary  of Labor.   The predicament that small businesses in California now find  themselves in--facing double taxation to compensate for the  government's singular negligence--is another example of why this  nomination is so ill-considered. It is a warning as to what all  Americans have in store if Julie Su is confirmed.   Stepping back, the California Unemployment Insurance Fund is the  source for paying out unemployment insurance claims honored by  California's unemployment office, known as the EDD.   The fund is ordinarily maintained through a tax levied on California  businesses. New employers are assigned a 3.4 percent UI rate for 2 to 3  years. After that, a business' contribution tax varies. It is somewhere  between 1.5 and 6.2 percent for the current year.  [[Page H1539]]    In times of economic duress, when the fund is paying out  significantly more than is coming in, the Federal Government has the  option of loaning money to States, including California, to cover the  payment deficit.   California had to take out such a loan during the COVID business  shutdowns and took on by far the most debt of any State. The current  debt amounts to $18.8 billion. This was because of the huge volume of  claims, yes, but also because of a staggering amount of fraud.   A coalition letter from dozens of Chambers of Commerce in California  notes:         The Employment Development Department proved ill-equipped       for the rapid increase in claimants. After numerous oversight       hearings and analyses of EDD's failings, it is clear that       EDD's failings added further to the UI fund's insolvency in       two ways: by failing to prevent fraud and, instead,       distributing funds to fraudulent claimants; and by mistakenly       distributing overpayments to legitimate claimants. Although       EDD and local law enforcement have attempted to recover some       of these mistaken distributions, recovery rates appear to be       less than 10 percent of the mistaken distributions. In other       words, these mistakes at EDD added to the UI fund deficit.                                time  1115    The total scale of EDD fraud in California is estimated at $32.6  billion. This unprecedented loss was almost entirely preventable if  Julie Su had taken basic fraud prevention measures.   A January 2021 report from the California State auditor notes that  the EDD fraud occurred for three main reasons:   First, EDD waited about 4 months to automate a key antifraud measure.   Second, EDD allowed claimants to collect benefits even though they  were using suspicious addresses. In one case, over 1,700 claims came  from a single address.   Third, EDD removed a key safeguard against improper payments without  fully understanding the significance of the safeguard.   Further, the State auditor reports that: ``Despite repeated warnings,  EDD did not bolster its fraud detection efforts until months into the  pandemic.''   ``And it does not reliably track suspicious claims and resolution to  determine the effectiveness of its fraud prevention tools.''   By the way, if you are wondering where all this money, $32.6 billion  went, the CEO of LexisNexis Risk Solutions has this to say: ``Seventy  percent of that money left California. It left this country. It went to  transnational criminal groups that have used that money for nefarious  purposes to harm our democracy. Some of that money has been used in sex  trafficking, child extortion.''   At this point, California is one of only four States in the country  that hasn't repaid its debt to the Federal Government. Now, taxpaying  businesses are on the hook. In the case of fund insolvency for 2  consecutive years--as is the case with California--Federal law mandates  an automatic increase in payroll taxes that amounts to $21 per  employee. The tax continues to ratchet up by $21 per employee each year  the fund remains insolvent, with a maximum tax increase of $434 per  employee per year.   Now, one might ask, why did California not repay its debt to the  Federal Government last year when it had a $97.5 billion surplus?   There is no good answer to that question.   I have actually joined with Representative Obernolte to call on  California's Governor and legislature to repay the loan so the burden  doesn't fall on employers, and I am calling on the United States Senate  to consider this a case study in what we don't want for our country.                            ____________________
