 Madam Speaker, I rise today as we celebrate  Black History Month and adopt antilynching legislation to recognize  civil rights trailblazer Reverend J. Edward Nash.   The son of slaves, Reverend Nash served as pastor of the Michigan  Street Baptist Church in Buffalo, New York, which opened its doors up  as a meeting place for abolitionists and antilynching activists and as  a stop on the Underground Railroad.   Last week, I visited the Nash House, a site on the National Register  of Historic Places and a testament to his work as part of our national  story. Our gracious hosts, former Buffalo Council President George K.  Arthur and Sharon Jordan Holley, shared with me their vision,  enthusiasm, and dedication to Nash, his home, and his legacy.   Among his papers are notes from the 1939 Urban League meeting  benediction in which he applauds those working to ``free us from the  shackles that hold us in the bondage of narrowness, selfishness, and  prejudice.''   Let us heed the advice of Reverend Nash.                            ____________________
