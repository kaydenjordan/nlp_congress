M. Kurta writes:   [[Page S2655]]              I have been asked to respond to your letter--    This is to Congressman Matt Gaetz--       on behalf of the Secretary of Defense.    This is regarding the maintaining of the moratorium on oil and gas  activities in the Gulf of Mexico beyond the year 2022. The letter  states:         The Department of Defense (DoD) cannot overstate the vital       importance of maintaining this moratorium.    Why is that? The letter goes on to explain not only the necessity of  which so many of our bases in the area--Tyndall Air Force Base in  Panama City, all the testing and training of the F-22, the training of  our pilots there; Eglin Air Force Base, the testing and the training of  the pilots for the F-35. Remember, the F-35 is being sold to many  foreign nations, the testing and training of those pilots, as well, but  now, with new technologies--I quote from the letter:         Emerging technologies such as hypersonics, autonomous       systems, and advanced sub-surface systems will require       enlarged testing and training footprints, and increased DoD       reliance on the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act's       moratorium beyond 2022. The moratorium is essential for       developing and sustaining our nation's future combat       capabilities.    So I think it is pretty clear.   There is one other issue. This all follows the fact that this Senator  filed a bill last January to extend this moratorium. I will point out  that just recently a bipartisan delegation from Florida--a majority of  the Members of the Florida delegation, bipartisan--signed a letter to  the Department of the Interior and the Department of Defense requesting  the extension of this moratorium in law past the year 2022. The  response from the Department of Defense has come today.   There is one further issue, and that is, if it is off limits to oil  drilling in law, is there any question that it ought to be off limits  to seismic testing? To the author of the original legislation 10 years  ago, that should be clear, but--therefore we ought to clarify it. The  request of the Department of Defense is:         [A] question arose concerning whether Congress intended the       moratorium to prohibit even geological and geophysical survey       activities in the eastern Gulf. We would welcome       clarification from Congress concerning this matter.    So it will be this Senator's intent, joining in a bipartisan way with  colleagues from Florida, to get that clarification in extending the  moratorium.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                     Washington, DC, April 26, 2017.      Hon. Matt Gaetz,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Gaetz: Thank you for your letter dated       March 24, 2017, regarding maintaining the moratorium on oil       and gas activities in the Gulf of Mexico beyond 2022. Since       military readiness falls under my purview, I have been asked       to respond to your letter on behalf of the Secretary of       Defense. The Department of Defense (DoD) cannot overstate the       vital importance of maintaining this moratorium.        National security and energy security are inextricably       linked and the DoD fully supports the development of our       nation's domestic energy resources in a manner that is       compatible with military testing, training, and operations.       As mentioned in your letter, the complex of eastern Gulf of       Mexico operating areas and warning areas provides critical       opportunities for advanced weapons testing and joint training       exercises. The moratorium on oil and gas ``leasing, pre-      leasing, and other related activities'' ensures that these       vital military readiness activities may be conducted without       interference and is critical to their continuation. Emerging       technologies such as hypersonics, autonomous systems, and       advanced sub-surface systems will require enlarged testing       and training footprints, and increased DoD reliance on the       Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act's moratorium beyond 2022.       The moratorium is essential for developing and sustaining our       nation's future combat capabilities.        Since signing the 1983 ``Memorandum of Agreement Between       the Department of Defense and the Department of the Interior       on Mutual Concerns on the Outer Continental Shelf,'' the two       departments have worked cooperatively to ensure offshore       resource development is compatible with military readiness       activities. During recent discussions between the DoD and the       Department of the Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy       Management, a question arose concerning whether Congress       intended the moratorium to prohibit even geological and       geophysical survey activities in the eastern Gulf. We would       welcome clarification from Congress concerning this matter.        On behalf of the Secretary, I appreciate your interest in       sustaining our testing and training activities in the eastern       Gulf of Mexico.            Sincerely,      A.M. Kurta,        Performing the Duties of the Under Secretary of Defense for       Personnel and Readiness.
