Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I am going to cut to the chase: the Republican Study  Committee budget is so extreme, it cannot be taken seriously. It cuts  spending by $10 trillion over 10 years, which is $4 trillion more than  the already irresponsible spending cuts in Chairman Black's budget.   To its credit, the RSC tells us where those cuts will come from,  rather than leaving large amounts unspecified or using matching  asterisks or phony economic assumptions to reduce spending.   The RSC budget cuts Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. It cuts  programs that ensure basic living standards, protect the environment,  and help families afford college.   For 2018, the RSC budget matches the President's level for defense,  including war funding. But for nondefense discretionary spending, the  RSC budget provides $394 billion, which is $122 billion, or 24 percent,  below the austerity cap.   There is no way this House or any House would approve an  appropriations bill that inflicted a 24 percent cut on all government  operations. If just two programs--veterans' programs and NIH funding-- were excluded from those cuts, everything else would be cut by more  than 55 percent.   So yes, this budget claims to reach balance, but it would achieve it  by making cuts that would be catastrophic. Not even Congress is that  self-destructive.   I contend that the two Republican budgets actually show how  dismissing the notion that revenues must be a part of any solution to  restrain deficits and debt, compounded with the flawed notion that  balance must be achieved in the short term, will inflict intolerable  hardship on the American people.   While totally unintentional, they make a pretty compelling case that  for Congress to responsibly address our debts and deficits, while  funding the Federal programs and investments that the American people  want and expect, raising revenues has to be part of the equation.   One of the things that amuses me, in a very kind of dark way, is that  I remember so well, in 2010, when Republicans actually rode to victory  in the House by claiming that we Democrats were going to cut $750  billion out of Medicare. That wasn't true, but they claimed it.   Now, in this Republican Study Committee budget, they have doubled  down on that. It is not exactly double, but they are going to cut it by  $898 billion. I don't think America's seniors and the disabled  population would feel very good about that.   I would like to thank my colleagues for bringing that important issue  to the debate.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Walker), the chairman of the Republican Study  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, it is fascinating to have this debate and speaking in  such high-principled ways about the need to reduce deficits and debt. I  don't think any Democrat would argue that we need to do something to  reduce deficits and debt. We face a very dire, long-term fiscal future.   But we also lose sight of the fact that the American people expect  something from their government. They expect our government to keep  them safe, but they also expect their government to protect their  drinking water, protect their air, to make sure that the food they eat  is not dangerous, to provide law enforcement and help local law  enforcement to do many things.   The budget, as well as Chairman Black's committee budget, would  decimate all of those services that the American people expect from the  Federal Government.   I think only about what is going on right now with Houston, Florida,  Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands and the enormous cost that the  Federal Government is going to have to bear to help restore those  communities and those territories to some degree of normalcy. That is  what they expect the American Government to do. These budgets would  make that all but impossible.   So we look at it both ways. Later, we will propose a Democratic  alternative that actually makes those kind of investments and makes  sure that the notion of American security is not just a huge military,  but is a foundation of investment in human capital and research and  infrastructure that will allow this economy to grow. We do it with  keeping debt at the same percentage of the economy, as it is now,  because we are willing to raise revenues.   On the other hand, Republican budgets, both the Republican Study  Committee budget and the chairman's budget, anticipate enormous tax  cuts for the wealthiest Americans and corporations--tax cuts that have  been proven to do exactly the opposite of what many on the other side  claim they do, which is to stimulate economic growth.   We will hear claims that, yes, we can cut taxes by $2 trillion or $3  trillion over 10 years, and they are going to be paid for by this  renewal of economic activity. But history tells us that is not what  happens. Not only history tells us that, but virtually all the  economists in the country tell us that, too.   Goldman Sachs, Steve Mnuchin's previous employer, says that the tax  cuts outlined last week would maybe create an additional 0.2 percent of  growth in the economy.   CBO and the Federal Reserve say tax cuts don't pay for themselves.  Even Bruce Bartlett, the author of ``Reaganomics,'' says this whole  notion that tax cuts pay for themselves is nonsense. He actually said  bull, which is half of what he said, but you get the idea.   This is not easy. We can speak in the darkest terms of how we are  imposing this debt on our grandchildren and try to use emotional  arguments. But the fact is, we are dealing with a very realistic,  pragmatic dilemma, and that is: how to do what the American people  expect us to do without making the future impossible.   It is not done by the Republican budgets. We think it is helped along  by the Democratic alternative, and we look forward to having that  debate just a little bit later this morning.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I would remind my friend from Kentucky that Ronald  Reagan reduced the Federal income tax rate from 70 percent down to 28  percent, and income tax revenues doubled.   He is correct that we expect things from our government. We have seen  a 49 percent increase in spending in the last decade. Have we seen a 49  percent increase in the quality of education or a 49 percent increase  in our infrastructure or our defense capability?   What we have seen is a 49 percent increase in bureaucracy and  government.   I would remind the gentleman that when we squander the people's  money, we rob them of the means to meet the disasters and unforeseen  circumstances that confront our country.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Flores), my friend and former chairman of the Republican Study  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I feel like I have to be Paul Harvey for a  second and talk about the rest of the story.   Because while what Mr. McClintock said was true about the initial  phases of the Reagan administration, at the end of the Reagan  administration, the national debt had almost tripled, and he had been  forced to raise taxes a couple of times in the interim.   So, again, we can argue about how positive cutting taxes were in the  Reagan administration, but the end result wasn't particularly good for  the American economy.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch), a distinguished member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch), a distinguished member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Vermont.    Mr. Chairman, in closing, I would just say that we need  to cut right to the chase.   It is unlikely that either the Republican Study Committee budget or  the Republican Budget Committee budget could pass this House. It  certainly couldn't pass the Congress.   This is all about moving the ball forward so we can push through a  massive tax cut to the wealthiest Americans, with 51 votes in the  Senate. That is what this day is about, and that is what this process  is about.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to reject both the Republican  Study Committee budget and the Republican Budget Committee budget, and  I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record letters of  support of the Republican Study Committee budget from the Committee for  a Responsible Federal Budget, the Council for Citizens Against  Government Waste, FreedomWorks, and Heritage Action for America.                                         Committee for a Responsible                                                  Federal Budget,                                                  September 8, 2017.      Hon. Mark Walker,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Walker: I am writing you to express our       appreciation for the fiscally responsible budget released by       the Republican Study Committee.        Your budget would make important progress by putting debt       on a downward path as a share of GDP, reducing it from 77       percent today to 56 percent by 2027--instead of letting it       rise to 89 percent as under current law.        By calling for spending cuts and entitlement reforms, your       budget helps to keep the national debt on a sustainable path.        We applaud the Republican Study Committee for your serious       contribution to the ongoing budget debate.            Sincerely,                                                Maya MacGuineas,                              President, Committee for a Responsible      Federal Budget.                                   ____                                        Council for Citizens Against                                                Government Waste,                                    Washington, DC, October 4, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: You will soon vote on several       different budget proposals for fiscal year (FY) 2018. On       behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of       the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW), I       urge you to support the budget resolution as reported by the       House Budget Committee and the Republican Study Committee's       (RSC) budget resolution, both of which would put the nation       back on the path to fiscal sanity and pave the way for       comprehensive, pro-growth tax reform.        Under the leadership of Chairman Diane Black (R-Tenn.), H.       Con. Res. 71, as reported by the House Budget Committee,       would reduce spending by $6.5 trillion over 10 years and       balance the budget by 2027. H. Con. Res. 71 provides       reconciliation instructions for fundamental tax reform that,       if enacted, will allow Americans to keep more of their money,       simplify the filing of taxes, and allow small businesses to       boost wages and create jobs. While H. Con. Res. 71 would       increase defense spending above Budget Control Act mandated       cap levels, this legislation also calls for $203 billion in       spending cuts across various programs and a $700 billion       reduction in improper payments.        The RSC budget enacts many of the same reforms as the House       Budget Committee's plan, but it proposes to reduce government       spending by $10 trillion over 10 years and achieves balance       in six years. The RSC plan creates a pathway for tax reform;       repeals and replaces Obamacare; makes Social Security       solvent; rescues Medicare and disability insurance; and       decreases FY 2018 non-discretionary spending to $394 billion.        Tax reform presents an historic opportunity to unleash the       economic potential of the American people. While Congress is       well-positioned to enact tax reform, that cannot occur until       a budget resolution with reconciliation instructions is       adopted. I urge  [[Page H7862]]       you to support both the House Budget Committee's FY 2018       budget resolution as reported and the RSC's FY 2018 budget       resolution. All votes on the FY 2018 budget resolutions will       be among those considered in CCAGW's 2017 Congressional       Ratings.            Sincerely,                                                        Tom Schatz,      President, CCAGW.                                   ____                      [From FreedomWorks, Oct. 4, 2017]        Key Vote Yes on the McClintock Amendment to H. Con. Res. 71         On behalf of FreedomWorks' activist community, I urge you       to contact your representative and ask him or her to vote YES       on the amendment offered by Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) to       H. Con. Res. 71, the budget resolution for FY 2018. The       amendment, which includes reconciliation instructions for       fundamental tax reform, is the Republican Study Committee's       FY 2018 budget alternative.        The Republican Study Committee's (RSC) FY 2018 budget would       reduce federal spending by more than $10 trillion over the       ten-year budget window, bringing the budget into balance in       FY 2023. The RSC's budget would repeal ObamaCare and enact       other patient-centered health insurance reforms, make Social       Security and Medicare solvent, and reform federal welfare       programs. It also promotes free trade, regulatory reform, and       other free market, limited government principles.        The current text of H. Con. Res. 71 and the McClintock       amendment include language that allows the House Ways and       Means Committee to produce legislation to reform the tax       code. Riddled with loopholes and special interest deductions,       America's tax code has become far too complex. According to       the Tax Foundation, Americans spent 8.9 billion hours and       $409 billion complying with the more than 74,000-page tax       code.        It has been more than 30 years since Congress passed       fundamental tax reform. Congress has a generational       opportunity to reform the tax code by consolidating and       lowering tax rates, broadening the tax base, and promoting       job creation and international competitiveness for American       businesses. This will make the tax code fairer and simplify       the filing process, allowing the vast majority of Americans       to file their taxes on a postcard.        FreedomWorks will count the vote on the McClintock       amendment to H. Con. Res. 71 on our 2017 Congressional       Scorecard. The scorecard is used to determine eligibility for       the FreedomFighter Award, which recognizes Members of the       House and Senate who consistently vote to support economic       freedom and individual liberty.            Sincerely,                                                      Adam Brandon,      President, FreedomWorks.                                   ____               [From Heritage Action for America, Oct. 3, 2017]       ``Yes'' on the RSC's Budget: Securing America's Future Economy                            (By Andrea Palermo)         On Thursday, the House will vote on the Fiscal Year 2018       (FY18) Budget offered by the Republican Study Committee (RSC)       as an amendment to the committee-approved FY18 budget       resolution. The RSC's Budget: Securing America's Future       Economy, introduced by RSC Budget and Spending Task Force       Chairman Tom McClintock (R-Calif.), would balance in 2023,       reduce non-defense discretionary spending, reestablish       national defense spending to support the military, break the       ``firewall'' between defense and nondefense discretionary       spending, fully repeal and replace Obamacare, repeal Dodd-      Frank by implementing the Financial CHOICE Act, reform       entitlement programs, and finally, enact pro-growth tax       reform. If passed, the RSC's budget would give lawmakers a       serious conservative blueprint for reform.        Pro-Growth Tax Reform. Republicans campaigned and promised       to fix America's broken tax code. The current code has become       a significant obstacle to economic growth, job creation and       higher wages for American workers. The RSC budget would       fulfill the Republican campaign promise by enacting tax       reform that cuts taxes for families, makes American       businesses competitive around the globe, ends double       taxation, and simplifies the code.        Repealing Obamacare. Republicans owe their majorities to       their unwavering opposition to Obamacare, a reality that is       reflected in the RSC's budget. The budget remains committed       to fully repealing the law despite recent Republican       failures, and sends a signal to the American people that       conservatives will continue to push for free-market, patient-      centered health care reforms.        Funding Defense. Although the Budget Control Act of 2011       has put significant pressure on our military, a conservative       budget would align military spending with strategic       priorities by breaking the firewall. The RSC's budget does       not rely on the much-discussed OCO gimmick, but increases       defense spending to a total of $668 billion in FY18, which is       $119 billion above the current defense cap. Importantly, that       cost is offset by lowering non-defense discretionary spending       to $394 billion in FY18, which is $122 billion below the cap.        Reforming Entitlements. The RSC's budget maintains the       Medicare premium support reforms, which are widely       established and broadly supported. In addition, the budget       lays down bold markers on Social Security, Social Security       Disability Insurance and Medicaid. It takes a similarly       aggressive approach on mandatory program spending like food       stamps (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP)       and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) by       building on the success of the 1996 welfare reforms and       enacting work requirements as outlined in the Welfare Reform       and Upward Mobility Act (H.R. 2832/S. 1290) and the       Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Reform Act (H.R.       2996).        Other important items in the budget include: Enacting the       Financial CHOICE Act, eliminating the Consumer Financial       Protection Bureau (CFPB), holding federal agencies       accountable, reducing funding for the Environmental       Protection Agency (EPA), separating food stamps and farm       programs, ending commodity subsidy programs, reforming crop       insurance, ending unconstitutional amnesty for illegal       immigrants, enforcing existing immigration laws, securing our       borders, delegating elementary and secondary education to       states and localities modeled after the Academic Partnership       Leads us to Success (A-PLUS) Act, reforming Higher Education       by passing the Higher Education Reform and Opportunity (HERO)       Act, eliminating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, returning       transportation and infrastructure policy to the states,       reorganizing the executive branch, and protecting the life of       the unborn.        Taken as a whole, the RSC's ``Securing America's Future       Economy'' demonstrates a seriousness of purpose when it comes       to governing. If passed, this budget would provide a fiscally       responsible path forward for our nation, limit the size and       scope of our bloated federal government, and unleash economic       prosperity for all Americans.    Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, Just a few steps from this Hall, Thomas  Jefferson addressed his first inaugural address. After listing all of  the blessings that our country enjoys, he asked what more do we need to  maintain a happy and prosperous society. He said: ``Still one thing  more, fellow citizens. A wise and frugal government, which shall  restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free  to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall  not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the  sum of good government. . . .''   We have it within our power to restore that wise and frugal  government and the prosperity and happiness that free societies always  produce the moment we summon the political will to do so. The  Republican Study Committee seeks that shining city on a hill and today  offers this map to get us there.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR.

SEC. 307. REINSTATEMENT OF PAY-AS-YOU-GO.         In the House, and pursuant to section 301(b)(8) of the       Congressional Budget Act of 1974, for the remainder of the       115th Congress, the following shall apply in lieu of       ``CUTGO'' rules and principles:        (1)(A) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), it       shall not be in order to consider any bill, joint resolution,       amendment, or conference report if the provisions of such       measure affecting direct spending and revenues have the net       effect of increasing the on-budget deficit or reducing the       on-budget surplus for the period comprising either--        (i) the current year, the budget year, and the four years       following that budget year; or  [[Page H7869]]         (ii) the current year, the budget year, and the nine years       following that budget year.        (B) The effect of such measure on the deficit or surplus       shall be determined on the basis of estimates made by the       Committee on the Budget.        (C) For the purpose of this section, the terms ``budget       year'', ``current year'', and ``direct spending'' have the       meanings specified in section 250 of the Balanced Budget and       Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, except that the term       ``direct spending'' shall also include provisions in       appropriation Acts that make outyear modifications to       substantive law as described in section 3(4)(C) of the       Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010.        (2) If a bill, joint resolution, or amendment is considered       pursuant to a special order of the House directing the Clerk       to add as a new matter at the end of such measure the       provisions of a separate measure as passed by the House, the       provisions of such separate measure as passed by the House       shall be included in the evaluation under paragraph (1) of       the bill, joint resolution, or amendment.        (3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the       evaluation under paragraph (1) shall exclude a provision       expressly designated as an emergency for purposes of pay-as-      you-go principles in the case of a point of order under this       clause against consideration of--        (i) bill or joint resolution;        (ii) an amendment made in order as original text by a       special order of business;        (iii) a conference report; or        (iv) an amendment between the Houses.        (B) In the case of an amendment (other than one specified       in subparagraph (A)) to a bill or joint resolution, the       evaluation under paragraph (1) shall give no cognizance to       any designation of emergency.        (C) If a bill, a joint resolution, an amendment made in       order as original text by a special order of business, a       conference report, or an amendment between the Houses       includes a provision expressly designated as an emergency for       purposes of pay-as-you-go principles, the Chair shall put the       question of consideration with respect thereto.       SEC. 308. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.         The House adopts the provisions of this title--        (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House of       Representatives and as such they shall be considered as part       of the rules of the House, and these rules shall supersede       other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent       with other such rules; and        (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of       the House of Representatives to change those rules at any       time, in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the       case of any other rule of the House of Representatives.                        TITLE IV--POLICY STATEMENTS       SEC. 401. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE                     COVERAGE FOR WORKING FAMILIES.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) Making health care coverage affordable and accessible       for all American families will improve their health and       financial security, which will make the economy stronger.        (2) Medicaid is the Nation's largest health insurance       program, providing quality, comprehensive, and affordable       coverage to more than 70 million vulnerable Americans,       including more than one in three children.        (3) Millions of low-income seniors and people with       disabilities rely on Medicaid to pay for nursing home care       and home- and community-based services that provide help with       activities of daily living.        (4) Medicaid coverage provides financial stability to       families struggling to escape poverty and to parents of       children with disabilities and special health care needs.        (5) The existing financing structure of Medicaid ensures       that Federal contributions keep pace with costs and enables       States to respond to changing needs, such as increased       enrollment in coverage during economic downturns or an aging       population that requires extensive long-term care services.        (6) Under the Affordable Care Act, 31 States and the       District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid eligibility to       low-income adults, including working parents who do not       receive coverage through their employers.        (7) Roughly 20 million previously uninsured people have       gained health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act,       reducing the Nation's uninsured rate for working-age adults       to one of the lowest levels on record.        (8) The law provides premium tax credits that vary by       income and the local cost of coverage and cost-sharing       assistance to help low- and middle-income families afford       quality insurance and pay their out-of-pocket costs.        (9) The law prohibits insurers from denying coverage or       charging higher premiums based on pre-existing conditions,       requires coverage of essential health benefits like maternity       care and prescription drugs, limits out-of-pocket costs, and       prohibits lifetime and annual limits on coverage.        (10) The law put in place significant cost-saving reforms       to Federal health programs that have played a part in slowing       the rate of healthcare spending growth in recent years, with       2011, 2012, and 2013 experiencing the slowest growth rates in       real per capita national health expenditures on record.        (11) On May 4, 2017, the House of Representatives passed       H.R.1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017, legislation       that would repeal provisions of the Affordable Care Act, make       deep cuts in Medicaid, and--        (A) result in 23 million Americans losing health insurance       in 2026, including 14 million people losing Medicaid;        (B) dramatically increase costs for older adults, low-      income families, and people with pre-existing conditions;        (C) reduce Medicaid spending by $834 billion over ten       years;        (D) jeopardize care for seniors in nursing homes, children       with disabilities, and families receiving Medicaid benefits       as States look to reduce coverage and services;        (E) severely undermine access to substance abuse treatment       during the nationwide opioid epidemic;        (F) shorten the life of the Medicare Hospital Insurance       Trust Fund; and        (G) provide nearly $1 trillion in tax cuts that mostly       benefit millionaires, billionaires, and wealthy corporations.        (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that--        (1) Congress should build upon the progress of the       Affordable Care Act to make health care coverage more       affordable and accessible to all American families, and       reject any measures to repeal or undermine the law;        (2) the Administration and Congress should fully implement,       enforce, and fund the Affordable Care Act, and stop any       efforts to sabotage the health insurance marketplaces; and        (3) Congress should preserve Medicaid and not dismantle it       by converting Medicaid into a block grant, per capita cap, or       other financing arrangement that would limit Federal       contributions and render the program incapable of responding       to increased need that may result from trends in demographics       or health care costs or from economic conditions.       SEC. 402. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON TAX REFORM THAT PROVIDES                     SUPPORT AND RELIEF TO HARDWORKING AMERICAN                     FAMILIES.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) Tax plans from House Republicans and President Trump       prioritize tax cuts for millionaires, billionaires, and       wealthy corporations, while shifting more of the burden onto       everyone else. Their plans fail to close special interest       loopholes in the tax code, and even add trillions of dollars       of new loopholes for the wealthy. These plans reflect the       failed theory of ``trickle-down'' economics, which creates       few jobs and instead leads to massive deficits. A return to       these policies would--        (A) fail to create good paying middle-class jobs;        (B) do nothing to help low-income or middle-class       households with the rising costs of health care, education,       housing, child care, or retirement; and        (C) widen the income gap between millionaires and       billionaires and the middle class.        (2) Americans today are working harder than ever, but       continue to struggle to find good jobs, get ahead, and stay       ahead. This is part of a four-decade trend of stagnant wages       for middle-class and low-income households, even as       millionaires and billionaires become richer and corporations       reap massive profits.        (3) The Obama Administration ended with 83 consecutive       months of private-sector job growth, but challenges still       remain to create more good-paying jobs and broadly shared       prosperity. The number of long-term unemployed remains       elevated, and unemployment for people of color continues to       be higher than the rest of the population. Many areas remain       in need of well-paying jobs.        (4) By almost any metric, the middle class has seen little       to no improvements in their incomes. Real median household       income in 2013 was only $7,000 higher than it was in 1979.       Median weekly real earnings for workers increased less than 1       percent from 1979 to 2014. Poorer workers have done even       worse. For workers in the lower half of the income scale,       real annual wages from 1979 to 2014 grew only $76. And the       entire lower 50 percent of the United States population holds       a mere 1 percent of total national wealth.        (5) All the while, millionaires and billionaires have seen       their incomes and wealth skyrocket. Incomes for the top one       percent of households grew five times as fast as for middle-      income workers, and now average over $1 million a year. CEOs       make nearly 300 times what the typical worker does. Ten       percent of the population owns 76 percent of the Nation's       total wealth, and the average net assets of the top one       percent now exceed $10 million per person.        (6) The top one percent of households receives a       disproportionate share--17 percent--of the benefit of major       tax expenditures. This uneven distribution of major tax       expenditures has exacerbated income and wealth inequality.       The tax code treats income from wealth more favorably than       income from work by giving preferential tax rates on unearned       income, and it contains numerous, wasteful tax breaks for       special interests.        (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House to responsibly       reform the tax code to provide support and relief to low- and       middle-income families, create good-paying jobs, and drive       broadly-shared prosperity, while closing special-interest       loopholes and making sure the wealthiest Americans pay their       fair share.       SEC. 403. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON DEFENSE AND NONDEFENSE                     FUNDING INCREASES.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:  [[Page H7870]]         (1) The current spending limits set by the Budget Control       Act of 2011 are too low, for both defense and nondefense       funding. Defense and nondefense investments must be at       appropriate levels to protect both national security and       economic security. The nondefense discretionary spending       limit for 2018 is $2 billion less than it was in 2016, in       nominal terms, representing a significant cut to purchasing       power. If the inflation rate is what the Congressional Budget       Office projects, the 2018 cap represents a reduction of       nearly $30 billion compared with 2016. Defense spending faces       similar reductions.        (2) The Budget Control Act of 2011 is based on parity for       defense and nondefense spending, setting up separate caps for       both and instituting a ``firewall'' to prevent reductions in       one category because of increases in the other.        (3) Bipartisan agreement has provided a solution to the       austerity-level caps before, and can be used again to change       these arbitrary spending caps to prevent the harsh impact of       massive, irresponsible cuts to important Federal programs.        (4) Congress must begin discussions and negotiations       immediately, to raise the caps to appropriate levels, and       maintain parity between defense and nondefense.        (b) Policy on Defense and Nondefense Funding Increases.--It       is the policy of the House that Congress should enact       increases to the current defense and nondefense spending       limits, in equal amounts, without using reductions in one       category to pay for increases in the other.       SEC. 404. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON IMMIGRATION REFORM.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) Fixing the country's broken immigration system will       mean safer communities, a stronger economy and lower budget       deficits.        (2) The Congressional Budget Office estimated that enacting       the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration       Modernization Act, as introduced by House Democrats in the       113th Congress, would have reduced the deficit by $900       billion over the next 2 decades, boosting the economy by 5.4       percent, and increasing productivity by 1.0 percent.        (3) The Social Security Actuary estimated that immigration       reform will reduce the Social Security shortfall by 8 percent       and will extend the life of the Social Security Trust Fund by       2 years.        (4) The United States is a Nation founded, built and       sustained by immigrants, and the Congress has a       responsibility to harness the power of that tradition by       implementing an effective and fair immigration policy.        (5) The current immigration system is broken because it       keeps families of legal immigrants and United States citizens       separated for decades, it allows for the exploitation of       undocumented workers to the detriment of all workers, it does       not meet the needs of our economy and discourages legal       immigration, and it keeps millions of hard-working, law-      abiding families who have lived in our communities for       decades hiding in the shadows, including many thousands who       came to the United States as infants or young children.        (6) Overly aggressive immigration enforcement that focuses       on individuals with deep ties to the United States hurts       State and local law enforcement efforts to establish and       maintain trust with immigrant communities. The number of       Latinos reporting crimes in big cities across the country is       lower than past years, particularly among domestic violence       and sexual assault victims.        (7) The vast majority of individuals in U.S. Immigration       and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody have not been convicted       of a serious crime. ICE's own statistics demonstrate that       arrests of people with no criminal record increased 157       percent in the first 100 days of the Trump Administration,       and only 6.5 percent of those arrested were convicted of       violent crimes.        (8) The number of detained asylum seekers continues to rise       dramatically and detaining asylum seekers, other vulnerable       populations, and those who do not pose risks to public safety       is unnecessary and wasteful.        (9) Increasing the use of alternatives to detention rather       than expanding immigration detention would be more humane and       cost-effective.        (10) It has been nearly four years since the Senate passed,       on a bipartisan basis, its comprehensive immigration reform       bill.        (11) Immigration reform is needed to secure the sovereignty       of the United States of America and to establish a coherent       and just system for integrating those who seek to join       American society.        (12) A successful immigration system cannot rely on border       security alone. The country needs a system that promotes the       reunification of families, protects workers and is responsive       to the needs of employers, and implements an inclusive       legalization program for those who are currently here.        (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that Congress       enact comprehensive immigration reform - such as the Border       Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization       Act, introduced by House Democrats in the 113th Congress - to       boost our economy, lower deficits, establish clear and just       rules for citizenship, and make our communities safer.       SEC. 405. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON SOCIAL SECURITY.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) Most of the 61 million Americans who currently receive       earned Social Security benefits rely on these benefits for       the majority of their income, with nearly a quarter of them       relying on Social Security for at least 90 percent of their       income.        (2) In the past, Social Security benefits were part of a 3-      legged stool where retirees relied on a combination of Social       Security, a private pension, and personal savings to finance       retirement.        (3) Social Security benefits will be more important to       future retirees as few workers will receive traditional       pensions, and many workers cannot afford to adequately fund       their retirement through employer-sponsored savings plans or       IRAs.        (4) Social Security's Disability Insurance (DI) and Old Age       and Survivors Insurance (OASI) systems are intertwined both       in their benefit structure and in their revenues - DI       recipients who reach retirement age receive OASI benefits and       beneficiaries in each category have helped finance the other       category even if they will never receive those benefits.        (5) Social Security benefits are already being cut as       Social Security's normal retirement age is increasing from 66       years for workers retiring now to 67 years for those born in       1960 and later. This cut disproportionately impacts low-      earners because life expectancy continues to increase among       higher-earners but not low-earners. Thus, high-earners will       generally receive benefits for a longer time than low-      earners.        (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that the House       of Representatives will not adopt changes to Social Security       that involve reductions in earned Social Security benefits.       SEC. 406. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON PROTECTING THE MEDICARE                     GUARANTEE FOR SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH                     DISABILITIES.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) Senior citizens and persons with disabilities highly       value the Medicare program and rely on Medicare to guarantee       their health and financial security.        (2) In 2018, 60,000,000 people will rely on Medicare for       coverage of hospital stays, physician visits, prescription       drugs, and other necessary medical goods and services.        (3) The Medicare program has lower administrative costs       than private insurance, and Medicare costs per enrollee have       grown at a slower rate than private insurance for a given       level of benefits.        (4) People with Medicare already have the ability to choose       a private insurance plan within Medicare through the Medicare       Advantage option, yet two-thirds of Medicare beneficiaries       chose the traditional fee-for-service program instead of a       private plan in 2016.        (5) Rising health care costs are not unique to Medicare or       other Federal health programs, they are endemic to the entire       health care system.        (6) Converting Medicare into a voucher for the purchase of       health insurance will merely force seniors and individuals       with disabilities to pay much higher premiums if they want to       use their voucher to purchase traditional Medicare coverage.        (7) A voucher system in which the voucher payment fails to       keep pace with growth in health costs would expose seniors       and persons with disabilities on fixed incomes to       unacceptable financial risks.        (8) Shifting more health care costs onto Medicare       beneficiaries would not reduce overall health care costs,       instead it would mean beneficiaries would face higher       premiums, eroding coverage, or both.        (9) Versions of voucher policies that do not immediately       end the traditional Medicare program will merely set it up       for a death spiral as private plans siphon off healthier and       less expensive beneficiaries, leaving the sickest       beneficiaries in a program that will wither away.        (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that the       Medicare guarantee for seniors and persons with disabilities       should be preserved and strengthened, and that any       legislation to end the Medicare guarantee, financially       penalize people for choosing traditional Medicare, or shift       rising health care costs onto seniors by replacing Medicare       with vouchers or premium support for the purchase of health       insurance, should be rejected.       SEC. 407. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON FINANCIAL STABILITY AND                     CONSUMER PROTECTION.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer       Protection Act of 2010 is an important component of the       country's response to the financial crisis and recession. It       took a number of steps to protect consumers of financial       products and services as well as protect taxpayers from the       costs of another financial crisis.        (2) These steps included the creation of an orderly       liquidation process to allow regulators to close failing       institutions that some argue are ``too big to fail,'' as well       as a new Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), an       Office of Financial Research to monitor the stability of our       financial system, and the Consumer Financial Protection       Bureau (the Consumer Bureau).        (3) The Consumer Bureau plays a critical role in protecting       older Americans, military service members, student loan       borrowers, and other consumers, especially in minority and       low-income communities. It has implemented new rules for       mortgage markets and prepaid cards, and also successfully       recovered nearly $12 billion on behalf of more than 29       million consumers and service members.  [[Page H7871]]         (4) The Consumer Bureau's funding from the Federal       Reserve's operations help give it important independence from       efforts to interfere with its vital mission and activities,       independence on par with every other banking regulator.        (5) The Consumer Bureau has already faced and overcome       efforts to obstruct its operations.        (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that Congress       should continue to support the vital work of the Consumer       Financial Protection Bureau as well as its governing and       financing structures and other key components of the Dodd-      Frank legislation such as orderly liquidation authority,       FSOC, and the Office of Financial Research.       SEC. 408. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON WOMEN'S ECONOMIC                     EMPOWERMENT.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) Women's contributions are critical to the economic       success of hard-working families.        (2) Not only do women play a key role in maintaining       healthy families, they also have unique health care needs and       face issues that require special focus.        (3) Every hard-working American deserves to feel safe and       supported during retirement. Yet women are more likely to       face financial risk during retirement because of their lower       lifetime earnings and disproportionate role as family       caregivers.        (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that Congress       should economically empower women and protect their health       and safety. Congress must enact policies that would       accomplish the following:        (1) Help families attain better jobs, fight pay inequity,       raise the minimum wage, and enable women entrepreneurs and       small businesses to achieve their goals.        (2) Give American families control of their own lives, and       help them balance the demands of work and family. These       policies include paid and expanded family and medical leave,       paid sick days, and quality, affordable child care.        (3) Strengthen the retirement security of women and their       families by protecting Social Security, Medicare and       Medicaid.        (4) Support caregivers, many of whom sacrifice their own       careers to provide for family members.        (5) Maintain health insurance protections for women,       increase funding for the prevention and treatment of women's       health issues such as breast cancer and heart disease, and       support access to full reproductive care.        (6) Prevent and protect women from domestic violence and       sexual abuse.       SEC. 409. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON NATIONAL SECURITY.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) The country faces many national security challenges and       we must continue to support a strong military that is second       to none.        (2) Those who serve in uniform are our most important       security resource and the Administration and Congress shall       continue to provide the support they need to successfully       carry out the missions the country gives them.        (3) A growing economy is the foundation of our security and       enables the country to provide the resources for a strong       military, sound homeland security agencies, and effective       diplomacy and international development.        (4) Austerity-level spending caps threaten adequate       investment in activities critical to our economy and national       security, which include activities funded by both the defense       and nondefense portions of the discretionary budget.        (5) Diplomacy and foreign aid are essential components of       our security and the President's proposal to cut these       activities by 32 percent below current levels prompted more       than 120 retired admirals and generals who have first-hand       knowledge of their effectiveness in securing our Nation to       forcefully object.        (6) The Nation's projected long-term debt could have       serious consequences for our economy and security, and that       more efficient military spending has to be part of an overall       plan that effectively deals with this problem.        (7) Reining in wasteful spending at the Nation's security       agencies, including the Department of Defense--the last       department still unable to pass an audit--such as the       elimination of duplicative programs and better controlling       delays and cost overruns on weapon systems that have been       identified by the Government Accountability Office (GAO)       needs to continue as a priority.        (8) The Department of Defense should continue to review       defense plans and requirements to ensure that weapons       developed to counter Cold War-era threats are not redundant,       are affordable, and are applicable to 21st century threats;       and such review should include, with the participation of the       National Nuclear Security Administration, examination of       requirements for, and cost of, the nuclear weapons stockpile,       nuclear weapons delivery systems, and nuclear weapons and       infrastructure modernization.        (9) Nonwar operation and maintenance costs per active-duty       service member have grown at a rate well above inflation for       decades--from $59,000 per service member in 1980 to $157,000       per service member in 2015 (measured in constant 2017       dollars), and it is imperative that unsustainable cost growth       be controlled in this area.        (10) Cooperative threat reduction and other       nonproliferation programs (securing ``loose nukes'' and other       materials used in weapons of mass destruction), which were       highlighted as high priorities by the 9/11 Commission, need       to be funded at a level that is commensurate with the       evolving threat.        (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that--        (1) the austerity-level spending caps required by the       Budget Control Act of 2011 for fiscal years 2018 through 2021       should be rescinded and replaced by a fiscal plan that is       balanced and takes into account a comprehensive national       security strategy that includes careful consideration of       international, defense, homeland security, and law       enforcement programs; and        (2) efficiencies can be achieved in the national defense       budget without compromising our security through greater       emphasis on eliminating duplicative and wasteful programs,       reforming the acquisition process, identifying and       constraining unsustainable operating costs, and through       careful analysis of our national security needs.       SEC. 410. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) continues to       face challenges meeting the needs of the next generation of       returning veterans, including sufficient funding to provide       critical services and benefits.        (2) Access to quality health care and veterans' benefits       has been an ongoing challenge for the VA, highlighted most       recently in the ongoing claims backlog and veterans waiting       months for health care appointments.        (3) Providing health care where veterans live and ensuring       a sufficient number of health care professionals, especially       in the area of mental health treatment, have also been       challenges.        (4) The VA has made progress in reducing the number of       initial benefit claims, dropping the claims backlog to less       than 94,000 from a peak of 611,000 claims just a few years       ago, but that statistic leaves out the many veterans who are       still waiting many months or even years to have their appeals       decided.        (5) The President's budget includes a 6 percent increase       over current-year funding but shifts funding away from       critical programs that veterans rely on in favor of expanded       funding that pays for certain veterans to get private health       care at the expense of care provided at VA hospitals and       clinics.        (6) The President's budget also cuts funding from other       Federal agencies that provide lifesaving programs and       services for veterans, including deep cuts to Medicaid       benefits veterans rely on, the elimination of the Interagency       Council on Homelessness, steep cuts at the Department of       Housing and Urban Development, elimination of the Legal       Services Corporation, and severe cuts to entrepreneurship       outreach programs targeted to veterans through the Small       Business Administration.        (7) The VA currently has advance appropriations for       approximately 85 percent of its discretionary budget. The       residual 15 percent, which includes funding for the day-to-      day operations at the Veterans Benefits Administration,       remains vulnerable to a Government shutdown.        (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that--        (1) Congress should support a funding level no less than       the President's request for veterans' discretionary programs       so that the VA has the resources it needs to ensure veterans       get the health care and benefits they earned in a timely       fashion;        (2) Congress should lift the austerity-level funding cap on       nondefense programs for 2018 and beyond to ensure adequate       funding for veterans' programs;        (3) advance appropriations be expanded to cover all of VA's       discretionary budget to prevent delays in veterans' benefits       and services during a Government shutdown;        (4) the VA submit along with its annual budget a ``Future-      Years Veterans Program'' that projects its needs over five       years to help facilitate the appropriations and oversight       processes;        (5) Congress should provide sufficient resources for the       VA's Office of the Inspector General to guarantee veterans       are properly served and that resources are spent efficiently;        (6) no changes be made to the Individual Unemployability       benefit to ensure that disabled veterans, many of them       severely disabled, who are deemed unable to engage in       substantial work as a result of their service to our country,       continue to receive the full disability and social security       benefits they earned and were promised; and        (7) Congress shall provide sufficient funding and staff       resources for VA hospitals and clinics, and that any       increased funding for private and community care not provided       directly by the VA should not come at the expense of       necessary resources for VA hospitals and clinics.       SEC. 411. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON DISASTER RESPONSE FUNDING.         (a) Findings.--The House find the following:        (1) Natural disasters such as hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and       Maria require swift congressional action to help storm       survivors get their lives back on track, rebuild disaster-      stricken communities, and prevent further damage to the       economy.        (2) The Budget Control Act of 2001 provides procedural       tools specifically to respond to  [[Page H7872]]       natural disasters, by allowing adjustments to the spending       caps for disaster and emergency spending.        (3) Mitigation and prevention is an important part of       disaster recovery and response, providing investments that       make future disasters less costly in terms of both dollars       and lives.        (b) Policy on Funding for Disaster Response and Recovery.--      It is the policy of the House that Congress should act       swiftly to assist with recovery from hurricanes and other       natural disasters. Such funding should be provided using the       budgetary provisions in place for this purpose: providing       adjustments to the spending caps for disaster and emergency       response, recovery, and mitigation. Congress must also       support efforts to address future disaster damage and loss,       by appropriately funding mitigation and prevention efforts.       SEC. 412. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) The Federal workforce provides vital services to our       Nation on a daily basis. It includes those who patrol and       secure our borders, protect us from terrorists, take care of       our veterans, help run our airports, counter cyber-attacks,       find cures for deadly diseases, and keep our food supply       safe.        (2) Veterans make up 31 percent of the Federal workforce.        (3) Many Federal workers are paid at a rate that is far       below their private sector counterparts.        (4) The Federal workforce is older than in past decades and       older than the private sector workforce. Nearly one third of       the Federal workforce is eligible to retire.        (5) Federal employee pay and benefits are not the cause of       the country's deficits and debt. The Federal workforce has       already contributed more than $180 billion toward reducing       the country's deficits in the form of pay freezes, pay raises       insufficient to keep pace with inflation, furloughs, and       increased retirement contributions. The President's budget       for 2018 continues to unfairly target the Federal workforce       by proposing an additional $149 billion in compensation and       retirement benefit cuts.        (6) Since 1975, the Federal workforce has declined 35       percent relative to the size of the population of the United       States.        (7) Nearly all of the increase in the Federal civilian       workforce from 2001 to 2016 is due to increases at security-      related agencies, including the Department of Defense,       Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Veterans       Affairs.        (8) Proposals to reduce the size of the workforce at       nonsecurity agencies by 10 percent have excluded an       assessment of their impact on government services.        (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that Congress       should not target Federal employees to achieve further       reductions in the deficit as they have already contributed       more than their fair share, that Federal workers should be       compensated with pay and benefits at a level that enables the       government to attract high quality people--which is       especially important during this period when more workers       will be retiring--and that no proposal to reduce the size of       the workforce should be considered without an assessment of       its impact on government services.       SEC. 413. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON CLIMATE CHANGE SCIENCE.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) Global climate change is a threat to national security,       public health, and economic growth.        (2) The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate       Change concluded that the effects of climate change are       occurring worldwide, stating: ``The impacts of climate change       have already been felt in recent decades on all continents       and across the oceans''.        (3) The United States Government Accountability Office       described climate change as, ``a complex, crosscutting issue       that poses risks to many environmental and economic systems--      including agriculture, infrastructure, ecosystems, and human       health--and presents a significant financial risk to the       Federal Government''.        (4) In March 2017, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, in       written testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee,       stated that ``climate change can be a driver of instability       and the Department of Defense must pay attention to potential       adverse impacts generated by this phenomenon''.        (5) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and       National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that       2016 was the warmest year on record, setting a new record for       global average surface temperatures for the third year in a       row. Furthermore, 16 of the 17 warmest years on record have       occurred since 2001.        (6) The United States National Research Council's National       Climate Assessment and Development Advisory Committee found       climate change affects ``human health, water supply,       agriculture, transportation, energy, coastal areas, and many       other sectors of society, with increasingly adverse impacts       on the American economy and quality of life''.        (7) The most vulnerable among us, including children, the       elderly, low-income individuals, and those with underlying       health conditions, face even greater health risks as a result       of climate change.        (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that climate       change presents a significant public health, environmental,       and financial risk to the United States. The United States       must continue to play a leadership role on climate change       policy and should not retreat from global commitments on       climate change. Congress must provide robust funding for       climate change science, which provides critical information       for protecting human health, defending the United States, and       preserving economic and environmental systems throughout the       world.       SEC. 414. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON INCREASED EFFICIENCY AND                     ELIMINATING WASTE.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) The Government Accountability Office (``GAO'')       identifies examples of waste, duplication, and overlap in       Federal programs, and makes regular recommendations regarding       ways to reduce costs and increase revenue.        (2) The Comptroller General has stated that addressing the       identified waste, duplication, and overlap in Federal       programs ``could lead to tens of billions of dollars of       additional savings, with significant opportunities for       improved efficiencies, cost savings, or revenue enhancements       in the areas of defense, information technology, education       and training, health care, energy, and tax enforcement.''        (3) The tax gap, the difference between taxes owed and       taxes paid, now averages $458 billion annually. Even modest       improvements in enforcing existing law could yield a boost in       revenue without any changes to the tax code.        (4) Tax expenditures, or spending through the tax code,       total $1.5 trillion per year and represent the largest       category of spending in the budget -- exceeding Medicare,       Medicaid, and Social Security. However, unlike other types of       spending, tax expenditures are not reviewed in any systematic       way in the annual budget process.        (5) Improper payments, payments that should not have been       made or that were made in an incorrect amount, totaled $144       billion for 2016. While some improper payments are the result       of fraud, the vast majority are due to unintentional errors,       such as payments to eligible beneficiaries that were not       properly verified, or overpayments or underpayments because       of a data entry mistake.        (6) Shutting down the government, arbitrarily cutting       agency budgets, and funding large portions of the government       through stop-gap appropriations do not lead to efficient and       effective government.        (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the House that Congress       must continue to root out wasteful spending, make government       operations more efficient, pass appropriations bills on time,       and avoid costly government shutdowns. Congress must task       agencies with shrinking the error rate in government programs       and provide adequate budgetary resources for agencies to       develop new processes, review expenditures, and improve       information technology systems.       SEC. 415. POLICY OF THE HOUSE ON THE INVESTIGATION OF RUSSIAN                     INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016 U.S. PRESIDENTIAL                     ELECTION.         (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:        (1) Free and fair elections are the cornerstone of our       democracy, and foreign interference in them undermines the       public trust and casts doubt on the legitimacy of our       government.        (2) The country's intelligence agencies all agree that       Russia launched a campaign to undermine the 2016 U.S.       presidential election, which included cyber-attacks,       dissemination of false information, and other intelligence       operations to malign Secretary Hillary Clinton and increase       the odds of a Donald Trump presidency.        (3) Members of the Trump campaign had repeated contact with       Russian government officials and oligarchs and then failed to       report this contact in testimony to Congress and in security       clearance applications. One such meeting reportedly included       a request for a back-channel line of communications with the       Russian government using Russian facilities, which would       preclude U.S. Government oversight. Another involved a       Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer and a former Soviet       counterintelligence officer under the assumption that they       would provide politically damaging information about       Secretary Hillary Clinton as part of the Russian government's       effort to support the Trump campaign.        (4) Under the direction of Federal Bureau of Investigation       Director James Comey, the FBI was investigating whether       members of President Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to       influence the election.        (5) On May 9, 2017, President Trump fired FBI Director       Comey and then made statements suggesting his dismissal was       to stop the investigation of collusion.        (6) On May 17, 2017, the Department of Justice announced       the appointment of former FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III       to serve as Special Counsel to investigate Russian       interference into the 2016 presidential election and any       coordination between the Russian government and individuals       associated with the Trump campaign.        (b) Policy on the Investigation of Russian Interference in       the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election.--It is the policy of       this concurrent resolution that to restore confidence in our       government and to preserve the sanctity of our electoral       process, Congress must ensure adequate funding for the  [[Page H7873]]       Special Counsel appointed by the Department of Justice so       that he can perform a thorough and nonpartisan investigation       of Russia's campaign to affect the 2016 U.S. presidential       election and any individuals in the United States that may       have colluded in those efforts.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 553, the gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth) and a Member opposed each will control 15  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, Democrats and Republicans are looking at the same  challenges facing our country and American families. Education,  healthcare, and housing costs have all increased while wages stay  stagnant.   It used to be that the two parties would debate different strategies  to address the problems facing the American people. Sadly, those times  are behind us.   In giving millionaires, including the majority of this Congress, the  President, and wealthy donors a giant tax cut, the Republican budget  does not even pretend to address the problems facing the American  people. Not only does it ignore working families, it increases their  challenges.   The Democratic budget alternative, in stark contrast to the  Republican budget, begins to address the real challenges our country  faces now and in the long term.                                time  1015    We are less than a decade removed from the worst economic crisis in  most of our lifetimes, and we have a chance to rebound in a way that  builds a foundation for our country to thrive for generations, but we  have to seize that opportunity.   Rather than giving resources to people and businesses that already  have them, we are calling for targeted investments in programs that  grow our economy, create good-paying jobs, and provide real support for  working families and real security in retirement.   Rather than sending thank-you notes to the corporations that bankroll  campaigns, we have an opportunity to make vital public investments that  lead to a brighter future rebuilding roads, bridges, and other critical  infrastructure, all of which lead to good jobs now and in the long run.   Rather than giving the President a multimillion-dollar refund on  taxes he refuses to disclose, we can invest in retirement security for  seniors who didn't inherit millions. We can invest in affordable  education so young people do not have to grow up wealthy to have a shot  at earning it in their future careers.   Instead of taking healthcare away from people, straining emergency  rooms, and making Americans sicker, we have an opportunity to continue  investing in affordable quality healthcare for all of us, finally  eliminating a great burden on American families, a burden that no other  developed nation shares.   This budget is an opportunity for our country to invest in our  future, and if we adopt the Republican budget plan, we will have  squandered it.   Democrats believe in a government that prioritizes American families,  and they should be the priorities of this Congress. I, therefore, urge  my colleagues to oppose the Republican budget and support the  Democratic alternative.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Jeffries), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), a distinguished member of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), a distinguished member of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), a distinguished member of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Nolan), a distinguished member of the Agriculture  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a distinguished member of the Budget  Committee.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from  Kentucky for his astute analysis on what the American people really  want. I thank the manager, the chairwoman of this bill, and I  acknowledge the position that they take.   But what America really wants is for Washington, for America, for the  government, to stand by them in their time of need.   I am very grateful to be part of a party that is not about politics  but is about values. We are the better choice party. We offer a better  deal on this project that we have worked so hard on called the American  budget.   The American budget, in contrast to our friends on the other side of  the aisle, recognizes, as I visited the National Institutes for Health,  that 80 percent of their budget that we are going to lose goes for  research and researchers--looking those researchers in the eyes when  they explain the research in medical science to help save lives, and to  know that the Republican budget cuts the NIH, the Centers for Disease  Control, and takes up the TrumpCare that cuts trillions in Medicaid and  $500 billion in Medicare. That is the story of this bill.   Then, as my good friend from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) indicated, we  invest in infrastructure, and we help this young man, not only with his  healthcare but with education. Do we realize how many jobs go unable to  find individuals in this country? Hundreds of thousands because of the  lack of training.    So if my friends want growth, you know how you get growth? You invest  in the American people. Or you tell the American people when tragedies  strike, whether it is the Virgin Islands, or Puerto Rico, or Florida,  or Texas, or tragically, in Nevada, that you will stand by them. You  provide them with the infrastructure to be able to overcome.   Not the Republican budget, because the Republican budget is giving  trillions in tax cuts, and the distribution of those moneys will not  see the front door of low-income, moderate-income, middle class working  Americans.   That is the distinction between the Democratic budget. It increases  opportunity through a higher minimum wage. It believes in equal pay for  equal work. It knows that immigration reform will bring in billions of  dollars. It will create opportunities for work.   Then, of course, we know that the Democratic budget strengthens our  healthcare, and it provides that her Social Security, her Medicare,  will not be in jeopardy. The Medicare trust fund will not lose with a  Republican budget and the trillions of dollars of tax cuts, her life,  as she continues to seek some balance of good life will be lost.   We are the right direction. We are for the American people. We are  standing by the American people with the Democratic budget. I ask my  colleagues to vote for the Democratic alternative.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, in closing, it is clear that we have a very different  budget and a very different understanding of the challenges facing our  country. We see that so many Americans are working harder and longer  and can't remember the last time they got a raise.   We know families are worried about how to pay for college, or if  their parents' retirement is secure, or if they will ever be able to  afford to stop working. And we know that trillions of dollars in tax  cuts for millionaires and large corporations will turn these fears of  hardworking Americans families into reality.                                time  1045    Just a few minutes ago, my Republican colleague from Ohio talked  about what the American people want. On many of those things, we agree.  But I know one thing the American people don't want. They don't want  massive tax cuts for the top 1 percent of Americans.   The Democratic budget rejects tax cuts for the wealthy. We invest in  programs that will grow our economy, create good-paying jobs, provide  real support for working families and real security in retirement. We  make education  [[Page H7879]]  and childcare more affordable, and we support policies to help every  American get the healthcare that they need.   Those are the priorities of our budget, and they are the priorities  of the American people.   I, therefore, urge my colleagues to support the Democratic  alternative, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.

The Acting CHAIR (Mrs. Walorski). Pursuant to the rule, it is now in  order to consider a final period of general debate, which shall not  exceed 10 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chair and  ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget.   The gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black) and the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth) each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee.    Madam Chairwoman, I yield myself 4 minutes.   Madam Chairwoman, I suppose I should be saying thank you. I will get  a huge tax cut under the Republican tax cut plan, as well the majority  of those people sitting here--the majority of our colleagues in  Congress--who are, like me, fortunate enough to be millionaires  already.   Forgive me if I am in no mood to say thank you, because I was elected  not just to represent millionaires, but to represent aspiring  millionaires, working families, seniors, and veterans. For all of them,  for anyone who isn't already a millionaire, this budget is a slap in  the face.   With all of the problems facing our country right now, all the people  struggling to get ahead, it is unfathomable to me that this Congress  could look at people like me and say: Hey, that guy, let's give him  more money. In fact, let's give all millionaires hundreds of thousands  of dollars in tax cuts.   Really, I am small potatoes. President Trump, according to his  financial disclosure, will get hundreds of millions of dollars in tax  cuts.   Where is all that money coming from? If you are listening to this and  you are not a millionaire, probably from you.   To pay for our own tax cuts and the tax cuts for wealthy donors,  Republicans are going to increase taxes on 45 percent of American  families with children. That is just the start. Seniors, people with  disabilities, and low-income families will see their healthcare cut.   Poor seniors will lose benefits that help them keep food on the table  and their homes heated in the winter. Veteran benefits, meals for  hungry schoolchildren, programs that make education affordable and job  training available, investments that generate economic growth and  create good-paying jobs are all at risk in this budget.   They are also cutting corporate tax rates, which we will be paying  for by plunging our Nation into deeper and deeper debt, giving  multinational giants another advantage over small- and mid-size  businesses in the name of perpetuating the myth of supply-side  economics.   Supply-side failed. They renamed it trickle-down, but nothing  trickled down. Now it is job creators. When that fails, maybe they will  call it ``I get mine now; you get yours later--maybe.'' But whatever  they name it, it is a sham. This plan is a hoax on the American people,  and it will make most people's lives more difficult.   So forgive me if I am in no mood to say thank you for the extra money  in my pocket. With millions of Americans struggling and scraping to get  ahead, and with my tax cut increasing their challenges, I cannot begin  to justify my extra money, and, quite frankly, I cannot fathom how my  Republican colleagues are able to justify theirs.   With this budget, Republicans aren't just passing the buck, they are  pocketing it. Madam Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no''  on the Republican budget.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Pelosi), the distinguished minority leader.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
