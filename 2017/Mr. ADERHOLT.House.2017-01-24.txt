 Madam Speaker, I know our time is short. I just want to  say that this bill signifies our staunch support for life, and in spite  of what has all been said, it just simply prevents taxpayer funds from  being used to pay for abortions.   For years our government has had a patchwork approach to this issue.  However, this bill, H.R. 7, would create a clear and unified policy  across all Federal agencies.   Our Founding Fathers set forth in the Declaration of Independence  ``that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their  Creator with certain unalienable Rights.'' One of those unalienable  rights is life. Therefore, it follows that the right to life of each  human being should be preserved and protected.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
