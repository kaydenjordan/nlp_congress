 Madam President, as you have heard from my colleagues  before me, there are serious concerns about the job-killing resolution  that we will be voting on this evening and the effects it will have on  our solar industry and American workers.   For years, solar has been a growing source of clean, low-cost energy  and economic development in States all across our Nation. And it is a  source of jobs--good-paying, union jobs--right here in the United  States.   America's domestic solar industry is made up of more than 10,000  businesses--large and small--located in every single State, employing  over 250,000 Americans. I will repeat that: employing over 250,000  Americans. In fact, my State of Nevada has the most solar jobs per  capita of any other State in this great Nation.   When we talk about the solar industry, we are talking about an  industry that is generating hundreds of thousands of American jobs and  supporting American workers, while at the same time helping us to  transition to clean renewable energy.   Thanks to historic investments we secured in the bipartisan  infrastructure law and the Inflation Reduction Act, the American solar  industry is experiencing an unprecedented boom.   Last year, a new solar project was installed in the United States  every 44 seconds and, in fact, the demand is only expected to increase.  This is only going to create more jobs and help make us more energy  independent.   For example, the average solar installer in Reno, NV, makes about  $80,000 a year. It is a good job. That is a job that lets a family pay  their rent, buy groceries, put something away for their kids' college  and for their own retirement. These are the kinds of jobs we should be  creating, and we are, thanks to these historic investments.    That is why I have been a champion of our domestic solar industry and  have been fighting back against attacks on it from my colleagues--well,  frankly--on both sides of the aisle. That is why I led a bipartisan  group of Senators last year to push President Biden to pause additional  retroactive solar tariffs after a Commerce Department investigation.  Well, they threatened to destroy our domestic solar industry and kill  tens of thousands of American jobs.   But at this moment--this moment--our American solar workers are at  risk. My workers in Nevada are at risk. Those $80,000-a-year jobs are  at risk. And all of the progress we have made to transition to clean  energy, all the good-paying jobs that we have created, and all of the  solar projects that are lowering energy costs for families--well, they  are all at risk, too.   Last week, the House of Representatives passed a Congressional Review  Act. This resolution rolls back the 2-year pause on these additional  solar tariffs. If enacted, this resolution will decimate our American  solar industry. So let me be crystal clear: Enacting additional  retroactive tariffs on imported solar panels themselves will kill--will  absolutely kill--the American solar industry, and it will kill any  chance we have to meet our climate goals. It will kill the current  American solar jobs.   I know that some of my colleagues have said that supporting this  resolution is being pro-worker. Well, I am just going to say that that  is wrong. No one can say they are pro-worker while at the same time  voting to kill good-paying American jobs. And that is exactly what this  resolution will do.   I don't even know why this is on the table. Are we seriously going to  tell that solar installer that he is out of a job? Are we going to put  his family on unemployment just for politics?   I am going to repeat it: Supporting this resolution and killing  American jobs, it hurts workers and their families. Period.   Opposing this resolution means being on the side of American workers.  It means being on the side of unions like IBEW, the laborers, the  operating engineers, the carpenters union, who are all urging a ``no''  vote today.   All of us here in this Chamber agree that we have to strengthen  domestic manufacturing; we all agree we have to be competitive with  China; and we all agree that we have to be energy independent.   That is what this current pause on additional tariffs--that is what  this current pause helps us to do because, right now, solar panel  manufacturers in the United States can only meet about 15 percent of  the demand for American solar projects.   So thanks to the investments made by the Inflation Reduction Act, we  are going to greatly ramp up our domestic solar manufacturing, creating  jobs, making us energy independent right here at home.   But it is going to take time. It will take time to ramp up domestic  solar manufacturing so it can provide more than 15 percent of U.S.  demand. Our current solar industry's best success depends on the steady  supply of solar panels to install. We can't cut off supply of important  solar panels by enacting massive retroactive tariffs that will just  kill solar projects; it will kill American jobs; and it will hurt  American workers.   So what can we do?   Well, what we can do is have a bridge that allows us to do both: keep  our domestic solar industry alive while we invest and bolster our  domestic manufacturing so that we can be competitive with China. That  is exactly what this pause helps us to achieve.   Enacting retroactive tariffs will even directly harm U.S. solar panel  manufacturing businesses by cutting off their major source of solar  cells--a key component in the panels--making it that much harder for  them and us to compete with China. That is why I am leading the effort  to block this resolution and to keep the pause in place.   So I urge my fellow colleagues to join me and be on the side of  workers by protecting good-paying American union jobs, to join me in  fighting to meet our climate goals, and to join me in making our Nation  more competitive with China by voting against this job-killing  resolution and saving America's solar future. Hundreds of thousands of  American solar workers, their families, and our communities--well, they  are counting on us.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I would like to continue finishing the  letter from the Birmingham jail:         Abused and scorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up       with America's destiny. Before the pilgrims landed at       Plymouth, we were here. Before the pen of Jefferson etched       the majestic words of the Declaration of Independence across       the pages of history, we were here. For more than two       centuries our forebears labored in this country without       wages; they made cotton king; they built the homes of their       masters while suffering gross injustice and shameful       humiliation--and yet out of a bottomless vitality they       continued to thrive and develop. If the inexpressible       cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the opposition we now       face will surely fail. We will win our freedom because the       sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are       embodied in our echoing demands. Before closing I feel       impelled to mention one other point in your statement that       has troubled me profoundly. You warmly commended the       Birmingham police force for keeping ``order'' and       ``preventing violence.'' I doubt that you would have so       warmly commended the police force if you had seen its dogs       sinking their teeth into unarmed, nonviolent Negroes. I doubt       that you would so quickly commend the policemen if you were       to observe their ugly and inhumane treatment of Negroes here       in the city jail; if you were to watch them push and curse       old Negro women and young Negro girls; if you were to see       them slap and kick old Negro men and young boys; if you were       to observe them, as they did on two occasions, refuse to give       us food because we wanted to sing our grace together. I       cannot join you in your praise of the Birmingham police       department.        It is true that the police have exercised a degree of       discipline in handling the demonstrators. In this sense they       have conducted themselves rather ``nonviolently'' in public.       But for what purpose? To preserve the evil system of       segregation. Over the past few years I have consistently       preached that nonviolence demands that the means we use must       be as pure as the ends we seek. I have tried to make clear       that it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends.       But now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or perhaps       even more so, to use moral means to preserve immoral ends.       Perhaps Mr. Connor and his policemen have been rather       nonviolent in public, as was Chief Pritchett in Albany,       Georgia, but they have used the moral means of nonviolence to       maintain the immoral end of racial injustice. As T. S. Eliot       has said: ``The last temptation is the greatest treason: To       do the right deed for the wrong reason.''        I wish you had commended the Negro sit inners and       demonstrators of Birmingham for their sublime courage, their       willingness to suffer and their amazing discipline in the       midst of great provocation. One day the South will recognize       its real heroes. They will be the James Merediths, with the       noble sense of purpose that enables them to face jeering and       hostile mobs, and with the agonizing loneliness that       characterizes the life of the pioneer. They will be old,       oppressed, battered Negro women, symbolized in a seventy two       year old woman in Montgomery, Alabama, who rose up with a       sense of dignity and with her people decided not to ride       segregated buses, and who responded with ungrammatical       profundity to one who inquired about her weariness: ``My       feets is tired, but my soul is at rest.'' They will be the       young high school and college students, the young ministers       of the gospel and a host of their elders, courageously and       nonviolently sitting in at lunch counters and willingly going       to jail for conscience' sake. One day the South will know       that when these disinherited children of God sat down at       lunch counters, they were in reality standing up for what is       best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in       our Judaeo Christian heritage, thereby bringing our nation       back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep       by the founding fathers in their formulation of the       Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.        Never before have I written so long a letter. I'm afraid it       is much too long to take your precious time. I can assure you       that it would have been much shorter if I had been writing       from a comfortable desk, but what else can one do when he is       alone in a narrow jail cell, other than write long letters,       think long thoughts and pray long prayers?        If I have said anything in this letter that overstates the       truth and indicates an unreasonable impatience, I beg you to       forgive me. If I have said anything that understates the       truth and indicates my having a patience that allows me to       settle for anything less than brotherhood, I beg God to       forgive me.        I hope this letter finds you strong in the faith. I also       hope that circumstances will soon make it possible for me to       meet each of you, not as an integrationist or a civil-rights       leader but as a fellow clergyman and a Christian brother. Let       us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will       soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be       lifted from our fear drenched communities, and in some not       too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and       brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their       scintillating beauty.        Yours for the cause of Peace and Brotherhood,                                            Martin Luther King, Jr.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.
