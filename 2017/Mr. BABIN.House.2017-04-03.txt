 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly urge my colleagues  in the United States Senate to confirm Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S.  Supreme Court.   Since being nominated by President Trump, Judge Gorsuch has provided  unprecedented transparency and access. He has completed three rounds of  intense questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee, which totaled  nearly 20 hours and covered nearly 1,200 questions. This was the  longest hearing of any nominee in the 21st century.   During this time, Judge Gorsuch showed himself to be uniquely  qualified and experienced to serve on our Nation's highest court. In  fact, he showed the exact same qualification that previously earned him  unanimous approval by the U.S. Senate in 2006 to serve on the Tenth  Circuit Court of Appeals. Then-Senators Obama, Biden, Clinton, and  Schumer were all serving in the Senate at that time and raised no  objections whatsoever to Judge Gorsuch's nomination.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for the Senate to put politics aside and  confirm Judge Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court.                            ____________________
