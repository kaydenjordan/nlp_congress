 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it has been a good week in the Senate  because two important things happened. First, we finally confirmed  every single U.S. attorney that had been blocked by Republicans, making  the country safer. And today, the Senate is taking the next big step  toward enacting major legislation to create jobs, bring back American  manufacturing, strengthen supply chains, and unleash another generation  of American innovation.   Later today, we will vote to enter into a conference committee with  the House on the competition and innovation legislation, and we will  work with the House to finalize this jobs competitiveness bill. We will  also vote next Tuesday and Wednesday on 28 motions to instruct--8 from  Democrats, 20 from Republicans.   There is still a lot of work to do before we send this competitive  jobs bill to the President's desk. Not everyone is going to get what  they want, but even so, this bill is going to be just what the doctor  ordered to boost our economy, bring back manufacturing jobs, and lower  costs for American families.   Let me say it again. Today, the Senate is moving forward on  legislation that is awash with good news for American jobs, American  families, American innovation. It is great news for American families  who want to see lower costs on daily essentials. It is great news for  workers who want to see good-paying manufacturing jobs brought back  from overseas. It is great news for our businesses, especially our chip  manufacturers that need help strengthening supply chains. And it is  great news for our innovators, scientists, workers at universities, and  creators who will help us create new technologies and generate the next  wave of good-paying jobs in this century.   Now, we Democrats have bent over backward to get this bill done. We  allowed a very long list of motions to instruct. In fact, it is the  most votes on motions to instruct of any bill in decades. And it is a  sign of both the immense good will we have shown to our Republican  colleagues and the fact that many Members on both sides of the aisle  have a stake in seeing the bill finalized.   Frankly, it shouldn't have taken us so long to get to this point of  forming a conference on the USICA legislation, but, once again, it is  good news that the bill is moving forward.   I thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle who worked in good  faith to help us reach this point. I give a particular shout-out to  Chairman Cantwell, as well as Senator Young, my cosponsor on this  legislation.                        Confirmations and Nominations    Mr. President, as I also mentioned, we got more good news yesterday  after the Senate confirmed every single U.S. attorney who had been  blocked by a handful of Republican obstructionists.   It was about time that Republicans finally relented on their  dangerous and indefensible blockade on Federal prosecutors. I don't  think it has ever happened before. These U.S. attorneys are vital to  keeping Americans safe. They are not political positions; they are  entirely dedicated to preserving public safety and protecting our  communities.   It was totally reckless for a very small band of Republicans, who  claim to care about public safety, to have halted these Federal  prosecutors for so long just to score political points.   Still, after months of unnecessary delay, Americans in Georgia and  Michigan and Ohio and Nevada and  [[Page S2202]]  Minnesota and New Hampshire and other States can breathe a sigh of  relief that the Republican blockade on Federal prosecutors has broken.   Now, there are many other very important and uncontroversial nominees  who are still being blocked by a handful of Senate Republicans. Many of  them deal with national security. Many of them would help our country  find ways to lower costs. Republicans should drop their holds on these  uncontroversial nominees at once or else we are going to have to keep  Members here in the Chamber for late night and weekend sessions to get  them through.   Finally, I want to say it was egregious for Republicans to similarly  prevent the nomination of Lisa Cook to go through this week. Make no  mistake, we are going to get her confirmed through the Senate as soon  as we can.   Lisa Cook is a historic and highly qualified nominee. She will be the  first Black woman ever to sit on the Federal Reserve Board of  Governors. Her family, literally, fought segregation growing up in  rural Georgia. And despite personally facing immense discrimination,  she is now professor of economics at Michigan State, a former adviser  to President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, and is on the  Chicago Fed Board's academic advisory board.   A historic Federal Reserve nominee who accomplished as much as Lisa  Cook deserves far, far better treatment than what Republicans have  shown. But, nevertheless, the Senate will vote on her confirmation as  soon as we can.                               Federal Funding    Mr. President, on Ukraine and COVID, this morning, President Biden  has sent Congress his request for $33 billion in emergency funding to  support the Ukrainian people. This is a big but critically necessary  package. I will make sure the Senate prioritizes this important funding  package so we can get help to the Ukrainian people fast--ASAP.   It was also good to see the President call for legislation to get  tough on Russian oligarchs. This must be done. I will ask the Senate to  arm the Federal Government with the tools necessary to put further  pressure on Russian oligarchs and Putin's cronies. I will expect we  will include authorities that expand existing forfeiture laws to  achieve that end.   We need to go after these crooked oligarchs who have gotten rich off  Putin's regime. The war in Ukraine is on their hands, and the Federal  Government should be fully empowered to make sure their moment of  reckoning comes.   Two months into the war, Putin's hopes for a quick takeover of  Ukraine have all but extinguished, thanks to the bravery of the  Ukrainian people and in addition to the aid that the United States has  provided in the forms of Javelins, Stingers, armed carriers, tanks, and  so many other critical weapons.   This is a fight against democracy--this is a fight of democracy  against authoritarianism.   So every penny we approve for Ukraine is money well spent. And the  fight is far from over. We can't stop now. We must make sure that the  Ukrainian people will continue to have the help they need for as long  as they need it.   The Senate must also work in a bipartisan way to pass another round  of time-sensitive COVID funding. On both Ukraine funding and COVID  funding, Republican obstruction will not serve the American people.   The administration has made clear it needs more COVID money right now  in order to secure the next round of vaccine doses, testing, and the  new lifesaving therapeutics, which are so good that if you get a  positive test and you take the therapeutic, the likelihood of getting  any kind of COVID, particularly the more severe kind, is virtually--is  minimal. These are amazing drugs. But what is happening? Since we don't  have the money to purchase them, other countries are going to the  companies--American companies, American innovation that has made them.  And God forbid there is another variant. We may not have them--all  because of delay and political games on the other side stopping the  COVID legislation.   The administration has made clear they need this money right now,  and, as I said, if we wait, other nations are going to beat us to the  punch, and America might be left waiting for months before more  supplies are made. This is a risk. It may be a few months away but very  real. It is a risk that the American people simply can't afford.   Of course, there is a very simple way we can prevent another closure  of schools and churches and businesses. Republicans should work with  Democrats to pass another COVID funding bill ASAP. No political games.  No poison pills. No dithering about.   In short, we must get both Ukrainian emergency relief and COVID  funding relief done quickly.                                Oil Companies    Mr. President, finally, on gas prices and the FTC, earlier this  morning, I joined with Senator Cantwell, Speaker Pelosi, and Chairman  Pallone to detail some of the ways Democrats are helping Americans ease  the pain they are feeling at the pump. We are focused like a laser on  developing and passing legislation to lower costs and improve  Americans' daily lives.   Nowhere else are Americans feeling the hurt as viscerally and as  repeatedly as they are when they fill up their tank at the gas station.  We are thus working on legislation to fight bad actors who may be using  COVID and Ukraine to jack up prices on consumers to pad their profits,  and I intend to put that legislation on the floor.   Oil is basically an oligopoly. A few small companies dominate it. And  that means supply and demand doesn't work. That means, for instance,  that the biggest 25 energy giants in America reported a breathtaking  $205 billion in profits in 2021. If there were real competition, they  would fight to get the price lower to get some market share, but with  very little competition, they just keep the price up, and the consumer  is strangled. One executive even bragged to shareholders about the  benefits of ``capturing value from high prices.''   What are the oil companies doing with all this cash? They are helping  their CEOs and their biggest, wealthiest shareholders. The amount of  buybacks is skyrocketing. Buybacks do no good. They don't help the  worker. They don't help the consumer. They don't even produce more oil,  for those who believe that is the way to go. They simply line the  pockets of the CEOs and the biggest shareholders, and then they can go  back and say: I got the stock price up--but not the way you are  supposed to in capitalism by making your company sell more, be more  productive, but, rather, by this horrible buyback, which has become  endemic in corporate America and is very harmful to America. Yet we are  seeing it in oil more than anywhere else right now.   So it is high time--we need somebody to look under the hood, see what  the problem is, and give them the tools to fix it. That somebody is the  FTC. It is high time for the FTC to roll up their sleeves and drill  down on what is going on at the big oil companies.   Very soon, the Senate will confirm Alvaro Bedoya and return the FTC  to full strength. But Congress needs to do more to beef up the FTC's  ability to crack down on potential gas price manipulation and price  gouging, so we will work on legislation to that end, among other  proposals to lower gas prices.   Once again, as we reach the end of this week, let me say that I  intend to put legislation that eases the pain of gas prices on the  floor for a vote when it is ready.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I would note Maryland is in the House.                    Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 4521     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motions  to instruct at the desk, which may be made with respect to the message  to accompany H.R. 4251, be printed in the Record for the information of  the Senate.
