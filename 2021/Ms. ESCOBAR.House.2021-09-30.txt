 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life  of Dr. Diana Natalicio, who will be remembered as an icon of higher  education and a trailblazer in El Paso.   Dr. Natalicio served for 31 years as the president of the University  of Texas at El Paso, my alma mater, UTEP, between 1988 and 2019. As the  longest sitting president at UTEP, her imprint on the institution will  be everlasting.   She devoted her life's work to making UTEP accessible and elevating  it to a top-tier institution. As a first-generation college student  herself, she knew the importance of working for an equitable college  experience for first-generation and low-income college students and  access to higher education for all. In 2019, 51 percent of UTEP's  graduates were first generation.   Dr. Natalicio taught us that no matter where you come from, everyone  deserves a good education. She also understood the struggles that El  Pasoans face and worked on finding solutions to those barriers. I am  deeply grateful for Dr. Diana Natalicio's service to our community and  the vision she created for UTEP students.    Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in honoring Dr. Diana Natalicio's  life and contributions to El Paso.   May her legacy continue to inspire us all.                            ____________________
