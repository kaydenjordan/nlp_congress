 Mr. Speaker, next week tens of thousands of  women and men from around the country will March For Life, making clear  to the country and to the world that women and unborn babies deserve  the utmost respect, love, and protection from the violence of abortion.   Sadly, Mr. Speaker, since 1973 over 61 million unborn babies have  been killed by either dismemberment, a procedure where the child is  decapitated and torn apart arms, legs, and torso or by chemical  poisoning. The loss of children's lives in America is staggering, a  death toll that equates with the entire population of Italy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Indiana,  Congressman   Jim Banks, who has been a leader in defending the  innocent and most vulnerable.  [[Page H282]]         Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  eloquent comments and reminding us of the great progress being made at  the State level where so many laws and policies have been enacted, and  we are trying to do that on the Federal level.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Alabama, Martha Roby, a  member of the Appropriations Committee and the Judiciary Committee.                                time  1815     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Roby for  her very powerful statement and her leadership here in the U.S. House.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Harris), my  distinguished friend and colleague, the co-chairman of the  Congressional Pro-Life Caucus. Dr.   Andy Harris is a board-certified  anesthesiologist who has served so ably at Johns Hopkins and elsewhere.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Harris so very much  for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Norman), a distinguished Member. He is also the sponsor of the Ensuring  Accurate and Complete Data Reporting Act.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  sharing that beautiful story of his grandchild. What a tenacious  spirit, and our prayers are with him as he prospers and thrives.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin), my good  friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much  for his comments tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Green).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Baird), a Bronze Star winner and a Purple Heart recipient.  I thank him for his service and thank him for his witness for life.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Chabot), my good friend and colleague. The gentleman was the  prime author of the law to save born-alive children, a law that we are  looking now to strengthen with 199 cosponsors which is Representative  Ann Wagner's bill. I thank the gentleman for his leadership.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Hice).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman so much  and thank him for reminding the Members, as well as those who might be  watching on C-SPAN, of the selflessness of the pro-life movement.   The people who will be marching are doing it for others, and,  increasingly, at every march, there are more women who are postabortive  who now speak out on behalf of their lost child. And they admonish and  encourage others not to make that same terrible, irreversible mistake.   I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry), my good  friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much  for his very eloquent remarks and for his clarity as well. He has  always been such a clear speaker, and I thank him so much.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Marshall), and  I would like to point out to the Chair that we have so many doctors,  M.D.s, who are speaking on behalf of unborn children and their moms. I  want to thank the gentleman, Dr. Marshall, for that as well.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman so much  for his words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield now to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Latta).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio  for his leadership on that bill and all of the other pro-life pieces of  legislation.

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).    Mr. Speaker, again I point out to my  colleagues that there are so many medical doctors who are part of this  pro-life effort. Hopefully, their views, like all of ours, but theirs  especially, will be weighed and, hopefully, people will agree to the  great work that Dr. Joyce is doing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Watkins), who represents the Second Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Cloud), who is my friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to another gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Wright), and I thank him for sponsoring the  Teleabortion Prevention Act and the Child Custody Protection Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Guest), who represents the Third Congressional  District.    Mr. Speaker, in a Florida abortion clinic,  Sycloria Williams delivered a live baby girl at 23 weeks. The clinic  owner took the baby, who was gasping for air, cut her umbilical cord,  threw her into a biohazard bag, and put the bag in the trash.  Heartbroken, Sycloria later had a funeral for her baby girl, who she  named Shanice.   In Sycloria's home State of Florida, in just 1 year, in 2017, 11  babies were born alive during abortions. Shockingly, only 6 States-- Florida, Arizona, Michigan, Minnesota, Oklahoma, and Texas--currently  require reporting of children born alive who survive abortion.   Why the coverup? Dr. Willard Cates, the former head of the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention's Abortion Surveillance Unit, said  live births ``are little known because organized medicine, from fear of  public clamor and legal action, treats them more as an embarrassment to  be hushed up than a problem to be solved. It is like turning yourself  in to the IRS,'' he goes on, ``for an audit. What is there to gain? The  tendency is not to report because there are only negative incentives.''   Mr. Speaker, I would remind my colleagues that Philadelphia  abortionist Kermit Gosnell, one of the few who got caught, was  convicted for murder, for killing children who were born alive after  attempting abortions.   The grand jury described it this way: ``Gosnell had a simple solution  for unwanted babies he delivered: He killed them. He didn't call it  that. He called it `ensuring fetal demise.' The way he ensured fetal  demise was by sticking scissors into the back of the baby's neck and  cutting the spinal cord. He called that `snipping.' ''   Mr. Speaker, we have tried the whole year to bring the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act introduced by Ann Wagner and 191 of  us to a vote here in this House. I, again, with my colleagues, appeal  to the leadership: These children need protection. The unborn children  need protection.   Congressmen   Andy Biggs and Doug LaMalfa said it so well a few  moments ago, that we have such a clearer picture of the unborn as well.  Andy said, even without today's technology, he and his wife knew there  was a baby. Ultrasound shatters the myth that an unborn child is  anything but human, alive, and extremely vulnerable.   Mr. Speaker, let's protect the children.
