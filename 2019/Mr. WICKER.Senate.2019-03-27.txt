 Mr. President, I am pleased to advise the Senate  of the accomplishments of a fellow Mississippian, Mr. Samuel B. Olden  of Yazoo City, on the occasion of his 100th birthday.   Mr. Olden is from Yazoo City, the gateway to the Mississippi Delta,  where he was born in 1919, to a family of Mississippi planters.  Throughout his youth, he read widely in the B.S. Ricks Memorial  Library, the oldest privately funded public library in the State, which  greatly contributed to his personal development and admission into the  University of Mississippi in Oxford. There, he received a B.A. and  M.A., reportedly conversed with Nobel Prize winning author William  Faulkner, and was ultimately recruited to Washington, DC, to serve at  the Department of State. Prior to American involvement in World War II,  Mr. Olden was sent abroad as the Vice Consul at our embassy in Quito,  Ecuador, from 1941 to 1943. Upon his return, Mr. Olden enlisted in the  U.S. Navy, serving from 1943-46 at posts ranging from Shanghai, China,  to Paris, France.   After the war, Mr. Olden transited the north Atlantic on a Liberty  ship. A fellow naval officer noted Mr. Olden's fortitude during this  stormy passage. While tending to his ailing father back in Mississippi,  he received a letter from Washington asking him to consider defending  our Nation's freedom, in a third, essential way. Mr. Olden returned to  the District of Columbia, where he was invited to join the newly formed  Central Intelligence Group. Commencing in 1947, Mr. Olden spent 2 years  in the group's Washington office, followed by 3 years in Vienna,  Austria, where he defended freedom and democracy against Communist  aggression.   Following a decade in public service, Mr. Olden entered the private  sector, where he employed his experience abroad for Mobil Oil. From  1952-1957, he was posted in East and West Nigeria, British and French  Cameroon, The Congo, Chad, and Gabon. He joined Mobil's government  relations department in 1957 and returned to New York. There, he  attained Observer status at the United Nations and strode the halls  with Adlai Stevenson and Eleanor Roosevelt. Later, he went abroad once  more to serve as general manager of Mobil's affiliates in Tunisia,  Algeria, Peru, and Spain.   By 1974, Mr. Olden was fluent in English, French, German, and  Spanish. He had connections around the world. And where did he go? He  chose to retire to the finest place that he had ever lived: Yazoo City.  There, he owned and operated a cattle ranch for 15 years, while  continuing to pursue his passion for the study of history. He was twice  a board member and was elected president of the Mississippi Historical  Society, served 15 years on the State Committee for the Center for the  Study of Southern Culture at the University of Mississippi, and founded  the Yazoo Historical Society's remarkable museum, housed in the same  Triangle Center building where he had attended elementary school. Even  in his 90s, he established and helped to fund the Yazoo Memorial  Literary Walkway, which stretches between the Triangle Center and the  B.S. Ricks Library. The walkway memorializes more than 100 Yazooan  authors that include former U.S. House Minority Leader and U.S. Senator  John Sharp Williams, literary critic and editor Henry Herschel  Brickell, Governor Haley Reeves Barbour, beloved writers Willie Morris,  Teresa Nicholas, Ruth Williams, John Langston, and Caroline Langston  Jarboe, and educator Henry Mitchell Brickell. His large collection of  pre-Columbian ceramics is now on display in the Mississippi Museum of  Art in Jackson and is the focus of Yumi Park's book ``Mirrors of  Clay.''   This remarkable man has served his Nation as a diplomat, military  officer, and emissary, during wars hot and cold. He served the world in  the energy industry as a global businessman of distinction. He returned  to his hometown and has continued to serve his State, his university,  and his community as a historian, educator, and philanthropist even  into the tenth decade of his life. His friends across the Nation and  around the world celebrate with him today.                            ____________________
