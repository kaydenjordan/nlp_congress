 Mr. Chair, I respect the gentleman's point  about how we need to work towards an agreement to how Congress can have  the most constructive role possible on arms sales.   The concern here is the tendency of the White House to declare an  emergency when they simply want to do something that we haven't allowed  them to do. It is troubling because it takes us out of the process, so  we need to find a way to make sure that they can't do that.   It is not a huge mystery why these arms sales have been held up. We  are concerned about Iran's malign influence. We are also concerned  about the actions that Saudi Arabia has been taking in that region that  could be stirring up conflict and making it easier for Iran to have  that malign influence; quite specifically, killing civilians in Yemen  in a way that generates sympathy, certainly, for the Houthis in Yemen  but then sympathy for that side.   So, we are worried about the way Saudi Arabia is conducting this war,  certainly, and we are also worried about other actions by Saudi Arabia.  Certainly, the murder of the journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, has not been  answered for to this point.  [[Page H5598]]    So, simply selling weapons to Saudi Arabia at this point is something  that is going to take time and is going to raise questions.   For the President to simply bypass us, taking us out of the process  in that situation, I think, undermines our role.   That is the purpose of this amendment, and I urge adoption.                                time  1245     Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer amendment No.  26 as the designee of Mr. Khanna.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a variation  on a bill that this House passed and the Senate passed as well that the  President vetoed that would cut off any U.S. support for the Saudi  coalition that is fighting in Yemen.   And I will agree with some discussion that came earlier that this is  a complicated situation because we are concerned about the malign  influence of Iran in the region. But the problem is the way the war has  been conducted in Yemen.   As I mentioned earlier on the previous amendment, the civilian  casualties and the way the war has been conducted has undermined, I  believe, our efforts to arrive at a peaceful solution and to begin to  limit the Iranian influence in the region.   I met with Saudi Arabian officials as they explained to me what their  targeting strategy was, and how they were trying to mitigate civilian  casualties, but I was not impressed because whatever they showed me on  these pieces of paper, it has been well-documented that they bombed a  school bus, killing a large number of children. They actually bombed a  funeral, a funeral that had a lot of the key leaders in Yemen at it  that were going to be responsible for negotiating a peace agreement.  And on countless other instances they have bombed civilian targets.   There is also a very aggressive blockade going on in Yemen that is  having a devastating humanitarian impact.   Now, I understand that Iran is also doing things that we should  oppose. They are killing civilians; they are stirring up difficulties.  But we are not supporting Iran. We are not responsible for that piece  of it.   But to the extent that we participate in helping Saudi Arabia,  through intelligence sharing, through refueling, through a variety of  different means, we are participating in the atrocities that are being  committed on that side, and we should not be. It is not what is going  to lead us to a peaceful solution.   I also want to emphasize that this amendment, as did the bill that we  passed, very carefully carves out the activity that we are engaged in  in Yemen to counter violent extremist groups like al-Qaida and ISIS  that have arisen in the region.   We have a counterterrorism presence in Yemen. This amendment in no  way restricts us from continuing that counterterrorism activity. This  is focused on the civil war in Yemen.   And it is worth noting that, as we get to the point now where Iran is  involved, that is not the way it started. Basically, the Houthis in  Yemen were an oppressed minority and suffered decades of mistreatment  at the hands of whoever happened to be in charge in Yemen, which led to  the revolt.   Now, since that time, the Houthis have committed all manner of  atrocities, as well as the war moved forward. But initially, this was a  civil war that doesn't really have anything to do with the terrorism  fight that we are doing. And I think it is incredibly important for the  credibility of our foreign policy to clearly differentiate between our  activities, our legitimate activities, in Yemen to stop those  terrorists in Yemen who threaten us and threaten our allies in the  region, and the activities of this broader civil war that, as I said, I  believe, is merely creating more violence in the Middle East and  empowering Iran by creating widespread sympathy across the board and in  the United States for the Houthis and for the people in Yemen who are  being the victims of these bombing attacks.   The U.S. should step back from this. And if Saudi Arabia is the great  ally that everyone has said they are, we should be able to have a  conversation with them about how they change their actions, so we can  be in a better position to support them and lead toward greater peace  in the region and contain Iran. That is what we need to do.   But the current policy isn't working, so this amendment makes it  clear the United States is not supporting the Saudi-led coalition that  is engaged in the civil war in Yemen, and I urge support.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have no further speakers and I  am prepared to close.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close. I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   I think the intelligence sharing point the gentleman from Arkansas  made is very important. Let me say, there are multiple countries  involved in this coalition in Yemen.   In working with the UAE, for instance, they actually do take steps to  minimize civilian casualties and are reasonably successful about it in  the operations that they have conducted, both from the air and the  ground.   Saudi Arabia has not. And believe me, I certainly understood the  malign influence of Iran and their relationship with the Houthis. But  Saudi Arabia, time and time again, regrettably, has not used this  intelligence sharing in a way that minimizes civilian casualties.   I had cited the instances earlier of the school bus that was bombed;  the funeral party that was bombed; the civilians who are continually  hit. They are not using this intelligence sharing in a way to minimize  civilian casualties. And I think we need to make a statement that they  are going to have to change their ways before we continue to do this.   On the broader issue, and that is really what Yemen is about for U.S.  policy purposes, is Iran's influence in the region and, also, the role  that Saudi Arabia plays in the violence. And the problem I have with  the administration's policy right now is it would do nothing to contain  what Saudi Arabia is doing, which only exacerbates the violence and  creates openings for Iran. So we need to balance that.   As far Iran is concerned, right now it is hard to say where the  administration's policy is going. It is a maximum pressure campaign. We  have seen Iran lash out since we abandoned the nuclear deal. They are  now moving more in the direction of developing a nuclear weapon than  they were before we abandoned the nuclear deal.   The administration is now saying that they want to force Iran to the  table to stop them from getting a nuclear weapon.   We need a better policy in Iran. I urge support for the amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, three quick points.   First of all, Richard Nixon era or not, I think we all agree that the  missile right now is working. I certainly hope it is since we are  relying on it as a key part of our nuclear deterrent.   We have a lot of weapons systems. I mean, I am surprised that the B- 52 bomber is still functional, but it is.   To imply that somehow because it is old, by definition, it doesn't  work, I hope that is not true. In fact, I know it is not true because  the current missile works perfectly fine and is a more than adequate  deterrent.   Second, the studies that have been done were trying to figure out if  we could get away with keeping this missile for the entire projected  80-year lifespan of its replacement. The studies have come back and  said, no, it probably will not last 80 years. We have not studied  whether or not it could last another 25 or another 50.   That is the purpose of this amendment. That would save us money.    Look, we need a nuclear deterrent. I don't believe the gentleman from  Oregon--certainly, I don't--supports getting rid of our nuclear  weapons. The question is, how many do we need? What does the deterrent  look like? What makes sense?   It is clear that this missile works now. If we did this study, it is  quite reasonable to presume that it would work another 10, 20, 30 years  from now. Then that money could be used for other defense priorities.   This is to answer that question, which is very important.   I will skip the third point.    Mr. Chair, all I was going to say is that  the voice vote in our committee was not overwhelming. I am the one who  called the voice vote, and it was my sense that the amendment was  agreed to in the committee, but it was not overwhelming. There was a  large number of members of the Armed Services Committee who supported  the proposal that Mr. Blumenauer is now making.  [[Page H5618]]         Mr. Chairman, this is a little bit smaller  than what the gentleman from Ohio implied. We are stopping the funding  of this program. Actually, what we are stopping is the additional $185  million request that NNSA and the President requested in this budget on  top of this. The missile would continue to be funded.   This is a concern we had in committee. We talked about it and we let  it go.   But they have not really told us what they are going to do with this  additional $185 million. And we have concerns, in addition to the  concerns that Mr. Blumenauer raised about the efficacy of the program,  about whether or not they are going to be able to execute this $185  million and what their exact timeline is for the program. In fact, the  Air Force recently said that they were delaying by a year or two  certain steps in the development of this missile while saying they were  also going to be able to still meet the ultimate deadline for  deployment.    But the specific $185 million that is expensed is an amount that was  asked for in addition to what had originally been planned for FY20. We  do not have an adequate explanation, in my view, and in Mr.  Blumenauer's view, from DOD as to why they want that additional $185  million, and that is the purpose of this. It is not studying the entire  missile. It is saying, why are you accelerating the program and asking  for this additional money? So I support this amendment.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 476,  I offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), my fellow Washingtonian.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Shalala).    Mr. Chair, I don't have any more speakers,  so I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have no further speakers, so I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge support of the en bloc  package, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment that Mr.  Amash, Ms. Lee, I, and others have worked on in previous years. It is a  very simple principle.   Certainly, with the 9/11 attacks, with the terrorism threat that we  face, it is very real, and we need to make sure that our country is in  a position to defend ourselves against that.   But we also need to make sure that we protect the thing that gives us  our greatest strength, and that is the rule of law in our Constitution.  This amendment simply says you cannot use law of war detention against  people in the United States of America.   Our Article III courts have worked amazingly well throughout the  history of this country. Through many conflicts and many threats, they  worked very well to bring people to justice, lock them up, and protect  us.   In fact, there are hundreds of terrorists right now in U.S. prisons  who were prosecuted under Article III of the Constitution.   Article III and the history of the Supreme Court and other courts  that have laid out the laws that give us the basic protections are  essential to our liberty in this country.   We can protect ourselves and maintain our basic liberties. That is  what this amendment does.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate Mr. Amash bringing it, and I urge support.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 476,  I offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Panetta).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin).    Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of en bloc No.  6, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 476,  I offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster).    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from  New Hampshire for her leadership on this issue, and I agree that it is  a very important issue.   Absolutely, we will work with the Senate to do our best to address it  once we get to conference, and, again, I thank the gentlewoman for her  work on this.  [[Page H5653]]         Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Haaland), a member of the committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).  [[Page H5654]]         Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Ms. Kendra S. Horn).    Mr. Chair, I have no further speakers. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the en bloc  package, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's  comments, and I think he is absolutely right in the first half, and  absolutely wrong in the second half.   I would disagree with my colleague's comments that Democrats have not  had an opportunity to contribute to the process. We have in the past.  We worked in a bipartisan way.   It is, however, not true that this year everything is different.  Something was different, but not what I believe the ranking member  said. That is that we did include a large number of Republican  provisions, certainly in committee by the amendment process, and on the  floor.   The one sort of stark number here is, on the floor, we have not had a  large number of Republican amendments. There are a couple of reasons  for that. Number one, we have, I think, 15 or 16 en bloc packages, and  there are a large number of Republican amendments contained in that en  bloc package.   But as far as standalone amendments, there are a couple of problems.  One, traditionally, and this has happened to us as well, we had a lot  of our more controversial amendments, unless the majority party--at the  time, the Republicans--thought it was to their advantage to have us  vote on something that made us look bad, then they would let it in.  Otherwise, they wouldn't.   We kind of did the same thing. If there were amendments that we  didn't want, we didn't keep them. We did allow for Republican  priorities.   The reason, however, that there are fewer Republican amendments than  in  [[Page H5665]]  the past is because, for a long time, it has been the minority party's  plan this year to not support this bill. This is not a new thing. This  has been a debate.   As I mentioned yesterday, the reason for that was purely partisan.  And it is traditional. I have been working as a legislator long enough  to know that when Members are in the minority, they want the majority  party to fail. So whatever bill they are bringing up, the minority  tries to defeat it to gain leverage.   The Armed Services Committee has traditionally been different from  that. We don't do that on this bill. We work together in a  collaborative process to create the bill.   But this year, the minority party decided to treat the defense bill  like every other bill: We are in the minority. We want the bill to  fail.   The evidence of that is that I have worked with a lot of Members to  try to get amendments straightened out in Rules. On one in particular,  we worked with Representative Stefanik.     Mr. Chair, she didn't like the way we did  it, so she wanted to fix it. It had to do with the Under Secretary for  Intelligence and the title. It is kind of irrelevant what it was, but  we worked with her, and we got it solved.   We had it ready to go, and she pulled it today. She said she didn't  want to do it.   As I understand it, the reason was that she didn't want to feel  obligated to vote for the bill because we had cooperated and worked  with her. Well, how obnoxious of us to do that.   The games that are being played here are not primarily being played  by us.   Let me say to this body that I am 100 percent committed to  maintaining the bipartisanship of this committee, and what happened  this year won't change that at all.   I will say, in the past, the Republicans have not been as kind. We  had a Member who voted against the bill in committee a few years back.  He found out the next year that he got nothing in the bill because  voting against the bill was not allowed. We had a lot of Members vote  against it this year. I am not going to do that. We are going to keep  working together.   I want everyone listening to know that we on the Democratic side are  not the ones being partisan in this bill.    Madam Chair, pursuant to House Resolution  476, I offer amendments en bloc No. 16.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Ruiz).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. Wexton).    Madam Chair, we have no further speakers. I  urge adoption of the en bloc package, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes.   First of all, if you were to say ``unilateral nuclear disarmament''  to most people, I think, if you look at the plain language of the  words, what that would say is we are going to universally nuclear  disarm all nuclear weapons. That is what unilateral nuclear disarmament  would mean. So that is not what we are doing here.   Again, we literally have thousands of nuclear weapons. What we are  doing here is trying to decide whether or not we want to deploy one in  a different form, which is a smaller yield.   So we are not--let me assure my colleagues again--getting rid of all  of our nuclear weapons and unilaterally disarming from nuclear weapons.  We are not doing that.                                time  2045    This is one weapon with a small yield.   The other thing that is worth noting; there is actually no evidence  that the Russians have decided that they are going to use a low-yield  nuclear weapon first without any new clear provocation.   I have had this debate with a number of different people. There have  been various conversations about this; just like we have had various  conversations about a wide range of scenarios. But it is not at all  clear that Russia has decided to launch a nuclear weapon.   I believe that the purpose of a nuclear arsenal is deterrence; and we  ought to find a clear message. In fact, I find this debate, which we  have been having for a while, very dangerous because what we are saying  to the Russians is there is a scenario under which they can use a  nuclear weapon and we won't respond, and I don't think that should ever  be true.   We should say a nuclear weapon is a red line. You step across it, we  will respond.   It is also very untrue--this debate has said, Well, gosh, if they do  a low yield, we have no option but to hit them with something 10 times  as large.   We have a wide range of yields on our nuclear weapons, a wide range  of options in terms of where and when we could respond.   But what introducing a low-yield nuclear weapon does is we take the  Russian mutterings about doing an escalate to de-escalate and say,  yeah, we are with you. This could happen.   Former Secretary of State George Shultz, a Republican, is the one who  has been most critical of deployment of this weapon, because, as he  correctly states, when we start talking about low-yield nuclear  weapons, you start making nuclear war acceptable.   That is why deployment of this weapon is such a mistake. It takes us  down the road of saying, we can have a manageable nuclear war. No. Make  it clear to the Russians, if they start a nuclear war, we can't promise  that our response is going to be proportional, but we can promise that  we will respond.   This is a mistake. But we are not unilaterally nuclear disarming.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton), a member of the committee.    Madam Chair, if I may inquire, who has the  right to close on this one?    Madam Chair, I just have my close, so I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   There is nothing random about this decision; and I do find the  gentleman's argument interesting. I suppose Congress should just sort  of shut down and say, Pentagon, whatever you want, you have got. We are  not going to say anything about it.   I really disagree with that aspect of the gentleman's argument; that  because the Pentagon has decided to deploy this weapon, Congress should  have no say in it.   We are not doing this randomly. We are not doing this arbitrarily.  This is actually a debate that has gone on for a number of years as to  whether or not to deploy this weapon. I will grant you there are  arguments on both sides of it, but the notion that we are like, on a  whim, making this decision is ridiculous.   As I said, there are many former national security experts, including  former Secretary of State George Shultz, who thinks that this weapon  will destabilize and make us less safe.   And let's remember, we have had a nuclear deterrent for almost 75  years now. And for all of those 75 years, we have not put a low-yield  nuclear weapon on one of our submarines. We haven't done it. We have  had a very strong deterrent.   What I would say to Mr. Putin is, No, we are not going to deploy  every single weapon system that we have ever thought of because that  wouldn't be very smart. But we have thousands of nuclear weapons. And  as Mr. Moulton said quite clearly, we need to make it clear, we will  have an overwhelming response to any use of nuclear weapons. That is  what will deter them. That is what will stop a nuclear war from  starting.   When we start to have that situation where it goes back and forth,  and we say, Well, we can have a manageable nuclear war, that is the  danger that leads people to oppose this weapon. I urge opposition to  the amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I want to make it absolutely  clear, in all the scenarios that the gentleman on the other side just  pointed out, the President has the absolute right of self-defense.   As Mr. Khanna made clear in his opening remarks, the right of self- defense--if we were attacked in the way  [[Page H5716]]  that Congressman McCaul described, the President has the absolute right  to defend the United States.   What this amendment says, basically it is counter to the gentleman's  argument. The gentleman's argument basically is that Congress should  get out of the way. Under no circumstances should Congress have any say  in the use of the United States military.   I think that is wrong. I think we have a role to play. The President  should not be allowed to start a war anytime, anywhere, but he can  absolutely defend the United States in accordance with the War Powers  Resolution.   All this says, that if it isn't a matter of self-defense, if the  President has decided, as we decided in Iraq, that we are going to  launch a war for preemptive reasons or because of many of the things  the gentleman pointed out that Iran does, if we are going to start a  war because of that, then we in the United States Congress should  uphold our constitutional duty and have the right to vote on it. I  think that is appropriate.   Unless Members are in favor of Congress getting totally out of having  any say in this, Members need to support this amendment.    Madam Chair, the purpose of the 2002 AUMF  could not have been more clear. I was here at the time. It was one of  the more consequential debates we have ever had. And the purpose was  clearly stated to go after Saddam Hussein because he had weapons of  mass destruction and to wage war against the nation of Iraq.   If we cannot repeal that 17 years later, then Congress has truly and  totally abrogated its constitutional responsibility to regulate any use  of military force. There is no justification 17 years later to keep  this on the books so that Presidents can use the authority as a blank  check. Congress should stand up.    Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do  now rise.  [[Page H5724]]    The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Castro of Texas) having assumed the chair, Mrs. Fletcher, Acting Chair  of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R.  2500) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2020 for military  activities of the Department of Defense and for military construction,  to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for  other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 10 o'clock and 12 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, July 12, 2019, at 9  a.m.                            ____________________
