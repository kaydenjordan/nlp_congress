 Mr. Speaker, someone please wake me up. I think I am  having a nightmare.   What if I told you that, in the Middle East now, there is a place  where Christians, Muslims, Arabs, Kurds, Assyrians, Yazidis--women and  men--all sit together at the same table, as the result of the  beginnings of a democratic process where tolerance and pluralism is a  core value, and where we have seen safety, security, and prosperity  emerge from the ashes one of the most horrific conflicts of the modern  age. What if I told you that.   What if I told you that a foreign state actor spent $10 million a  month, to our reckoning, to influence thought in Washington, D.C.,  alone, to tell lies about this fledgling, tolerant democracy in the  Middle East.   What if I told you that the very Iranian regime that took the lives  of American women and men on the battlefield in Iraq was celebrating  right now along with Vladimir Putin and Bashar al-Assad and Turkey's  neo-Ottoman fascist Erdogan.   I can tell you all those things because they are true.   Someone please wake me up. I think I am having a nightmare.   I just spent my Thanksgiving and 2 weeks of my life--a lot of money  and a lot of time--away from my family to meet with brave people  spanning multiple ethnicities who, like the First Continental Congress,  have the recognition of exactly no foreign governments as a legitimate  emerging government; who are different from you and me only by virtue  of the happenstance of fate that they would be born somewhere as  opposed to another place; who have quite literally shed the lifeblood  of their children on battlefields that most Americans have never heard  of, from Deir ez-Zor, Manbij, Jarablus; people who fought, bled, and  died in homes that their families had inhabited in the Kabul River  valley, the Jazeera province; and who were the tip of President Trump's  spear in rooting out the combat components of a radical, warped,  hateful ideology embodied by Daesh or ISIS.   And today, without warning, we said good luck.   The Syrian Democratic Council is not a Kurdish experiment in north  and eastern Syria. It is an experiment that was largely started by  Kurds, yes, but it is an experiment that includes men and women from  across the ethnic and religious diversity of the region.   What we read about in any publication that comes out of Turkey, which  has about the worst press freedom on the planet, is how the PKK has  been engaged in terrorist activity in Turkey, and anyone affiliated  with the PKK by virtue of the accident of their birth as a Kurd is  somehow a terrorist. Folks, this is not true.   I met with everyone, from chief executives down to city councils.  When you go to Deir ez-Zor, where the bulk of the population is Arab,  the city council is Arab. And when you go to Manbij, the leadership is  Arab. And when you go to Jazeera, the leadership is Kurdish and  Christian, and it is male and female.   This Chamber that we stand in, in this venerated body, exists not  only because of the blood and sweat and tears of innumerable Americans  not only in the Revolution but throughout our history, but also because  foreigners were willing to stand up in support of an idea that was  freedom and self-determination: Lafayette, Pulaski, Kosciuszko, von  Steuben--German, Polish, French.   Yet again, we betray those who have shed their blood to advance  American policy.   Look, don't make the commitment to begin with. It is one thing to  learn that the United States has equivocated on its policy and people  died. It is another thing to learn that the United States is  equivocating on its policy and people with whom you have broken bread  are about to die.   I told them when I was there: I am here on my own time. I do not  formulate American policy. I happen to be a Member of Congress, but, by  God, I will stand up and be heard so that you might have the right that  was bequeathed to you, not by a political administration anywhere, but  by God, to live free of fear, to sleep soundly in your ancestral home,  to worship or not worship as you choose.   Ain Issa is the name of the town where, by happenstance, the Syrian  Democratic Council has put some functions of its government. Ain Issa  translates to English as the ``Eyes of Christ.'' You can't make this  up.   In my entire life, I have been proud of the 1 in 26 luck that I had  to slip from the womb the son of Lois and Tom Garrett in the  Commonwealth of Virginia, born in Georgia, in the greatest country on  the face of the planet.   But how many times must we muck up the endgame: the bloodletting in  Cambodia and Laos, the purges in Iraq after 1991, the betrayal of the  Kurds in 1985, the ignoring of vindictive revenge killings in 2004, the  encouragement and then withdrawal in 2017.   Ironically, Mr. Speaker, the Russians are far more loyal friends than  the Americans are. It is beyond me.   Somebody wake me up. I am having a nightmare.   To say that ISIS is defeated and that was our sole mission is, at the  very least, to exhibit a complete lack of understanding of what is  going on, on the ground.   I stood on the front lines near Jarablus by a building that was shot  up that day by the Free Syrian Army, who we funded, at a military post  manned by people of various ethnicities. And the Free Syrian Army did  this while the Turkish military watched.   Iranians seek to build a land bridge to the Mediterranean. Hezbollah  is a wholly owned subsidiary of Iran--it functions in Israel--and is  the only terrorist organization I know of that has taken human life on  every single inhabited continent--Oceania, Australia, Asia, Europe,  Africa, South America, North America. And we are just opening up the  door.   Eighty-seven people were killed in Deir ez-Zor province within 24  hours on either side of the time I visited. This wasn't a long time  ago. This was Thanksgiving.   This fight is long from over. Frankly, if I am an ISIS recruiter, the  idea that, ``Look, the Americans are leaving,'' will only strengthen  their position.   So let me make this metaphor, Mr. Speaker. We have a patient. That  patient is Syria. It is stricken with four cancers. There is the regime  in Russia; there is Turkey; there is Iran; and there is ISIS. We have  just eradicated the bulk of one cancer, dropped the scalpel, left the  surgery room, and declared that the patient is healed.  [[Page H10331]]    Candidly, the people in north and eastern Syria would be far better  off if we had never come to help, because the brave women and men who  have stood up to lead a democratic movement have identified themselves  for extermination.   I sat down in Manbij with the military council, with an individual,  it is my understanding, who was attacked with an IED the next day, and  we have declared victory. This was 2 weeks, 3 weeks ago.   So let me be clear, and let me counter some propaganda. When the only  people celebrating this decision are Turkey, Iran, and Russia, it might  be a bad decision. When you hear that the Syrian Democratic Council and  the forces in north and eastern Syria are Kurds, that defies the  reality on the ground, the reality that I saw, and the people with whom  I spoke.   The definition of insanity, Mr. Speaker, is doing the same thing  again and again and expecting a different result. Let me tell you what  I know, so that a month from now, I can say, ``See, I told you so,''  and maybe I will have that because 4-plus-or-minus million people in  north and eastern Syria won't even have so much as their homes.                                time  2130    Turkey is going into Manbij. They have been telling us that for a  month. They said: We have got to get the Kurds out of Manbij. Guess  what? The Kurds aren't controlling Manbij. The Syrian Democratic  Forces, which includes some Kurds, are in Manbij, but they are out.   This is like post-World War II Japan or Germany saying: You need to  get the African-American soldiers out of Berlin. It is racist on its  face, ridiculous, and denies the reality on the ground, and apparently,  nobody in the decision-making scheme has bothered to figure out what  the actual truth is.   So the Turks are going into Manbij. Now, what will that look like?  Well, we know what happened in Afrin and al-Bab. They fly the Turkish  flag over the courthouses. They have changed the street signs to honor  Ottoman sultans. I can show you a video, Mr. Speaker, of a paramilitary  police force raising their right hands in a Hitleresque salute  shouting: ``Long live Erdogan,'' in Turkish. This is on Syrian soil.   The children are educated in a different language. And the hospital  in Afrin, which used to have a sign outside in Kurdish and Arabic, now  has a sign outside in Turkish. In Jarabulus, the commanders with whom  we spoke said when Turkey came in and said they rooted out ISIS, we  looked through the field glasses the next day and lo and behold, the  same people that were there the day before in ISIS uniforms were there  in uniforms sanctioned by Turkey.   Oh, by the way, I just learned that we are going to sell $3.5 billion  worth of Patriot missile batteries to Turkey to go along with the F-35  fighters that I guess they can use to bomb the sovereign nation of Iraq  like they did last week in U.S. F-16s, perhaps this time more  effectively. This is insanity.   And I am not anti-this administration. I am not anti-this President.  I am anti-foolish policy that will cost human lives that will be  perpetuated and exacerbated by foolish foreign policy which preceded  it.   I am not suggesting we attack anybody. I am suggesting we don't turn  and walk away. People who depended upon us and took us at our word are  going to die, and we are worried about what we get for Christmas.   I mean, I don't have words. So, Mr. Speaker, I don't know what more I  can do. But I will not stop.   With great power comes great responsibility. Contrary to what some  people might say, we live in a great Nation. Our policy sucks. And to  walk away from commitments that we made because it is politically  convenient is beyond shameful. This matters. Iran is giddy. Erdogan is  giddy. The Russians have punked us, to use the jargon of the day. And  the band played on.   I don't know. Somebody wake me up. I am having a nightmare. I mean, I  represent the citizens of the Fifth District of Virginia, and I love  them. I love my district. But I value human life, and I believe that if  we make commitments, we should keep them. And if human life is lost  because we can't keep our word, we need to take a long, hard look at  exactly who we are.   Mr. Speaker, with that, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin  (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maine (Mr.  Poliquin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, very quickly back to Syria, if anyone tells  you that this is Turks versus Kurds, they should tell Sheikh Bandar,  the leader of thousands of Arabs who fight alongside the Kurds and the  SDF. If anyone tells you it is Turks versus Kurds, they should tell  that to Commander Johannes, the leader of thousands of Christians who  fight alongside Arabs and Kurds.   This is not a Kurdish experiment; it is a human experiment. It is an  experiment in democracy. We made a commitment. We should keep our word.   Mr. Speaker, if anyone is watching, I hope they will contact their  political leaders and ask them to stop the sale of Patriot missiles and  F-35s to the aggressive Turks. I hope they will know the Iranian  military is on the ground in Syria right now everywhere in the form of  the IRGC, except the place that we are about to abandon.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the men and women across the world who stand up  for the basic idea that all people are endowed by their creator with  certain inalienable rights, and among these are life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
