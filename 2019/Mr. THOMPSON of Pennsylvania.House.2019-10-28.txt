 Mr. Speaker, last week, we celebrated  Timber Innovation Day and National Forest Products Week.   The forest products industry plays an important role in many  communities around the Nation, including Pennsylvania, which is blessed  with some of the finest hardwoods in the world. In 2018, U.S. hardwood  exports were valued at $135 billion and employed roughly 700,000  people, nationwide.   In addition to its significant economic footprint, the industry also  provides numerous environmental benefits because managed forests  support proactive stewardship.   Unfortunately, times have been difficult for many timber producers in  recent years. While the industry continues to diversify and trade  negotiations progress, identifying new markets for American forest  products remains essential.   The Timber Renovation Act, which was included in the 2018 farm bill,  is one initiative I have been proud to support that does just that. It  encourages new markets by supporting research for wood products in  construction.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank our producers for the work that  they do.                            ____________________
