 Madam Chair, while in the district, I met with the Puerto  Rican Center of Arizona, including Gretchen Patterson, the founder and  president, Leticia Jimenez, Jose Moro, Claudio Medina, and Maria  Romero. They are advocates for Puerto Rico and have family members  still on the island. They work in Arizona communities to share the  culture of Puerto Rico and educate people about the island. They  described devastation on the island caused by Hurricane Maria. They  also talked about the problems with the electrical grid, even before  Hurricane Maria.   This legislation, H.R. 4606, will help Puerto Rico and other  Caribbean islands by expediting the approval of projects to export  small shipments of LNG to Caribbean island nations, which are in  desperate need of natural gas to modernize their electric grids and  supply more affordable fuel and feedstocks for manufacturing.   H.R. 4606 will also help our U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico and  the Virgin Islands who are still recovering from Hurricane Maria. While  the territories don't need a special permit to receive U.S. natural gas  shipments, they would certainly benefit if we allow more U.S. small- scale LNG exports to other destinations in the Caribbean.   H.R. 4606 will jump-start investments and jobs, which will create  economies of scale. With more competition, Puerto Rico and the Virgin  Islands will have more supply options and lower costs.   The Caribbean islands have some of the highest fuel and electricity  prices. We shouldn't deny them the opportunity to share in some of our  surplus natural gas.   H.R. 4606 isn't a silver bullet, but it will help deliver cleaner and  more affordable fuel to those remote locations.
