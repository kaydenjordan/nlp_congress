 Madam Speaker, when we come to the floor to talk about  the border crisis, it is a lot like the film Groundhog Day. If you  listen closely, I think you can hear ``I Got You Babe'' by Sonny and  Cher, and it is probably echoing through this Chamber as we speak. We  expect President Biden to do something about this disaster, Madam  Speaker, but just like in the movie, he does the same thing every  dadgum day--absolutely nothing.   Two million, thirty-five thousand, ten, that is how many migrants our  border agents apprehended at that southern border since President Biden  took office last January--over 2 million people. Hiding among the  massive crowds of people are smugglers working for drug cartels. They  are smuggling in children for all kinds of deviant things. In 2021,  over 860,000 pounds of drugs were confiscated from smugglers. More  concerning are the smugglers who are not caught.   Fentanyl is among the drugs flooding through the gaps in our southern  border. Just a tiny amount of this drug--as small as a pinhead--is  enough to kill everyone in this Chamber right now. Opioid-related  deaths in the United States topped over 100,000 for the first time last  year. 100,000 souls lost. Experts believe fentanyl is responsible for  this tragic milestone.                                time  1800    There should be severe punishments for fentanyl trafficking and  smuggling this stuff across our borders.   The Fentanyl Trafficker Elimination Act, legislation I recently  introduced, oddly enough, sends a clear message to these cartel thugs  about their fate if they are caught. Under my bill, convicted smugglers  would be locked up in an American prison for the rest of their lives.   More Americans will overdose on fentanyl and die if nothing is done  to deter drug smuggling activity or secure our southern border, Madam  Speaker, and our Vice President, the so-called border czar, is,  frankly, a joke.   Time is not on our side. President Biden cannot waste another day  ignoring the border crisis.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his, as always, more than a  lackluster attempt at governing.
