 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 298 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 298         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 734) to amend the Education Amendments of 1972       to provide that for purposes of determining compliance with       title IX of such Act in athletics, sex shall be recognized       based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics       at birth. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed       with. All points of order against consideration of the bill       are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and       shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Education and the Workforce or their respective designees.       After general debate the bill shall be considered for       amendment under the five-minute rule. In lieu of the       amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the       Committee on Education and the Workforce now printed in the       bill, it shall be in order to consider as an original bill       for the purpose of amendment under the five-minute rule an       amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 118-3. That amendment in the       nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. All       points of order against that amendment in the nature of a       substitute are waived. No amendment to that amendment in the       nature of a substitute shall be in order except those printed       in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution. Each such amendment may be offered only in the       order printed in the report, may be offered only by a Member       designated in the report, shall be considered as read, shall       be debatable for the time specified in the report equally       divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent,       shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject       to a demand for division of the question in the House or in       the Committee of the Whole. All points of order against such       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. Any Member may demand a separate vote in the House       on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the       bill or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute made       in order as original text. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 42) disapproving the action of the District of Columbia       Council in approving the Comprehensive Policing and Justice       Reform Amendment Act of 2022. All points of order against       consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The joint       resolution shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the joint resolution are waived. The       joint resolution shall be debatable for one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Oversight and Accountability or       their respective designees. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the joint resolution to final       passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit (if otherwise in order).     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Leger  Fernandez), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H1773]]  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 298 provides for  consideration of two measures, H.R. 734 and H.J. Res. 42.   The rule provides for H.R. 734, the Protection of Women and Girls in  Sports Act, to be considered under a structured rule, with 1 hour of  debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority  member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce or their  designees, and provides for one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.J. Res. 42,  disapproving the action of the District of Columbia Council in  approving the Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act  of 2022, under a closed rule, with 1 hour of debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Oversight and Accountability or their designees.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and in support of the  underlying pieces of legislation.   The Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act would reaffirm the  principle of fairness in opportunity within Title IX by specifying that  sex shall be recognized based solely on a person's reproductive biology  and genetics at birth.                                time  1230    Mr. Speaker, I am going to say something I never thought I would have  to say on the House floor, in Congress, or anywhere for that matter,  but here it is: women and men are different. That is not meant to be  controversial, mean-spirited, outlandish, or anything other than the  factual statement that it is.   Perhaps I can be more specific, Mr. Speaker. Women and men are  physically different. Women and men have different physical  characteristics, and that is okay. That is why Title IX exists: to  ensure that despite these differences, women and men have the same  opportunities.   Saying women and men are different does not lack empathy for people  who struggle with their identity. However, because some people struggle  with their identity should not and does not change facts.   Speaking of the facts, I would be remiss if I did not include some  for the House to consider, specifically in the context of athletics,  one study coming from the Duke University School of Law's Center for  Sports Law and Policy. They note the various differences between male  and female athletes leads to a 10 to 12 percent performance gap between  the sexes in athletic competition.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to submit for the Record the  results of this study.    Mr. Speaker, now we will hear that this bill is a  distraction or that it does nothing to address school safety issues,  but I couldn't disagree more.   We have seen women, strong women, women like Riley Gaines, speak to  the real harm female athletes experience from the issues we are  discussing today. For those who don't know, Riley is a former college  competitive swimmer--just like my own girls at home who are swimmers.   I had the chance to speak with Riley just last week. She shared  stories on how this problem has been branded on the left as taking away  inclusiveness, when in reality it is taking away opportunities from our  female athletes. Women are becoming collateral damage.   Riley told me stories about her competitor, a biological male,  sharing locker rooms and showers with teammates. She told me how a year  later one teammate who was quiet at the time wrote letters to her about  how the experience still traumatizes her.   Riley also shared a story of how when that same biological male  competitor won, she was asked to step away from the medal podium photo.  The sport she loved had been reduced to a photo op. That is not  progress. It is quite the opposite.   Riley reminded me that her story is not unique. In fact, I have a  list provided by Concerned Women for America where they documented over  100 instances of women needing the type of protection that H.R. 734  would provide.   So what do we know after all of this debate?   We know that women and girls like Riley have to face legitimate  safety and privacy concerns associated with sharing locker rooms with  competitors of the opposite sex. Women and girls have to face physical  safety concerns.   For example, there is a story of a biological male in North Carolina  participating in women's volleyball. This biological male spiked the  ball so forcefully into the face of a female competitor that he  seriously injured the young girl and caused lasting damage to her.   There is the story of Tamikka Brents, an MMA fighter, who had her  skull fractured and a concussion within 2 minutes of fighting a  transitioned fighter, Fallon Fox.   Women and girls have to face the lack of a level playing field and  stolen opportunities that come with it. As Riley speaks so eloquently  about, the fact is that these biological men steal championships and  associated opportunities from women. She would know.   Prior to transitioning, Lia Thomas, her competitor, was ranking in  the mid-500s in the men's competition. After transitioning and  competing against biological women, Lia Thomas finished first.   If this does not illustrate the unfairness of allowing biological  males to compete in women's sports, I don't know what will.   These women are Olympians and college all-Americans.   We also have to face the fact that biological men competing in sports  meant for women and girls has the effect of discouraging them. These  sports that are meant for women and girls and having to compete against  men, is discouraging.   Now they must face the inherent unfairness of competing against  biological men.   We know that sports participation has incredibly positive benefits  for participants, both from a physical and also from a mental health  perspective.   Since this phenomenon of biological men participating in women's  sports is relatively new, it is a problem that will only continue to  get worse if we don't act to stand up on their behalf.   Speaking of problems that will get worse if we don't act, I want to  turn now to H.J. Res. 42. This resolution would disapprove of the  District of Columbia Council's Comprehensive Policing and Justice  Reform Amendment Act of 2022.   Plain and simple, H.J. Res. 42 is about backing the blue.   In January of this year, the D.C. Council passed the Comprehensive  Policing and Justice Amendment Reform Act, effectively making the job  of our police officers even harder. Mayor Bowser declined to sign or  veto it, which allowed it to continue in the process ultimately  reaching here, the Congress, for disapproval.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to submit for the record four  letters of support for H.J. Res. 42 disapproving of the D.C. Council's  decision.   One letter is from the National Fraternal Order of Police. One letter  is from the National Association of Police Organizations. One letter is  from the United States Capitol Police Labor Committee. Finally, one  letter is from the Commonwealth of Virginia's attorney general.    Mr. Speaker, it is this last letter from Virginia's  attorney general that makes an important point. I am quoting directly  from the letter, ``Unfortunately, due to the proximity of our  communities, D.C.'s crime problem has become Virginia's crime  problem.''   What happens in the Nation's Capital certainly has consequences for  our neighboring communities, but I would also argue that it has  consequences across the country. The decisions made here often affect  decisions around the country and in other major cities.   Therefore, we must think carefully when we review legislation that  would allow outside groups to target individual officers and make it  more difficult for those officers to do their jobs. We certainly don't  want that to catch on.   D.C., as of this month compared to last year, has had total crime  rise 23 percent, seen homicides increase by 31 percent, and sexual  abuse crimes rise a staggering 84 percent.   Why we would be trying to implement measures alienating law  enforcement officers is beyond me. We should be doing everything we can  to show law enforcement officers that we stand with them, especially in  areas where crime is on the rise and out of control. We should make it  easier, not harder, for them to do their jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule, our female  athletes, and police officers here in the Nation's Capital and around  the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats have had ample opportunities to work with  Republicans during the 117th Congress on bills that protect students in  schools, including H.R. 7966, the STOP II Act, sponsored by  Representative Richard Hudson of North Carolina, that would have  increased funding for school resource officers and mental health  guidance counselors and would have provided Federal grants for better  securing our schools; and H.R. 7942, the Securing Our Students Act,  sponsored by Representative Burgess Owens of Utah, that would have  allowed school district to use unspent COVID-19 emergency relief funds  to improve school buildings and strengthen security.   Unfortunately, the Democrat then-majority blocked these bills from  coming to the House floor.   In addition, the House recently passed H.R. 5 which includes  provisions ensuring the rights of parents to be informed about violent  incidents in school and ensuring that school boards cannot censor the  voices of parents who are expressing concerns about any such violent  incidents.   This is not about bullying kids. It is about fairness. It is about  standing up for biological women and girls when no one on the left  seems to care about that.   Our colleagues across the aisle have even said it is okay for  biological males to share locker rooms and showers with biological  females even if they don't consent.   If supposed groups that support women oppose this bill, then they  don't support women. We aren't saying that they can't participate in  sports with children or biological males that might have a different  identity. We are not saying they can't participate in sports. We are  saying they must compete according to their biological sex.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Langworthy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, we have heard our Democratic colleagues  across the aisle talk about Republicans not caring about sexual abuse  of female athletes and it is going underreported. But not a single  Democrat voted for H.R. 5 which has language in it in the Parents Bill  of Rights to inform parents of violent activity going on at school.   This provision was put in, in part, because of circumstances that  happened in Loudoun County, Virginia, which kept a sexual assault by a  trans student of a young female under wraps, including even  transferring that student to another school where that student  committed an additional sexual assault. Not a single Democrat voted for  H.R. 5.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Alford).    Mr. Speaker, I flatly reject any talk of fearmongering  on behalf of Republicans on this side of the aisle.   Talk about fearmongering, we have just heard from our colleagues on  the other side of the aisle that, according to this bill, female  student athletes will be subject to violative exams. Nothing in this  bill talks about them being subject to exams, physical or otherwise,  only that they compete in the sports according to their biological sex  at birth.   Nothing in this bill prevents or says that transgender children  cannot participate in sports. We are only saying that, out of fairness  and safety for women and girls, students participate in sports  according to their biological sex. We are not preventing anyone from  participating in sports.   Mr. Speaker, again, I reiterate, the public safety legislation that  Republicans proposed in the 117th Congress that our colleagues on the  other side of the aisle opposed--bills that would increase funding for  school resource officers and mental health counselors, Federal grants  to secure schools, Securing Our Students Act, allowing districts to  claw back unspent COVID-19 funds to improve school buildings and  strengthen security--those bills were flatly rejected from the  Democrat-held majority at the time. Those bills would have done exactly  what they suggest that they want to do now. Maybe if we bring those  bills back, we will get their support.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this is the bill that they say is  demonizing: ``H.R. 734, to amend the Education Amendments of 1972 to  provide that for purposes of determining compliance with title IX of  such Act in athletics, sex shall be recognized based solely on a  person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth.''   ``Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit a  recipient from permitting males to train or practice with an athletic  program or activity that is designated for women or girls so long as no  female is deprived of a roster spot on a team or sport, opportunity to  participate in a practice or competition, scholarship, admission to an  educational institution, or any other benefit that accompanies  participating in the athletic program or activity.''   It makes me wonder, Mr. Speaker, if our colleagues on the other side  of the aisle have read this bill, given their vehement opposition to  it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close and yield myself  the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, they can say it all they want. It doesn't make it true.  This bill demonizes no one. It doesn't prohibit anyone from  participating in sports.   We have heard a lot about the trans community today and the high  percentage of trans students who committed suicide last year.   I want to reiterate: Those that are truly concerned about the mental  health status of trans students would have supported H.R. 7966, the  STOP II Act in the 117th Congress to provide additional funding for  mental health guidance counselors.   Again, I have read the text of the bill. There is nothing in it that  prohibits trans students from participating in sports. We are simply  saying that they must compete against their own biological sex.   Like I said at the beginning of my remarks, I never thought I would  have to say certain things on the House floor.   I never thought we would have to consider bills protecting sports for  women and girls or legislation to support law enforcement officers, but  if we don't support them, who will?    For me, those two things come naturally, and I think--I hope, anyway,  we are about to see robust support from both sides of the aisle on  these commonsense issues.   But even as I speak these words, I am aware that the President of the  United States has issued statements of administration policy on these  two bills stating his opposition and intent to veto them should they  reach his desk.   How sad we can't support all women and girls in athletics. How sad we  have decided to support activists over frontline police officers who  are contending with increases in crime across the board. But  unfortunately, this is where we are.   We heard today about the Utah law being vetoed and that it was for  students. In the State of Connecticut, it was one transgender student  that took the State championship away in State track and field from a  biological female.   Unfortunately, this is where we are. This is why these two bills are  necessary. Despite the statement from the President, I believe we must  act to advance these two important pieces of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the  underlying legislation it provides for.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Leger Fernandez is as  follows:     An Amendment to H. Res. 298 Offered By Ms. Leger Fernandez of New                                   Mexico         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 178) affirming the House of       Representatives' commitment to protect and strengthen Social       Security and Medicare. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 178.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time and  move the previous question on the resolution.
