 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the Reverend Perez  Gatling, the 13th pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Virginia Beach.  I thank him for his powerful and poignant prayer on the House floor and  know that his words will give Congress strength.   Known as ``the church that reaches out,'' Ebenezer Baptist Church is  the oldest African American church in the city of Virginia Beach and  has been the cornerstone of our community since 1859.   Pastor Gatling leads it by humble example, sharing with whomever he  meets his personal motto: ``I'm just a nobody trying to tell everybody  about somebody who can save anybody.''   Pastor Gatling is not only a faith leader, but also a mentor to so  many through his church's prolific community outreach, specifically,  for students of all ages.   Pastor Gatling is accompanied today by his loving family: Veleka  Gatling, Lewis Gatling, Russell Gatling, Cleo Gatling, Leo V. Williams,  Carolyn Williams, and Mary Bowen.   Thank you for joining us today. Thank you, Pastor Gatling, for  bringing your wise words and your wonderful family to visit us in  Congress.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my bipartisan  bill, H.R. 1200, the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment  Act of 2019.   In Congress, I have vowed to keep our Nation's veterans at the top of  my mind, and I plan to deliver on that promise through this critical  piece of legislation.   I represent a coastal Virginia district with eight major military  installations, including Naval Station Norfolk, the largest naval  station in the United States, so veterans are clearly a critical part  of my constituency, just as they are honored members of every  congressional district across America.   Our veterans put their lives on the line and are deployed far from  home to keep America safe. As a 20-year Navy veteran myself, I am proud  to bring a bill to the floor that would eliminate the erosions of  benefits they earned in service to our country.   The Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act would  recognize that the benefits we provide our veterans need to be  modernized and increased the same way that Social Security has raised  benefits to meet cost-of-living increases.                                time  1645    My bill enhances benefits for wartime disability compensation,  compensation for dependents, clothing allowance, dependency and  indemnity compensation to surviving spouses, and dependency and  indemnity compensation to children.   We have seen costs for disability care, clothing, and childcare  increase over the years, and it is vital that we continue to provide  benefits that actually meet the demands that our veterans see on the  ground.   A cost-of-living increase would aid veterans, their families, and  their survivors to help maintain the value of their benefits against  inflation. Without consistent increases, veterans and their families  may not be able to have a consistent quality of life into their later  years.   Providing quality benefits to our veterans and their dependents can  change lives, and Congress must honor the commitment to those American  heroes who served in harm's way so that we can live in peace at home.   I thank my colleagues on the Disability Assistance and Memorial  Affairs Subcommittee and my ranking member,   Mike Bost, for being a  cosponsor of this legislation, and I urge swift House passage so that  we can do our part to push this into law and help our Nation's  veterans.
