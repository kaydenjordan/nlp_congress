 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.    Madam Speaker, if this unanimous consent cannot be  entertained, I urge the Speaker and the majority leader to----    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Woodall for yielding to me  today.   Madam Speaker, I offered four amendments to improve this bill and  benefit northeastern Minnesota, but, like last week, all four were  rejected. They were not rejected on the merits, of course, but they  were rejected in the Rules Committee before even being debated on the  floor.   Two of my amendments would have removed onerous studies put in place  by seasoned politicians from the Twin Cities and Washington, D.C. These  studies in the committee report language are simply designed to delay  important job-creating mining projects in my district.  [[Page H4783]]    Unfortunately, these politicians play politics with the consequence  of killing jobs because, to them, our livelihood and these mining  projects are nothing more than some faraway idea in a faraway land.  Their well-funded interest groups oppose these jobs, so they attempt to  move the goalposts, lay down more red tape, require more studies, and  make it impossible--or at least attempt to make it impossible--to  permit.   I say this: we can do both. We can mine and keep our environment  pristine and clean.   However, to my constituents, these projects are a reality. These  good-paying jobs will put food on the table, and they will put gas in  our car and clothes on the backs of our children. These jobs will allow  us to work, recreate, play, and raise a family in northern Minnesota.   These projects not only mean good-paying, union-protected mining jobs  in cutting-edge industry, these projects can mean a larger property tax  base, increased enrollment in our schools, and a population growth in  our communities.   These mining projects are a big part of our economic engine, yet  Washington, D.C., and Twin City politicians can sneak language into a  committee report to undermine a fair process, while arbitrarily  rejecting my amendments.   Another amendment I introduced would have ensured no funding is  available to list the gray wolf under the Endangered Species Act. As I  testified last night at the Rules Committee, the gray wolf has  recovered. Even the Obama administration attempted to remove it from  the Endangered Species Act in 2013.   In northern Minnesota, wolf attacks on cattle and domestic pets are  becoming far too common, burdening our farmers who already are  struggling. One small northern Minnesota county alone accounted for 21  confirmed wolf attacks on cattle, and local officials expect the number  to be much higher, as many cattle that simply go missing are likely  wolf attacks.                                time  1245    Because the gray wolf is listed as Federally endangered, the  Minnesota Department of Natural Resources is unable to control them.  Our local experts, who truly understand the problem, have their hands  tied because politicians in this town, Washington, D.C., think they  know best. But they do not.    I thought my final amendment was a no-brainer, Madam  Speaker. It would have increased the Forest Products Timber Sale  program by a little more than $6 million. Because it is in the National  Forest System, it would have no negative budgetary effect.   The Forest Products Timber Sale program provides needed resources for  Forest Service personnel. It allows them to research, recycle forest  products, and find new ways to market them.   Meanwhile, an increase to this program means getting our loggers out  in the woods and creating jobs for our communities. This would have  directly benefited both Superior and Chippewa National Forests. It  would have allowed our loggers and our Forest Service personnel to  handle local environmental challenges like ensuring fallen trees do not  contribute to forest fires.   My amendments would have directly benefited the small, rural  communities in northern Minnesota. Unfortunately, powerful politicians  used the system to their advantage by rejecting my amendments and  preventing even an open debate on the issues.
