 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the work of Al  Kurland, who has dedicated nearly three decades to supporting youth and  families throughout the 13th Congressional District.   From his early efforts and grassroots engagement in Washington  Heights, Al's work has inspired countless youth advocates, social  justice activists, and civic mentors across the city of New York.   Al has long championed ensuring marginalized youth have a voice and  are empowered to thrive, and I am proud to recognize his contributions  today.   His latest essay, ``The Soul of Adolescence Aligns with the Heart of  Democracy,'' follows his journey of discovering his life's purpose and  his understanding of adolescent potential and wisdom.   His candor and vulnerability have led to countless young people  finding their full potential through community involvement,  strengthening our community.   Al Kurland has significantly contributed to our community. For that,  we are thankful.   I commend him for his unwavering dedication to all who call our city  home and applaud his tireless efforts to make our community stronger  for the next generation of civic leaders.                            ____________________
