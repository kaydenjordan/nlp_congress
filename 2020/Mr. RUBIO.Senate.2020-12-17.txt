 Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on  Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small  business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit that  drives our economy. It is my privilege to recognize a family-owned  small business committed to investing in its community. This week, it  is my pleasure to honor Aunt Catfish's on the River, of Port Orange,  FL, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   A long-time resident of Port Orange, Jim followed in the Galbreath  family tradition of entrepreneurship. His mother, Ann Galbreath,  founded and ran a restaurant called Marko's Drive-In in the 1950s.  After it closed briefly, Jim bought Marko's and reopened it. Building  on his experience, Jim used an old fishing dock to open a new  restaurant in 1979, Aunt Catfish's on the River.   More than 40 years later, Aunt Catfish's on the River is still  family-owned and operated. Jim's son, Brendan Galbreath, who started as  a teenager, took the helm, keeping the business in the family. Under  his leadership, Aunt Catfish's has stayed true to its reputation for  outstanding service and delicious cuisine.   The Galbreath family's focus on building strong relationships with  their community is a key part of their success. During the coronavirus  pandemic, Aunt Catfish's opened a drive-through operation and expanded  its carryout services. Brendan served on the Port Orange South Daytona  Chamber of Commerce/City of Port Orange Reopening Task Force, working  with local business owners, civic leaders, and public health experts.  Together, they designed and implemented the Port Orange Phase One  Reopening Plan, enabling their community to reopen safely.  Additionally, Aunt Catfish's on the River participated in the chamber's  ``I Am, I Go, I Support Local'' campaign to support local businesses.   Like many Florida small businesses, Aunt Catfish's on the River  experienced a sharp drop in revenue due to the coronavirus pandemic. In  April 2020, the U.S. Small Business Administration launched the  Paycheck Protection Program, a small business relief program that I was  proud to author. The PPP provides forgivable loans to impacted small  businesses and nonprofits who maintain their payroll during the COVID- 19 pandemic. Aunt Catfish's on the River used their PPP loan to keep  their employees paid, while maintaining the highest health and safety  standards for their customers.   Aunt Catfish's on the River is a notable example of the endurance and  resilience of family-owned small businesses. Through their advocacy and  service, Aunt Catfish's on the River has strengthened their local small  business community. Congratulations to Brendan and the entire team at  Aunt Catfish's on the River. I look forward to watching your continued  growth and success.                            ____________________
