 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Arkansas.    I send a question to the desk for the President's counsel  on behalf of myself and Senators Boozman, McSally, Blackburn, Kennedy,  and Toomey.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senators ask the President's counsel:         Did the House bother to seek testimony or litigate       executive privilege issues during the month during which it       held up the impeachment articles before sending them to the       Senate?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, no, the House did  not seek to litigate any of the privilege issues during that time. In  fact, they filed no lawsuits arising from this impeachment inquiry to  seek to contest the bases that the Trump administration gave for  resisting the subpoenas, the bases for why those subpoenas were  invalid.   When litigation was filed by one of the subpoena recipients--that was  Dr. Charles Kupperman, the Deputy National Security Advisor--he went to  the court and sought a declaratory judgment, saying: The President has  told me I shouldn't go. I have a subpoena from the House saying I  should go. Please, courts, tell me what my obligations are.   I believe that was filed around October 25. It was toward the end of  October.   Very shortly, within a few days, the court had set an expedited  briefing schedule and scheduled the hearing for December 10. They were  supposed to hear both preliminary motions to dismiss and also the  merits issue.   So they were going to get a decision after a hearing on December 10  that would go to the merits of the issue, but the House managers  withdrew the subpoena. The House of Representatives decided they wanted  to moot out the case so they wouldn't get a decision.   So, no, the House has not pursued litigation to get any of these  issues resolved. It has affirmatively avoided getting into any  litigation. That seems to be at least in part based on--if you look at  the House Judiciary Committee report--their assertion that under the  sole power of impeachment assigned to the House, the House believes  that the Constitution assigns--I believe the exact words are that it  gives the House the last word, something to that effect.   I mentioned this the other day. This is the new constitutional theory  that because they have the sole power of impeachment, in their view, it  is actually the paramount power of impeachment and that all other  constitutionally based privileges or rights or immunities or roles,  even, of the other branches--both the judiciary and the executive--fall  away, and there is nothing that can stand in the way of the  [[Page S653]]  House's power of impeachment. If they issue a subpoena, the executive  has to respond, and it can't raise any constitutionally based  separation of powers concerns. If you do, that is obstruction of the  courts. The courts have no role. The House has the sole power of  impeachment.   That is a very dangerous construct for our Constitution. It suggests  that once they flip the switch on to impeachment, there is no check on  their power and what they want to do. That is not the way the  Constitution is structured. When there are interbranch conflicts, the  Constitution requires that there be an accommodation process, that  there be attempts to address the interests of both branches.   The House has taken the position--and in other litigation--the McGahn  litigation--they are telling the courts that the courts are the only  way to resolve these issues. They brought that case in August. They  already have a decision from the district court. They have an appeal in  the DC Circuit. It was argued on January 3. A decision could come any  day. That is pretty fast for litigation. But in this impeachment, they  have decided that they don't want to do litigation. Again, it is  because they had a timetable. One of the House managers admitted it on  this floor. They had to get the President impeached before the  election. They had no time for the courts, for anyone telling them what  the rules were. They had to get it done by Christmas, and that is what  they did. Then they waited around a month before bringing it here.   I think that shows you what is really behind the claims of, oh, it is  urgent, then it is not urgent. It was urgent when it was our timetable  to get it done by Christmas. It is not so urgent when we can wait for a  month because we want to tell the Senate how to run things. It is all a  political charade.   That is part of the reason--a major reason--that the Senate should  reject these Articles of Impeachment.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.
