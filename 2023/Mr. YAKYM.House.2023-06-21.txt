 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight a very special  group of Hoosiers.   Last Saturday, the Penn High School baseball team shut out top-ranked  Center Grove 2-0 to win the Class 4A State championship for the second  straight year.   Their victory Saturday marks the first time in program history that  the Kingsmen have repeated as State champs, and now it is the sixth  State crown under Hall of Fame Coach Greg Dikos' belt.   The Kingsmen's big win came just 1 week after the Lady Kingsmen  softball team also won the State title, making Penn just the second  school in Indiana history to win a softball and baseball State  championship in the same year.   The most exciting moment in Saturday's game came in the bottom of the  fourth inning when senior center fielder Cooper Hums laid out for an  amazing, over-the-shoulder diving catch. In fact, Cooper's catch was so  spectacular that it landed him a top spot on ``SportsCenter's Top 10''  playlist. I watched the clip, and it is worth your time to watch.    Congratulations to Cooper, Coach Dikos, and all the Kingsmen on  defending their title and for bringing another State championship back  to the Second District.   God bless them, and Go Kingsmen.
