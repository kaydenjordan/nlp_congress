 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ben Kueter  of Iowa City who took down Hempstead's Joe Lewis in a technical fall to  win his fourth State title in wrestling--only the 32nd time in the  history of the Iowa State wrestling tournament.   He is also the seventh to complete an undefeated high school career,  with an outstanding record of 111-0 with 105 career bonus point wins.   In addition to winning his fourth State title and shattering records  in Iowa, Ben also holds a world title in wrestling. Just this summer,  he represented Iowa on the world stage and won gold at the Junior Men's  Freestyle World Championship.   An all-star athlete and senior at Iowa City High School, Ben excels  in more than just wrestling. He has also been a star member of the  football, baseball, and track teams.   Ben's proudest accomplishment, though, is being a good role model for  future wrestlers. He always makes time to talk to and take pictures  with younger wrestlers at tournaments and makes it a priority to keep  things fun.    I am proud of Ben's accomplishments, and I join all of Iowa in being  proud that he continues to represent our State at the highest levels.   I am also honored that he has chosen to continue his wrestling career  in Iowa City at the University of Iowa.   Go Hawkeyes!                        Texas Christian University Day     Mr. Speaker, today is also TCU or Texas Christian  University Day at the Capitol in Washington, D.C. As an alum of Harris  College of Nursing at TCU, I welcome TCU to Washington, D.C.   As long as TCU is not playing an Iowa team, I can say, ``Go Frogs!''                   Healthy Healthcare Debate Among Parties     Mr. Speaker, yesterday, February 26, The Wall  Street Journal released another article about the origins of COVID-19.  This time, the Department of Energy has acknowledged that most likely  this was a lab leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.   I remember having a hearing here in the Capitol with the Select  Committee on the Coronavirus Pandemic at which we discussed the origins  of COVID-19. We were derided and we were ridiculed, as were other  Members of Congress.   I think it is important that we recognize there is such an importance  for free speech, especially in healthcare and in medicine and science,  that a debate is what needs to take place and that we should be careful  in who we chastise simply because we don't like the political party  that they represent.   It was no conspiracy to acknowledge that there was not furin cleavage  sites normal, that there were doubling of amino acids, and that there  was gain-of-function research that had been funded indirectly by the  United States Government despite a prohibition on gain-of-function  research.   To this day, there has not yet been an intermediate host for SARS- CoV-2, although there was very rapidly with both SARS and MERS.   My point is that we need to recognize that we can have differences of  opinion and those should not be considered to be radical or conspiracy  theories, despite what political party that emanates from.                            ____________________
