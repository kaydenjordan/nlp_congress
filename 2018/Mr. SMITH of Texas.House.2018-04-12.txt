 Mr. Speaker, first of all, I thank the gentleman  from Virginia, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for yielding me  time and also for his tireless efforts over the years to pass a  balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.   Mr. Speaker, today the House of Representatives votes to protect  future generations from our debilitating debt. Thomas Jefferson  believed that ``the public debt is the greatest of dangers to be  feared.'' He wished ``it were possible to obtain a single amendment to  our Constitution taking from the Federal Government the power of  borrowing.''   It is past time that we listen to Jefferson's commonsense advice.  American families balance their checkbooks. States and local  governments balance their budgets. So should the Federal Government.   The last balanced budget occurred in the 1990s. The previous balanced  budget was during the Eisenhower administration. Surely it is not too  much to ask that we take a major step towards having a balanced budget  in our future.   Mr. Speaker, only a balanced budget amendment wil guarantee that the  Federal Government puts its fiscal house in order and keeps it that  way.
