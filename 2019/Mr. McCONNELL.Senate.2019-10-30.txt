 Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will vote on  funding for the national defense. It will offer a test for our  Democratic colleagues: Will their party's impeachment obsession crowd  out even the most basic governing responsibilities?   Unfortunately, it seems we may already have our answer. The  Democratic leader said at a press conference yesterday that his party  intends to filibuster funding for our Armed Forces. Democrats have  plenty of time and energy for their 3-year-old journey to impeach the  President, but they can't get to yes on funding our servicemembers.  That is about as clear a statement of priorities as you could get  around here.   Just a few days ago, U.S. Special Forces executed a daring mission  and took out the founder of ISIS. It was the clearest possible reminder  that the national security of the United States and the missions of our  servicemembers do not pause for partisan politics. But less than a week  later, for political purposes, Senate Democrats say that they will  refuse to secure funding for those very same missions.   Washington Democrats have talked up a storm in recent days,  criticizing the administration's approach to Syria and the Middle East.  Lots of talk--but, apparently, they are not concerned enough about the  Middle East and fighting ISIS to actually vote for the funding that  keeps the missions going.   Consider this. If Democrats filibuster this defense funding, as they  threatened to, they will literally be filibustering the exact kind of  military assistance for Ukraine over which they are trying to impeach  the President.   Let me say that again. This legislation is what appropriates the  money for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which is  precisely the program that Democrats are trying to impeach President  Trump for supposedly slow-walking. Yet, tomorrow, right here in the  Senate, they say that they are going to filibuster funding for the  exact same program.   Only in Washington--only in Washington will you see a show like that.   They want to impeach the President for delaying assistance to Ukraine  while they block funding for the program themselves. I would say it is  unbelievable, except that is exactly what is happening.   Look, I think it is pretty clear that our Democratic colleagues do  not have a great affinity for President Trump. But the country cannot  afford for Democrats in Congress to take a 1-year vacation from any  productive legislation just because they would rather obsess over  impeachment.   ISIS and other radical terrorists are not going to hit the pause  button because Democrats will not fund the U.S. military. Strategic  competitors like Russia and China are not going to hit pause because  Democrats would rather hurt the White House than fund our military  commanders.   Look, Congress needs to do its work. We need to fund our Armed  Forces. Tomorrow's vote will tell us which Senators are actually ready  to do it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, speaking of impeachment, yesterday,  House Democrats released their much-hyped resolution, which was  advertised as bringing fairness and due process into Speaker Pelosi's  and Chairman Schiff's closed-door, partisan inquiry. Unfortunately, the  draft resolution that has been released does nothing of the sort. It  falls way short--way short.   As I have said repeatedly, an impeachment inquiry is about the most  solemn and serious process the House of Representatives can embark  upon. It seeks to effectively nullify Democratic elections and cancel  out the American people's choice of a Commander in Chief.   For that reason, any such inquiry must be conducted by the highest  standards of fairness and due process. But thus far, this time around,  instead of setting a high bar, House Democrats seem determined to set a  new low.   Speaker Pelosi has initiated a bizarre process, starting with the  fact that she began it with a press conference instead of a proper vote  of the House. The process seems to be treating Chairman Schiff as  though he were a de facto special prosecutor, notwithstanding the fact  that he is a partisan Member of Congress whose strange behavior has  already included fabricating a lengthy quotation and attributing it to  President Trump during an official hearing, which he was chairing.   House Democrats' inquiry thus far has been conducted behind closed  doors. They have denied their Republican counterparts privileges that  Democrats received during the Clinton impeachment when they were in the  minority. Unlike during the inquiries around both President Clinton and  President Nixon, they have denied President Trump basic due process  rights and are cutting his counsel out of the process in an  unprecedented way.   House Democrats' new resolution does not change any of that. It does  not  [[Page S6263]]  confer on President Trump the most basic rights of due process or,  seemingly, alter Chairman Schiff's unfair process in the House  Intelligence Committee in any way whatsoever.   Chairman Schiff can continue doing this behind closed doors without  the President's participation, so long as he holds at least one public  hearing at some point. He is not even required to make all the evidence  he obtains public. He alone gets to decide what evidence goes in his  report. And the resolution doesn't even give the President any rights  in the public hearing that it requires Chairman Schiff to hold.   The resolution merely seems to contemplate that maybe--maybe--someday  in the future, at some other phase of this, due process might--might-- finally kick in, but only if the House Judiciary Committee feels like  holding hearings and calling its own witnesses--in other words, no due  process now, maybe some later, but only if we feel like it.   ``No due process now, maybe some later, but only if we feel like it''  is not even close to fair. ``No due process now, maybe some later, but  only if we feel like it'' is not a standard that should ever be applied  to any American, and it should not be applied here to the President of  the United States.   I understand that many House Democrats made up their minds on  impeachment years ago, but our basic norms of justice do not evaporate  just because Washington Democrats have already made up their minds.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, our Democratic  colleagues do apparently have time to push for show votes on messaging  resolutions with no chance of becoming law. This week's installment is  a Democratic effort to limit the flexibility that Governors of both  parties have utilized to lighten the burdens of ObamaCare. States have  jumped at the opportunity to use waivers to reduce the costs associated  with ObamaCare's mandate. In the States that have taken advantage,  premiums decreased significantly.   In 2018, the Trump administration expanded this policy with an even  more flexible interpretation of this part of ObamaCare. The goal was to  give States even more of what they had been asking for, even more  latitude to preserve consumer choice and lower premiums. But  notwithstanding all the evidence that says this is the right direction  for the American people, our Democratic colleagues want to roll back  the Trump administration guidance and limit States' flexibility.   Since this position is virtually impossible to explain on its merits,  our Democratic colleagues have instead turned to a familiar talking  point: the false claim that Republicans are trying to undercut  protections for Americans with preexisting conditions. Sound familiar?  But, of course, that is not true.   As Senate Republicans have said over and over and over again, we  support protections for Americans with preexisting conditions. And the  administration has made it very clear that this waiver program poses no  threat--no threat--to those protections. The Administrator of the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has stated that ``a section  1332 waiver cannot''--cannot--``undermine coverage with people with  pre-existing conditions.''   What is more, as the White House has already made clear, Democrats'  resolution has zero chance of becoming law. This is just another  political messaging exercise with no path to making an impact.   I urge my colleagues to reject this resolution, keep fighting to  lower premiums for the American people, and protect those with  preexisting conditions.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due for a second reading.
