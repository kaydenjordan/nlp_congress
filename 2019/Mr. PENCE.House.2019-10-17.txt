 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate legislation the House  passed this week to name the post office in Indianapolis after the late  Senator Richard Lugar.   Senator Lugar was a true statesman who served his country and the  State of Indiana with pride. He will be remembered as one of America's  greatest Senators, leaving his mark on domestic and global affairs  throughout his six terms.   Senator Lugar was an essential part of American diplomacy and strived  for peace throughout the globe. In 2013, Lugar's lasting contributions  and decades of service to this great country earned him the  Presidential Medal of Freedom.   Our Nation is stronger and safer because of Senator Lugar, and I  thank my colleagues for supporting legislation to honor his legacy.                   Positive Impact of U.S.-Japan Trade Deal     Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight the positive impact the  new U.S.-Japan trade deal will have on our Nation and on the Hoosier  State.   Japan is an important ally of the United States and a critical  trading partner that benefits the Hoosier economy. Japan is heavily  invested in the Hoosier State and in Indiana's Sixth Congressional  District.   Of the 19 counties in the Sixth District, Japan is currently invested  in 14 of them. This trade deal will help increase those investments in  our local communities, creating opportunities and jobs for many  Hoosiers. In Congress, we must build upon this successful trade  agreement President Trump has struck with the American people.   We can and we must pass the USMCA, which will increase opportunities  for workers and farmers across this country. I urge my colleagues to  continue to support these trade deals.   Congratulating the Winchester News-Gazette on Serving Hoosiers for 175                                   Years     Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Winchester News- Gazette on celebrating their 175th year as a newspaper.   Previously called the Winchester Patriot, Hoosiers in Randolph County  have relied on the News-Gazette for local news since 1844.   Local press is essential to a thriving community and is a prime  example of the First Amendment in action.   Congratulations to the Winchester News-Gazette on serving Hoosiers  for 175 years.       Congratulating Muncie-Delaware Chamber of Commerce on 125 Years     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Muncie-Delaware  Chamber of Commerce for celebrating their 125th anniversary.   The chamber has been an integral part of the greater Muncie community  since 1894. Their strategy for engaging large, medium, and small  businesses has been the driving factor behind the thriving economy in  the city of Muncie and Delaware County.   Congratulations to the Muncie-Delaware County Chamber of Commerce.                           Recognizing Rolls-Royce     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Rolls-Royce for the  tremendous work they are doing in my Hoosier State. I recently visited  both the Rolls-Royce Indianapolis headquarters and the Rolls-Royce  LibertyWorks plant, which produces more Rolls-Royce products than  anywhere else in the world.   Rolls-Royce employs 4,000 Hoosiers, and in recent years, invested  hundreds of millions of dollars to create world-class engines and  products that are on the cutting edge of our national defense.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Rolls-Royce for the great work they are  doing for Indiana and the United States.                            ____________________
