 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, today there are thousands--thousands-- of American servicemembers in Afghanistan defending us from terrorist  organizations and their sponsors. They are joined by servicemembers and  support personnel from allied nations and security partners. Each one  of these lives is precious to a nation and to a family somewhere. Each  one of us in this Chamber recognizes the solemn duty we have to our  servicemembers.   We are all concerned about media reports that the Russian Government  or its proxies has been offering bounties on the lives of American  soldiers to Taliban-linked fighters in Afghanistan. The Associated  Press has reported that the United States is investigating whether  Americans died as a result of Russian bounties and is particularly  focused on a 2019 attack that killed three U.S. marines, including one  young man from Locust Valley, Long Island, NY, and another who worked  as a firefighter in the FDNY--the great FDNY--for 15 years. On behalf  of my constituents and the American people, I demand answers.   If, in fact, Putin and his cronies have been sponsoring the murder of  American and coalition forces in Afghanistan, there is no question  there should be swift and severe consequences. But unlike every  previous administration I have ever worked with, the Trump  administration has been shockingly weak-kneed when it comes to  authoritarian leaders like Putin. This administration appears unwilling  to even acknowledge the gravity of the situation, unwilling to even  express concern about these rumors and commit to investigating them.  [[Page S3981]]    The shifting explanations from the White House about when and how the  President learned about these reports has only added to the confusion  and concern here on Capitol Hill. First, the President tweeted ``Nobody  briefed me or told me'' about the reports. That is what he said: Nobody  briefed him or told him. Then the President hinted he was aware of  these reports but that it didn't rise to the level of an official  briefing. The White House Press Secretary repeatedly denied that the  President had been briefed. Then, last night, the Associated Press  reported that President Trump had received intelligence about these  potential bounties as early as spring of last year--the spring of last  year.   Out of all of those different explanations, the best case--the best  case--for the President is that he doesn't read sensitive intelligence  reports. You know, that is his job.   It has been 5 days since media reports informed the world of Putin's  alleged bounty program. What has the President done? He hasn't  condemned it. He hasn't told servicemembers and their families he will  make sure this alleged program is exposed and ended. He hasn't directed  any action against Putin and his cronies whatsoever. He has done  absolutely nothing--nothing.   As the Commander in Chief, the President has no more serious and  solemn duty than to do right by the Americans in uniform who protect  our country. He is directly responsible, and must be held accountable,  for the well-being of American servicemembers who have volunteered to  put themselves in harm's way to protect our country. The least  President Trump could do is promise to get to the bottom of these  allegations and hold Putin and his cronies accountable for their  actions. Even that--even that--seems beyond the administration's  capabilities.   In the short term, we need an agreement from the administration to  conduct an immediate all-Members briefing on the reports that Russia  placed bounties on U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Senators need to hear  directly from CIA Director Haspel on these reports as soon as possible.                                 Coronavirus    Madam President, the number of new COVID-19 cases is accelerating at  an alarming rate through several States, and the economic effects of  the pandemic continue to hammer American families and businesses across  the country.   Over one-fifth--one-fifth--of the workforce has requested  unemployment assistance--one-fifth. In one month, the expanded  unemployment benefits we passed in the CARES Act will expire. For  millions of Americans, another rent payment is due tomorrow, and  eviction protections will run out for these tenants in a few weeks.  School districts are preparing for the fall without the resources or  the guidance they need to reopen safely. Localities are preparing for  the 2020 general election and need Federal resources to hold safe  elections. Even the popular and bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program  runs out of lending authority today, with over $130 billion in  remaining funds, while so many small businesses continue to struggle.  They have $130 billion sitting there. The program runs out today, and  our Republican colleagues are doing nothing.   There are so many urgent priorities that require our attention here,  but the Senate Republican majority has been ignoring them. Instead of  working in a bipartisan way to reform police departments across the  country, Senate Republicans dropped an inadequate partisan bill on the  floor. After it failed, the Republicans didn't seem eager to start the  bipartisan negotiations we need to get progress back on track.   Instead of spending the last 45 days working with Democrats on  legislation to address the public health and economic crises Americans  are facing due to the coronavirus pandemic, Republicans just sat on  their hands. In fact, Leader McConnell seems dead set on delaying any  COVID-19 relief until after the Fourth of July holiday, and even then,  he said he wants to assess the conditions in the country before taking  action.   We just can't wait for our Republican colleagues to wake up to the  reality in this country. People are losing their homes. People are not  being fed. People are losing their jobs. Small businesses are closing.  COVID-19 is spreading.   The Republican majority does nothing. It sits on its hands. The best  it says, in the voice of the leader: Let's assess the situation.   What more do we need to assess? The American people don't need an  assessment. They want action--action. It is amazing. We cannot wait-- the country cannot wait--for our Republican colleagues to wake up to  the reality.   Senate Democrats are forcing action on the floor this week on a  number of crucial issues. Last night, Democrats asked our colleagues to  pass emergency funding for State, local, and Tribal governments that  are finalizing their budgets today and may be forced to cut vital  services and lay off teachers, firefighters, and other public  employees. Senate Republicans, however, have blocked our bill.   Hopefully, our Republican colleagues will not be so hasty to reject  our attempt to start work on several other urgent priorities this week.  Today, Democrats will come to the floor to ask this body to take up  legislation on safe elections, led by my colleague Senator Klobuchar;  education funding, led by my colleague Senator Murray; and funding for  our nursing homes, championed by Senator Casey. All three will ask  unanimous consent requests. Will our Republican friends block action  once again as the country suffers, as the economy continues to decline,  as more people get sick, and more people die?    These are not abstract issues--not at all. This is about parents  making sure their kids safely continue their education. This is about  making sure elderly relatives are healthy and safe and properly cared  for. This is about making sure that, when it comes time to vote, every  American can exercise the franchise without worrying about getting  sick.   The need for these pieces of legislation is beyond dispute. When most  Republicans back home are asked if we should do these things, they want  us to do them.   We have only a few days to go before the Senate adjourns for the next  State work period. If Republicans continue to block reasonable attempts  at passing COVID-19 legislation, they will have to go home and explain  why to their constituents. Americans are tired of waiting for the  Republican Senate to ``feel the urgency of acting immediately.'' We  have a chance tonight to accomplish what should have been done months  ago and pass three important bills to ensure that our schools, our  elections, and our nursing homes get the support they desperately need.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, before my colleague from Utah wishes to  object, may I say a few words?  [[Page S4015]]     Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington State  for introducing this legislation, which I am proud to cosponsor.   Education is the future foundation of our success in America. It has  always been. When a crisis occurs, we have to stand by those who  educate our kids, and, most importantly, our kids themselves, whether  they be in preschool, whether they be in K-12, or whether they be in  higher education.   There are so many different ways that this crisis has affected our  schools, and, frankly, if our schools can't open in September, millions  of Americans who want to go back to work and who could go back to work  will not be able to because they have to be home taking care of their  kids. There is a need to really step up to the plate in a real way and  improve education over the long run, but at the same time not let it  deteriorate because the coronavirus has so affected our schools in so  many different ways.   I would hope that this body would pass this measure. It is vital-- vital--to get our economy going, vital to resume the education of our  kids, vital to make sure that classrooms can function in a healthy way,  and vital to providing the kind of childcare that people need as well.   I hope that my colleagues, again, would support this legislation. It  is so important. If America is going to have a great future--and I hope  and pray and believe we will--we are going to have to have the best  schools in the country, and if we are a country that lets a pandemic  hurt our schools badly so they will take years to recover, woe is us.   So I thank my colleague from Washington State for introducing this  measure. I am for it. Even if there is objection here, we will be  coming back to this issue because it is so, so important for the future  of our country. I appreciate the gentleman from Utah yielding, and I  appreciate the good works of my colleagues who have put together this  legislation    Mr. President, let me salute Senator Cardin and Senator  Shaheen for bringing this measure to the floor and forcing our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle to relent, who, originally,  of course, wanted to block this bill all day long. It is going to  benefit two groups of people. The first, very simply, are those  businesses whose businesses had gone bad in the last few months.   When this proposal was passed, plain and simple, the economy everyone  thought, might get better sooner. It hasn't, and there are large  numbers of businesses that are going to need to apply now. Had this  program run out today, they would have been out of luck. Now, with this  renewal, in short time, August 8, they at least get the chance to  reapply.   But there is a second group. This program was rolled out very poorly  by the administration. We all know that. We had to come back and fix it  twice. There are many businesses in New York and elsewhere that applied  initially and were rejected or that went to their bank and their banks  said no because this program was not aimed at helping the smaller  businesses by the administration, as they rolled it out.   The guidance that was supposed to be issued--and all the other things  that happened--didn't happen. There are many businesses that were  rejected the first time. I talked to many in New York in the last few  weeks: Can I apply again? Now it has been straightened out because of  the good work that Cardin and Shaheen and we Democrats did, forcing the  Republicans to help small businesses.   They originally just wanted to renew the PP Program as is, and we  said no. We said no, and we got a much better bill. These businesses  can now apply again with the new guidelines that were passed in COVID  3.5, and that is a very good thing.   I would recommend to our small businesses that have been rejected to  reapply because it might be available to you again.   Let me say, this shouldn't have happened. Our Republican colleagues  have been missing in action on COVID-19 throughout--on small business,  on unemployment insurance, on aid to localities, and on so many other  issues. The only reason we are here tonight is that we Democrats said  we are going to force you to come here with the unanimous consent  statement.   Let us hope--there is always hope here--that this will repeat itself;  that our Republican colleagues will see that sticking their heads in  the ground, following Leader McConnell, who said that we will have to  assess the situation--I guess tonight we are not assessing the  situation, but thank God we are acting--that we will move forward on  issue after issue after issue.   We have many more UCs this week. The need to pass those UCs is every  bit as pressing as to move this UC. Maybe they will relent again, and  maybe they will come back and say we need to negotiate.   Speaker Pelosi and I have asked Leader McConnell to sit down and  negotiate now. No, no way, no negotiation.   We have had to push our Republican friends to help small business, to  help the unemployed, to help those who rent, and so many other people,  and to help States and localities. They didn't want to do any of it.  But tonight might be a metaphor for what is going to happen in the  future as we move to the Heroes Act. Our Republican friends, pressured  by the very people in their own States, who desperately need help, will  have to say yes, we agree with you.   But I have to say that this happened tonight not because of  bipartisan action, as much as I would like to see bipartisan action in  this body. It happened because Democrats said we are going to go to the  floor and demand a UC. Until the last minute, our Republican friends  said we are going to block it for one reason or another. Thank God they  didn't. They deserve praise for not doing it. But let's make no mistake  about it. This is not the end. This is the beginning. We have a lot  more to do for small business and for many other parts of our economy  and our healthcare system that are struggling and suffering. They need  action. We need bipartisanship like we saw tonight in these areas as  well.   I yield floor
