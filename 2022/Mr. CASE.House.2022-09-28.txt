 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 6965,  the Visit America Act.   U.S. travel and tourism is one of our country's core industries. Pre- COVID, it generated some $2.6 trillion in annual economic output, was  one of our largest export and service industries, and supported fully 1  in 10 U.S. jobs. In many States, my own Hawaii being a prime example,  it is our leading industry.                                time  1630    But COVID taught us in spades how fragile this economic and jobs  generator can be. Very frankly, it has never earned full respect in  terms of Federal Government attention, focus, and support, given its  prominence.   U.S. travel and tourism needs and deserves far more. This bill, in  which I am joined by the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Titus), the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), our House Travel and Tourism  Caucus, and other colleagues, in addition to all aspects of the  industry, is a necessary start on a new chapter through a coordinated,  high-level Federal effort, including a 10-year travel and tourism  strategy and finally, finally, like other countries, an Assistant  Secretary of Commerce for Travel and Tourism.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge its passage.
