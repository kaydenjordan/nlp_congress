 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the city of Louisville will lay to  rest Officer Nick Rodman, a loving husband, father, son, and friend,  who died in the line of duty last week.   The special commitment that the men and women of law enforcement make  to protect and serve their fellow citizens is one that the Rodman  family holds dear, and Nick felt that call to service deeply, growing  up as the son and brother of fellow officers.   He is survived by the loves of his life: his wife, Ashley; his young  son, Mason; and his newborn daughter, Ellie Jean.   I ask my colleagues and our Nation to join me, the Louisville Metro  Police Department, and our entire city in honoring this public servant  as he is laid to rest.   To Nick's wife, Ashley: I hope the memories you have with your  husband will be a source of comfort as you face this heartbreaking  tragedy. The city of Louisville joins you in grief, and we will ensure  that Nick will always be remembered.                            ____________________
