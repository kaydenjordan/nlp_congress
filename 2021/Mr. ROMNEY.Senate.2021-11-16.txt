 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the esteemed  legacy of my friend, Arne Sorenson, who passed away earlier this year.  Arne's many accomplishments in his personal and professional life  continue to profoundly impact the lives of many. Most recently, Arne's  Marriott family, numbering over 120,000 employees, witnessed his high- caliber leadership as he navigated the company through a turbulent  period in the hospitality industry. Arne was a faithful and  compassionate servant leader, and I will always cherish his friendship.   Arne's contagious spirit of kindness and generosity sets a high  standard for what success looks like, in both public and private life.  As a business executive, he cared deeply for his employees and  customers and continued to serve as president and CEO while privately  persevering through extraordinary health challenges. His selfless  leadership is an example we can all aspire to.   The culture he helped build and foster at Marriott is unmatched.  Arne's decades of experience in the hospitality industry yielded  outstanding results for his enterprise, notably the acquisition of over  30 hotel groups, elevating Marriott to be the largest hotel chain in  the world. His humility and wisdom often carried the day. He  consistently praised and recognized the achievements of his employees  and partners and always sought feedback from friends, family,  colleagues, and customers.   Above all, Arne was a faithful and loving husband, father, and  friend. His integrity and values-based decision making extended from  the business world to the benefit of everyone lucky enough to have  known him, especially his wonderful family. Arne's wife and four  children were his greatest pride, joy, and purpose, and while they now  mourn his loss, I hope they may find comfort knowing Arne's light will  shine on for eternity. May he rest in peace.                            ____________________
