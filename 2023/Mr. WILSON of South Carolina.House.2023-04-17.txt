 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Madam Speaker, the Biden budget would  destroy jobs, slash wages, and reduce economic growth, according to a  new study by the Tax Foundation.   The budget will raise taxes by $4.7 trillion and reduce economic  growth. Americans are experiencing record-high levels of inflation  under Biden, and his plan will cut wages by a full percent.   The newly elected Republican majority is focused on fiscal sanity and  creating jobs.   Congratulations champion Matt Fitzpatrick of Sheffield, England, on  victory yesterday at the RBC Heritage presented by Boeing, at Hilton  Head Island, South Carolina.   I appreciate the success of Royal Bank of Canada President Dave  McKay, Boeing National Strategy Director Lindsay Leonard, Heritage  Classic Foundation Chairman Simon Fraser, and Tournament Director Steve  Wilmot.   The victory was special as it has been a vacation favorite for the  Fitzpatrick family from the United Kingdom for many years.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues, moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.                            ____________________
