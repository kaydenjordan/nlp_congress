 Madam Speaker, on this, the funeral day of the great  John Lewis, I ask my colleagues to support my amendment to fund a  critical source of knowledge for my State, ``The State of Black  Michigan'' report. This amendment comes directly from my meetings with  African-American leaders in my district in the wake of the killing of  George Floyd.   For four decades, researchers at Michigan State University compiled  ``The State of Black Michigan'' report. This critical research project  was established in the wake of civil unrest in the 1960s, and until  2007, it did what all good research does: it used hard data and facts,  regardless of politics, to inform and hold elected leaders accountable  for the persistent inequality in housing, healthcare, education,  economic opportunity, and more.  [[Page H4164]]    The work to produce ``The State of Black Michigan'' was spearheaded  by Dr. Joe Darden at Michigan State. It was not easy or cheap, and  since 2007, without a source of dedicated funding, we have been without  the knowledge of this report.   Madam Speaker, now, as the country once again confronts systemic  racism and inequality, we must acknowledge and learn from the  underlying facts to build effective policies. My amendment would  provide a source of funding for efforts such as ``The State of Black  Michigan'' so that we can confront systemic inequalities and actually  do something about these systemic problems.
