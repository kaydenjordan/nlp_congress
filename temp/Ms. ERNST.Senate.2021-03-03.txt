 Thank you to the Senator from Florida as well and for  sharing his personal story and why it is so important that we have  transparency on bills like this COVID package.   Over the course of the pandemic, Congress has worked together-- Republicans and Democrats--to pass five overwhelmingly bipartisan bills  providing COVID-19 relief to the American people, and I think we would  all agree that that relief was much needed.   Now, in March, we passed the largest stimulus package in American  history. And just a few months ago, we passed the second largest. But  what the Democrats aren't telling you is that much of the $900 billion  we passed in the most recent relief package, and even some of the CARES  Act money, has yet to be spent. And, frankly, folks, we don't even know  exactly who has spent what money Congress has doled out over the last  year.   I have long said, the American taxpayer deserves to know where and  how their money is being spent. Bottom line, we need transparency and  to know what has and has not been spent so far.   This commonsense effort will help us get this information. Until we  have those details, we should not continue throwing money to Washington  bureaucrats, and we certainly should not support this partisan $1.9  trillion package that includes many items that are completely unrelated  to COVID-19.   I agree with my colleagues that there is more that we can do to help  expedite the vaccine distribution and promote access to childcare so  our parents can return to work. But, folks, this is not Monopoly money.  This is real money.   We have a moral obligation to our future generations to spend  responsibly. Iowans and all Americans deserve transparency before we  add trillions of dollars to their tab.   With that, I will yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.
