 Madam Speaker, I rise today to raise mental health  awareness during Mental Health Month.   According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, about 164,000  Montanans have a mental health condition. Unfortunately, mental  healthcare is not available to many Montanans. In fact, over 50 percent  of Montanans live in an area where there is a shortage of mental health  professionals.   I recently brought together providers, leaders, and advocates in  Montana to discuss how we can improve mental healthcare, substance  abuse treatment, and suicide prevention. They told me about the  challenges they face to provide care and of their promising progress.  They told me about resources, like telemedicine, that could improve  treatment and help fill coverage gaps.   Individuals impacted by mental illness can lead healthy, fulfilling  lives. Access to treatment, though, is critical.   Let's work together in a bipartisan way to address mental healthcare.  Our communities depend on it.                            ____________________
