 Madam Speaker, can anyone seriously dispute that our  Federal fiscal house is seriously out of order?   Our national debt stands at $23 trillion, doubling in just the last  decade alone. No end is in sight, as we just registered $1 trillion  annual deficit in the last fiscal year, and this fiscal year looks the  same or worse. Interest payments alone will exceed defense spending by  2025.   We need look no further than into the mirror for the root cause. It  is our collective inability to face the music of fiscal responsibility  and sustainability. We clearly need help.   H.R. 5211, the Sustainable Budget Act, cointroduced today with my  colleague from Arkansas, the ranking member of the Budget Committee,  Mr. Womack, would follow the models of Simpson-Bowles and other such  independent commissions charged with focusing on our debt and  recommending a sustainable path forward for an up-or-down vote by  Congress.   In that, our bill is similar to other measures I have also  cointroduced: H.R. 4907, the TRUST Act, with Representatives Gallagher  and McAdams; and H.R. 5178, the RAFT Act, with Representative Burchett.  Together, they offer a far better way forward to tackling our debt  crisis, and I urge their prompt consideration and passage.                            ____________________
