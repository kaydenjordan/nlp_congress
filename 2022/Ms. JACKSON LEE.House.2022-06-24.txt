 Madam Speaker, our children are hungry, and I rise  to support hungry children and to end their hunger.   I rise to support the Keep Kids Fed Act of 2022. One in every seven  households with children struggle to get enough food on the table.   Just weeks into our pandemic, which still continues, one in every  three households with children, nearly half of all mothers, struggle to  feed our children.   It is crucial that we take emergency action to immediately stop the  hunger in this Nation, and certainly, we should look around the world,  as well.   Congress must extend key flexibilities, and so this legislation  provides nationwide waiver authority, allows waivers related to the  summer food program.   In my district, all of the school districts have children that are in  need of food: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Stop hungry children from  suffering and pass this legislation and end hunger for children as we  know it.   The work must continue. Hungry children cannot be what America is  defined as, and they must be safe. I ask my colleagues to join me in  stopping hunger in America in our children and families.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, let my thank the chairman very much  for yielding, and for the expeditious way in which the Committee on  Rules realized that we are in crisis.   Let me just start by saying to stop the carnage and the bloodshed, I  rise in support of the bipartisan Safer Communities Act. And since I  know that this Congress has vision and it has passion to move, as well,  the Protect Our Kids Act as we go forward in the future.   I realize that this bipartisan effort is historic, particularly in  light of the Supreme Court decision which took history and literally  shredded the constitutional privileges of life and liberty by  suggesting that laws that under Heller were legal, could not be in  place. Legislation that is going to come before us will, in fact,  emphasize that we want to save lives.   Madam Speaker, I support this effort going forward because I want to  say to the grieving families of Buffalo, the grieving families of  Mother Emanuel, the grieving families in Uvalde, the parent who spoke  to me just two nights ago whose daughter bled out, that we are  listening.   I also rise today to support H. Res. 1132, which says to the world  that the United States Congress calls on the Government of Russia, the  Russian Federation, to immediately release Brittney Griner.   This bill was introduced by myself, Congressman Stanton and  Congressman Allred, because we realize this young woman who grew up and  was born in Houston, Texas, who, was a two-time Olympian, who is a  renowned WNBA player, is now wrongfully detained in Russia. She has had  a prolific collegiate career and went to Nimitz High School and Baylor  University.   She is someone who has been known to be generous in her community by  providing an outstanding program that helps young people. She has the  Heart and Soul Shoe Drive. She is an American's American.   We ask that you support this H. Res. 1132 to release Brittney Griner  now.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the rule which brings to the  floor S. 2938, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, and H. Res. 1132,  ``Calling for the immediate release of Brittney Griner''.   Both the bill and the resolution addressed by this rule advance  bedrock American values and priorities that are intrinsic to our  national character.   The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act provides reasonable, common- sense measures to enhance safety and reduce gun violence that is  increasingly inflicting unspeakable pain and suffering on American  families.  [[Page H5888]]    I have never met an American who does not want to keep their children  safe, and especially protect them from gun violence. The bipartisan  nature of the bill emphasizes the universal desire to protect our  children and families.   When modest, reasonable measures can be taken to protect lives and  avert tragedy, it is our responsibility to embrace that opportunity.   The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act will surely save lives. Even if  it prevents just one mass shooting--or even if it only saves one life-- its worth will be proven.   Consider what America would think if, without enactment of this bill,  children were murdered in a mass shooting, and it were determined that  the killer would have been prevented from their heinous acts if only  this bill had become law. For those families in mourning, Congress's  failure to act would be unforgiveable.   Instead, by advancing this legislation, we will be averting the most  painful tragedy that a family could experience, and many families will  be spared that devastation.   The bill's reasonable steps will have a positive impact on public  safety and family security for years to come.   H. Res. 1132, which is also addressed by this rule, calls for the  release of Brittney Griner and, in so doing, puts Congress on record  emphatically defending true American values such as our devotion to  human rights, respect and dignity for each person, the right to due  process, and justice based on truth.   Each of these have been offended by Russia unjustifiably holding  Griner, and by the Russian distortion of a judicial system that extends  her detention, preventing her release to return home, without a factual  or legal basis for doing so.   Brittney Griner, who grew up in Houston, Texas, is an extension of  all of us. She represents quintessential American stories and  qualities. The injustices inflicted upon her by Putin and his acolytes  in Russia could have been imposed on any Americans within their reach.   The denial of basic rights from Brittney offends all Americans  because they are rights to which we believe all people are entitled. We  do not accept the dehumanization that is commonplace in Russia, and our  values compel us to seek justice for Brittney, her immediate release,  and her return home to her family and friends.   As a mother who has raised a family, I can only imagine the gut- wrenching pain that her parents, family, and friends must be feeling  right now. There is no worse feeling than when someone in your family  is in imminent danger and they are beyond your reach to help them.   As a Black woman, I can say there's no greater fear than having a  loved one being wrongfully placed in a situation or environment over  which there is no control.   For any of us, if we had a loved one placed in this situation, we  would be doing everything in our power to ensure their prompt and safe  return.   We would be calling and seeking the help of everyone possible-- including the media, the U.S. State Department, and even allies in  Russia.   We would press every politician and public figure to fight against  the corrupt government of Russia to ensure that our family member is  guaranteed their natural born rights to due process, a fair trial, and  a prompt release from detention.   No American citizen should be detained in a foreign country for  months, denied access to American consular officials, and dependent  upon the performance of a Russian lawyer, especially in absence of  substantial evidence of a crime.   Ms. Griner is suffering from Russia's heinous demonstration of power  and control that stems from centuries of bigotry and hatred embodied in  an autocratic leader who is the very antithesis of everything Ms.  Griner represents.   Ms. Griner's detention is primarily based on the country of her  citizenship, in a game of political leverage. Since she was targeted  because of being an American, every American should take this  personally. Her detention is an offense against our country, and  against our people.   Griner was detained on February 17, 2022, her initial release date  was set to be May 19th, it was then shifted to June 19th, and when that  date approached, it was delayed to July 2nd.   That is not justice--it's oppression. We call on Putin and the  Russian government to comply with their international treaty  obligations.   By passing the rule bringing H. Res. 1132 before us, Congress  insists, alongside the Griner family, that Brittney Griner must be  immediately and safely released and returned home to the U.S. We are  unified in demanding respectful treatment and justice for her, in  accordance with American values.   I also rise in support of the rule by which the House has passed H.  Res. 1132, ``Calling for the immediate release of Brittney Griner''.   A very important component of the rule currently before the House is  that it: ``Provides that House Resolution 1132 is hereby adopted.''   I fought hard for passage of H. Res. 1132, introduced by Congressman  Stanton, myself, and Congressman Allred, because, by raising our voices  for Brittney Griner, we raise our voices for bedrock American values  and priorities that are intrinsic to our national character.   H. Res. 1132 calls for the release of Brittney Griner and, in so  doing, puts Congress on record emphatically defending true American  values such as our devotion to human rights, respect and dignity for  each person, the right to due process, and justice based on truth.

Mr. Speaker, I stand here in the name of Mr. Garza,  whose daughter in Uvalde bled out, Buffalo, Tulsa, Parkland, Santa Fe,  and Sandy Hook. I stand here with the recognition of my chairman, Mr.  Nadler, and the years and decades--mine, over two decades--of fighting  for gun laws.   As I hold up the number of gun laws that I introduced over 27 years-- pages and pages--I can say to the Senate that in this bill, the  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, they have built on our legislation.   My bill, the Mental Health Access and Gun Violence Prevention Act,  which will increase access to mental health treatment, is in this bill.  The Violence Against Women Act, the boyfriend loophole, is in this  bill. The Protecting Our Kids Act and the issues dealing with raising  the age, bump stocks, and ghost guns are yet to be done, but we can  stand on this because it was bipartisan.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a list of gun violence  prevention legislation.     Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas Gun Violence Prevention                                Legislation                                117th Congress         H.R. 127--Sabika Sheikh Firearm Licensing and Registration       Act        H.R. 2585, ``Juvenile Accountability Block Grant       Reauthorization and the Bullying Prevention and Intervention       Act''        H.R. 121--Grin Violence Reduction Resources Act of 2021        H.R. 125, Gun Safety: Not Sorry Act of 2021        H.R. 130, Kimberly Vaughan Firearm Safe Storage Act        H.R. 135, Accidental Firearms Transfers Reporting Act of       2021  [[Page H5906]]         H.R. 137, Mental Health Access and Gun Violence Prevention       Act of 2021        H.R. 133, David Ray Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2021                                116th Congress         H.R. 49, Santa Fe High School Victims Act        H.R. 4080, Kimberly Vaughan Firearm Safe Storage Act        H.R. 4081, Sabika Sheikh Firearm Licensing and Registration       Act        H.R. 4082, Accidental Firearms Transfers Reporting Act of       2019                                115th Congress         H.R. 57, Accidental Firearms Transfers Reporting Act of       2017        H.R. 62, Gun Violence Reduction Resources Act of 2017        H.R. 1982, Mental Health Access and Gun Violence Prevention       Act of 2017        H.R. 1983, David Ray Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2017        H.R. 4268, Gun Safety: Not Sorry Act of 2017        H.R. 5088, No More Atrocities with Guns Act or the No MAGA       Act        H.R. 7016, Protect Lives and Stop the Imminent Chaos Act of       2019--the PLASTIC Act                                114th Congress         H.R. 4315--Mental Health Access and Gun Violence Prevention       Act        H.R. 4316--Gun Violence Reduction Resources Act        H.R. 47--Gun Storage and Safety Devices for All Firearms       Act        H.R. 3125--Accidental Firearms Transfers Reporting Act        H.R. 5470--Stopping Mass Killings by Violent Terrorists Act        H.

Amdt. 187--107th Congress                                106th Congress         H.R. 3987--Child Gun Safety and Gun Access Prevention Act       of 2000     Mr. Speaker, people are dying every day, and it is  obvious that through the legislation--The New York Times said here are  the shootings, pages and pages, that could have been stopped by  stricter gun laws.    Mr. Speaker, this article has the mass shootings  where stricter gun laws might have made a difference.   We understand that this legislation is only the concrete beginning.  My friends are going to attack that, but the American people are 70  percent for banning various weapons that are assault weapons. They are  70 percent and more for extreme risk protection. They are 70 percent  and more for understanding that we need an extended time for purchase  of these guns. And, yes, they are supporters of the Kimberly Vaughn  Safe Storage Act, which is a storage bill that says that we need to get  people to prevent suicide and to store their guns.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2938, the ``Bipartisan Safer  Communities Act.''   America is experiencing a crisis of gun violence.   In America, gun violence threatens our sense of safety and security  everywhere we go: where we shop for groceries; where we worship with  our families; and where we enjoy movies, dancing, outdoor festivals,  and concerts with friends.   I and many other members of Congress have introduced commonsense gun  safety legislation to make communities safer--over and over, year after  year, Congress after Congress. Until now, we have been unable to pass  any meaningful legislation.   After more than twenty years of drafting and repeatedly introducing  gun safety legislation, like my bill, the Mental Health Access and Gun  Violence Prevention Act to increase access to mental health treatment  and promote reporting of mental health information to the background  check system, I am encouraged by the steps we are taking today but wish  we did not have to lose so many lives to reach this point.   For years, I fought to close the boyfriend loophole--most recently in  the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization of 2021, which passed  the House last year.   Finally, through the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, we will ensure  abusive dating partners convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence  offenses are prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms for at  least five years.   Two weeks ago, this body proved to the American people that a  compromise could be reached on sensible gun safety measures when we  passed the ``Protecting Our Kids Act.'' That legislation, which I  introduced along with Chairman Jerry Nadler and Representative Mike  Thompson, encompassed decades of our hard work and proved to be the  catalyst for the bill we are considering today.   Like the Protecting Our Kids Act, this bill would establish new  federal offenses that specifically prohibit gun trafficking and straw  purchasing to thwart guns moving through the iron pipeline, keeping  them off the street and out of the hands of criminals.   While our bill would have raised the age at which a person could  purchase a semiautomatic rifle from 18 to 21--a concept I proposed in  my No More Atrocities with Guns Act of 2018--this bill would enhance  the background check process and investigative period for purchases of  rifles by anyone under the age of 21 and further strengthen the  background check process by clarifying who is engaged in the business  of selling firearms and, as a result, is required to run background  checks.   We also passed the Federal Extreme Risk Protection Order Act of 2021  recently that would give loved ones the ability to seek an extreme risk  protection order before our federal court when an individual presents a  serious threat to themselves or others by use of a firearm and provide  funding to enhance, promote, and implement similar laws at the state- level, which Safer Communities will do.   With the passage of this bill, we make a significant step forward in  the fight to end gun violence. But we must keep working to find  reasonable solutions to other problems that contribute to gun violence  in this country that are not addressed in this bill.   We must ban deadly bump stocks, ghost guns, and high-capacity  magazines as we endeavored to do in the Protecting Our Kids Act. We  must ban assault weapons.   We must institute a seven-day waiting period for purchases of the  deadliest of instrumentalities such as silencers and body armor, which  I have pressed for in my own bill, the Gun Safety: Not Sorry Act of  2017 and 2021, and assault weapons if we do not ban them.   We must pass legislation that encourages safe firearm storage  practices, like my bill the Kimberly Vaughan Firearm Safe Storage Act  that was included in the Protecting Our Kids Act to expand the  requirement that safe storage devices be made available at the point of  sale, which will train new gun owners on the value of safe storage and  remind seasoned gun owners that safe storage goes hand-in-hand with  responsible gun ownership.   23 years after Columbine when I first began introducing gun safety  legislation, and hundreds of thousands of gun deaths later, we continue  to mourn the unnecessary loss of life. Enough is enough.   While this bill may not solve all the problems that contribute to the  epidemic of gun violence, we must pass it without delay. Far too many  lives have been lost for us to wait any longer.   I support this meaningful, bipartisan legislation and urge my  colleagues to do the same. Let us save lives and protect the children  of America--together.   The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act would inject $4.5 billion in  critical funding into various state agencies and programs through the  Department of Justice, Department of Health and Human Services, and  Department of Education to:   Expand community mental health services for children and families,  and fund school-based mental health services and supports;  [[Page H5907]]    Implement evidence-based school violence prevention efforts; and   Encourage and support evidence-based, community violence intervention  programs and crisis intervention services, including the implementation  of vital Red Flag Laws--which have been proven to reduce the firearm  suicide rates in states that have already enacted such laws.   In America, gun violence is the leading cause of death among  children. In America, an average of 70 women are shot and killed by an  intimate partner every month. In America, mass shootings occur  increasingly each year--and every day, 316 people on average are shot.  In America, 45,979 deaths were by suicide in 2020--more than half of  those deaths were by firearm.   Each day parents send their children off to school, from elementary  age to college, praying now more than ever that they will return to  them safe and sound.   19 elementary school-aged children and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas;  10 people going about their daily lives at a market in Buffalo, New  York, all killed by 18-year-olds wielding AR-15-style weapons of war.  And 4 people murdered at a hospital in Tulsa, Oklahoma with another  assault weapon purchased only hours earlier.   In my home state of Texas, the El Paso Walmart shooting--22 dead;  Sutherland Springs--26 dead; Santa Fe High School--10 dead; Fort Hood  in 2009--13 dead; and the Dallas shooting of police--5 officers dead  and nine others injured.
