 Mr. President, in reserving the right to  object, throughout his Presidency, Joe Biden and his administration  have shown a complete and total inability to place qualified and  competent people in positions of power across the Federal Government.  We have had crisis after crisis due to the failed leadership of  President Biden and his appointees. I have absolutely no faith that Joe  Biden's radical, far-left nominees will uphold the rule of law.   I cannot and will not consent to allowing these nominees to move  forward in an expedited manner. We should take a vote so every Senator  can get on the record with their support or opposition to each of these  nominees.   Therefore, I object.    Mr. President, I object.    Mr. President, I object.    Mr. President, I object.    Mr. President.    I object.    Mr. President.    I object.
