 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the right to life  for every unborn child.   But before I start, I want to thank the gentleman from Jersey for his  tireless work and efforts to reverse this decision and to make sure  that life is what we are about in this country, because, tragically, in  the 47 years since Roe v. Wade, there have been more than 60 million  abortions in our country.   This is more than a statistic. These are innocent lives lost. Even if  this decision is brought back before the Supreme Court, abortions can  still be prevalent due to the increasing use of chemical abortion  pills. That is why my bill, the SAVE Moms and Babies Act, is necessary,  to ensure that the current FDA policy regulating these dangerous pills  will stay in place--preventing expanded use--to protect the health and  safety of women.   I am a committed advocate for pro-life policies, for the protection  of the sanctity of life. I appreciate and thank those who offer an  unwavering dedication to defending the unborn, despite a culture that  often marginalizes pro-life values. Such perseverance is incredibly  inspiring. It is an important reminder that we must all be a voice for  the voiceless.   The fight for life must continue.
