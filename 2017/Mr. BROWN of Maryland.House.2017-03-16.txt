 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my  colleague from Connecticut for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1181, which has very  little, if anything, to do with protecting veterans' Second Amendment  rights as the bill's title suggests.   I am a 30-year veteran of the United States Army. I served in Iraq. I  have led soldiers in both combat support and combat service support  units in the active and reserve components.   Our servicemen and -women face harsh realities in harsh  environments--not just in wartime, but in peacetime as well. Military  life, Mr. Speaker, is a hard life during war and in peace. It takes a  toll on the body and the mind. The number of military members seeking  mental and behavioral health services in the last 16 years, as well as  the mental health-related incidences involving soldiers and veterans,  substantiates my point.   But our soldiers are resilient, and that is no less true when we take  off the uniform.                                time  1500    But for many of our veterans, it might take some extra help, some  extra time, to recover from that harsh and sometimes traumatic military  experience.   As a nation, we must support our veterans in recovering from that  experience not only by providing the benefits they deserve, but by  protecting their right to enjoy the rights that they have defended.   But, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1181 misses the mark. When a determination is  made that a veteran is mentally incompetent or incapacitated, for  whatever reason, that determination is made to protect them, not to  punish or deprive them. When that determination is made, we owe it to  our veterans not to put a weapon in their hand, but, rather, to put the  full weight of a responsive mental health system at their disposal.   We entrusted our soldiers with a weapon while in uniform, so let's  treat our veterans with the same expectations and standards of safety  when they take off the uniform. If the unintended consequences of the  current law, as the bill's supporters claim, are too broad and  disqualified too many of our veterans from responsible gun ownership,  then let's work together to tackle that issue.   However, this bill goes too far and would prohibit the VA Secretary  from sharing important information with law enforcement on veterans who  might be a danger to themselves or to others.   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1181 misses the mark and ignores the  responsibility to safeguard and take care of our veterans who have  sacrificed so much to protect our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record three documents, and they are  the testimony of Brigadier General Xenakis, an op-ed from General  Chiarelli, as well as testimony submitted by Jeffrey Swanson.        Testimony of Brigadier General (Ret) Stephen N. Xenakis, MD                erik erikson scholar, the austen riggs center    Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs, Hearing                               June 24, 2015              H.R. 2001--Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act         Thank you to the Committee for this opportunity to submit       testimony regarding H.R. 2001--Veterans 2nd Amendment       Protection Act. I am Dr. Stephen Xenakis, retired Brigadier       General and Army Medical Corps Officer, with 28 years of       active military service. I am certified by the American Board       of Psychiatry and Neurology in General Psychiatry and Child       and Adolescent Psychiatry, and have dedicated my professional       career to providing medical and psychiatric care to our       soldiers and veterans and sustaining the readiness of our       fighting force. First and foremost, I am dedicated to       improving and protecting their health and wellbeing, and       therefore urge the committee not to pass H.R. 2001--Veterans       2nd Amendment Protection Act (H.R. 2001) in its current form.        Under the current process, if a veteran is determined to be       incapable of managing his or her disbursement of funds from       the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), the veteran is       assigned a fiduciary, categorized as mentally incompetent,       considered ``adjudicated mental defective,'' and therefore       prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms. In its       current form, H.R. 2001 would  [[Page H2110]]       change the process, stating those who are deemed mentally       incompetent by the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) would       NOT be considered adjudicated mental defective ``without the       order or finding of a judge, magistrate, or other judicial       authority of competent jurisdiction that such person is a       danger to himself or herself or others. The result being,       individuals who are currently prohibited from purchasing or       possessing firearms, because of a VBA fiduciary finding,       would no longer be prohibited.        Though I concur that there is room for improvement in the       VA interpretation of the mentally incompetent determination,       H.R. 2001 is misguided in its approach. Yes, there may be       individuals who have been swept into the ``adjudicated mental       defective'' category because they need assistance managing       their disbursement of VBA funds and for whom firearms access       would not pose a risk to themselves or anyone else. However,       there are also individuals in this category for whom access       to a firearm would indeed be dangerous. Therefore restoring       firearms in the sweeping manner to everyone declared mentally       incompetent by the VA, as H.R. 2001 would do, would put our       veterans, and citizens, in harm's way.        To discuss H.R. 2001 is to discuss this country's veteran       suicide crisis, and to discuss suicide is to discuss access       to firearms. The high suicide rate among the veteran       population is devastating; a 2012 report from the VA reported       an estimated 22 veterans per day commit suicide. Data shows       recent veterans who were on active duty during the wars in       Iraq and Afghanistan have a marked increased risk of suicide       compared to the general population (41% higher suicide risk       among deployed veterans; 61% higher risk among those non-      deployed). Access to firearms is a significant part of the       problem; a study of male veterans found that veterans were       more likely than non-veterans to use firearms as a means to       suicide. Research shows firearms are the most lethal means to       suicide; an estimated 85% of suicide attempts using a firearm       are fatal, compared to 2% by poisoning or overdose, or 1% by       cutting.        The evidence is strong and paints a grim picture--suicide       is a serious public health problem. According to 2013 data       from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide       is the 10th leading cause of death for all age groups.       Suicide is the second leading cause of death for those age       25-34, ahead of heart disease, liver disease, or HIV. Over       half of the 41,149 suicides in 2013 were by firearm.        Our society can mitigate this problem however with smart       policies and practices. We should take a page out of the       military training manuals. The military trains us to think       ``safety first'' and avoid unnecessary harm and injury. It is       our standard practice among military psychiatrists to       confront a potentially suicidal soldier and intervene       aggressively to protect the soldier and the family. I       routinely ask--``do you have weapons, where are they, what       can you and your family do now to keep you and them safe?''       As such, it is absolutely crucial, that any veteran who has       been deemed mentally incompetent by the VBA go through an       individualized process to restore his or her firearms rights,       including an assessment for risk to self and others       consistent with best medical practices, to ensure that the       veteran would not constitute a danger to the self or others       going forward. Such a process is not outlined in H.R. 2001       and, therefore, I urge the committee not to pass the       amendment in its current form.                                   ____                        [From The Hill, Mar. 16, 2017]           Give Our Veterans Considering Suicide Help, Not a Gun                   (By Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, retired)         As the Army's vice chief of staff, I spent much of my time       working on a crisis most Americans don't even realize exists.       A crisis that on average takes the lives of 20 American       veterans each day: the devastating epidemic of veteran       suicide.        Our brave men and women in uniform risk their lives daily       to make America safer. But for many, when they return home,       the battles they face are far from over. The stress of       repeated deployments, failed relationships, financial       challenges, depression and PTSD are among the reasons that       every year roughly 7,000 veterans take their own life. Two-      thirds of the time they do so by gun.        Researchers who study suicides have found that the decision       to end one's life is often spontaneous, and that if       accessible, guns are the most lethal and common way one       commits suicide. For this reason, eliminating easy access to       a gun during a mental health crisis can mean the difference       between life and death.        Knowing this, I am shocked that some in Congress are       currently supporting a new piece of misguided and dangerous       legislation that would make it easier for veterans who are at       risk of facing a mental health crisis to get their hands on a       gun. Congress should be working to save lives and to       guarantee that all veterans have access to world-class       medical care and counseling, not making it easier for those       suffering from the hidden wounds of war to end their lives.        We have to do better. And as someone who has spent years       working to reform our mental health system and to reduce       veteran suicides, I know we can.        Shortly after the tragedy at Virginia Tech, Congress       passed, and President Bush signed, bipartisan legislation       requiring the Department of Veterans Affairs to send the       names of veterans who have clear and convincing evidence of       mental incompetency to the National Instant Criminal       Background Checks System. Any person listed within this       system is ineligible to legally purchase firearms from a       licensed dealer.        The legislation that Congress is currently considering       would reverse this law, and would immediately remove more       than 174,000 mental health records from the background check       system. The records that would be removed include veterans       who are prohibited from obtaining guns because they are       suffering from serious mental illnesses like dementia,       schizophrenia, and long-term severe posttraumatic stress.        We know that reducing veteran suicide is a complicated       issue that requires comprehensive solutions. That said,       providing veterans who struggle with mental illness increased       access to a gun is not part of that solution.        Congress should instead focus on more supportive gun-      focused legislation like making it easier for family and       friends to help their loved ones in crisis. Most states       currently lack laws that enable family and friends to contact       law enforcement and remove firearms from individuals who pose       a threat to themselves or others. Gaps like these in our laws       help explain why since 1968, more Americans have died from       guns in the United States than on battlefields of all the       wars in our country's history.        Still, there are some who will mislabel these responsible       policies as efforts to strip our veterans of their rights       without due process. They could not be more wrong. In fact,       there is already a law on the books that ensures any veteran       on the prohibited purchaser list has a right to a hearing       where they can present evidence regarding his or her mental       capability. That's important. The current system works.        Last year, I joined former Congresswoman Gabrielle       Giffords, her husband, Navy combat veteran and retired NASA       astronaut Capt. Mark Kelly, and a long list of the nation's       most prominent retired military officials to launch the       Veterans Coalition for Common Sense. It is a national       initiative of distinguished veterans from all branches and       ranks of the military who are committed to advancing       commonsense solutions to gun violence here at home. While       respecting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding       Americans, our focus is to help keep guns out of the wrong       hands, and saves lives.        Throughout the course of my nearly four decades of service       to our nation, I saw first hand the incredible power of       firearms and the dangers they pose when they end up in the       hands of people who should not have them.        Every day while deployed, our brave men and women in       uniform risk their lives to protect our freedom, and when       they return, we should protect theirs. Congress has a duty to       ensure these heroes' safety and they can do so through       rational and honorable grin safety legislation. Our veterans       in crisis need our help, not a gun.    Testimony submitted by Jeffrey Swanson, PhD and Richard Bonnie, LLB   Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs, Hearing,      June 24, 2015, H.R. 2001--Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act         We thank the Committee for this opportunity to submit       testimony regarding H.R. 2001: Veterans 2nd Amendment       Protection Act.        The Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act (H.R. 2001)       addresses an important concern of fairness in a policy that       is intended to protect veterans but may infringe their rights       without sufficient due process. The policy in question is       VA's current practice of reporting to the FBI's National       Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) the names of       veterans who are assigned a fiduciary to assist the veteran       in managing their benefit funds. What is controversial about       this is that VA decides, in a rather opaque administrative       procedure, who gets a ``fiduciary''--and thus, indirectly,       who is put into NICS--without assessing whether a       financially-challenged veteran is at risk of harm to self or       others. This decision occurs without a hearing before either       a judge or other objective, duly authorized administrative       officer in which the facts of the matter could be presented       and challenged.        Over the past several years, VA has reported the names of       about 100,000 ``incompetent beneficiaries'' to the NICS--the       database that licensed gun dealers query to determine whether       people trying to buy a gun can legally do so. The proposed       law, H.R. 2001, would remove these veterans' names from NICS       and would uncouple the loss of gun rights from routine       assignment of VA fiduciaries in the future. Would such       changes be good or bad for veterans, or for the public? Our       testimony offers some background information and research       evidence to help legislators evaluate VA's fiduciary/gun-      restriction policy and consider the possible advantages and       drawbacks of rescinding it.        The Department of Veterans Affairs did not invent the idea       of removing gun rights from people found incompetent to       manage their money; the policy was apparently initiated to       implement the 1968 federal Gun Control Act, which banned the       possession of firearms by certain categories of persons       assumed to be dangerous, including anyone ``adjudicated as a       mental defective.'' The archaic phrase gives offense to       modern ears  [[Page H2111]]       and lacks clinical meaning, but the Department of Justice       (DOJ) has defined it specifically to include anyone who       ``lacks the mental capacity to contract or manage his or her       own affairs'' as determined by some lawful authority.       According to current VA procedure, military veterans fall       under this broad gun-disqualifying definition whenever the VA       finds them to be financially incompetent and in need of a       third-party ``fiduciary'' to manage VA benefit funds.        VA's assignment of fiduciaries is made through an       administrative process within the Veterans Benefits       Administration (VBA), and without the requirement of either a       formal evaluation of decision-making capacity by a healthcare       professional or a genuine opportunity for a fair hearing for       adjudicating the question of financial capacity as defined in       the DOJ regulations. These strong due process objections to       the VA's policy are clearly the main concern underlying H.R.       2001. The argument is mainly about procedure, and we have       serious doubts about whether VA's current way of assigning       fiduciaries actually meets the definition of ``adjudicated as       a mental defective'' under the Gun Control Act. But it is       worth asking whether this procedurally flawed policy is also       substantively flawed. Is there a public-safety rationale for       attaching gun rights to the fiduciary standard? What do we       know about the relationship between the ability to manage       money and risk of harm to self or others? Is there even a       connection?        Recent research on post-deployment adjustment of Iraq and       Afghanistan war veterans has found a modest statistical       correlation between a measure of financial decision-making       capacity and self-reported suicidality and interpersonal       violent behavior. In a nationally representative random       sample of 1,388 separated veterans and reservists from the       era of our recent wars, participants were tested on basic       money management skills and also queried about violence and       suicidal behavior and thoughts. Veterans who scored poorly on       financial management abilities were about twice as likely to       report serious acts of violence, arrest, suicidal behavior,       and use of illicit drugs, compared to those with good money       management skills. These differences in relative risk       associated with financial incapacity were statistically       significant, even though the majority of veterans with       financial incapacity were not violent or suicidal. Other       research, on civilians with psychiatric disabilities who were       found incompetent to manage their Supplemental Security       Income (SSI) benefits, founds that assignment of a family       member as a ``representative payee'' was significantly       associated with increased risk of violent acts by the       incompetent beneficiary against family members.        Does the fiduciary gun-restriction policy, as it stands,       effectively prevent firearm-related violence and suicide       among veterans? The full answer to that question is unknown,       but the population impact of the policy is inherently limited       by the very small proportion of at-risk individuals that it       affects, considering the entire veteran population of       approximately 22 million. There are undoubtedly better and       more efficient, effective, comprehensive, and carefully-      tailored ways to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous       people than reporting a relatively small number of       putatively financially incompetent veteran beneficiaries       to the NICS.        But what about the 100,000 veterans who are already in NICS       because they were assigned a fiduciary? What are the       implications, for them and their families, of automatically       restoring their gun rights without any case-by-case review?       Unfortunately, there is little information publically       available about the population of incompetent veterans who       have already been reported to the NICS. However, we do know       something about the distribution of psychiatric diagnoses of       veterans in NICS, which are typically the diagnoses for which       the veterans are receiving VA benefits: approximately 20,000       of the group--1 in 5 of those in NICS--have a diagnosis of       schizophrenia or other psychotic illness, and about half of       those have a ``paranoid type'' of schizophrenia, which is       typified by delusions of persecution and threat from others.        Do these mental health conditions significantly elevate the       risk of violence and suicide and thereby justify legal       restrictions on gun access? Sometimes, and it depends.       Epidemiological studies of people with schizophrenia in the       general community have found that the large majority are not       violent towards others, but that the subgroup with acute       symptoms of excessive and irrational threat perception--such       as believing that others are ``out to get me''--are       significantly more likely to be violent towards others.        Also in NICS are about 23,000 veterans diagnosed with       posttraumatic stress disorder and about 15,000 (mostly older)       veterans suffering from dementia with underlying causes       ranging from Alzheimer's disease to traumatic brain injury       research literature would suggest that both of these groups       of veterans, too, carry some elevated risk of suicide or       irresponsible behavior with firearms. Still, all of these       diagnostic categories function as nonspecific risk factors       for gun violence and suicide; there are many more people with       these diagnoses who will not harm anyone than who will. That       is because violence and suicide are caused by many       interacting factors--mental illness being only one--and       people with mental illness may carry other risk and       protective factors for dangerous behavior. It is just the       magnitude of the thing being prevented--death by a gun--that       might justify limiting the rights of so many people who would       not turn out to be violent in any case.        Civil rights advocates and gun violence prevention experts       could each find fault with a policy that infringes the       constitutional rights of so many while having only modest       impact, at best, on gun violence and suicide. Hence, the       criticism that animates H.R. 2001: that the VA's fiduciary/      gun policy, without due process, precludes access to firearms       by people who have not been shown to pose any particular risk       of harming anyone. To make matters seem even more unfair,       those ``incompetent beneficiaries'' reported by VA to the       NICS have been subjected to different treatment than       similarly-situated civilian counterparts. For instance,       incompetent Supplemental Security Income (SSI) beneficiaries       with ``representative payees'' assigned by the Social       Security Administration do not similarly lose gun rights.       Further, when states report ``incompetent'' individuals to       NICS, it is because a state court has determined mental       incompetency in a formal adjudicatory procedure--one that       relies on expert clinical testimony and offers due process       protections commensurate with the important rights at stake.        In the end, what would H.R. 2001 accomplish from the       veteran's point of view? Mainly, it would mean that VA's       appointment of a fiduciary to manage one's VA benefits would       no longer be used, by itself, as a predicate for denying the       veteran the right to purchase and possess a gun. This would       reform the VA's arguably flawed policy going forward.       However, the problem addressed by H.R. 2001 is more       complicated in two ways. First, it is necessary for the VA to       take appropriate steps to facilitate NICS reporting for       veterans receiving mental health care in the VA system who       are found by a lawful judicial or administrative authority to       pose a danger to themselves or others. For example, the VHA       could decide to report to NICS all involuntary commitments to       VA hospitals; this would fill a gap created by the current       inconsistent NICS-reporting practices of state civil courts       and public mental health authorities.        Second, it is necessary to address the fate of the 100,000       veterans who are already in NICS. Some of these veterans are       disqualified under other criteria because, for example, they       have been involuntarily committed or convicted of a felony or       domestic violence misdemeanor, with corresponding additional       records in the NICS. However, should the gun rights of all of       the remaining veterans in this group be automatically       restored by retroactively invalidating the VA's past actions?       From the limited available data, it seems likely that       automatically restoring all of these individuals' gun rights       will provide legal access to firearms for at least some       veterans who do, in fact, pose a danger to themselves or       others. Therefore, for veterans already in the NICS because       of a fiduciary determination by the VA, perhaps some level of       systematic review on the question of dangerousness, with due       process overseen by a federal court, might provide some       needed protection and peace of mind--for the veterans       themselves, as well as for their families and communities.
