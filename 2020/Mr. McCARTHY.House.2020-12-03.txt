 Mr. Speaker, for months, Democrats have used an  unconstitutional scheme to allow Members to vote from home. They call  it proxy voting. I call it exactly what it is: shadow voting.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats are turning away from their responsibility to  their constituents by staying home and handing their voting card to  Nancy Pelosi. They are handing over their voting card and not coming to  work.   But why? What is so important that they can't show up? Do you know  what we found? Because they wanted to attend a space launch that never  took off, or they want to hang out on their boat. Who knows what else  they have done.   Mr. Speaker, they don't have to show up to vote because, guess what.  Someone else will do it for them. Maybe if we renamed Congress ``The  French Laundry,'' they all might show up here.   This has been going on for months, and Democrats have worked overtime  to hide it from the American people.   Mr. Speaker, to date, there have been 4,836 votes cast in this body  by lawmakers who weren't even here.   Think about that: 4,836 votes cast in this body by Members who  weren't even here.  [[Page H6060]]    Over a dozen lawmakers have given their vote to Nancy Pelosi on every  single bill since this scheme was in place. Last night, the number was  over 60 Democrats. Nearly one-third of the entire conference of the  Democratic Party did not show up for work. I promise you, each and  every one of them will get their paycheck.   Mr. Speaker, Americans are working hard to keep their businesses  open, to keep food on the table and their kids in school. They deserve  a Representative who will show up for the job, the job that they said  they would do, the job they asked people to vote for them so they would  come to Washington to give their voice to Congress, not to give it to  Nancy Pelosi.   Mr. Speaker, this is embarrassing. This week is only about cats and  cannabis when it should be about COVID. Think for one moment of what we  are going to do in this body with the history of what has happened on  this floor: the battle of civil rights; the question of whether to end  World War I or World War II; the question of whether every man and  woman is equal. Those are the things that we debate on this floor. And  they were debated in the times of need.   But what is of need to the American public? We all know the  challenges faced before us. We have been fighting it for months. But 40  times on this floor the Democrats have said no.   Mr. Speaker, our own Speaker of the House said we would not leave  this body until we voted on COVID relief. They had 40 times to do it,  and they said no.   Mr. Speaker, 4,836 times a Member didn't even show to cast a vote,  and they still got paid. What about all those businesses that are shut  down now permanently? There is more than $130 billion sitting to go to  the workers for small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, 23 Democrats on the other side signed a letter in  September and said: If we do not get a COVID relief bill, we will sign  that discharge petition.   And what does that do for the American public? It goes around the  Speaker of the House so the voice could actually come to the floor and  the bill could be here and voted upon. And they said they would sign it  if nothing happened. I wonder if their word will be kept, because I  looked at the book and it hasn't.   The Speaker of the House said we would not leave unless we had COVID  relief. But they call us back, and what do they call us back for? The  post office.    Well, Republicans put up COVID relief on the floor that day, but  Democrats said no. They call us back this week when people are hurting,  people are losing their jobs. Maybe that is why one-third of the  Democrats don't show, because they don't want to show their face to the  constituents, that the only thing they are going to do on the floor  this week is vote about cats and cannabis.   Mr. Speaker, that is wrong, and you know it. Everybody in this body  knows it. It is despicable.   If Democrats want to waste the American people's time with these  ridiculous bills, they will need to show up to do it. Republicans won't  be a party to this unconstitutional, undemocratic mess any longer.                            ____________________
