 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  permitted to complete my remarks prior to the scheduled vote.    Mr. President, I join my colleagues in mourning the  passing of a great and good colleague, someone we knew not only as a  fellow worker here and a colleague but also as a friend.   Every one of us had a personal connection to Dianne Feinstein. She  had no enemies. She had adversaries, she differed, but she could differ  and disagree without being disagreeable, as the saying goes. She  established personal connections with all of us over her many years of  service.   I have listened to my colleagues on the floor this morning, and  coming through to me is not only a sense of pain in her passing but  also joy in knowing her.   What strikes me is that she leaves a legacy--yes, a legacy--in  legislation, in good works in California that impacted people's lives  there, but her real legacy is people. Her legacy is the people who  regard her as a role model, the people who were inspired to follow her  into public service, the people who stood up and spoke out--and often  it was truth to power as she did--because she was there. She blazed the  trail. She showed how to do it.   I first became aware of Dianne Feinstein in the early 1990s as a  newly elected State attorney general, advocating for an assault weapons  ban in the State of Connecticut--the early 1990s, and she was doing it  at the Federal level. Connecticut and the Congress did it together.  [[Page S4808]]    Then I defended our Connecticut law in the Connecticut courts with  many of the same arguments that we used to challenge Federal law.   She stood alone in those days as an advocate and a champion of gun  violence prevention, and she modeled the curve that has led to the  modern movement of gun violence prevention. And it is a movement now  because she knew it would require the American people to be as outraged  as she was and saddened by the death that she personally witnessed in  San Francisco. And she would often recall it in very personal terms.   For her, all of these causes were personal. Her service and her  helping people were personal. And she understood that service and  results, accomplishments, required that we be bipartisan, that we work  across the aisle, that we work with people who disagreed with us and  try to find common ground. That is what she did relentlessly and  tirelessly.   So her service, her grace, her generosity, her sensitivity, her  caring will continue in the people that are her legacy, in the people  who will and should, always, preserve her memory as a motivation for  continued service.   I am proud to have been her friend as well as her colleague, and I  will always treasure the great and good model and mentorship that she  provided for so many of us, as we go through these next days of grief  and pain but also joy in knowing her.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     I ask for the yeas and nays.
