 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding.   The President of the United States deserves universal condemnation  for what was clearly, in my opinion, impeachable conduct, pressuring  the Vice President to violate his oath to the Constitution to count the  electors.   His open and public pressure, courageously rejected by the Vice  President, purposefully seeded the false belief among the President's  supporters, including those assembled on January 6, that there was a  legal path for the President to stay in power. It was foreseeable and  reckless to sow such a false belief that could lead to violence and  rioting by loyal supporters whipped into a frenzy.                                time  1445    Unfortunately, my Democratic colleagues drafted an article that I  believe is flawed and unsupportable, focusing on the legal terms of  incitement and insurrection.   Even noting impeachment does not require meeting a certain legal  standard--the danger for open speech and debate in this body and for  the Republic is high--if the House approves the article as written.   The language will be used to target Members of this body under  Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. It will be used to suggest that any  statements we make are subject to review by our colleagues and to send  us down a perilous path of cleansing political speech in the public  square.   Madam Speaker, we must end this. Let us condemn that which must be  condemned, and do so loudly. But let us do it the right way, with  deliberation and without disastrous side effects. We must end tearing  apart our Nation by social media and sound bites. Let us stop. Let us  debate. Let us sit down and lead this Nation together.
