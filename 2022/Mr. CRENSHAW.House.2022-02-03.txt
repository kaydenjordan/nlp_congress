 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of  Misty April Holley, who we lost on November 20, 2021, in Houston,  Texas.   I will do my best to give the world a glimpse of who Misty was. And I  would like to do that using the words of her father, Ron Holley.   Here is how Ron describes his beloved daughter:   Misty spread love and charity to everyone she knew. Misty was a  person full of grace who fully owned her shortcomings and gave out  forgiveness freely to all. She knew in her heart that we are all of one  race, the human race. Humanity would do well to learn lessons of love  and charity from her.   Misty was fueled by dreams and aspirations of what could and should  be. She could make you laugh, make you sad, and sometimes frustrated.  She evoked feelings you didn't know you had. In short, she would keep  you real. She was above all pretenses.   We will miss her contagious laugh. Without Misty, the world feels  lacking. But somehow, we will laugh again. Misty would have it no other  way. We will see you on the other side.   Madam Speaker, and my colleagues, please join me in praying for the  Holley family, Misty's friends, and everyone she touched. May the  strength of the Lord be with them as they endure the tremendous loss of  a wonderful life taken much too soon.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of amendment 56, which I was proud  to offer.   Madam Speaker, it is no secret what the Republican Party thinks of  the Chinese Communist Party and their attack on our global leadership  and the threat they pose to our exceptional Nation and the global order  we established and maintained.   If you look at the COVID outbreak and coverup, the treatment of  Uyghurs in Xinjiang, or the repression in Hong Kong, the facts clearly  establish that the CCP is unaccountable, unreliable, and untruthful.   While some in this Chamber want to think of them as a partner, I  cannot bring myself down to that level of naivety.   Let's call them what they are: they are a competitor; they are a  threat. That is why when I read this bill I was shocked to see that  Democrats are almost being complimentary when they refer to China and  their emission goals.   They say China ``is likely to achieve its carbon emissions'' pledge  to the Paris Agreement, and that their emissions will peak ahead of  schedule in 2030, a full 15 years after they agreed to Paris.   Some Democrats go on to highlight China's pledge to be carbon neutral  by 2060 and to phase down their coal-fired power generation. It reads  like a press release for the Chinese Communist Party published in the  Global Times or something tweeted by the bombastic foreign ministry  spokesmen, not policy from the United States Congress.   Worst of all, there is not even an attempt to fact check this  information. Take it as blind fact, despite coming from an autocratic,  Communist regime.   Trust but verify will not do here. With China it should be do not  trust until we verify and continue to verify.   Madam Speaker, are we so naive that we take China's word at face  value? I believe I speak for my fellow Republicans, and probably a few  of my friends on the other side of the aisle, when I say: No,  absolutely not.   We have no reason to believe the Communist leadership that has  publicly stated that their goal is to best us in every technological  field and establish global dominance.   In fact, we already have evidence that they falsified emissions data  before joining the Paris Agreement. But some still want to trust them?  It doesn't take a classified intel report to call China's bluff.   They have no intention of meeting these goals, but that won't stop  them from telling us that they are on track. If I had to guess, they  will say they are doing it even better than we are in reducing  emissions, if for nothing more than their ongoing information warfare  to make us appear weak and ineffectual on the world stage.   Madam Speaker, that is the purpose of my amendment. We need to have  the State Department, in consultation with the Department of Energy,  come in and give us the facts. This amendment requires an annual  briefing regarding the progress and efforts of China to meet emissions  goals.   We need to know: Is China telling the truth about how much they have  reduced emissions? Are they building more coal-fired power plants? Have  they successfully deployed carbon capture technologies the way we have?  These are answers we need for the United States to compete with China.   Knowledge is power and the quickest path to victory is understanding  your adversary. Despite all the other problems scattered throughout  this bill, I believe this amendment is a chance to at least do one  thing right.   This amendment is about accountability, this is about accuracy, and  most importantly, this is about knowing the full capabilities of our  largest and fiercest competitor.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support accountability, to  support accuracy, to support truth, and to support knowledge by  supporting this amendment.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
