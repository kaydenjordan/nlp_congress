 Mr. President, I thank my friend from Hawaii and Senator  Durbin for his work and Senator Cortez Masto, who is off to a really  good start in her first year in the Senate. I thank them for their work  on this issue that is personal to Senator Cortez Masto and Senator  Hirono because they are not that far removed from coming to this  country.   My family has been here longer, but this issue is personal to me  because of the people I met whom I will mention in my relatively short  remarks. I want to tell some stories about people I have met.   Immigrants in my State and across this country make vital  contributions to our economy and local communities. They are business  owners and entrepreneurs. They are educators and students. They are  workers and leaders in the community. They serve our Nation in the  military.   For many immigrants brought here as children--and this is the key  point--this is the only country they have ever known. They may speak  Spanish at home or speak Arabic at home or they may speak Bengali at  home or they may speak Urdu at home, but they don't know those  countries they came from because they were small children when they  came.   President Trump promised to go after violent criminals, not innocent  children. Unfortunately, his efforts have been aimed not at violent  criminals who should, in fact, be removed from our country, but he has  gone after so many innocent families and innocent children.   My daughter Emily is a legal aid lawyer for immigration in Columbus.  She has told me stories of families who have played by the rules, they  worked hard, they are active in their church, they hold full-time jobs,  and they are raising their kids. Their kids are doing well in school,  and the mother and father get deported, not because they have ever  committed a crime but because they came here a number of years ago to  escape violence in the countries they came from.   Those are not the same situations exactly as these DACA kids, but we  know who these DACA children are--these Dreamers. We shouldn't be  targeting young people who are contributing to this country--the  country they grew up in, and the only home they have ever known. They  are working, going to school, paying taxes, and serving in our  military.   Ariel was brought to the United States as a baby when he needed  medical treatment for a rare condition. He has lived here ever since.  He attends Cuyahoga Community College, a few hours from my home. He is  working toward a degree in business administration. He wants to be an  entrepreneur who will create jobs in his community and my community.  Other Dreamers have jobs, and they are contributing already to our  community.   I heard from Elvis, who grew up in Northwest Ohio. He graduated from  Ohio State and works at Nationwide. He told us:         The contributions of DACA recipients are not only present       in metropolitan areas but also in rural ones. This is evident       to me, someone who grew up in rural Ohio, and whose family       continues to live there, every day.    Nathali in Columbus works as a product development and design  engineer at Honda. She has lived here since she was 9. Her DACA status  expires this summer. If she isn't protected, she will probably have to  give up her job. She is contributing to America's economy, to Ohio's  auto industry, and she pays taxes.  [[Page S7970]]    I heard from Vania in Delta, OH, a suburban farm community west of  Toledo. She oversees the entire human resources department in her  company, one of the largest bell pepper growers in the country. She  said:         I was raised in this community, graduated high school and       college here, and am currently giving back to it in my role.       I have established myself as a contributing member of this       community and for this reason, among many others, I deserve a       chance to continue my work.    All she says is: I want to continue my work. I want to continue  raising a family. I want to continue contributing to this country. I  want to continue to work in my community. I want to continue to be a  good citizen. She is not asking for a handout. She wants what most  Americans want, to be able to keep doing her work.   There is no question our immigration system is broken, but we don't  fix it by kicking out these contributing members of our communities who  grew up here--underscore that. They may not have been born here, but  they grew up here. They know our country. They live in Toledo and  Dayton and Xenia, and they live in Mansfield. Those are their lives, as  it was my life growing up in Mansfield.   We don't fix our immigration system by kicking out these contributing  members who grew up here and made their home here--who are American in  every sense except the paperwork. It is time for us to come together to  put partisan considerations aside and pass a commonsense solution that  protects these kids, protects these Dreamers, and upholds our American  values   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.
