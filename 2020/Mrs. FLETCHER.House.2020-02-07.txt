 Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim time in  opposition, although I do not oppose the amendment.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H957]]    Madam Chair, I rise today to offer this bipartisan amendment with my  colleague and neighbor, Mr. Crenshaw, to help families who, through no  fault of their own, were denied disaster recovery funding--in our case,  for our constituents affected by Hurricane Harvey.   As Members of this body will recall, Hurricane Harvey landed on the  Texas Gulf Coast in August of 2017. It was the second costliest  hurricane in United States history. It took 68 lives, it dropped more  than 60 inches of rain, and it caused nearly $125 billion in damages.   Our community came together to help, and we showed each other and the  Nation how much we can accomplish when we work together to help our  neighbors in need.   This body worked, too, appropriating funds quickly to help those  affected for immediate assistance and for long-term rebuilding.   But the needs were great and the funds, though well-intentioned, were  slow. So many of our constituents took out loans from the Small  Business Administration, where they could get low-interest loans to  begin the necessary and immediate work of rebuilding.   When they applied for the SBA loans, they were told that taking out a  loan would not disqualify them from other disaster aid. Unfortunately,  they were, in fact, disqualified from other forms of Federal aid  because they had taken out an SBA loan.                                time  1100    If they had taken out a loan from a friend or a bank, they would not  have been in this situation. They would still be eligible for the  Federal aid.   But because they chose to take out an SBA loan in the midst of an  unprecedented disaster, they were disqualified from receiving further  Federal assistance.   Of course, that is inconsistent with the program, it is inconsistent  with the intent of this body to punish people for seeking help from the  agencies that are there to help them in their times of need.   I have heard from so many constituents who have been left behind by  what, by all accounts, was a mistaken interpretation of the intent and  the rules that need to be corrected. We simply cannot leave them  behind.   We now have the opportunity to correct this error here and to bring  meaningful relief to disaster victims. This amendment will fund $45  million to those in Texas who were wrongfully denied assistance because  they took out SBA disaster recovery loans. We have a chance today to  right this wrong and to deliver the help that our neighbors have been  waiting on for years.   During Harvey, our community demonstrated that we are at our best  when we are working together to solve problems, and this amendment does  the same.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Price), the chairman of the Transportation, and  Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I thank my colleagues for their collaboration on this bill. I thank  Mr. Crenshaw for working with me on this important effort for our  community and for communities across our State and, of course, our  country.   I thank everyone for their collaboration and support in this effort,  and for the eloquent statements and important statements made this  morning in support of this amendment on the floor.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment. And I yield  back the balance of my time.
