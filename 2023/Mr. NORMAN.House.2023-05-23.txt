 Madam Speaker, as I sit here and listen--I am on the  Rules Committee--I hope all those listening in the balcony, what my  Democrat friends are saying are just words. My strong belief is that  this fentanyl bill, H.R. 467, is a step in the right direction.   The issue that is plaguing this country is the invasion of the  border.   Where have we heard one word from my Democrat colleagues about  stopping the invasion?   We are a Nation of borders. Every nation is sovereign or you cease to  be a Nation. That is where our fentanyl is coming in and it shocks me  to keep hearing you say it is coming in at designated points of entry.  There are no designated points of entry. The whole border is open.                                time  1300    The lives that were lost due to the drug overdoses that killed  100,000 of our young people last year, why does that not resonate? I  have no earthly idea why this administration is intent on keeping our  borders open, and they know it.   You got a Vice President who is laughing at it. You got a President  who hasn't even been there other than to go on one regulated visit to  the border. It is insane, and the American people are tired of it.   In South Carolina, I went to a news conference with police officers.  They seized enough fentanyl to wipe out the whole State of South  Carolina. What do we hear from the other side? Crickets. We hear  nothing, and it is a crying shame of what happens.   Mr. Speaker, I will end with this: A DEA agent who was talking about  this problem--he had picture after picture of our young people--said,  In the morgue, there are no drug treatment centers. In the morgue,  there are no education systems. In the morgue, there are no things to  coach people who are in a casket. It is a sad day for America, and  hopefully this insanity will end at some point in time when a new  administration takes over.  [[Page H2519]]
