 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand for life.   I am a wife, a mother, and a grandmother. I have felt life quicken in  my womb. I know the blessing of children, all of whom are created in  God's image. And that is why I am so saddened by the pro-abortion  discussions taking place around the country and in places like New  York, Virginia, and others, where State legislatures are debating and  legalizing abortion all the way up to birth and, in some cases, after a  child is born.   I am sickened that laws are being written which allow for a baby who  survives an abortion attempt to no longer receive support and care once  they are born. This is infanticide. There is no other way to say it.  This is an affront to life.   We must demand more from our country and our citizens. We must ensure  protections for the youngest and most innocent of our citizens, both  inside and outside the womb. We must take care of those who cannot take  care of themselves. We must take care of our children. We must take  care of and respect and cherish life.
