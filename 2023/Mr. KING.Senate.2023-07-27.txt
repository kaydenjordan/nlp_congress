 Mr. President, I want to say a few words about my vote in  support of the Hawley amendment No. 1058, relating to expansion of the  Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. I voted in favor of this  amendment, but I would like to highlight that an important group is  left out of this expansion: payments to beneficiaries of deceased  individuals who were responsible for cleaning up atomic testing sites.  While this amendment includes payments to beneficiaries of deceased  individuals who qualify under the new Manhattan Project Waste sections,  cleanup veterans are notably left out of such payments to their  beneficiaries upon their passing.   I hope that during the conference process for the underlying bill, we  are able to include this provision to ensure just compensation for  these veterans and their families. If we are not able to include these  veterans during the conference process, I hope to work with my  colleagues to provide benefits to our cleanup veterans as standalone  legislation or through another appropriate, legislative vehicle.    Mr. President, today I want to take a moment to recognize a  dear friend and devoted advocate for Maine, my legislative director,  Morgan Cashwell. She proudly served my office and the people of Maine  for more than 8 years. Years filled with sleepless nights of vote-a- ramas, preparation for committee hearings, and long negotiations. She  has been an extraordinary leader, an effective policymaker, and a  wonderful colleague and mentor to so many.   There is never an ``easy'' time to work in Congress, but certainly,  there have been few times more challenging or unpredictable than during  the COVID-19 pandemic. Taking over as legislative director amid  regularly shifting public health guidance, Morgan was able to maintain  a successful and efficient legislative team, all while keeping morale  high and putting Maine people first. This leadership--rooted in  kindness--has made her beloved by everyone in the office and all those  who are lucky enough to know her.   You never want staff who will just tell you what you want to hear;  that was never Morgan. In fact, Morgan embodies the Maine spirit of  ``calling `em like you see `em'' and providing her honest advice in  even the toughest situations. I valued her counsel and knew it was  always guided by an unshakable moral compass and a true compassion for  others.   Not only is Morgan among the best staffers I have had the privilege  of working with; you could not find a more effective legislative  director in Congress. During her time working for Maine, it is not an  exaggeration to say that Morgan's steady hand has helped shape some our  most important recent bills. Her impact can be found across  generational investments in the great outdoors, the country's most  significant piece of climate legislation, and a historic expansion of  broadband infrastructure.   To cite just one example of many: When Maine's vital and iconic  lobster industry came under threat last year, Morgan led the successful  effort to defend the livelihood of thousands of men and women who  responsibly work the water against an otherwise certain economic death  sentence. Thanks to her fierce advocacy, the Maine delegation was able  to include protection for our State's lobstering communities in the  2023 omnibus appropriations legislation, a last-minute addition that  might not have happened without her dedication, selfless nature, and  tireless determination to do what was right.   While I am truly sad to see her go, I wish Morgan all the best as she  enters this next chapter of her career and profoundly thank her and her  supportive family: husband Keith and her children Rory and Reese.   Morgan, I will be forever grateful for your service. Maine, my staff,  and the entire country are all better for it.                            ____________________
