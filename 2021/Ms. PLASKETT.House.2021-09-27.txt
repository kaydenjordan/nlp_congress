 Madam Speaker, this weekend I had the honor to work on  our budget reconciliation in the Budget Committee. The legislation  contains economic development initiatives that I have long championed  to create good-paying jobs while lowering costs and cutting taxes for  American families. This is the kind of legislation that assures the  rest of the American people that they have not been abandoned in their  time of need.   The Build Back Better Act is a true job creator, creating millions of  jobs while tackling the climate crisis and ensuring that America will  not only compete but lead the way to a more prosperous future.   Historic investments in clean energy technology will create 2 million  jobs each year over the next decade, while reducing carbon emissions by  over 50 percent by the year 2030. We also include investment in  workforce training to connect workers to jobs, research and development  to strengthen American manufacturing, and access to credit and  investment for small businesses.   The Build Back Better Act will also make significant investments in  American agriculture. As a member of the Agriculture Committee, we were  able to include critical investments in agricultural research, rural  development, and renewable energy: $7.75 billion in agriculture  research and infrastructure; $18 billion in rural job-promoting  investments to ensure those living in rural America, on Tribal lands,  and our insular areas have access to clean water and reliable and  efficient renewal energy; and $40 billion in investments in forestry  programs.   It should concern us, and it concerns me, that CEOs make more than  350 times more than the average worker, that billionaires have seen  their wealth increase up to $1.18 trillion during the pandemic, or that  55 of the largest corporations have paid zero dollars in Federal income  taxes on over $40 billion of profits.   These are what my colleagues, the Republicans, are calling job  creators. Recognize that phrase when you hear them say job creators. It  means those CEOs and those businesses that have created wealth for  themselves without jobs for the American people.   It is incredulous to me that the top 1 percent has evaded paying an  estimated $160 billion in taxes each year while the average American  pays his or her taxes every year. Millionaires and billionaires are  paying lower taxes than teachers, cops, and firefighters.   But Democrats are bringing legislation that is going to keep America  great, that is going to continue to make America the innovators. This  is our moment to change the course of progress toward the everyday  American.   History will point to this week, this law, as the significant  transformation in the lives of the American people and overall success  of true American greatness.                            ____________________
