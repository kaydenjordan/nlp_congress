 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about our efforts here  in the people's House to reform our Tax Code and reduce the burden of  the Federal Government on every American. Right now, Americans know  that our Tax Code is unfair, it is too long, and it is too complicated.   It has been 30 years since we have made meaningful reforms, and the  time for that change is now. House and Senate Republicans have  announced reforms that will make the Tax Code simpler, with more than  90 percent of filers being able to do their returns on a simple  postcard.   We have asked to make the Tax Code fair for middle class Americans,  lowering their rates and doubling their standard deduction. We have  asked to give relief to low-income Americans by eliminating the lowest  10 percent bracket completely and cutting the 15 percent bracket to 12.  We have asked to crack down on tax avoidance by ending the dozens and  dozens of loopholes that only the wealthiest taxpayers and corporations  can take advantage of.   Mr. Speaker, we have a unique opportunity to do so much for  hardworking families across America. I hope that my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle will join us, offer solutions, and make this a  bipartisan effort to give the American people the relief they deserve.                            ____________________
