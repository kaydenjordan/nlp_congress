 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member and my  colleague from Maryland for yielding.   It is so rich to hear the other side discuss the sacred right of  voting, discuss what our veterans and our servicemembers fought for,  and the sacred right of voting while defending and continuing to defend  the disenfranchisement of American citizens in D.C. for their right to  vote.   They don't believe in statehood. They don't believe in the actual  enfranchisement and voting rights for D.C. residents who are U.S.  citizens.   Yet, they have the audacity and the gall to not just continue in that  position and claim they believe in the sacred right to vote while  denying that right to vote to an overwhelmingly Black city, but then  expanding their position--expanding their position--so that, in direct  contradiction of their ``conservative'' values of small government and  defending freedom, they have decided to expand the jurisdiction of this  body to meddle into the business of D.C. residents.                                time  1730    The D.C. Council has the right to determine its policies for D.C.  residents. If any Member of this body does not like that, they can feel  free to change their registration, resign their post, and run for D.C.  Council.   For those who are residents here of Washington, D.C., they could have  gone, as the ranking member stated, to any one of the many hearings on  this issue.   I understand that there may be disagreement. I understand that  Republicans may not be happy with what the D.C. Council is doing, but  when cities in Vermont pass the same provisions, when San Francisco,  when nine Maryland cities brought up this provision, did the Republican  Party corral all of Congress and bring this issue down to the floor for  a vote?   No, they did not.   They are singling out the residents of the District of Columbia and  expanding in the history of disenfranchisement that goes all the way  back to the legacy of slavery, and they are bringing it right here to  this floor. Because why? They don't have any real bills to debate. We  are not here to talk about healthcare; we are not here to talk about  abortion; we are not here to talk about voting rights. We are here to  talk about the expansion and the continued subjugation and  disenfranchisement of the people of the District of Columbia. Let them  govern themselves.
