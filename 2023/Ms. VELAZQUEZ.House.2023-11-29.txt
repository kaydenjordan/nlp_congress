 Madam Chair, I thank Ranking Member Grijalva for  yielding.   I rise today in opposition to this disingenuous bill introduced under  the guise of protecting National Park Service land.   If Republicans were really concerned about protecting our national  parks, why did they vote to cut the National Park Service budget by  approximately half a billion dollars in the appropriations bill that  they passed less than a month ago?                                time  1430    The point here is not to protect the National Park Service. The point  here is cruelty.   If extreme MAGA Republicans really wanted to preserve public lands,  why have they passed bills that include shameless giveaways of our  public lands and waters to the destructive oil, gas, and mining  industries?   If Republicans really cared about our Federal lands, why have they  continuously tried to gut bedrock environmental laws, like the  Endangered Species Act, since taking the majority?   Republicans do not care about our national parks. They are simply  looking for more excuses to spread anti-immigrant rhetoric.   I know firsthand that the situation in New York is a humanitarian  crisis and not a partisan issue. If you want to tackle the root cause  of this, let's get together to draft legislation. We have legislation  that has been introduced--in many instances, bipartisan legislation.  Let's get real and deal with the broken system that we have in this  country and address comprehensive immigration reform.    We must ensure that people fleeing violence and  persecution, regardless of nationality or other demographics, can  access asylum and the refugee resettlement system in this country, as  required by law.   New York City is doing all it can to accomplish this, but it cannot  do it alone. The real solution here is to increase support for the city  and the individuals exercising their protected right to seek asylum in  the United States.   The bill before us today is performative and vilifies migrants,  making it harder for New York City to meet this moment.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment,  which would allow the Secretary of the Interior to provide housing when  States sending asylum seekers to New York City fail to meet certain  conditions.   Today, there are over 65,900 asylum seekers currently in the care of  the city. To respond to this influx, our city has opened 213 sites,  including 18 large-scale humanitarian relief centers.   A guiding principle of New York City's response has been that people  fleeing violence and persecution deserve a functioning asylum and  refugee resettlement system in this country.   To my colleagues who are intent on labeling these people illegal, I  ask, do they not have the legal right to seek asylum enshrined under  the Geneva Refugee Convention and U.S. law?   Asylum seekers are human beings who have fled disaster, conflict, and  persecution to come to the United States for a better life. They  deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. They should not be used  as pawns in cruel political stunts.   Politicians from States like Texas and Florida have bused asylum  seekers to New York to get on cable news. These buses are often sent  with little to no communication from officials in those States. Tens of  thousands of migrants have been sent to New York from various  originating States, no matter if they wanted to come or not. They may  not have a clue about the conditions they will find in New York or the  resources available to them.   As temperatures fall below freezing, there are lines of asylum  seekers waiting outside of centers because they have reached their 30- day limit at city-run shelters. They have nowhere else to go. However,  here we are, debating a bill that will close Floyd Bennett Field.   My amendment will ensure that asylum seekers--not illegal aliens but  asylum seekers--who are bused from State to State without support,  scant information, and no other options can access the resources they  deserve. Specifically, my amendment allows the Secretary of the  Interior to authorize the use of land controlled by the National Park  Service for the purpose of housing migrants when a State fails to  provide 48 hours' notice to the receiving State or provide truthful  information to the migrants about where they are being transported to  or provide the opportunity to refuse the busing.   We have heard hundreds of migrant stories about not knowing where  they are being sent. We cannot allow this practice to continue without  consequences. My amendment will help create an accountability system  for the States that decide to deceptively bus migrants to other States  like New York.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
