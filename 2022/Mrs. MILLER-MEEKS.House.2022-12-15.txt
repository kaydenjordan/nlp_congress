 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  University of Iowa's Jack Campbell for being named to the All-American  Football Team and being recognized as this year's Butkus Award winner,  the first in the university's history.   This is not Jack's first accolade. He was also named the Butkus- Fitzgerald Big Ten Linebacker of the Year award recipient as well as  the Nagurski-Wooden Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year, and he  received the William V. Campbell Trophy throughout his 4 years with the  Hawkeyes.   This season, Jack had 118 tackles, two interceptions, one recovered  fumble, and one forced fumble. Jack was pivotal in leading the  defensive lineup to be named one of the best in the country, making him  very deserving of these awards.   Jack is another example of the University of Iowa students excelling  inside and outside of the classroom.   Congratulations to Jack on an outstanding 4 years, and I wish you the  very best in your future endeavors.   Go Hawkeyes.                            ____________________
