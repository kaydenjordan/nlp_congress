 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I would like to begin by thanking  Congresswoman Lowey, our Subcommittee Chairman Price, and their staff  for working with me on this amendment and for their critical leadership  on this bill.   I would also like to thank my sisters in service, Congresswoman  Velazquez and Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, for leading this amendment  with me. I am so proud to partner with them to make our government more  accessible, especially in times of disaster.   This amendment ensures meaningful access to fellow Americans with  limited English abilities to the public information maintained by  grantees of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Community  Development Fund.   The amendment rests on two principles, Madam Chair. First, the Puerto  Rican people have a right to know how this relief money is being spent  in their own communities.   Second, no one is in a better position to hold officials and grant  recipients accountable and to ensure that the money we allocate today  is used in the best interests of the community than the people of  Puerto Rico themselves.   That is why it is critical that we ensure that any information made  available is easily accessible to all people, regardless of what  language they speak.   I cannot overstate how important it is that we pass this bill. The  people of Puerto Rico are struggling and persevering through some of  the most difficult circumstances that any of us have ever experienced.   The bill provides over $4 billion in critical disaster relief and  long-term recovery assistance, and funds programs and grants to get  kids back in fully-functioning schools, repairing damages to  infrastructure and roads, and to rebuild the island's electrical grid  that has been damaged because of disasters and so forth, and ensure  that no one else is affected, or that children don't go to sleep  hungry.   It is time--it is time to release these funds.   To hold the money that can save lives is not only inhumane and  immoral, but it is, more dangerously, a form of oppression. The  disconnection to human suffering that we cause by doing nothing is what  will continue to fail the American people.   Passing this bill fulfills the central promise of our democracy  governed ``of the people, by the people, and for the people.''                                time  1115    Passing this amendment in this bill ensures that some of the most  vulnerable people have full access to democracy, regardless of who they  are, where they are from, and what language they speak.   I urge my colleagues to please support this amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman  [[Page H959]]  from North Carolina (Mr. Price), my distinguished fellow colleague and  chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation, and Housing and Urban  Development, and Related Agencies.    Madam Chair, I want to reiterate the importance of this  amendment. As a person who was born and raised in this country and who  didn't speak English when I started school, and who is now a Member of  this Chamber, I can tell my colleagues personally how critical this is  to our democracy and to protecting all of us.   I thank my colleagues again for their tremendous support, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
