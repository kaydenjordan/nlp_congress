 Mr. Speaker, I intend to support the en bloc  package even though it is not in our jurisdiction.   At this time, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Issa), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I intend to support this package,  and I urge its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his  leadership in this endeavor. This is a very important piece of  legislation, a very bipartisan product, and I hope that our colleagues  on both sides of the aisle will join the chairman and I in giving final  passage to this important piece of legislation.
