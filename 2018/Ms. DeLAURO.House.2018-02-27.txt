 Mr. Speaker, this is National Anti-Hunger Week. The  United States is the richest nation on Earth. We are a land of  abundance. And yet millions of people in our country go to bed hungry  every single night.   They are called food insecure, but what it is is that they are  hungry, and programs like the food stamp program, the SNAP program,  have enjoyed bipartisan support for decades because great leaders,  people like George McGovern, Bob Dole, Ted Kennedy, Jack Kennedy, and  people like Jake Javits, said that we have a moral obligation to combat  hunger in the United States.   What we need to do is to strengthen the SNAP program, not sabotage  it. This administration's new proposals to implement strict work  requirements are a thinly veiled attempt to throw people off of the  program.   The vast majority of SNAP recipients already work if they can. USDA's  most recent data shows that work rates have been increasing year after  year.   The food box proposal is an attack on the dignity of the families  that have fallen on hard times. Undermining SNAP will not eradicate  hunger. It throws many Americans into deep poverty and desperation at  times when they need support the most.   Food insecurity affects veterans, working families, children,  workers,  [[Page H1277]]  the unemployed, and seniors. It is about lifting people out of poverty.  It is about supporting our economy. It works for households with  children.                            ____________________
