 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  the CARES Act.   Americans are facing a public health crisis that is an unprecedented  threat to the health and safety of our communities. Hospitals are  struggling to care for our communities and get the protective equipment  they need. The pandemic has brought schools, businesses, and whole  States to a standstill, including my home State of Massachusetts.   Americans are calling for help, and today we will vote to bring them  relief and offer them a lifeline, but it won't be the end of our  support. To those on the front lines--healthcare workers, cashiers,  childcare providers, truck drivers, cleaners, and postal workers--and  to all Americans, we say: We see you. We appreciate and are grateful  for your sacrifice, and we will continue to fight for the people.
