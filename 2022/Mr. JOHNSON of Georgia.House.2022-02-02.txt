 Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Speaker, my amendment would help  strengthen cybersecurity, improve American competitiveness, and  contribute to a more diverse workplace by creating the David Satcher  Cybersecurity Education Grant Program which gives the Commerce  Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology, also known  as NIST, the authority to make grants to historically Black colleges  and universities and also minority-serving institutions and schools  that serve large numbers of Pell Grant receiving students. It would  help these students promote cybersecurity education and research.   Madam Speaker, we must include more women and minorities so we are  maximizing all the tech talent our country has to offer. We are engaged  in a cyber war, and we need all hands on deck. HBCUs are doing some of  the most sophisticated and technologically advanced work in our Nation,  and we should tap into and fully support those institutions to help us  win this cyber war. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment when  it comes up.   I would also recognize the fact that, as I have listened to the  debate today on this very important topic, from my friends on the other  side of the aisle I have heard a lot of Asian bashing. It is quite  dangerous for us to go down that path, stoking the passions of people  against other people. This is not about other people. This is about  what America can do to put itself in a position to protect its supply  chains and to make things in America and restore the greatness that  this country has.   Madam Speaker, I would urge my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle to refrain from the constant bashing of Asian people because it  translates into real time. I mean, it has a real detrimental effect to  our brothers and sisters who may not look like some but they are  people, too. They are Americans as well. So we should not demonize an  entire people just to score cheap political points.
