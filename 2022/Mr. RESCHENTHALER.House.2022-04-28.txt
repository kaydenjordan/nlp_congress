 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman,  my good friend from Maryland, (Mr. Raskin), for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the rule before us today provides for consideration of  S. 3522, the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022.   Mr. Speaker, let me start by saying that I strongly support this  bill, which streamlines existing defense authorities to enable the  President to enter into a lend-lease agreement directly with Ukraine  and Eastern European countries.    I know I speak for my Republican colleagues in expressing my  wholehearted support for the people of Ukraine as they defend  themselves and their democracy against Vladimir Putin's atrocities.  That is why I look forward--and so do so many of my colleagues--to  voting for this bill later today.   However, I have to urge my colleagues to oppose this rule as it  continues Speaker Pelosi's authoritarian lockdown of the House of  Representatives.   For over 2 years the Speaker has used COVID-19 as an excuse to deny  Members the ability to advocate on behalf of the people they represent.  This rule keeps those oppressive procedures in place, despite the fact  that even the bluest of States are easing their COVID restrictions.  This is just further proof that my colleagues across the aisle care  only about political science, not about real science.   Further, Mr. Speaker, this rule fails to provide for consideration of  legislation to address the serious issues facing the American people.  Under the Biden administration, our Nation has careened from one crisis  to the next.   Right now, families across the country are facing a 41-year high in  inflation and skyrocketing gas and food prices. These are expected to  cost the average American family $5,000 a year.                                time  1245    This morning we learned the U.S. GDP fell by 1.4 percent during the  first quarter of 2022. This is getting worse by the day. Forty percent  of small businesses are planning to raise prices by 10 percent just to  keep up with inflation. This economic crisis is not the result of the  war in Ukraine as President Biden and the leftists on the other side of  the aisle like to claim. This crisis is a direct result of the  Democrats' out-of-control spending and their far-left, dangerous,  radical policies.   Just look at the fact that inflation has increased every month since  Joe Biden has been President. Putin didn't invade Ukraine until  February of this year, yet during President Biden's first year in  office--again, well before the invasion of Ukraine--gas prices jumped  nearly 53 percent, from $2.25 a gallon to $3.44 a gallon. Again, that  was before Russian soldiers ever crossed the border in Ukraine.   But talking about borders, let's talk about our southern border. The  border crisis is a direct result of Joe Biden's incompetence, and the  radical policies of the left are leading to disaster. Thanks to the  open border policy of the left, last month over 200,000 illegal  immigrants were encountered at our southern border. That is a new  Biden-era high. Again, that is over 200,000 illegal immigrants. To put  this in perspective for my colleagues, that is roughly three  congressional districts.   Since Biden took office, over 2.4 million illegal immigrants have  been apprehended at our southern border, including more than 40  individuals who are on the terrorist watch list. This is only going to  get worse if President Biden gets away with lifting title 42.   So, again, Mr. Speaker, while I support S. 3522 and, of course, the  people of Ukraine, I believe this is a missed opportunity to help the  American people, the people in southwestern Pennsylvania, and the  people throughout this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I, therefore, urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the  previous question and ``no'' on the rule, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Maryland said that we just can't help  but to disagree. Nothing could be further from the truth. This bill  could be passed on the suspension calendar. This is going to pass by  well over two-thirds vote. It passed, I believe, unanimously in the  Senate. The fact that we are here debating a rule on this instead of  just passing this on suspension is a waste of time. This bill will  pass.   But we have got a real crisis at the southern border. We have got  inflation. Even the Biden administration said we are expected to have  food shortages. We also are failing to project American power abroad,  which is leading to chaos all over the world.   We agree on the issue with Ukraine, yet we are still here wasting  valuable time that we could be using to address real problems.   But let's just go back to the southern border. As I mentioned earlier  in my remarks, just in March, encounters at the southern border hit a  new Biden-era high of over 200,000 individuals encountered at the  southern border. In addition to apprehending individuals from the  terrorist watch list, Border Patrol agents are seeing an increase in  illicit drugs, including deadly fentanyl. Alarmingly, fentanyl border  seizures increased by 134 percent in fiscal year 2021. President Biden  and House Democrats had this open border policy that is creating a  humanitarian and a security crisis both at the border and in our  communities where people are literally dying from fentanyl overdoses.    With all that in consideration, the Democrats and the left still want  to do away with title 42 and lift it. That is why, Mr. Speaker, if we  defeat the previous question, I will personally offer an amendment to  the rule to immediately consider H.R. 471, the PAUSE Act of to 2021.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record along with any extraneous material immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Stefanik), who is the Republican Conference chair.  She will explain the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Just two quick points in rebuttal for my friend from Pennsylvania.   First off, if there is concern about the humanitarian crisis on the  southern border, the best thing you can do is try to bring order to  that southern border. The trek that these individuals have to take is  incredibly dangerous. Women and children are often exploited. Coyotes  are making literally millions of dollars. Oftentimes, when the illegal  immigrants come to the United States, they are put in sort of  indentured servant status to the drug cartels and the coyotes.   The perverse thing about arguing that you care about people is that  if you really did care about the humanitarian crisis, you would share  the Republican viewpoint of law and order.   Secondly, to the fact that we need to act quickly on the bill  regarding Ukraine, my colleagues across the aisle could have passed  this bill on Tuesday. The fact that we are here wasting time on a bill  that could have passed by suspension just shows the lack of seriousness  on the other issues facing the American people. To act quickly, my  colleagues should have been advocating this bill be run on Tuesday on  suspension.   Here to talk more about these issues is the Republican leader of the  Oversight and Reform Committee, Mr.   James Comer of Kentucky, who  recently led a delegation to the southern border.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Comer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman from Kentucky.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Georgia (Mrs. Greene).    Mr. Speaker, I would request to have words taken  down.    Mr. Speaker, no objection.  [[Page H4591]]     Mr. Speaker, I would tell my colleague across the  aisle that I still have several speakers, just so we are on the same  page.   Mr. Speaker, there were comments made prior regarding why we, on our  side of the aisle, are not talking about the underlying bill.   The answer to that is very simple. Let's put this into perspective.   We are here debating the rule.   We are not debating final passage. In fact, we don't need to debate  final passage because the vast majority of my colleagues agree on this  particular bill. We are not here debating final passage of the bill.   We are debating, in essence, the rest of the legislative calendar for  the day. We simply are arguing that in this calendar and in the agenda  for the rest of the day, we should be considering other important  matters, such as the crisis at the southern border.   So I just felt like I needed to put that in perspective.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.  Guest), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Green), my good friend, to rebut the gentleman from  Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, let me just be clear. We are not  going down several roads. We are going down one road with this argument  and that is the southern border.   I am willing to bet that this vote will pass, the underlying bill  will pass with over a two-thirds vote. We could have tried to run this  on Tuesday. Even if it did fail, we could have been here running it  today.   We have delayed this when we have serious business to discuss,  particularly the southern border. And that is what we are debating; the  fact that the legislative business for today should include the crisis  at the southern border.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Carter), my good friend, and a good pharmacist, to talk more about the  crisis at the southern border.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, let me just start by reiterating that I and the vast  majority of my colleagues support S. 3522, and we look forward to  voting on that bill later today. We need to bolster Ukraine's defense  capability and protect vulnerable civilian populations in Ukraine.   However, we are debating the rule right now. The rule before us  extends Speaker Pelosi's authoritarian COVID lockdown that has stripped  rank-and-file Members of their ability to advocate for the people they  represent.   Let's just look at the stats. Ninety percent of the country is in a  low-risk community level. That is according to the CDC; over 90 percent  of the country. So why is the Speaker so afraid to let the House get  back to work?   If the Speaker followed the real science, not the political science  the left has followed through this entire pandemic, the Speaker would  allow the people's House to resume regular business.   Further, this rule is a missed opportunity to address the serious  issues that are facing American families. American families are getting  hammered by inflation. Gas prices are out of control. The border crisis  is raging, and we are being told by President Biden that we are  expected to face food shortages in future months.                                time  1345    On top of all that bad news, just this morning, we learned the GDP  decreased at an annual rate of 1.4 percent in the first quarter of  2022. Our GDP is decreasing. This is the weakest showing since the  pandemic recovery began and this falls well below the projections of  economists.   So, instead of passing legislation to address the serious economic  crisis we are facing and the serious security issue we are facing at  the southern border, Democratic leadership is sending the House home a  day early. We were supposed to be here tomorrow. Yet, we are getting  sent home early, despite all these issues facing the American people.   We can do a lot more for this country and the American people. For  that reason, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question and ``no'' on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
