 Madam Speaker, this week, the Republican majority won  the honor of having run the most closed Congress in American history:  84 closed rules, zero open rules.   What does that mean? It means that they blocked us from fully  debating or amending legislation, prohibiting us from fully giving our  constituents a voice in this Congress.   Why are we here? Our constituents sent us here to be able to debate  issues and to vote on those issues.   Two weeks ago, the majority blocked my amendment to ensure equal pay  for equal work. Congress passed the Equal Pay Act in 1963 to end  unequal wages. Yet, in 2018, women still earn about 80 cents, on  average, to a man's dollar. The gap is worse for women of color.   A woman working full-time will lose $400,000 over the course of her  career. African American women lose $840,000. Latinas will lose over $1  million.   Since women are the sole or co-breadwinner in half of the families  with children, our Nation's families and our economy suffers, which is  why I offered the Paycheck Fairness Act as an amendment. It toughens  remedies in the Equal Pay Act to help America's working women fight  wage discrimination and receive a full paycheck. They blocked it.   The strength of this institution is its potential to make a  difference in the lives of the American people. That is vital when the  biggest economic challenge is jobs that do not pay them enough to live  on.   We cannot help raise wages, improve education, or fix crumbling  infrastructure when this majority, more than any in American history,  has closed the House to debate and to amendments. They closed it to  action. It is unacceptable. The American people deserve better.
