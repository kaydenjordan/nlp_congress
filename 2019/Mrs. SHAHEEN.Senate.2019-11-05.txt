 Madam President, I have come to the floor to pay  tribute to Thomas Iverson, Jr., a longtime New Hampshire resident and  law enforcement official who passed away recently at the age of 72.  Although he was born in Massachusetts and lived briefly in Maine,  George was in many ways a quintessential Granite Stater. He had big  personality and a passion for public service that brought him to posts  across our great State.   After an honorable discharge from the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam  war, Tom began his long career in law enforcement with the Manchester  Police Department. He served in New Hampshire's Queen City for 6 years  before, at the age of 26, becoming chief of police for the town of  Bradford, a small community of roughly 1000 residents west of Concord.  He continued his commitment to protecting communities across New  Hampshire as lieutenant with the Merrimack Police Department, chief of  police in Pembroke, and finally serving as chief of the Litchfield  Police Department. Following a law enforcement career that spanned  three and a half decades with service in five towns, Tom retired in  2004.   Though a full retirement would have been well-deserved, Tom wanted to  [[Page S6391]]  continue dedicating his life to public service. His next move took him  to Maine, where he was named the director of the Emergency Management  Agency for Piscataquis County in 2005, acting as a link between  communities and the State in responding to natural and manmade  disasters in Maine's least populous county. He returned to the Granite  State in 2012 and became involved in courthouse security for the New  Hampshire Judicial Branch's facilities in Manchester.   Throughout his career, Tom was a strong proponent of what we now know  as community policing. He knew the value of police officers building  trust and forging strong ties with the people they serve. When he  served as chief in Bradford, Pembroke, and Litchfield, Tom was a  reliable and approachable presence in the community. His commitment to  this community-based approach did not surprise those who knew him and  his commitment to helping and enjoying the company of others. At many  local potlucks, he was known to bring his trademark Norwegian meatballs  with pasta. Although incredibly giving of his time and wisdom, Tom kept  this recipe a closely-held secret.   The Granite State and the many communities he served are grateful for  his many gifts and acts of selfless service. In the last month, family  and friends have gathered to share and cherish their many fond memories  of him. I am with them in spirit as they reflect on the life of this  good and generous man.                            ____________________
