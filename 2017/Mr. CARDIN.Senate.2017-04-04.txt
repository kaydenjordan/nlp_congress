 Madam President, I take this time to explain to the  people of Maryland and our Nation my views on Judge Neil Gorsuch to be  an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.   There is no more important responsibility that a Member of the Senate  has than the advice and consent of an Associate Justice of the Supreme  Court of the United States. Of the many important responsibilities we  have, this is one of the most important responsibilities.   I have taken this on to try to understand as much as I can about  Judge Gorsuch, to understand the dynamics of what his membership on the  Supreme Court would mean, because I recognize it is not just an  appointment for this term of Congress. This is a lifetime appointment,  and it is very possible that he, if confirmed, will serve on the  Supreme Court for a generation. So his impact on the workings of the  Supreme Court is something that is extremely important to each Member  of the Senate.   I think many of us are looking for an Associate Justice who can bring  about more consensus on the Supreme Court, who can try to deal with  some of the great divisions in our Nation in a way that represents the  values of our Constitution, that will allow our Nation to move forward  in a united way.   We also recognize that the Senate must give an independent evaluation  of a Supreme Court Justice. This is not because the President of your  party nominated someone to the Supreme Court, whether you support or  oppose; it is the independent review process that each Senator  undertakes to determine whether the nominee should get our support.   So what I look at is someone who would be a mainstream jurist, who is  sensitive to the civil rights of all Americans, who would understand  the importance of our Constitution, which has been a Constitution that  has expanded rights and not one that we would look at ways to move in  the wrong direction on extending constitutional protections--that is,  move backward rather than forward.   First, let me start by stating that I am troubled by the process  President Trump followed in nominating Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme  Court. During his campaign, he talked about a litmus test for Supreme  Court Justices, that they must be pro-life in the mold of Justice  Scalia. The list that was submitted to him in which Judge Gorsuch was a  part was proposed by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist  Society. That is not a good way to start a process of bringing in a  consensus nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States.   To my knowledge, there was no consultation with any Democrats prior  to the nomination being made. The reason why consultation with all  Members of the Senate is important is that if you engage in real  understanding as to what the Senate--and we represent the entire  country--is looking for in a Supreme Court Justice, you have a much  better chance of ending up with a nominee who is going to enjoy broader  support, bipartisan support, real bipartisan support in the U.S.  Senate, and then the 60-vote threshold does not become a hurdle.   There is a reason we have the rules we do in the Senate, and the 60- vote concept on a controversial nominee is so that we don't end up with  an extreme candidate who would end up being on the Supreme Court of the  United States, that there must be that process that would generate 60  votes.   So despite my concern about the process that was initiated by  President Trump in the nomination, I have tried to look at all of the  opportunities to understand Judge Gorsuch's record and his likely  actions as a member of the Supreme Court. I took the time to meet with  Judge Gorsuch, and I found that interview, that process, to be  extremely helpful in understanding his judicial philosophy. I monitored  the hearings that took place in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I  found that testimony to be helpful. I reviewed the testimony of experts  who had submitted both verbal and written comments in regard to Judge  Gorsuch. I have reviewed his extensive legal record. We do have an  extensive legal record that I am going to comment about that went into  my own process in determining whether I can support him.   I came to the conclusion that I could not support Judge Gorsuch to be  an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States because  he is not a mainstream candidate. I am concerned that he would put  corporate interests before individual rights. The strength of our  Constitution is in the individual. Individual rights should be  paramount to special interests or corporate interests.   I saw in his legal opinions a hostility toward environmental  interests, women's health, marginalized students with disabilities, and  other vulnerable types of individuals, that had me greatly concerned.   I was particularly concerned about whether he could separate his  political views from his legal views. This is an extremely important  point. We want our Justices on the Supreme Court not to be influenced  by the politics around us.  [[Page S2310]]    In the legislative branch, it is perfectly legitimate to take into  consideration political views. The President of the United States is  nominated by a political party; that is understood. But the Supreme  Court--the Justices on the Supreme Court need to leave their political  views outside of their responsibilities. I was deeply troubled, after  reading the opinions of Judge Gorsuch and his writings, that he would  not be able to separate his political views from his legal views.   I was concerned about whether he would truly be an independent check  on the Presidency. We know that President Trump is testing the  constitutional reach of his office. We have seen that in some of the  Executive orders he has issued. And I have little confidence by his  responses at the hearings that Judge Gorsuch would be an independent  voice toward the President of the United States.   Let me cite some examples to fill in the blanks on what I am saying.  Judge Gorsuch challenges the Chevron deference doctrine. In the  Gutierrez case, he indicates that judges rather than agencies should be  basically administering our laws. The longstanding deference to  agencies to interpret our law has allowed agencies to carry out their  mission. Without that authority, it is extremely challenging to see how  an agency can carry out the missions of laws we have passed. Judge  Gorsuch raises questions as to whether that document is still relevant.   Let me make it clear. Who benefits from the Chevron doctrine? The  Chevron doctrine has allowed agencies to protect workers' rights,  protect our environment, protect consumers, food safety, and the list  goes on and on. Each of our States has examples to show how important  the Chevron doctrine has been. In my State of Maryland, the Chesapeake  Bay is critically important to Maryland's economy, critically important  to the character of our State we have in Maryland and our future. The  protection of the public health of the Chesapeake Bay has very much  been advanced by the Chevron deference doctrine.   Judge Gorsuch wrote: ``Chevron appears to qualify as a violation of  the separation of powers.'' Then he argued that its ``primary rationale  is no more than a fiction.'' Looking at what he has said about a  fundamental document that is there to protect our environment, protect  workers, protect public health, versus what Justice Scalia once  explained--and I quote from Justice Scalia: ``In the long run, Chevron  will endure and be given its full scope, because it more accurately  reflects the reality of government and thus more adequately serves its  needs.'' In the Gutierrez case, Judge Gorsuch was showing a more  activist conservative agenda than Justice Scalia.   Let me move on to Citizens United. We have talked about Citizens  United probably more than any Supreme Court case on the Senate floor.  We know it is a 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision. We know it opened up the  floodgates for dark money, allowing corporations to have constitutional  rights which we thought were only for individuals.   In the Riddle case, Judge Gorsuch announced a strict scrutiny  standard to political contribution limits that quite frankly would make  the Citizens United case even worse and would gut campaign finance law  limits. I think each of us should be concerned about that decision.   Let me move on to the TransAmerican Trucking case. Here, Judge  Gorsuch was in dissent. He was in the minority. What he basically said  was that a truckdriver had to sacrifice his life in order to protect  his job; otherwise, he could be fired. What I mean by that, as I think  many of our colleagues know, but let me say to those who might not be  totally familiar, the truckdriver found himself abandoned because the  brakes of his trailer were frozen in subzero temperatures. He contacted  his dispatcher for help and after several hours recognized that his  life was in danger because of hypothermia. He did not have adequate  heat in his cab.   He had one of three choices. He could try to maneuver the cab and the  trailer with frozen brakes, maybe costing himself his life or the lives  of other people on the road; he could remain as he was instructed by  the dispatcher and perhaps freeze to death; or he could do what I think  any reasonable person would do: He disconnected the cab, took care of  making sure he was safe, warmed himself up, and returned to the trailer  in order to complete the mission. For that, he was fired, and Judge  Gorsuch said that was acceptable. That is an extreme opinion and one  that gives us great pause as to how Judge Gorsuch will act on the  Supreme Court of the United States.   Let me talk about NLRB v. Community Health Services, wherein Judge  Gorsuch was again in the dissent. It had to do with backpay for  workers. In this opinion, he showed real hostility to workers and  unions--something that had me greatly concerned.   Another case that received a great deal of publicity in this body was  Hobby Lobby. I raise it here for one principal reason. What the Court  was saying and Judge Gorsuch was agreeing with was that the religious  protection that is provided under the Constitution--that it is more  important for a company to be able to exercise that religious freedom  than the employees. Once again, one of my principal concerns is whether  Judge Gorsuch will protect the rights of individuals or whether he will  side on behalf of business. Clearly, in the Hobby Lobby case, he  decided on business, to the detriment of women's rights, the LGBT  community, and others.   In the Planned Parenthood Association of Utah case, he showed a  direct hostility to Planned Parenthood. Quite frankly, this case is  very difficult to understand because Judge Gorsuch would have allowed  the Governor to cut off funds even though the case had been settled and  the parties had not asked to have the case retried.   We talk about activism and that we do not want to see activist  judges. To me, that demonstrates that Judge Gorsuch, indeed, will be an  activist judge in his trying to move a particular political agenda.   In Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District, which is a case that  came in during the confirmation hearing process, we had a severely  autistic child, and Judge Gorsuch was responsible for the absurd  reading of the de minimis benefit of defending against private  placement. The Supreme Court rightly rejected that logic on an 8-to-0  decision.   Justice Roberts wrote the opinion about the IDEA law in that there  are protections for disabled students in our school system. Judge  Gorsuch would turn back the progress that we have made on civil rights  and on constitutional protection.   As I mentioned earlier, I am very concerned about whether Judge  Gorsuch can keep his political views separate from what he says--how he  acts as a potential Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States.  I go to a 2005 National Review article in which he wrote:         American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom,       relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and       the ballot box as the primary means of effecting their social       agenda. . . . This overweening addiction to the courtroom as       the place to debate social policy is bad for the country and       bad for the judiciary.    I mention that particular case and quote Judge Gorsuch because we do  not want a judge to side with either being a liberal or a conservative.  We do not want a judge to say: I have a responsibility to promote an  agenda as a judge. We do not want a judge to be able to take a  political view and take that onto the bench. Whether it is a person  whom we agree with politically or disagree with politically, we want to  have an independent judiciary. This National Review article causes me  grave concern as to whether Judge Gorsuch can, in fact, be that neutral  person on the Court.   Judge Gorsuch appears to be an activist judge and will become an  activist judge and will turn back progress to protect individual  constitutional rights. That is something that gives me grave concern.  It is the reason I cannot support this nominee to be an Associate  Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.   Let me turn to process for one moment, because it looks as though,  sometime tomorrow, we are going to be called upon to vote on a cloture  motion. I want to comment on that if I might.   As I said earlier, to me, Judge Gorsuch is not mainstream. He will  put  [[Page S2311]]  corporate interests above individual interests. He shows a hostility  toward the environment and women, health, women's health, et cetera. He  has political views that, I think, he would not be able to  differentiate, and he would not be an independent check and balance in  our political system.   For all of those reasons, it seems appropriate to me that this is why  we have a 60-vote threshold--to make sure that we do not take extreme  nominees and allow them to be confirmed by a partisan vote. We want to  have a broader consensus, and Judge Gorsuch did not earn that broader  consensus.   There are additional considerations here, and this goes back a few  years with the Republican leadership. What they did to President  Obama's judicial nominations must be underscored because this is not in  a vacuum. We did not get to this place in a vacuum from what has  happened already but in our going back to President Obama when his  district court nominees were delayed--in some cases, totally blocked-- and required a record number of cloture motions to have been filed and  acted upon--a record number. We had, as I understand, more clotures and  more filibusters of President Obama's nominees by Republicans than we  did in the entire history of the U.S. Senate.   There has been a direct effort by the Republican leadership to  filibuster judicial nominees. That is wrong. It should not have been  done. Yes, there are reasons for some but not for the record numbers  that were done. You should be able to allow for the comity.   Quite frankly, in 2013, the Republican leader told President Obama:  No more DC Circuit Court judges. Let me repeat that. In 2013--this was  the first year of the President's term--the Republican leader said: No  more DC Circuit Court judges. We had 3 vacancies in the DC Circuit  Court; 8 of the 11 had been filled, and 3 were vacant, and it had  nothing to do with the nominees. They just said that they were not  going to consider any of them, and they used a filibuster to block any  filling of these positions.   First, I quote from Chief Judge Henry Edwards when he talked about  the DC Circuit:         The review of a large, multi-party, difficult       administrative appeal is the stable judicial work of the DC       Circuit. This long distinguishes the work of the DC Circuit       from the work of other circuits. It also explains why it is       impossible to compare the work of the DC Circuit with other       circuits by simply referring to the raw data of case filings.    Chief Justice Roberts noted that about two-thirds of the cases before  the DC Circuit involve the Federal Government in some civil capacity.  That figure is less than 25 percent nationwide. He also described the  DC Circuit's unique character as a court with the special  responsibility to review legal challenges of the conduct of the  national government.   My point is clear. This is the second most important court in our  land, and in the first year of President Obama's term, the Republicans  announced that they would filibuster any attempt to put any judge on  this circuit. Then we had the ultimate filibuster by the Republicans,  and that was Merrick Garland.   In February 2016, after Justice Scalia's death, a nominee was  submitted to us by President Obama who was acknowledged to be  mainstream, acknowledged to be well qualified, acknowledged to be a  consensus nominee, and he got the ultimate filibuster. Most of the  Republicans in the Senate would not meet with him. He did not have a  committee hearing or a committee vote, and he did not have a floor  vote. That was the ultimate filibuster. It was wrong, particularly when  we know that he would have received 60 votes.   So you cannot compare Judge Gorsuch with Judge Garland because,  unlike Judge Garland, Judge Gorsuch does not share the same evaluation  of being able to be a consensus, mainstream candidate who would receive  a 60-vote threshold.   For all of these reasons, if the majority leader is going to pursue  the cloture vote on the Gorsuch nomination, I will not vote in favor of  cloture. I would hope that we would be able to return to the comity  that is important in the U.S. Senate, but we recognize there are times  in which you should have a 60-vote threshold. When the President of the  United States goes outside of the norms and the process has already  been employed by the Republicans, I urge my colleagues to rethink the  course that we are on.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.    Mr. President, this week, I introduced, along with  Senators Perdue, Feinstein, Rubio, Blumenthal, Collins, Merkley,  Booker, and Leahy, the Combating Global Corruption Act of 2017.   Global corruption is a fundamental obstacle to peace, prosperity, and  human rights. It is fueling transnational criminal networks and violent  extremism, and combatting it should be elevated and prioritized across  our foreign policy efforts.   I know my colleagues understand the crucial importance of addressing  corruption because it undermines public confidence in government  institutions and fosters resentment and instability. There is growing  recognition across the United States and around the world that  corruption is a serious threat to international security and stability.  The countries and names might be different, but the characteristics and  the impact on innocent people are the same.   The bribery scandal surrounding the huge Brazilian construction firm  Odebrecht has tarnished politicians and governments from Peru to  Columbia to Mexico. Rampant corruption in oil-rich Angola is depriving  children of a quality education and contributing to the highest child  mortality rate in the world. While progress is now being made,  extensive corruption in Afghanistan resulted in billions of dollars of  assistance winding up in the pockets of crooked elites.   The connections are clear: Where there are high levels of corruption,  we find fragile states, political instability, and people suffering  from hunger and violence.   Corruption is a global problem, but its consequences take the  harshest toll at the local level, and it is very tough to fight. The  problem of corruption, and the disruption and suffering it causes,  involves many corrupt actors, from government officials to businessmen,  from law enforcement and military personnel to street gangs. Corruption  is a system that operates via extensive, entrenched networks in both  the public and private sectors.   We know that corruption is the lifeblood of Vladimir Putin's Russia,  and it is the glue for his regime's survival. Parasitic at home, deeply  corrupt regimes like Putin's seek to enrich themselves, hollow out  their own countries' institutions, and subvert rules-based democratic  states abroad. An anticorruption platform run by opposition activist  and aspiring, Presidential candidate Alexei Navalny recently released  information uncovering four mansions, an Italian vineyard, yachts, and  other high-value assets reportedly held by Prime Minister Dmitry  Medvedev. Anticorruption demonstrations, in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and  across the country in recent weeks reflect the ongoing resistance of  the Russian people to government corruption. Hundreds were arrested.  Prominent anticorruption activist Ildar Dadin, who has already spent  over a year in prison for earlier protests, was among those arrested.   Corruption feeds the destructive fire of criminal networks and  transnational crime. Citizens lose faith in the social compact between  governments and the people. In Venezuela, we have seen how rampant  corruption has collapsed the country's economy, sparked a humanitarian  crisis, and produced chains of money laundering that span several  continents. The ongoing crisis there now threatens to collapse the last  few remnants of the rule of law.   Corruption also fuels violence by security forces. South Sudan's  kleptocrats have either failed to pay or delayed salary payments to  their soldiers who have in turn taken out their rage on innocent  civilians, attacking them, looting and burning their homes, and  engaging in other violent criminality.   We should take heart that in just the past 2 years, popular protests  against corruption have broken out in Iraq, Azerbaijan, Brazil,  Guatemala, Honduras, Lebanon, Malaysia, Moldova, and Venezuela. In  Romania, efforts to weaken anticorruption laws there prompted an  estimated 500,000 protesters to take to the streets last month, even  after the government repealed its decree, showing the degree to which  citizens are fed up with graft and determined to push back. These were  the largest demonstrations since the fall of communism.   Some victims express their frustration through peaceful protest, but  not all. The revolutions of the Arab Spring and Ukraine began, in part,  as determined anticorruption protests.   In every country where protests erupted in 2011, demonstrators  condemned the corruption of detested ruling elites and demanded  accountability and the return of looted assets. These  [[Page S2419]]  revolutions have degenerated into some of the chief security challenges  we confront now--Russian aggression in Ukraine, 6 years of slaughter in  Syria, the implosion of Libya, a brutal war in Yemen, the fraying of  Iraq, and an expanding insurgency in Egypt.   Official corruption fuels radical extremism and terrorism, too; it  gives credibility to militant religious extremists and helps them gain  recruits and increasing footholds in Afghanistan and Iraq to Pakistan,  Central Asia, the Sahel, and West Africa. It may seem like a spurious  example, but it can be persuasive to a young Nigerian man whose sister  was molested by a teacher as the cost for attending school.   Let's be clear-eye. Any fight against corruption will be long-term  and difficult. It is a fight against powerful people, powerful  companies, and powerful interests. It is about changing a mindset and a  culture as much as it is about establishing and enforcing laws.   As my colleagues and constituents know, my attention has long been  focused on fighting corruption. I introduced the Global Magnitsky Human  Rights Accountability Act to target human rights abusers and corrupt  individuals around the globe who threaten the rule of law and deny  fundamental freedoms, but the problem is so big--we simply have to do  more.   This is why this week I introduced with bipartisan support the  Combating Global Corruption Act of 2017 in the U.S. Senate.   We must meet the scale of entrenched corruption with greater resolve  and commitment. To do that, I believe we must focus on three things  which I will lay out in my legislation.   First, we must institutionalize the fight against corruption as a  national security priority. In my bill, the State Department will  produce an annual report, similar to the Trafficking in Persons Report,  which takes a close look at each country's efforts to combat  corruption. That model, which has effectively advanced the effort to  combat modern day slavery, will similarly embed the issue of corruption  in our collective work, so that we hold governments to account.   The bill establishes minimum standards for combating corruption-- standards that should be every government's duty to its citizens. These  include whether a country has laws that recognize corrupt acts for the  crimes they are--violations of the people's trust--and that come with  serious penalties for breaking that trust; whether an independent  judiciary decides corruption cases, free from influence and abuse;  whether there is support for civil society organizations that are the  watchdogs of integrity against would-be thieves of the state. This bill  aims to build anticorruption DNA into the basic functions of  government.   Second, the bill would improve the way we look at our own foreign and  security assistance, and promote more transparency--let in some  daylight. For countries that fall short on their corruption efforts,  the bill calls for an assessment of the risk of corruption for our  foreign assistance and steps to combat corruption, including the  ability to claw back any funds diverted from their intended purpose and  terminate compromised programs. American taxpayers should know how our  foreign assistance is spent, and they should feel confident that we are  doing the kind of risk assessments, analysis, and oversight that ensure  our assistance to other countries is having the effect we want it to  have.   Third, the bill consolidates information about anticorruption efforts  abroad and puts it online, where citizens can see the numbers and the  programs. That kind of transparency is essential to open government,  but in my experience, it also has the effect of making us better at  self-policing our work. We can use the data to capture redundancies and  analyze trends, improving our decisionmaking.   I urge my colleagues to join me and the bipartisan cosponsors of this  legislation in this effort. The success of our diplomacy, and the  ultimate impact of our international security efforts depend on it.   Thank you.                            ____________________
