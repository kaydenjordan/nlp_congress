 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize West Seattle High  School students Will Rasmussen and Aidan Day as the winners of  Washington's Seventh District Congressional App Challenge.   Will and Aidan developed an app that helps students and teachers  maximize learning time in the classroom by automating the checking of  attendance, which often takes several minutes of class. Will's and  Aidan's design uses RFID technology to let students quickly tag into  class using a keycard similar to ORCA cards, our region's transit  access cards which allow passengers to pay their bus and train fare by  swiping their cards.   Our diverse group of App Challenge judges praised Will's and Aidan's  ingenuity. Microsoft enterprise specialist Hammad Rajjoub called it ``a  great idea to bring to life,'' because ``time is the most important  asset we all have.'' Other judges suggested scaling it up for use in  other school districts.   Will's and Aidan's winning project is a model for all of us to use  our creativity, knowledge, and ultimately the technology we create to  benefit the greater good and improve our communities.   Congratulations, Will and Aidan.                            ____________________
