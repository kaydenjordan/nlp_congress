 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and  that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I take no pleasure in coming to the  floor today. We in the Senate take pride in our decorum and our sense  of comity with each other, so much so that we often twist ourselves  into pretzels to avoid saying anything that might be interpreted as a  criticism of another Senator. Yet there comes a time when these verbal  gymnastics simply won't do. You are either going to speak the truth or  fail to do justice to the values you hold dear.   What one of our colleagues said last week about the events of January  6 was felt by many to be racist and hurtful--a stain on the office he  is so fortunate to hold.   Look, I get that no one likes to be called racist, but sometimes  there is just no other way to describe the use of bigoted tropes that  for generations have threatened Black lives by stoking White fear of  African Americans and Black men in particular.   On a radio show, our colleague explained that he never feared for his  safety during the January 6 insurrection of the U.S. Capitol. But make  no mistake, under different circumstances, he would have been afraid.  He said:         Now, had the tables been turned--now, Joe, this will get me       in trouble--had the tables been turned and President Trump       won the election and those were tens of thousands of Black       Lives Matter and antifa protesters, I might have been a       little concerned.    Is that not racism?   I don't think the Senator is ignorant of the fact that for centuries  in this country, White supremacy has thrived on using fear to justify  oppression, discrimination, and violence against people of color. I do,  however, think my colleague may be ignorant of the pain caused by his  comments and unaware of how they compound the trauma that so many still  feel in the wake of the events of January 6.   Because I do not think I can do justice to that pain, I want to share  with you an email I received this weekend. It is from one of the most  devoted public servants I have ever had the pleasure of working with,  an African-American member of my staff. His name is Keith Roachford. He  has devoted nearly three and one-half decades to serving the people of  New Jersey in Congress and his community as a faithful churchgoer and  Boy Scout leader. It reads:         Senator,        I would not normally send you an email like this but I am       at a loss of how to express  [[Page S1545]]       the outrage and hurt I am feeling from the comments made by       Senator Johnson that he would have been more afraid on       January 6th if the insurrectionists would have been from       Black Lives Matter.        I am blessed to be on your staff and have had the       opportunity to serve as a staff member in the NJ delegation       for 34 years, but this is the most painful thing I have ever       heard being said by a US Senator.        I could not imagine that the horrible and painful events       from [January] 6th could be replicated in a statement from a       sitting member of the Senate.        However, Johnson's comment is worse than the image of the       insurrectionists walking through the Capitol building with       the confederate flag.        He is perpetrating the racist trope that the country should       fear black people.        I have experienced what it is like to have a taxi cab pass       you by in order to pick up white passengers who are further       down the block of where you are standing.        Nothing can describe the feeling when you have entered a       store and having store clerks watch your every step while       shopping.        Sandy--    That is his wife--       and I have had the conversations with our sons when they were       young about how to enter a store; not look suspicious; keep       your hands out of your pockets until you make your purchase;       or how to respond and talk to police officers in any       interaction.        I have had the difficult conversation of explaining to a       young black scouter in our scout troop why a white campground       store clerk accused him of not paying for an item because he       was black.        [This] type of hate speech is [not] new. The hardest part       of what he said is that in 2021, a United States Senator       would so freely express this type of hate out loud.        I am so grateful for our officers who endured so many       injuries on [January] 6th, and I pray that they will recover       physically and mentally.        They are going through so much right now, I feel guilty       that my email to you might sound shallow because of the pain       they are trying to overcome.        I understand that the Senate works best when both sides can       find common ground, but how do [you] really reach common       ground when [such views can be held]?        Again, I am sorry for reaching out late on Saturday       evening, but I needed to share this with you.        Keith.    To read these pained words both broke my heart and boiled my blood.  Thousands of people of color serve in the U.S. Capitol workforce. They  are legislative staffers like Keith and Capitol Police officers and  maintenance workers, cafeteria staff, and so much more. I should not  have to stand here and remind anyone that many of them feared for their  lives on January 6. But not Senator Johnson. He felt no fear. He wasn't  afraid because, and I quote:         I knew those are people that love this country, that truly       respect law enforcement, would never do anything to break the       law, so I wasn't concerned.    People who love this country do not desecrate our most sacred  democratic institutions and display symbols of racial hatred like the  Confederate flag in the halls of Congress. People who respect law  enforcement do not assault Capitol Police officers, beat them within  inches of death, and hurl ugly epithets at officers of color. And  people who would never do anything to break the law would not try to  overturn the rule of law, plot to kill elected officials, and stop the  peaceful transfer of power as instructed by the Constitution of the  United States.   Now, I know what some rightwing media pundits and some of my  Republican colleagues will say. They say it every time they are asked  to accept some responsibility for perpetuating the lies told by  President Trump that inspired the violent events of January 6.   They say: What about Black Lives Matter?   They say: Well, what about it?   Well, I say: Well, what about it?   The violent picture they paint of this movement could not be more  divorced from reality. At this point, several reputable studies have  confirmed that the protests launched in the wake of George Floyd's  chilling murder were overwhelmingly peaceful. I repeat: The Black Lives  Matter movement is overwhelmingly peaceful. I know many people don't  care about facts these days, but it is the truth.   One study out of Harvard University analyzed 7,305 Black Lives Matter  protests. The conclusion? Allow me to quote Professor Erica Chenoweth.  She said:         Only 3.7 percent of the protests involved property damage       or [some form of] vandalism. Some portion of these involved       neither police nor protesters, but people engaging in       vandalism or looting alongside the protests. In short, our       data suggest that 96.3 percent of events involved no property       damage or police injuries, and in 97.7 percent of events, no       injuries were reported among participants, bystanders or       police.    Likewise, the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project--an  organization I might add is partially funded by the U.S. Department of  State's Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations--examined 7,750  different Black Lives Matter demonstrations across the Nation last  summer. They found just 3 percent of those protests associated with any  violence or property destruction whatsoever. They also concluded that  police departments ``disproportionately used force while intervening in  demonstrations associated with the [Black Lives Matter] movement  relative to other types of demonstrations.''   Indeed, on January 6, as we waited for hours for backup from the  National Guard and other law enforcement agencies to come to the aid of  Congress, I know that I am not the only one who could not help but  think of the violent, government-sanctioned crackdowns that met Black  Lives Matter protesters last summer.   The bottom line is that these lies casting Black Lives Matter as  violent have already done real damage. They have convinced millions of  Americans that they should fear those who march under the banner of  this movement for justice, when really it is the resurgence of violent  White supremacy that should be Americans' real cause for alarm.   Indeed, last October, the Department of Homeland Security issued a  report confirming that White supremacists pose the most lethal domestic  terror threat to the American people. Research from the Center for  Strategic and International Studies finds that White supremacists and  their sympathizers carried out two-thirds of terrorist plots and  attacks in 2020.   In the weeks since January 6, we have learned that far-right  extremist groups that regularly preach White supremacy, such as the  Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys, played a major role in plotting and  executing the attack on the U.S. Capitol.   Every Member of this body owes their life to the sacrifices made that  afternoon by Capitol Police officers, including officers of color. At  least 100 officers were physically injured in the January 6 attack. One  officer, a veteran and fellow New Jerseyan named Brian Sicknick, later  succumbed to the injuries he sustained. Two others subsequently  committed suicide. Hundreds of officers now carry with them invisible  scars from the trauma they endured that day--scars that may not fade  for years or even decades.   For one of our colleagues to cast those who attacked the Capitol as  harmless patriots while stroking fear of Black Americans is like  rubbing salt in an open wound.   Everybody in this body should know that when you perpetuate such  racist tropes, you contribute to a culture that gives people permission  to treat Black Americans as suspicious and their lives as expendable.  We in the Senate are supposed to hold ourselves to a higher standard.  We are supposed to advance America's long march toward a more perfect  Union, not coddle and cater to those who would take us backwards, and  we are supposed to stand up for the truth. That is what brought me to  the floor today.   I hope Members of this body on both sides of the aisle will join me  in making sure that we do not debase the institution and the people we  are called to serve--all the people--for whom so much pain has existed  for years and exists still today.   With that, I yield the floor.
