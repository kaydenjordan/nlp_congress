 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                          Hurricane Harvey Recovery     Mr. President, I am particularly glad to see you  presiding today because I came here to report on what you and I saw  together in Texas during this last long weekend. Unfortunately, it  didn't feel quite like home--not when parts of Texas battered by  Hurricane Harvey aren't what they used to be and not when so many  cities, towns, and wornout faces don't look like they otherwise would.   As of this weekend, more than 8 million cubic yards of debris still  needed to be cleared in Houston alone--the Presiding Officer's hometown  and the city of my birth. More than 800,000 people have registered with  FEMA for individual assistance. More than 24,000 hotel rooms are still  occupied by victims of the flood. Fifty-two public and charter schools  sustained ``catastrophic damage'' and are awaiting funding for repairs.  Worst of all, 82 lives were lost as a result of this terrible storm.   One news story that stuck with me came from Port Arthur, where the  mayor, Mr. Derrick Ford Freeman, a man of truly steel resolve, can't  stop yawning. Well, he is exhausted. He has a good reason. He has been  sleeping upstairs in his child's second floor bunkbed because, unlike  some other residents, he hasn't had time to strip the first floors of  his house that flooded to remove the Sheetrock, destroyed furniture,  and all of his personal effects. He has been too busy worrying about  others and trying to help pull the pieces back together.   Mayor Freeman spoke of the smell in his house at night. First, it is  the flood. Then, it is the mold. Then, it is the mosquitoes. He spoke  about the challenges his community faces, and he spoke about the more  than 100 schoolteachers and 100 city employees in Port Arthur who still  did not have homes ready to return to.   What Mayor Freeman was most worried about, though, is that people  will forget. Now, as other natural disasters and news stories begin to  occupy the  [[Page S6108]]  coverage on television and turn people's gaze away from Texas, to  Florida and now to the devastation in Puerto Rico, the mayor's concern  makes some sense.   But I want to assure Mayor Freeman--as I know the Presiding Officer  would, and as we would to our friends in Florida and the east coast,  who were hit by Hurricane Irma, or our friends in Puerto Rico, who were  devastated by Hurricane Maria--that we will not forget and that we will  stand together to make sure that the Federal Government plays its  essential role in helping them recover and in helping them restore  their lives.   But I also remember another civic leader, Mayor Becky Ames of  Beaumont, and what she said to me right after the storm. Smiling, she  declared:         We had a downpour; now we have an outpour. The outpour is       coming right into our city.    That is what we saw time and again. Yes, the Federal Government  responded. Yes, the State responded, led by Governor Abbott and  emergency operations. Yes, the mayors and the county judges responded.  But the truth is neighbors helped neighbors. We talked again. I sort of  chuckle when I think about the Cajun Navy, but our friends from around  the country, including next door in Louisiana, came to help pluck  people off the tops of their flooded houses and places of business, and  of course many people have lent a helping hand.    I think it is best to combine Mayor Freeman's concerns with Mayor  Ames's optimism. In other words, we need to make sure that outpour she  was speaking about continues. I know the outpour hasn't dried up places  like Friendswood, TX, where the Presiding Officer and I helped Team  Rubicon clean up some of the houses that were trashed by Hurricane  Harvey. We joined the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan--and we are  delighted he saw fit to come join us in this effort--as well as the  chairman of the House Appropriations Committee and virtually the entire  Houston congressional delegation.   We also know the outpour has not stopped in places like Aloe  Elementary in Victoria, a school that was severely damaged by the  storm. There I saw second graders get packages from their counterparts  in West Lafayette, LA. The school may have temporary walls. Certain  classrooms and hallways had to be cordoned off as the building  continues, but these ``Aloe-gators''--the school mascot--are  permanently grateful for the help they are getting from children from  Lafayette, LA, and Cumberland Elementary in Indiana.   I think we owe it to these youngsters--and the many other Texans we  met with in Victoria, Friendswood, and Houston--to explain what we here  in Washington are doing to address the storm, which, let's not forget,  rained down more water--34 trillion gallons--than any storm in U.S.  history. I think they are wondering if we remember the sheer scale of  the disaster zone--an area larger than West Virginia, Delaware, and  Rhode Island combined. We want to assure them that the answer is yes.   We have been working hard trying to match the scale of the storm with  an appropriate congressional response. Here are just a few of the ways  in which the Federal Government has responded:   First, the President--and we thank him for his leadership and  initiative--issued a major disaster declaration under the Stafford Act,  which is the trigger for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's, or  FEMA's, public assistance grants to be provided. This is, to be clear,  not a handout. Each State is responsible for part of the cost.  Secondly, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducted infrastructure  assessments and assisted with State debris management. Third, FEMA has  coordinated with the American Red Cross and other local governments to  find and provide temporary housing for the displaced.   As I said, these are just a few of the ways the administration has  been responding. I realize they are just on the first step. That is why  last week I led a bipartisan letter, along with my colleague in the  Chair, calling upon the Department of Housing and Urban Development to  speed up allocation of relief funds. We were able to appropriate, and  the President signed into law, a $7.4 billion allocation for community  development block grants, or CDBG funds, that Congress has decided are  appropriate as a downpayment on the recovery from Hurricane Harvey.  These CDBG funds, community development block grant funds, will help  Texas communities repair their infrastructure, rebuild schools, and  reopen the businesses that are integral to recovery. I might add, given  Texas's contribution to the national economy, it is really important  not just to folks in Texas, this is important to the country that we  get our businesses back on their own two feet, opening doors, and  helping contribute to the economy while they continue to create jobs.   I am grateful to my colleagues for moving with such dispatch in  appropriating the funds. I know Congress's quick action can quickly be  undone by delays at the bureaucracy level. We need to make sure that  doesn't happen. On the State level, Governor Abbott has announced the  Commission to Rebuild Texas, which will be led ably by Texas A&M System  Chancellor John Sharp. I met with Chancellor Sharp last week in Texas,  and he assured me the commission will be traveling around the State and  working to prioritize projects to help restore roads, bridges, schools,  government buildings, and impacted communities. The Texas delegation  will be working with him as we focus on our response. I know we all  look forward to working with the commission and Governor Abbott in the  months to come. It will be months, if not years, before the recovery  will be complete.   One additional way we can help victims is through targeted tax  relief. I want to highlight in this regard a noncontroversial section  of the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill that House  Democrats blocked yesterday. It contained a number of disaster tax  provisions, like those that were passed after Hurricane Katrina, that  will help hurricane victims get back on their feet. It is  unconscionable that the House minority leader held that relief hostage  to cater to the most extreme elements of her own political party. If we  were talking about earthquake victims in San Francisco instead of  hurricane relief in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico, surely she  wouldn't be playing politics like she is now with this important  hurricane relief package.   Spearheaded by Chairman Kevin Brady, the legislation would have  helped victims keep more of their paycheck, deduct more of the cost of  their property damage, and have more immediate access to their  retirement savings without penalty. It would also have encouraged even  more Americans to generously donate to hurricane relief.   It is imperative the House act a second time later this week to  overcome the objection of Ms. Pelosi, to make sure hurricane tax relief  is delivered to those in need on a timely basis and without further  delay. Shame on those who would play politics with the sort of relief  the President and we have all committed would be forthcoming in  response to these terrible hurricanes, whether it is Harvey, Irma, or  Maria. The fact remains that Federal, State, and local actors will have  to continue to work side by side to make sure Texas is made whole  again.   Colleagues, let's keep Mayor Ames and Mayor Freeman in mind. Let's  remember that those still recovering in their communities and elsewhere  need and deserve our support. Let's make sure Texas resembles the home  we all have come to know and love following this terribly devastating  hurricane.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate be  in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to address a bill that was  actually recommended to me by the chairman of the Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions Committee, Senator Alexander. I appreciate his  bringing this matter to my attention. I will explain what it does in a  moment.   Basically, it deals with the educational impact of hurricanes on our  population, whether they be in Texas, whether they be in Florida, or  whether they be in Puerto Rico. I think it is important, as the  Presiding Officer knows in his having been to Puerto Rico recently,  that we deal with all of these hurricanes and their aftermaths in a  similar and combined and joint fashion.   This legislation is called the Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria  Education Relief Act of 2017, and it has three vital hurricane relief- related purposes.   First, it provides the Secretary of Education with the authority to  waive Federal matching requirements for two campus-based aid programs  under the Higher Education Act. First is the Federal Supplemental  Educational Opportunity Grant Program. Second is the Federal Work-Study  Program. Notably, in my State, 18 campuses of higher education will be  eligible for the waiver of Federal matching requirements. If not passed  before September 30, which is on Saturday, if I am not mistaken, these  matching funds will no longer be available. So this is a rare window of  opportunity for us. As I said, this waiver of authority and relief was  also done following Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Sandy, I believe.    No. 2, the bill requires the Secretary to reallocate any remaining  supplemental educational opportunity grant or Federal work study funds  from the 2016 and 2017 award years to colleges and universities located  in hurricane-impacted areas. Currently, this second amount totals $17.5  million, and if it is not used by the end of September, like these  matching funds, it will no longer be available. These funds provide  financial aid to students who have been harmed by the hurricanes at  those schools.   Finally, the third thing this bill will do is restore the equitable  distribution to all schools in the Project School Emergency Response to  Violence Program.   These grants go to schools to assist recovery following a crisis.  They can be used for a wide variety of activities, including mental  health assessments, emergency transportation needs, and increased costs  for teacher overtime. My State alone can be expected to submit  applications for this funding next week, and over 14,000 campuses would  be eligible. Obviously, given the limited funds, not all of them will  receive the maximum they could, but the point is, this is a widely  needed and important source of funds for those 14,000 campuses in Texas  alone. Previously, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut all  received these funds after Katrina and Sandy.   Colleagues, Congress needs to act or we will forgo our opportunity to  use all three categories of these funds since, as I said, the time  expires next Saturday.   When so many people in my home State of Texas and States such as  Louisiana and Florida and places such as Puerto Rico are dealing with  the aftermath of devastating hurricanes, we cannot allow this  opportunity to go to waste.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of S. 1866, introduced earlier today.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         A bill (S. 1866) to provide the Secretary of Education with       waiver authority for the reallocation rules and authority to       extend the deadline by which funds have to be reallocated in       the campus-based aid programs under the Higher Education Act       of 1965 due to Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma, and       Hurricane Maria, to provide equitable services to children       and teachers in private schools, and for other purposes.    There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The bill (S. 1866) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading,  was read the third time, and passed, as follows:                                  S. 1866         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Res. 114) expressing the sense of the       Senate on humanitarian crises in Nigeria, Somalia, South       Sudan, and Yemen.    There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill,  which had been reported from the Committee on Foreign Relations, with  an amendment to strike all after the resolving clause and insert the  part printed in italic, and with an amendment to strike the preamble  and insert the part printed in italic, as follows:        Whereas Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, and Yemen are all in       famine, pre-famine, or at risk of famine in 2017;        Whereas, according to the United Nations Office for the       Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), 20,000,000       people are at risk of starvation this year in Nigeria,       Somalia, South Sudan, and Yemen;        Whereas, on March 22, 2017, Mr. Yves Daccord, the Director-      General of the International Committee of the Red Cross,       testified before Congress that the crisis represents ``one of       the most critical humanitarian issues to face mankind since       the end of the Second World War'' and warned that ``we are at       the brink of a humanitarian mega-crisis unprecedented in       recent history'';        Whereas, according to the United States Agency for       International Development (USAID), ``[m]ore than 5.1 million       people face severe food insecurity in northeastern Nigeria'';        Whereas, according to USAID, ``An estimated 6.2 million       people--more than half of Somalia's total population--      currently require urgent humanitarian assistance.'';        Whereas, according to USAID, ``An estimated 5.5 million       people--nearly half of South Sudan's population--will face       life threatening hunger by July.'';        Whereas, according to USAID, in Yemen, ``More than       seventeen million people--an astounding 60% of the country's       population--are food insecure, including seven million people       who are unable to survive without food assistance.'';        Whereas, according to the United Nations Children's Fund       (UNICEF), ``[s]ome 22 million children have been left hungry,       sick, displaced and out of school in the four countries'' and       ``Nearly 1.4 million are at imminent risk of death this year       from severe malnutrition.'';        Whereas the humanitarian crises in each of these regions       are, to varying degrees, man-made and preventable--      exacerbated by armed conflict and deliberate restrictions on       humanitarian access;        Whereas parties to the conflicts, including even some       government forces, have harassed, attacked, and killed       humanitarian workers, blocked and hindered humanitarian       access, and continue to deprive the world's most hungry       people of the food they need;        Whereas humanitarian actors, coordinated by OCHA, have       appealed for $5,600,000,000 in 2017 to address famines in       Yemen, South Sudan, Nigeria, and Somalia; and        Whereas Mr. Daccord testified before Congress on March 22,       2017, ``Our main message is clear: immediate, decisive action       is needed to prevent vast numbers of people starving to       death.'': Now, therefore, be it        Resolved,      That it is the sense of the Senate that--        (1) the United States should lead an urgent and       comprehensive international diplomatic effort to address       obstacles in Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, and Yemen that       are preventing humanitarian aid from being delivered to       millions of people who desperately need it;        (2) the United States should encourage other governments to       join the United States in providing the resources necessary       to address the humanitarian crises in Nigeria, Somalia, South       Sudan, and Yemen;        (3) parties to the conflicts in Nigeria, Somalia, South       Sudan, and Yemen should allow and facilitate rapid and       unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in       need and respect and protect humanitarian and medical relief       personnel and objects; and        (4) the United States, working with international partners,       should support efforts to hold accountable those responsible       for deliberate restrictions on humanitarian access in       Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, and Yemen.

(7) Stakeholder's views on how such quality metrics would       provide information on--        (A) the goals, values, and preferences of the beneficiary;        (B) the documentation of the care plan;        (C) services furnished to the beneficiary; and        (D) outcomes of treatment.
