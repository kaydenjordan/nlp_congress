 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Biddeford  Regional Center of Technology, which is celebrating its 50th  anniversary. BRCOT offers unique hands-on programs and follows rigid  national standards to help prepare its students for academic success  and future careers. BRCOT offers a variety of programs to local high  school students and integrates academic study with firsthand career and  technical education. Students work closely with instructors who stress  ``learning by doing.''   BRCOT began in 1967 when the Biddeford School Board and the Biddeford  City Council voted to build an addition on to the high school  specifically dedicated to technical training. This addition opened for  the 1968 school year, and though, over the past 50 years focus on  career and technical training ebbed and flowed, today there is a  resurgence of interest and support for students to develop the skills  and practical knowledge gained through career and technical education.  BRCOT is one of 27 career and technical schools in Maine and serves  students from Biddeford, Dayton, Saco, Old Orchard Beach, and  surrounding communities. Students can focus on 16 different career  pathways, including auto technology, legal studies, early childhood  education, machine tool technology, and welding and metal fabrication.   BRCOT ensures that students are fully prepared to work in their  chosen field by collaborating with the local business community to  develop updated and current programs based on industry standards. All  coursework is approved by the State of Maine and includes a heavy  emphasis on safety and ``habits of work,'' with BRCOT providing job  shadow and internship opportunities that give students real world  experience. BRCOT also boasts an active student leadership council,  representing students from each program. The leadership council is  involved in community projects, fundraising, advising fellow students  on BRCOT policies, and special events, such as the annual awards  banquet.   The 2018 school year has a full complement of 345 students in 16  programs. BRCOT boasts a 90 percent graduating rate, with 40 percents  of those students earning technical credentials, making them ready to  transition to full-time careers. Nearly two-thirds of graduates choose  to attend postsecondary schools, including Maine Maritime Academy,  Maine College of Art, the University of Maine, as well as choosing to  serve in the U.S. Army and the Marine Corps.   I am proud to recognize the work of the Biddeford Regional Center of  Technology. For 50 years, they have served thousands of students in the  Biddeford area, increasing their skills and preparing them to continue  their education or enter the workforce. I want to thank all of those  involved in the work of BRCOT, from the students to the teachers and  faculty, and I look forward to seeing their continued success for many  more years to come.                            ____________________
