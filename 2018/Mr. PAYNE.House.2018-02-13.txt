 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Kelechi Ibezim, a high  school senior from Glen Ridge, New Jersey, for becoming the first  African-American Eagle Scout in Troop 55 of the Northern New Jersey Boy  Scouts Council.   This young man is a resident of my district. Along with others in his  troop, Kelechi led the effort to build an outdoor classroom at the  Montclair Child Development Center. The center serves underprivileged  children and focuses on teaching them social skills.  [[Page H1107]]    Kelechi has spent time painting schools, volunteering for nonprofits,  and serving as treasurer of the youth branch of the Montclair NAACP. He  plans to pursue a career in business or law once he graduates from  college.   Mr. Speaker, Kelechi is just one of the many examples of young people  in my district making Black history every day. I ask my colleagues to  join me in congratulating Kelechi on receiving his Eagle Scout ranking.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it is a real honor and privilege to join both  of my colleagues here for what is a very important discussion to have.   I commend Congressman Garamendi for always being passionate,  considerate, and diligent on these efforts around the issues that are  germane and important to this country moving forward and being  successful. So I thank him for being a role model for me here in the  House of Representatives.   Also, I thank Mr. Price, who has been a leader. I worked with him on  several occasions in North Carolina on different issues. It is good to  be in both of their company on this important issue.   We are here tonight on this Special Order talking about the  President's infrastructure plan. It is not really much of a  transportation plan at all. What President Trump has proposed is  another massive giveaway to big corporations.   The Trump infrastructure plan would privatize much of the Nation's  infrastructure. It would replace interstate highways with tollways. It  would roll back environmental protection regulations and workers'  rights. It would award infrastructure grants based on how much revenue  is raised locally, instead of awarding Federal grants based on the  project's quality.   Mr. Speaker, President Trump promised America a trillion-dollar  investment in our Nation's crumbling infrastructure. But, like always,  the President has not delivered.   This is becoming a theme with him as we move through different issues  that this Nation faces. There is a pattern developing here. My father  always used to mention that type of thing. When he saw issues or  something that were going awry, he would notice the pattern in the way  these things are addressed. There is definitely a pattern in the way  the President has handled being Commander in Chief, and has not  necessarily been in the best interest of the entire country, but to a  select few.   The Trump infrastructure plan is cut from the same cloth as the tax  scam my Republican colleagues passed in December. It is cut from the  same cloth as the budget President Trump proposed this week.   The tax scam was a massive giveaway to the billionaires and big  corporations, to golf course owners and to owners of LLCs. Now, I don't  know much about big business and golf courses--I am a miniature golf  man myself--but, once again, there is that pattern.   What would be so important in the tax scam that you carve out  something for golf course owners?   Well, anyway. Can you say Mar-a-Lago?   Also, in that same vein, if I am not mistaken, all of the Trump  businesses that are still being enriched as he sits in the White House,  which is totally contrary to what this Nation was built on, are all  LLCs.                                time  2000    So in the tax scam, there was a carve-out for LLCs. Oh my goodness.  There seems to be a pattern here.   Trump proposed a budget that slashes more than $168 billion--$168  billion from Federal highway, transit, Amtrak, and water infrastructure  funding. He also proposed that we privatize the Nation's air traffic  control, which would add another $57 billion to the Federal deficit. So  much for deficit hawks.   So, before even proposing his infrastructure plan, the President  proposed a $225 billion cut to infrastructure spending, all so he can  pay for his tax giveaways to the rich.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats and Republicans want to work together to  rebuild America's crumbling infrastructure, but the President's plan  doesn't get us there at all. It is a partisan proposal that benefits  the President's corporate friends at the expense of the American  people.   This infrastructure plan is a major blow to my constituents and  everyone who travels along Amtrak's Northeast corridor. It proposes an  Infrastructure Incentives Program that would award grants based on how  much revenue is raised locally, instead of how badly needed the project  is.   Now, that seems not to make too much sense from where I am standing,  and my constituents understand, and Congressman Garamendi's  constituents, and the majority of people in this House, if you really  pulled them aside and asked them honestly. But that is for another day.   Take, for instance, the Gateway project. The Gateway project is a  multiyear, multibillion-dollar project that will repair, replace, and  expand the railroad infrastructure connecting New Jersey and New York,  but Boston to Washington, D.C., as well. It is the Nation's most  critical infrastructure project.   The Gateway project will make commutes safe and more reliable for  hundreds of thousands of people, and the economic activity it generates  could create upwards of 100,000 new jobs in the region.   This multiyear project, Mr. Speaker, is vital to this Nation's health  and infrastructure. The Northeast corridor is the only line that is  profitable for Amtrak in the entire Nation; and we want to cripple  that. We don't want to strengthen that. We would like to cripple that  more. It doesn't make sense.   The Gateway project is something that is needed. It will put  Americans to work. It will create a greater infrastructure and allow  the two tunnels going into New York City now to be repaired. They took  a terrible beating from Superstorm Sandy, and the corrosive saltwater  got into a lot of those tunnels, damaged the electrical work in those  tunnels; and I am glad my constituents and people going back and forth  between New York and New Jersey don't get to see the shape that these  hundred-year-old tunnels are in.   So once we create this new tunnel, it would allow us to repair the  other two, which is desperately needed--desperately needed.   So it is the Nation's most critical infrastructure project that we  see. The Gateway project will make commuters safe. It could generate,  as I said, more than 100,000 new jobs in the region.   The Gateway project is necessary to modernize Amtrak's Northeast  corridor, which runs between Boston and D.C. It is a project that  benefits people from States up and down the Atlantic seaboard. That is  why the Federal Government agreed to cover half of the cost of the  Gateway project, with New York and New Jersey splitting the other half.   And if my colleague would--who has greater knowledge of these issues  over the years--to have a State come along and be willing--you know, we  think that 70/30 splits are good with States, but New Jersey and New  York has said: We will do 50/50. Now, if we can't understand how that  is a positive, and that the States are willing to do their part, then  we don't understand these issues.  [[Page H1111]]    I am new to this, so I would--will the gentleman elaborate on the--I  have heard that 80/20 splits are good and 70/30 are great. And here is  a 50/50 split, yet, and still, we cannot get the Federal Government to  buy in, which, when Amtrak said they would take over the Northeast  corridor, the Federal Government was supposed to fund them to the  levels they needed in order to maintain it. And Amtrak has never  received the dollars that was promised since the inception of taking  over the Northeast corridor.    Tri-State.    I think the gentleman is on the right track. We are  willing to work with the President. And this, unfortunately, is another  incident or an example of where his lack of knowledge of government  operation is hampering what we need to do in this Nation.   It is very difficult to learn on the job, especially when you have  the job of Commander in Chief and you have had no experience with the  government, understanding the Senate, understanding how the House--how  it operates.   We are willing to help him. We want him to be successful, because if  he is successful, the Nation can be successful--not on his own, not his  own personal success, but success for the Nation.   I will come to a conclusion, as I see one of my colleagues who is on  the Northeast corridor has joined us as well, but just to your point  about water infrastructure.   So the Congressional Black Caucus went to Flint to meet with the  residents there, and Ms. Pelosi was on the trip and sat and met  different people and what they were going through at that time. It was  just sad, heartbreaking.   So me, traveling back to Newark, New Jersey, which is the third  oldest city in the United States of America, understanding if they were  having those issues in Flint, which is nowhere near as old as Newark,  New Jersey, what were the conditions in my community?   And lo and behold, I spoke to several mayors in my district, and I  said: You need to start looking at your water system. Based on what I  saw in Flint, I am very concerned.   And don't you know, that Tuesday, they found lead in 30 schools in  Newark, New Jersey, in the water system.    Mr. Speaker, I would just like to thank both of my  colleagues and Mr. Price for really showing a youngster at this how to  engage the American people.   And these issues, Mr. Speaker, are critical to Americans across the  Nation. And, yes, there is a swath that does not have these issues to  worry about, but there are people every single day who need to have us  address these issues in the manner in which we are speaking.   Everyone is not well off. Everyone is not able to buy for themselves.  Everyone is not the owner of a golf course. Everyone is not the  President of an LLC.   There are hardworking people. There are people who need jobs.  Reinvesting in infrastructure will put Americans to work, will give all  Americans the quality of life that they deserve in this Nation if they  are willing to work for it, and we understand that. But give them the  opportunity to work for it.
