 Madam Speaker, I, too, am pleased to be here  today with my colleagues to recognize the life and incredible service  of Sergeant Major Dan Altieri.   Originally from the northeast Ohio community of North Canton,  Sergeant Altieri served our country honorably in the United States  Marine Corps for 30 years, ending his career as the regimental sergeant  major for the 25th Regiment.   His more than 10 overseas deployments included tours in Grenada,  Lebanon, the Gulf war, Afghanistan, and Iraq, where he was with the  Columbus-based Lima Company.   When Lima Company was struck by a series of deadly attacks in 2005,  surviving officers turned to Sergeant Altieri to help them deal with  the unspeakable travesties that the war had brought upon them. A  testament to his leadership and courage, his marines often said they  would ``Follow Sergeant Altieri.''   Sergeant Altieri's service also extended right here at home, serving  in the Stark County Sheriff's Office in Canton for 25 years as a  deputy, keeping our community safe.   Northeast Ohio mourns the loss of Sergeant Altieri, who was taken  from us far too soon last week at the age of 62.   We will forever be grateful to Sergeant Altieri's service, and our  community and country are certainly better off having witnessed his  kindness and leadership.                            ____________________
