 Madam President, during National Hispanic Heritage Month,  we are called to honor the contributions of a critical community--that  of Hispanic Americans. Now accounting for 60 million individuals in the  United States, these men and women are an essential pillar of our  society. Although this group has grown significantly in recent decades,  individuals of Hispanic descent and culture have been with our Nation  since its very founding.   Hispanic identity is a complex concept, at least with respect to how  many in the United States traditionally understand race and ethnicity.  The word ``Hispanic'' stems from ``Hispanic,'' the Latin name for the  ancient Roman colonies on the Iberian Peninsula that also serves as the  origin for the modem state of Espana, or Spain. It was there that the  Spanish or Castilian language, culture, and people developed out of the  convergence of Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Celts, Basques, Visigoths  and Arabs, in addition to Christians, Muslims, and Jews.   The story does not end there. Along the hallowed walls of the U.S.  Capitol Rotunda are two paintings by John Vanderlyn depicting key  historical scenes. In 1492, the Spanish Catholic Monarchs King  Ferdinand and Queen Isabella agreed to sponsor the journey of  Christopher Columbus in search of a passage to the East Indies.  Columbus failed at this goal, but, as the Landing of Columbus  illustrates, he did land in the island now named San Salvador in the  Bahamas. This voyage prompted the Spanish exploration and colonization  of the Americas, including North America, reaching as far as  Mississippi in 1541, as depicted by William Henry Powell's Discovery of  the Mississippi by De Soto, and even deep into the Pacific Northwest.   Even then, however, we are still missing other key elements of the  story. The Spanish were not alone. They encountered vast empires, the  Aztecs and the Incas, in addition to hundreds of other peoples, from  the Mapuche in Argentina to the Maya in Guatemala. Colonization was a  bloody process that uprooted and killed millions of indigenous people.  Moreover, the Spanish brought millions of Africans to the Americas as  part of the Atlantic slave trade. Men, women, and children had to  struggle in cruel and terrible conditions as the property of others.  Nevertheless, it is undeniable that the indigenous and African  communities have helped make the Hispanic community what it is today,  whether it's in culture, art, music, food, language, or even the  genetic makeup of the people themselves. Significant portions of the  Hispanic community can trace their descent to these two groups--at  least in part, if not entirely.   The exploration and colonization that would lead to the creation of  the Hispanic world in the Americas would, in turn, set the stage for  English to do the same later, beginning with the first permanent  settlement in Jamestown, VA, in 1607. Eventually, these English  colonies would sever themselves from the British Empire and form the  United States of America. But Spanish colonies would continue to  influence our Nation throughout our history. Multiple territories, such  as Florida, Texas, California, and Puerto Rico, became integral parts  of our country. Others, inspired by the principles of the Enlightenment  and the examples of the American and French Revolutions, became their  own independent countries. They have since been our neighbors in the  Western Hemisphere and some of our most critical partners in trade,  security, and championing the virtues of democracy.   Congress established National Hispanic Heritage Month from September  15 to October 15 in recognition of the pivotal contributions and legacy  of this community that traces its roots to Spain, Mexico, Central  America, South America, the Caribbean, and further beyond. Millions,  such as the Hispanos of New Mexico and the Tejanos of Texas, are the  descendants of settlers who have been on these lands for centuries.  Starting in the twentieth century, millions of individuals from across  the Hispanic world have come to our Nation as immigrants. Since 2000,  the Hispanic population in Maryland has more than doubled, now  accounting for half a million people, or nearly 10 percent of all  Marylanders. Our State is home to a diverse community of individuals  with origins from across the Hispanic world, with sizeable populations  of Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Guatemalans, Salvadorans, and Peruvians.   Yet we must recognize that this community faces distinct challenges.  Instability continues to hamper the abilities  [[Page S5786]]  of already fragile states in our hemisphere, and dangerous conditions  abroad prompt many to leave everything behind to pursue a safer  existence. As the Hispanic-American population has grown, racism,  hatred, and naked xenophobia have unfortunately grown with it. Given  these trying circumstances, we must recognize the obligations that  arise from our shared humanity to assist those in need and to welcome  and celebrate our differences.   Hispanic Americans have done so much to support and make the United  States of America the exceptional nation that it is today. They have  made groundbreaking discoveries and innovations in science and  technology. They have shown us new ideas, art and music, and cuisine.  They have created new products and jobs as entrepreneurs and business  owners, and they have led our communities as dutiful elected  representatives of the people. They have fought and are fighting today  to protect our way of life and to promote our interests and ideals  abroad. During National Hispanic Heritage Month, we celebrate this  community's countless contributions, but not necessarily as something  new. Hispanic Americans have played an important role in the American  story since its very beginning.                            ____________________
