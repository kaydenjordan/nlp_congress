 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Goodlatte for his long-time  commitment to this very, very important issue, passing a balanced  budget amendment for our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, with the national debt exceeding $20 trillion, it is  long past time that we take necessary steps to restore fiscal  responsibility to the budget process. Too often, spending bills are  passed by adding to the deficit rather than balancing the budget and  helping to pay down our national debt. It is time to reverse that  mentality.   One of the greatest disappointments that I have experienced in my 22  years in Congress happened when we passed a balanced budget amendment  in the House by the required two-thirds votes, but the effort failed in  the Senate by just one vote, and a number of Members from the House  went down to the Senate to personally watch that vote and stare those  Senators in the eye, and it was such a disappointment because we all  knew then how important this was to our country.   And here we are, 20-plus years later, and the debt has gone up far  more than any of us thought even possible at that time. Had the  balanced budget amendment passed back then, our debt today certainly  would be lower, much lower.   The American people sent us here to make the difficult decisions  necessary to balance the budget and to live within our means. Just as  the American people have to do, every family has to balance their  budget every week or every month, and they can't spend more than they  take in or they end up going bankrupt. Our Federal Government is  basically bankrupt, but since we print money here, we are able to go  on. But that harms the American people. It harms our economy. We have  got to do something about it.   We cannot continue to just hope that we pass a balanced budget. It  has become increasingly obvious over the years that the only way to  ensure a balanced budget is to mandate, to require that Congress pass  one, and that is what we are considering today.                                time  1315    Passage of the balanced budget amendment is the only thing that we  [[Page H3167]]  can do to make certain that we, and future Congresses, rein in the out- of-control spending and restore fiscal sanity to Washington.   The resolution offered by Chairman Goodlatte today takes the  necessary steps to ensure that for any fiscal year, total outlays--what  we spend--do not exceed total receipts--what we take in. Our Nation  cannot continue to spend money that it doesn't have.   Let's end the borrow-and-spend mentality that created our staggering  national debt--over $20 trillion--and put our Nation on a sustainable  path by requiring that a balanced budget be enacted every year.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.
