 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  and legacy of my dear friend, Peggy Sadler, who is now with the Lord.   Peggy and her husband, David, met while attending the University of  California-Santa Barbara. In the mid-1960s, they moved to the beautiful  Simi Valley. David passed away last year as well, so they are now  reunited in Heaven.   Peggy was the mother of two children, Robert and Leslie. She was a  tireless public servant for over 40 years, supporting local public  leaders and volunteering throughout the community. Peggy spent her  retirement helping raise her grandchildren and great-grandchildren,  serving as a docent at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and  Museum, and serving her community as a volunteer at her local church.   I am grateful for the friendship that Peggy and I shared. The city of  Simi Valley is a better place because of Peggy Sadler. May we all pray  for her family, and may God bless Ms. Peggy Sadler.                            ____________________
