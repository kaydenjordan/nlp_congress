 Mr. Speaker, I am here to inform the House of  Representatives that the Committee on Oversight and Accountability has  indeed brought forward the receipts in our impeachment inquiry of Joe  Biden.   Through our investigation, we have uncovered a check to Joe Biden for  $200,000. This comes from foreign funds from a country in the Middle  East through a struggling company. You can see the check is directly  made to Joe Biden. This is what money laundering looks like.   We have also uncovered and released today another check to Joseph R.  Biden for $40,000. This $40,000 is a check written to him by his  brother and sister-in-law, James and Sara Biden, and this check comes  from funds directly through money laundering through the CCP.   No President of the United States, no Vice President, or no  officeholder should ever engage in money laundering, receiving money,  selling out their office, selling out their power, and getting paid  from foreign countries. We must continue our impeachment inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question of the  privileges of the House and offer the resolution that was previously  noticed.
