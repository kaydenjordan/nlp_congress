 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, today our colleague John Lewis will be  laid to rest. What an incredible legacy he leaves behind.   I was blessed to serve with him in the House of Representatives. The  two of us were elected in the same class to start serving in the House  of Representatives in 1987. We became friends, and he was certainly an  inspiration to all of us.   I particularly mention his name today because of the challenges we  are finding to our First Amendment right to peacefully protest. John  Lewis frequently talked about ``good trouble'' and that all of us have  a responsibility to speak out when we see something that is wrong and  to do it in a peaceful way.   It is interesting that his last public appearance was with the  protesters of Black Lives Matter here in DC, as he wanted to be there  and was proud to see the diversity of the group who was there to  protest the brutalities that we have seen in America and the systemic  racism we see in our country.   We not only have the right but the responsibility to speak out when  we see these injustices. The First Amendment to our Nation's  Constitution is key to the foundation of our country's democracy,  including the right of people to peacefully assemble and petition for  redress of grievances.   The President of the United States ordering unidentified agents of  the Department of Homeland Security to arrest and detain protesters is  a flagrant breach of trust and potentially a violation of the law.  Congress must speak up in a unified, bipartisan voice and tell the  President that such an escalation and militarization of our city  streets without provocation or invitation from local officials must  stop and must stop now.   I am gravely concerned that when Federal law enforcement agents are  deployed in this manner, their presence has increased tensions and  caused more confrontation between demonstrators and police. Indeed,  local, State, and even Federal officials--including the U.S. Attorney-- have criticized the Federal agents' intervention and tactics in  Portland.   I share the concerns of many of my colleagues regarding the misuse of  resources and personnel, particularly when Federal law enforcement  officers are used for political purposes by the President to violate  the civil rights of our constituents. We all should be concerned that  both the Justice and Homeland Security Departments are misusing their  emergency authorities and are actually aggravating the situation in  Portland and elsewhere.   I have cosponsored legislation that would place important limits and  oversight on the use of Federal officers for enforcement operations and  arrests relating to protests, including making sure that law  enforcement officers are clearly identified.   I recently voted in the Senate to place further limits on the  transfer of excess military equipment to State and local law  enforcement agencies, and I will continue to demand that America reform  its Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies.   After the shocking death of George Floyd in police custody in  Minneapolis, Congress must address systemic racism and police brutality  through passage of the Justice in Policing Act. While this legislation  has passed the House, Senator McConnell has still refused to bring it  up in the Senate, condemning it to his legislative graveyard.   Now more than ever, we urgently need to rebuild trust with our  communities and change the Trump administration's mentality from a  warrior to a guardian approach for law enforcement.   News reports indicate that Federal law enforcement officers have been  using unmarked vehicles to drive around downtown Portland and detain  protesters since at least mid-July. In some cases, citizens could not  tell the difference between law enforcement and far-right extremists in  the region who wore similar military gear.   This reminds us of the most radical images that we have seen in  authoritative, repressive regimes on how they violate the rights of  their citizens.   Federal officials have been reported as grabbing Americans in the  dark, not providing any form of identification, and arresting,  searching, and detaining individuals in cells before properly reading  their Miranda rights. There are widespread reports of Federal agents  not having any probable cause before making these arrests.   Not only are these actions irresponsible and dangerous, it is a  violation of our constitutional rights. America's strength is in the  ideals that we believe in. We are the global leader in democratic  values and the rule of law. These actions weaken our Nation, and these  actions weaken America's credibility and global leadership on behalf of  democratic values.   I am pleased that last week the inspectors general of the Department  of Homeland Security and Justice agreed to investigate how their agents  used force, detained people, and conducted themselves in confrontations  with protesters both in Portland, OR, and Washington, DC.   Recall in Washington, DC, that Attorney General Barr used force to  clear a peaceful protest at Lafayette Park just outside the White  House. Attorney General Barr took this action so that the President  could hold up a Bible for a photo-op outside of a church. This was an  unacceptable breach of faith in the Constitution. It breaks the trust  [[Page S4603]]  between our law enforcement and our citizens.   Defending democracy and the rule of law--the very freedoms we as a  nation hold so dear--is hard work. It is made harder when the very  individuals sworn to uphold the law work so hard to undermine it.   The Justice Department is the only Cabinet agency named after an  ideal, and Mr. Barr has forfeited his ability to effectively lead it.   In particular, the Justice Department inspector general will  investigate how U.S. marshals have used force in Portland and how other  parts of the Justice Department--such as the FBI, Drug Enforcement  Administration, and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and  Explosives--were used in the Nation's Capital.   The inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security has said  he opened an investigation into allegations that Customs and Border  Protection agents improperly detained and transported protesters in  Portland and that he would review the deployment of DHS's personnel in  recent weeks.   America is not under siege, as the President would like citizens to  believe--except by a President who freely uses aggressive law  enforcement as a prop to distract the country from his flailing  response to the pandemic that has crippled our Nation. Citizens are  rightly concerned that the administration has deployed a secret police  force, not to investigate crimes but to intimidate individuals it views  as political adversaries.   Several former Secretaries of Homeland Security have sounded the  alarm as well. Michael Chertoff, a Secretary of Homeland Security under  George W. Bush, wrote recently:         The Trump administration's deliberate decision to intervene       in the Portland protests with a heavy hand, unconventional       means and inflammatory political rhetoric has contributed to       growing public distrust--particularly of the Department of       Homeland Security.        Critics of the department are now rightly worried that its       law enforcement agents might be increasingly deployed by       President Trump to score political points, or even interfere       with the November election.    Secretary Chertoff concluded:         These actions, now or into the future, endanger our       democracy and undermine the nation's safety--by hurting the       department's ability to carry out its core mission of       protecting Americans from genuine threats to our security.    Tom Ridge, the first Secretary of Homeland Security after its  creation, said that the presence of Federal authorities in Portland,  OR, as protests continue in the city, is not consistent with the  Department of Homeland Security's mission. He noted that the first  words of the Department's vision statement that he helped establish are  ``preserving our freedoms.''   Secretary Ridge continued:         When they appear to be quasi-military rather than law       enforcement, I think it's like pouring a little bit of       gasoline on the fire. . . . Preserving the right to dissent       is something very important.    Now, I know President Trump has threatened to send additional Federal  officers to Baltimore and other cities to quell any further dissent or  protests. Let me remind President Trump that the protests in Baltimore  after the death of George Floyd in police custody have been peaceful,  so we don't need additional Federal agents designed to crack down on  free speech and peaceful protests, nor do we want Federal agents to  come to Baltimore with the purpose of escalating tensions with the  community or trying to provoke or incite violence or to discourage the  lawful right of citizens exercising their First Amendment.   Instead, in Baltimore, we want to continue working cooperatively with  our Federal partners, like our U.S. attorney, to address the stubborn  problems involving drug gangs and the high violent crime and murder  rate. Ensuring the safety of our communities requires an all-hands-on- deck approach. In Baltimore, we are using a task force known as the  Baltimore Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Strike Force,  which is made up of local, State, and Federal partners. This task force  only works due to continued transparency, collaboration, and engagement  with the community throughout this process.   Together, the citizens of Baltimore will keep working with our law  enforcement authorities to improve safety in our neighborhoods and on  our streets. The city of Baltimore and the U.S. Department of Justice  are continuing to work closely together, along with our U.S. District  Court for the District of Maryland, to fully implement a consent decree  to bring constitutional policing to Baltimore residents so that the  police adopt a guardian instead of a warrior approach.   Instead of spreading divisive rhetoric and taking escalatory actions  against our citizens--tactics recently employed by President Trump--we  should focus on working constructively at the Federal, State, and local  level to promote proven strategies and solutions--like the strike  force--that effectively reduce crime and improve safety.   I look forward to the findings and recommendations of the inspectors  general of those two Departments to make clear what went wrong and to  take steps to make sure this type of Federal law enforcement authority  is never abused again in the future.   I would hope that all my colleagues would recognize the threat of  these actions to the protections in the First Amendment of our  Constitution, and we will work together as one body to protect the  lawful rights of our citizens to protest their disagreements with  government in a peaceful way.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
