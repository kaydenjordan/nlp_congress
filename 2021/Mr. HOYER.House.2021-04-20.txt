 Madam Speaker, first of all, I rise in strong support of  this resolution. It makes in order that we will not discriminate  against people based upon their religion or the State from which they  come or the nation from which they come. It says not at our cost, but  at their cost they have the right to consult counsel. That seems to me  to be a basic premise in America.   Then, thirdly, which we hear so much lamentation about, it gives to  700,000-plus people in the District of Columbia equal status with the  500,000 people in Wyoming. How terrible. Now, perhaps if my friends  from the other side of the aisle, Madam Speaker, thought that there  were going to be two Republican Senators elected, they would be for it.  I say perhaps, but I believe there is no doubt about that.   I am proud to be a strong supporter of that legislation, and I will  tell my Republican friends who talk about human rights around the world  so often--properly so--that Washington, D.C., is the only capital in  the free world whose residents do not have a representative in the  parliament of their country--the only one.   There is no reason why the gentlewoman who sits in front of me,  Eleanor Holmes Norton--who is an extraordinary American and an  extraordinary patriot who serves her Nation so incredibly well and is  elected by those 700,000 people--why she is less than we because  Eleanor Holmes Norton cannot vote on final passage of a bill.   Now, I did, as the majority leader, at least give her the respect and  the respect to others who are representatives of their particular  areas--Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana  Islands--the right to vote in the Committee of the Whole to let them  know at least in that small way we wanted to give voice to the folks  they represent.   So I rise in strong support of this rule. We have passed these bills  before. Republicans opposed them before, and they will oppose them  again. I am not surprised.   Madam Speaker, before I sit, however, I want to speak about another  issue. We are expecting the Republican leader to offer a privileged  resolution at the conclusion of the debate on this rule. I am  disappointed at that news. His resolution is being used by Republicans  to posit a moral equivalence between a comment by the gentlewoman from  California about standing up for justice and peaceful protest and  remarks by Representative Greene who directly threatened violence by  retweeting a tweet. I understand it was not her words, but she  retweeted those words which said that if you want to shut Pelosi up, a  bullet to the head will accomplish that objective. She didn't say it. I  want to make that clear. She retweeted a tweet that said that.   Even more egregiously, it is being used to twist reality to suggest  that somehow Congresswoman Waters' remark is as condemnable a remark as  rhetoric that incites a violent attempt to overthrow the government of  the United States on January 6, an action that Republicans refuse to  condemn. There is no equivalence.   Chairwoman Waters' remarks reflect the very profound anger and sense  of hopelessness that she and so many others--myself included--feel when  we see African Americans being killed during encounters with our law  enforcement and their families not seeing justice.   It is my understanding we are going to get a ruling almost perhaps  any minute. We will see.   It is, however, irresponsible to take Chairwoman Waters' remarks out  of context just to hold a gotcha partisan vote, particularly when no  action was taken by her party regarding Mrs. Greene's remarks.   It is, frankly, exploiting the pain of so many families and  communities to turn Chairwoman Waters' concern for justice into a  partisan cudgel.   As my friend, the dearly departed Elijah Cummings used to say and  would surely say now, ``We are better than this.''   So when the minority leader offers his motion, I will offer a motion  to table and urge all my colleagues to support that motion.   I urge all of my colleagues to pick up their dictionary, turn to the  Cs, and look up confront. Confront is to face the facts. Confront is to  face the truth. Confront is to face the challenges that we have, and  that is what Ms. Waters urged.   I would suggest to my friend, the minority leader, Madam Speaker,  that if confrontation is subject to sanction, then we are going to have  a lot of people on his side of the aisle who we believe are  confrontational every day.   Confront is not violence. Confront is not waving guns and some  groups' biggest fear. Confront is not to say to be violent in  confronting the facts, the truth, the opportunities, and the  challenges, and, yes, the alternatives that we all take.   So if one of us stands up and says that we need to confront this and  we need to be confrontational and we need to get up in people's faces  and say: This is the truth and we need to act and that would be subject  to admonition, then I suggest to my friend, Madam Speaker, and my  friends in this House, that we all confront.   We came here to represent people and to confront their needs, to  confront their fears, and to confront their wants. Now, yes, you could  say, well, that is advocacy. Of course, it is. So I ask my friends not  only to vote for this rule, but to vote for the motion to table my  friend's motion that I anticipate.   We could spend all our time here, Madam Speaker. We have been on this  side of the aisle, as my friend, the leader knows, and we haven't had  all the resolutions that have been introduced on my side of the aisle.  This makes it harder, however, not to proceed on numerous resolutions  on my side of the aisle. Let us table this resolution on behalf of this  institution and every Member in it.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to section 6 of House Resolution  330, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bills: H.R. 367, H.R.  370, H.R. 396, H.R. 397, H.R. 408, H.R. 490, H.R. 965, H.R. 1251, H.R.  1395, H.R. 1491, H.R. 1528, H.R. 1532, H.R. 1565, H.R. 1602, and H.R.  2523, and agree to H.

Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The stated goal of the United States International       Strategy for Cyberspace, launched on May 16, 2011, is to       ``work internationally to promote an open, interoperable,       secure, and reliable information and communications       infrastructure that supports international trade and       commerce, strengthens international security, and fosters       free expression and innovation . . . in which norms of       responsible behavior guide states' actions, sustain       partnerships, and support the rule of law in cyberspace''.        (2) In its June 24, 2013, report, the Group of Governmental       Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and       Telecommunications in the Context of International Security       (referred to in this section as ``GGE''), established by the       United Nations General Assembly, concluded that ``State       sovereignty and the international norms and principles that       flow from it apply to States' conduct of [information and       communications technology] ICT-related activities and to       their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure with their       territory''.        (3) In January 2015, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia,       Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan proposed a troubling international       code of conduct for information security, which could be used       as a pretext for restricting political dissent, and includes       ``curbing the dissemination of information that incites       terrorism, separatism or extremism or that inflames hatred on       ethnic, racial or religious grounds''.        (4) In its July 22, 2015, consensus report, GGE found that       ``norms of responsible State behavior can reduce risks to       international peace, security and stability''.        (5) On September 25, 2015, the United States and China       announced a commitment that neither country's government       ``will conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of       intellectual property, including trade secrets or other       confidential business information, with the intent of       providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial       sectors''.        (6) At the Antalya Summit on November 15 and 16, 2015, the       Group of 20 Leaders' communique--        (A) affirmed the applicability of international law to       state behavior in cyberspace;        (B) called on states to refrain from cyber-enabled theft of       intellectual property for commercial gain; and        (C) endorsed the view that all states should abide by norms       of responsible behavior.        (7) The March 2016 Department of State International       Cyberspace Policy Strategy noted that ``the Department of       State anticipates a continued increase and expansion of our       cyber-focused diplomatic efforts for the foreseeable       future''.        (8) On December 1, 2016, the Commission on Enhancing       National Cybersecurity, which was established within the       Department of Commerce by Executive Order 13718 (81 Fed. Reg.       7441), recommended that ``the President should appoint an       Ambassador for Cybersecurity to lead U.S. engagement with the       international community on cybersecurity strategies,       standards, and practices''.        (9) On April 11, 2017, the 2017 Group of 7 Declaration on       Responsible States Behavior in Cyberspace--        (A) recognized ``the urgent necessity of increased       international cooperation to promote security and stability       in cyberspace'';        (B) expressed commitment to ``promoting a strategic       framework for conflict prevention, cooperation and stability       in cyberspace, consisting of the recognition of the       applicability of existing international law to State behavior       in cyberspace, the promotion of voluntary, non-binding norms       of responsible State behavior during peacetime, and the       development and the implementation of practical cyber       confidence building measures (CBMs) between States''; and        (C) reaffirmed that ``the same rights that people have       offline must also be protected online''.        (10) In testimony before the Select Committee on       Intelligence of the Senate on May 11, 2017, Director of       National Intelligence Daniel R. Coats identified six cyber       threat actors, including--        (A) Russia, for ``efforts to influence the 2016 U.S.       election'';        (B) China, for ``actively targeting the U.S. Government,       its allies, and U.S. companies for cyber espionage'';        (C) Iran, for ``leverag[ing] cyber espionage, propaganda,       and attacks to support its security priorities, influence       events and foreign perceptions, and counter threats'';        (D) North Korea, for ``previously conduct[ing] cyber-      attacks against U.S. commercial entities--specifically, Sony       Pictures Entertainment in 2014'';        (E) terrorists, who ``use the Internet to organize,       recruit, spread propaganda, raise funds, collect       intelligence, inspire action by followers, and coordinate       operations''; and        (F) criminals, who ``are also developing and using       sophisticated cyber tools for a variety of purposes including       theft, extortion, and facilitation of other criminal       activities''.        (11) On May 11, 2017, President Donald J. Trump issued       Executive Order 13800 (82 Fed. Reg. 22391), entitled       ``Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and       Infrastructure'', which--        (A) designates the Secretary of State to lead an       interagency effort to develop an engagement strategy for       international cooperation in cybersecurity; and        (B) notes that ``the United States is especially dependent       on a globally secure and resilient internet and must work       with allies and other partners toward maintaining . . . the       policy of the executive branch to promote an open,       interoperable, reliable, and secure internet that fosters       efficiency, innovation, communication, and economic       prosperity, while respecting privacy and guarding against       disruption, fraud, and theft''.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term       ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee       on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on       Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives.

(3) Executive agency.--The term ``Executive agency'' has       the meaning given the term in section 105 of title 5, United       States Code.       SEC. 4.

       Whereas several peaceful demonstrators have died as a       result of police violence, including 31-year-old Roman       Bondrenko who was violently beaten by plainclothes police       officers and, as a result, suffered head injuries that       resulted in his death;

       Whereas Alyaksandr Lukashenka continues to undermine the       sovereignty and independence of Belarus through efforts to       integrate Belarus into a so-called ``Union States'' under the       control of Russia;
