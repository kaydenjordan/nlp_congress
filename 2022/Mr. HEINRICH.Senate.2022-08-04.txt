 Mr. President, reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, what my colleague from Kentucky is  attempting to do here is to really short-circuit the bedrock public  health protections in the Clean Air Act.   And make no mistake. This is a major policy change; not a minor  change. It would have far-reaching impacts. For example, this policy  would clearly make food even more expensive; it would make air quality  worse. And it is not even eminently clear that the impact on gas prices  would necessarily be negative.   So, fundamentally, this is the kind of sweeping policy that should  actually go through the committee of jurisdiction--in this case, the  Environment and Public Works Committee.   So I object.
