 Madam Speaker, as we work to strengthen America's roads,  bridges, and highways, it is important that our workforce keeps pace  with our infrastructure improvements.   Seventy percent of the Nation's freight is carried by commercial  trucks, yet, as our economy strengthens, motor carriers are having  difficulty finding the drivers they need to handle the growing  capacity.   While most States, including Indiana, allow drivers to obtain a  commercial driver's license at 18, they are prohibited from driving in  interstate commerce until they are 21 by Federal law.   To address this issue, I cosponsored legislation to alleviate the  shortage of commercial drivers back home, helping our farmers,  manufacturers, retailers, and small businesses to keep Hoosiers  working, eating, building, selling, and growing.   The DRIVE-Safe Act will help Indiana's freight continue to move,  while preserving the safety of our highway system.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues on the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to help fill these  desperately needed jobs and provide young Hoosiers with the opportunity  to enter the industry.                            ____________________
