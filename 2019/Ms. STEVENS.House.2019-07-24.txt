 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this cynical,  partisan motion to recommit.   The bill before us today is not a bailout. It is a backstop. It is a  solution to a boiling point that we ignore at the peril of more than a  million workers who are now faced with financial catastrophe in  retirement.   If we do nothing with this multiemployer pension crisis, taxpayers  will pay the price.   If we do nothing, our Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation will  tumble.   If we do nothing, 1.3 million hardworking Americans will lose what  they paid into their entire working life.   To the teamster who has played by the rules, to the carpenter who is  already seeing a drop in his monthly benefits, we are here today to do  something.   But the ringing irony, that the very people opposing this bill are  some of the very people who rushed to vote to pass a tax relief act for  the wealthiest corporations and the biggest banks, ballooning our  deficit by $1.9 trillion. We scratch our heads and we ask, Why is it  that you cannot lift a finger for the middle class?   Today, we deliver for the American people, and we save the pensions  of those who have never asked for anything.   Take it from me, my friends, I know what it is like to be on the  phone with the PBGC when the auto industry needed our help.   I know what that means when they tell us that these plans will run  insolvent by 2025.   I know what it is like to be working in the Department of the  Treasury during the largest economic crisis of our times; when  Republicans and Democrats came together, shelving political dogma, to  make a uniquely Federal problem right.   Butch Lewis is a good deal, and the kind of deal you make to protect  our middle class and the economic security of so many. This is what you  do.   Make government work for us. Contribute to the best action in the  outcome of the very people--pass Butch Lewis.
