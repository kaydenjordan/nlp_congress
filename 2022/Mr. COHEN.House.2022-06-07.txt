 Mr. Speaker, during the break, I had the opportunity to  participate in the Transatlantic Dialogue. We had members of  parliaments from maybe six or seven different nations: Ireland,  Germany, Serbia, and Croatia--all over Europe.   I asked what the rate of inflation was, and in every country, it was  8, 9, and 10 percent. And I asked them if their parliaments didn't  blame Biden for it? They laughed. Of course, they laughed.   Inflation is a worldwide problem. We are doing what we can. It is  caused by the awful coronavirus and the effects it has had on  production in China. And it has hurt our opportunities to continue our  manufacturing as we saw it before.   Gasoline prices have increased the same amount in Europe as they have  here.   And is it Joe Biden's fault?   No. It is OPEC, and it is Russia. Prices have gone up about 30  percent since they invaded Ukraine.   All Americans should want and should work together to reduce  inflation and oil prices. But it is not Joe Biden's fault. It is a  worldwide problem.                            ____________________
