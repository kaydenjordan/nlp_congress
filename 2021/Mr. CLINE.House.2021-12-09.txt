 Madam Speaker, the American people deserve a transparent  and bipartisan legislative process, but that is apparently not what the  Democrat majority wants.   Unfortunately, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  continually manufacture crisis after crisis by waiting until deadlines  are immediately upon us before addressing the issues at hand. And when  we are up against a deadline, it gives the majority leverage to limit  opposition and allows them to ram harmful bills through this House,  claiming they are necessities.   They have done it with multiple continuing resolutions. They did it  with the Surface Transportation Reauthorization Act. And now, after  having already punted responsibility once on the issue, they are doing  it again on raising the debt ceiling, as a default looms less than a  week away.   We must stop fanning the flames of fires where the tools exist to  extinguish them. Democrats legislating in this manner creates  uncertainty and spooks the market, which contributes to the twin  economic crisis and energy crisis, both of which this administration  has done nothing to address.   For our economy to truly recover, we must ensure the government is  working efficiently and effectively on behalf of the American people.                            ____________________
