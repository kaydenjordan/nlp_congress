 Mr. Speaker, this week, I had the privilege to speak to  the parents of Special Forces Soldier Aaron Butler from Monticello,  Utah.   From the time Aaron was in the first grade, he wanted to join the  military and serve our country. After a legendary career as a four-time  State wrestling champion at Monticello High School, Aaron joined the  Utah National Guard.   Within a few years, he was one of just four soldiers who graduated  with honors from the Army Green Beret Special Qualification Course.   Throughout his service, Aaron's teammates and superior officers  regarded him as a natural leader with an unmatched work ethic.   He was tough and dedicated. He loved our country, and he took his  responsibility to protect it seriously.   On August 16, 2017, Aaron was serving as a staff sergeant in Bravo  Company, 1st Battalion, 19th Special Forces Group of the Utah National  Guard on his first combat deployment that should have ended in October.   Tragically, an explosion occurred while he was clearing a booby- trapped building in Afghanistan, killing Aaron and injuring 11  teammates.   His family, seven siblings, parents, and fiancee, as well as his  teammates, were devastated. His hometown and the rest of our State  mourned this tragic loss.   His sister said that if Aaron had given his own eulogy, he would have  said: I came. I lived. I killed bad guys. I died.   Aaron and his courageous sacrifice will never be forgotten. Our  country is forever indebted to the service of Aaron and countless  others who make daily sacrifices to protect our country and keep us  safe.   And our country is, likewise, forever indebted to the families that  have supported them.   Like many others, I have been blessed by the dedicated military  service of a family member. My father served in the Navy during World  War II. I was reminded of his great service during a recent visit to  the U.S. Naval Academy, where I had the honor to meet with a group of  Utah cadets, and again during a visit with U.S. troops stationed in  Poland and Abu Dhabi.   This weekend, we will celebrate Memorial Day and take the opportunity  to express our deepest and most profound gratitude to those who have  fallen in the service of our country. I thank them, their families, and  all those who are willing to serve. Our way of life and every ideal we  hold dear has been built on the sacrifice of these heroes.   This week, I am proud to speak in support of the proposals in the  National Defense Authorization Act that will provide our troops with  support to increase capability and capacity in a force that has been  asked to do too much with too little for too long.   In this, I am pleased to support a well-deserved pay raise for our  troops and extend special pay and bonuses to servicemembers in high- demand fields, something our servicemembers and their families have  more than earned.   After heroically serving this country, our veterans deserve the very  best that we can give them back home.   This week, I was honored to support more than a dozen veterans bills  that passed the House. These proposals will help improve the lives and  honor the men and women who have served so selflessly.   This legislation will help provide for disabled veterans who have  been wounded in service. It will ensure our veterans have access to the  care and resources they have earned. It will keep our homeless veterans  off the street. It will ease educational burdens placed on our veterans  by the Federal Government. It will protect our veterans from the  dangers of opioid abuse. It will increase accountability at the  Department of Veterans Affairs to guarantee those brave individuals and  their families receive the quality of service they deserve.   This Memorial Day, we honor the dedicated generations of men and  women who have fought for our country and ensured our freedom. May we  all strive every day to live worthy of their sacrifice, and may God  bless the United States of America.                            ____________________
