 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to use a  stethoscope as a prop during my remarks.    Madam President, last year, I put my sport coats and  ties away and broke out some scrubs, found my stethoscope and a lab  coat, and went to work fighting COVID on the frontlines of hospitals  and community centers in Wyandotte County, KS, and Seward County, KS.   This is a picture of some of the heroes I worked with. I think what  is important to note is this is a time when none of us knew how bad  this virus was. It reminded me, as a medical student, working on HIV  patients. Myself geared up from head to toe with patient protective  equipment, personal protective equipment, nurses, respiratory  therapists, radiology techs--all of us not knowing how bad this virus  was and how easily it could spread.   Today, these heroes are being punished. These heroes came to work  every day covered from head to toe in personal protective equipment,  with each one knowing that they could contract COVID-19 from any one of  their patients at any given time.   This particular setting, an ICU--an ICU with 8 beds and 13 patients.   Despite the risk to them, to their families--think about that. Think  about having children at home or a spouse, that you were not only  risking your own life but the fear of taking this virus home with you.  But they threw themselves into the fire, so to speak, all in the effort  to save Kansans from a pandemic that was raging across our communities.   In the earliest months of this pandemic and still to this day, our  healthcare heroes have displayed sacrifice and dedication to the  American people. It is a reminder to all of us how essential these  people are in ensuring the safety of our communities.   They weren't left unscathed. Between burnout and suicide, the  pandemic took a heavy toll on their physical and mental health-- doctors, nurses, all the supporting staffs in these hospitals, in the  nursing homes, in the emergency rooms.   The resulting exodus of fatigued and demoralized doctors and nurses  and other frontline workers is exacerbating a labor shortage which  already existed across rural Kansas and across rural America long, long  before the pandemic occurred.   Since February of 2020, roughly one in five healthcare workers has  quit their job--one in five--according to a poll published late last  year. In September, the American Nurses Association sent a letter to  HHS Secretary Becerra urging the Agency to declare the nursing shortage  a national crisis and to take immediate action to confront the issue.   I can tell you, I don't talk to any doctor back home, any hospital  administrator, who is not going to grab me and say: We have got a huge  nursing shortage. You have to do something about it.  [[Page S934]]    The nursing homes, the rehab centers are all suffering huge, huge  nursing shortages. The nursing colleges are now having a huge shortage  of teachers. Nearly a third of the country's 15,000 nursing homes  reported a shortage of nurses or aides. Hospitals have been forced to  recruit foreign nurses, and National Guardsmen have had to fill in as  nursing assistants to ease these problems. These shortages are  particularly impactful in rural areas like my home State of Kansas.   The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services acknowledges there are  currently ``endemic staff shortages for all categories of employees at  almost all kinds of healthcare providers and suppliers.'' Despite this  acknowledgement, President Biden and his public health officials went  forward with this vaccine mandate, knowing it could and would lead to  more firings--firings like those we saw in New York, where 33,000  healthcare workers were fired--33,000. They were fired, retired, or  placed on unpaid leave because they chose not to abide by the State's  mandatory inoculation policy.   Labor shortages at healthcare facilities will impede access for the  elderly and the poor--those who are supposed to be cared for under  Medicare and Medicaid.   In addition to the impact this would have on the healthcare  workforce, this mandate puts additional burdens on hospitals and State  surveyors. The rule requires covered entities to comply with redtape by  requiring them to develop and implement policies to ensure compliance  with the mandate, meanwhile taking nurses away from that contact with  the patients who need the attention.   CMS estimated that the cost of this mandate on private-sector  entities would exceed $158 million. Follow-on guidance issued by CMS  recently also required State surveyors to enforce the Federal  Government's vaccine mandate by verifying compliance at healthcare  facilities. This will take away, again, limited resources at the State  level and prevent them from fulfilling their traditional surveying and  certification duties, not to mention multiple States have laws on their  books prohibiting vaccination as a condition of employment for State  agencies.    As a physician, I am confident that the vaccine has saved lives, and  I am so grateful for the vaccines. However, whether to receive it or  not is a personal choice between individuals and their doctor, not  mandated via unconstitutional Executive actions. I still believe in the  sanctity of the patient-physician relationship.   Make no mistake, this Federal vaccine mandate is not about public  health or science and fails to account for changes in data and the  circumstances of the virus. If it were, we would recognize natural  immunity as a highly effective way to combat the virus. Mountains of  evidence show that those who achieved immunity through natural  infection--many of them being on our frontline, those healthcare heroes  from yesterday--are highly protected against reinfection.   The mandate was also crafted when the Delta variant was the dominant  strain in the United States. Omicron is now the dominant strain. It is  much milder and has a 91-percent lower risk of death than Delta.   Additionally, research shows the traditional COVID vaccine dosing  regimen provides little protection against transmission of the Omicron  variant, basically said that natural immunity is at least as good if  not better than vaccination from the original vaccines.   As noted by Dr. Fauci, ``Omicron, with its extraordinary,  unprecedented degree of . . . transmissibility, will ultimately find  just about everybody,'' and even those who have received the initial  vaccine and subsequent booster ``will still get infected.'' And we saw  that play out, right? We all saw that play out. Many, many people who  had gotten the vaccine ended up with the Omicron virus, and certainly  we also found out that natural immunity was much better than the  original vaccines against Omicron.   Most absurdly, in late January, the CDC issued guidance that allows  COVID-positive healthcare workers to return to work. Let me say that  again. The hypocrisy. The CDC issued guidance that allows COVID- positive healthcare workers to return to work even if they are still  testing positive. How many people in America would want a COVID- positive respiratory therapist intubating their loved one in an ICU?   These examples just show how flawed the science is behind the CMS  vaccine mandate. As previously stated, that is because this vaccine  mandate is not about public health or science. The Biden  administration's mandate is about fulfilling their desire to control  every aspect of our lives, and it is a slap in the face to the hard- working men and women who never took a day off in the frontline fight  of the COVID-19 battle.   These are real people with real families. They are working to feed  their families, and they have mortgages to pay. And these are smart  people. These are well-educated people--people who thoughtfully  considered the vaccine and then decided it was not best for them. These  were my medical school classmates, successful physicians working at  medical centers, experts in their fields who had looked at the data and  had deeply either religious reasons or scientific reasons for not  taking the vaccine.   Each day, we hear from Kansans faced with the difficult decision of  taking the jab or losing their job. We even surveyed dozens of  healthcare providers across the State who are already citing shortages  and other staffing issues due to the mandate. In fact, 87 percent of  the surveyed oppose the mandate or cited numerous concerns with it.   These jobs can't be replaced overnight, and with the March 15  deadline for nearly all healthcare workers who haven't received two  doses looming, what we are about to witness is a government-induced  labor shortage and, in turn, a health crisis we can't afford. That  health crisis will affect every American, whether you are waiting for  your elective hip to be replaced or you are waiting to get your loved  one moved from a hospital setting into some type of a nursing home or  assisted living facility. You all, every one of us, will be impacted.   One respondent put it best when he told us this:         [W]e are concerned that the execution [of the mandate] will       exacerbate an already dire workforce crisis in long term       care. A hard deadline with no resources for providers or       glide path for unvaccinated workers is likely to push too       many out the door and ultimately, threaten residents' access       to long term care.    Now, I know some here will say that the Supreme Court ruled to uphold  this mandate earlier this year and this is settled, but that is not the  full story here. The Supreme Court opinion which lifted the stay on the  rule focused primarily on the Secretary of HHS's statutory authority to  impose conditions upon healthcare facilities participating in Medicare  and Medicaid. This does not mean it is a good rule or it is a  beneficial condition to have placed on those facilities given  everything I have laid out here today. In fact, it is a hardship to  those facilities, and it is a hardship for the families of the loved  ones who are in those facilities.   This fight against a harmful rule continues here on the Senate floor,  and I am going to keep fighting along with all those throughout this  Nation's Federal judicial system.   Quick update. Sixteen States have joined together in a new filing  last month to once again block the Federal Government from enforcing  the mandate in their respective States. Sixteen States think the CMS  has got this wrong. They think the White House has got this wrong.  Additionally, the attorney general in my home State of Kansas, Derek  Schmidt, is leading the fight. He, along with nine other attorneys  general, has asked a separate Federal court to reopen litigation.   No, we are not even close to stopping this fight.   It has been an incredibly tough time these past couple of years. We  have lost over 950,000 Americans to COVID-19. We have seen mental  health issues skyrocket, suicides on the rise, and substance abuse  increase.   But if there is one thing that is for sure, though, it is that  Americans will keep fighting to get through this. Frontline workers in  hospitals, doctors' offices, community health centers, and beyond will  fight even harder; that is if we remove the burden of the vaccine  mandate and our healthcare heroes aren't forced to leave their jobs.  [[Page S935]]    Just this week, England terminated their COVID vaccination  requirement for all health and social services. We must do the same. I  urge my colleagues to support this resolution of disapproval to  invalidate President Biden's overreaching and harmful vaccine mandate  for our healthcare workers. This is a major element of the government's  overreaching COVID-19 response that must begin to be scaled back. Not  only is it coercive and unconstitutional, the mandate does not take  into account the fact that natural immunity is as effective as the  vaccines and that vaccines do not prevent transmission of the Omicron  variant. Additionally, we all know--we all see it--we have a massive  labor shortage in our healthcare industry and must do everything in our  power to fight for Americans who ran to the sound of the battle, for  these are the true heroes of the pandemic and deserve our best fight  and utmost respect.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I appreciate the comments of my  colleague from the great State of Oregon, but his arguments all rely  upon one assumption, and that is that the vaccine works to prevent  transmission.   But the vaccines don't work to prevent transmission.   The Supreme Court's ruling was not a ruling on merit. The Medicare  and Medicaid vaccine mandate will impact every family, every person  across this great Nation. We already have a dire shortage of doctors,  nurses, ultrasound techs, custodians, housekeepers, kitchen staff in  all these hospitals and nursing homes. This mandate will result in more  staffing shortages and firings.   The science behind this mandate is quite outdated. Natural immunity  is stronger than immunity achieved through vaccination at this point in  time.   Last night, during the State of the Union Address, President Biden  said:         Let's stop looking at the COVID-19 as a partisan dividing       line.    Let's take him at his word. Let's make our actions be consistent with  his words. Let's repeal this divisive mandate today.   I urge all my colleagues to support our resolution.   I yield the floor.                             Vote on S.J. Res. 32     Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
