 Mr. Speaker, I would like to talk one more time about  the reconciliation bill that may be before us very soon.   We began this session with a great electoral victory for Black Lives  Matter, who on their website said we disrupt the western prescribed  nuclear family structure.   First of all, I think that is just insulting because we have nuclear  families all over the world. But in any event, I look at the  reconciliation bill that is now before us, and it looks to me like a  payoff to people who want to discriminate against the nuclear family.   Whether you look at the earned income tax credit, all the additional  money in low-income housing, or the increase in Pell grants, they are  all additional money that will be disproportionately very difficult for  nuclear families to access.   I strongly reject voting for this bill because in the future we must  no longer punish people who decide to live in nuclear families.                            ____________________
