 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, this week, Republicans are choosing MAGA  extremism over our military, over women's health rights, and over  diversity, equity, and inclusion.   Our military, Mr. Chairman, was founded to fight for the freedom of  all our citizens. House Republicans have threatened democracy with  these divisive amendments, setting us back in history far before civil  rights and taking us back to slavery. The very fabric of our country  stands on equal rights, freedoms, and the decisions of all our  citizens.   They are divisive amendments using the defense bill to undermine the  freedom for us to learn about one another, for us to hire one another,  and for us to understand our cultures.   It would bring us together if we did DEI. Even your own chairman of  the Financial Services Committee said that we would include diversity  and inclusion in our committees because we are stronger when we are  together.   Democrats have long advocated for more rights, not for less, for more  access for those marginalized, and for more freedom for those who are  considered citizens of our beloved country.   Mr. Chairman, this is wrong, and we are better than that. It is very  difficult as a Black woman for me to stand on this House floor and have  my colleagues say that there is no value and no need for diversity,  equity, and inclusion.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Chu).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Mrs. Fletcher).    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Chair, in closing, let me just say that this is  difficult today, but let me assure my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle that we are not playing games. Let me assure my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle that we take this very seriously and very  personally.   Let me assure my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that when  we use a defense bill, when we use our military--I am old enough to  remember when Black officers and when women were not allowed to serve-- you are setting us back on this floor on both sides of the aisle.   We have people of color, people who have served, women who have  served on this side of the aisle, and to use it to deny women rights to  their reproductive rights, to use this as an excuse in a political  maneuver, we are so serious that this has become something that is very  difficult for us to stand on this floor and work with you and look at  you for something that is so appalling.   The ACTING Chair. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.   Members are again reminded to direct their remarks to the Chair.                                time  1815     Mr. Chair, I was asking to be recognized to have the  words colored people--    Mr. Chair, I would like to be recognized to have the  words colored people stricken from the Record. I find it offensive and  very inappropriate.    Mr. Chair, I am asking for unanimous consent to take  down the words of referring to me or any of my colleagues as colored  people.    I have asked unanimous consent, Mr. Chair, to have the  words stricken. I didn't ask for an amendment.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
