 Mr. Speaker, in 2018, the United States Commission on  Civil Rights released the ``Broken Promises'' report, a project  undertaken at my request to evaluate Federal obligations to Indian  Country.   Here is a summary. For too long, the Federal Government has failed to  live up to its treaty and trust responsibilities to Tribal nations. As  a result, many Native communities lack adequate housing, health  facilities, schools, and justice centers. Many lack basic  infrastructure--roads, water, and telecommunications--required to  deliver needed support services.   Congress and the Federal Government have a moral and legal obligation  to fulfill the promises that have been made, and that is why I am proud  to introduce the Honoring Promises to Native Nations Act, legislation  to help reverse the decades-long pattern of systemic funding shortfalls  and to strengthen Federal programs that support Indian Country.   This bill includes provisions to reaffirm the nation-to-nation  relationship between the Federal Government and Tribal nations and to  better meet the needs of Native communities.   Action is long overdue, Mr. Speaker, and Congress should move swiftly  to get this done.                            ____________________
