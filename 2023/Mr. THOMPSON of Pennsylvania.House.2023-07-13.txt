 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the Bellefonte Red Raiders varsity baseball team for the extraordinary  achievement as the 2023 PIAA quad A State champions.   On June 17, at Penn State's Medlar Field at Lubrano Park, the Red  Raiders defeated Dallas High School 7-1 to claim the championship  title. The Raiders were led on the mound by senior Dom Capparella who  pitched a complete game while striking out five batters and only  allowing one run.   At the plate, junior Trevor Johnson led the way hitting a pair of  doubles and scoring two runs. Junior Levi Purnell added a pair of hits  and three RBIs.   Mr. Speaker, Bellefonte finished their season with a 20-5 record.  Bellefonte joins Bald Eagle, another Centre County school, in winning  their class's State championship. This is the first time that the two  Centre County schools won a State championship in baseball in the same  year.   This is the first time Bellefonte has won a class 4A title, but this  is their eighth State championship and the first since 2015.   We congratulate Red Raiders again on their victory.               Congratulating Clarion High School Baseball Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the extraordinary achievements of the Clarion High School Baseball Team  on their 2023 State Championship victory.   On June 15, at Penn State's Medlar Field at Lubrano Park, Clarion  High School Bobcats beat DuBois Central Catholic for the PIAA Single A  2023 Baseball State Championship. This was an incredibly rare meeting  of two teams from the same district. The Bobcats were victorious with a  4-1 win.   Devin Lauer went four shutout innings, allowing five hits and  striking out five before giving way to Derek Smail, who allowed just  one run in three innings.   Mr. Speaker, this is an historic win for the Bobcats as it is their  first State Championship victory in program history. This team was  fueled by determination, perseverance, and commitment as they continued  to move toward the championship game.   Congratulations to the Clarion High School Bobcats on this impressive  victory.                            ____________________
