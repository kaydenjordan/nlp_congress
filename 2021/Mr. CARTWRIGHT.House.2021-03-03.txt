 Mr. Speaker, this week we will be passing H.R. 1, the  For the People Act, and the dark money interests are squealing loudly  about it right now.   H.R. 1, the For the People Act, requires exposure of the identities  of the people and companies that are the dark money that contribute  hundreds of millions of dollars toward American elections, including  Federal elections, in this country--people and companies that don't  have to reveal who they are, what they are about, what profits they are  trying to maximize, or even if they are from the United States of  America. They don't have to reveal any of that.   H.R. 1, the For the People Act, is to restore democracy to this  country, to restore pure democracy so that we know who is paying for  these elections. The dark money interests are squealing about it. They  are squealing like stuck pigs. Let's pass H.R. 1.                            ____________________
