 Mr. Speaker, after months of hard work and  collaboration, the China Task Force has released our final report,  which includes more than 400 solutions to counter the growing threat of  the Chinese Communist Party. This report is the framework for combating  the aggressive Chinese Communist regime.   After meeting with more than 130 experts, we developed realistic and  achievable solutions that take a comprehensive approach to  strengthening America's national security and holding the Chinese  Government accountable.   We realized that out of our 400 recommendations, 180 are legislative  solutions, of which 64 percent are bipartisan and one-third have  already passed either the House or the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, these are commonsense solutions that we can vote on  today to strengthen our strategic position for tomorrow.   As the only physician serving on the China Task Force, it was my  privilege to delve into opportunities to strengthen our supply chains  and ensure that Americans are never again beholden to the Chinese  Government for key medicines or healthcare supplies.    On the Health and Technology Subcommittee, I led efforts to  strengthen  [[Page H5110]]  the supply chains for medicines, semiconductors, and other vital  materials.   Congress has passed several provisions aimed at advancing research  and the manufacturing of critical medical supplies here in the United  States. We also created new reporting requirements to help us better  understand international supply chains and counter vulnerabilities in  the system.   To bolster our technology supply chain, I cosponsored H.R. 7178, the  CHIPS Act, to increase domestic production of advanced semiconductors,  which will help Americans to develop next-generation telecom  technology, fully automated systems, and, importantly, new weapons  systems.   I also introduced the ORE Act, H.R. 7812, to incentivize the domestic  production of rare earth materials, which is key to breaking the  Chinese monopoly on critical supply chains.   America cannot allow China to win the race to next-generation  technology. We want innovative breakthroughs to happen here in this  country, and the China Task Force is making progress through the  legislative process.   As a leader on the competitiveness committee, I focused on issues  ranging from combating Chinese Communist-sponsored theft of  intellectual property to exposing the influence of the Chinese in U.S.  research institutions and countering the importation of illicit  fentanyl.   Too often, American companies are being coerced to surrender  intellectual property to the Chinese Government in order to gain entry  into the Chinese marketplace. In extreme cases, we hear of outright  theft by Chinese hackers and agents. The China Task Force has produced  recommendations that direct the Federal Government to ramp up  investigations of individuals acting as pawns of the Chinese Communist  Party and enforce antitheft laws.   Our Nation has also seen wholesale efforts of the Chinese Government  to steal research and gain influence at United States universities. In  my own backyard, the FBI arrested a former Penn State researcher  suspected of espionage. The task force has compiled provisions to  increase transparency and accountability in the higher education  system, and I introduced legislation to close loopholes and force the  disclosure of all foreign money in our research systems.   Finally, we must stop illicit fentanyl from reaching our communities  and killing our neighbors. The China Task Force has produced  recommendations to stop the importation of these devastating analogues  from China.   In the House, I cosponsored legislation to hold foreign nations,  including China, accountable if they fail to cooperate with U.S.  narcotics control efforts and prosecute the production of fentanyl in  their countries. I thank Senator Toomey for championing this provision  in the Senate.   By implementing these solutions, we can make America safer, stronger,  and better equipped to lead in the 21st century.   The China Task Force final report is a framework. It is our playbook  to make a difference. While our work on this report has finished, our  commitment to this cause must and will continue. Phase two starts  today.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to  call up H.R. 8265 to extend the Paycheck Protection Program to keep  millions of employees on the payroll of America's small businesses.
