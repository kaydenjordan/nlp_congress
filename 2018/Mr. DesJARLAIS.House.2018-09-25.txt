 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs be discharged from further consideration  of the bill (H.R. 2634) to designate the Mental Health Residential  Rehabilitation Treatment Facility Expansion of the Department of  Veterans Affairs Alvin C. York Medical Center in Murfreesboro,  Tennessee, as the ``Sergeant John Toombs Residential Rehabilitation  Treatment Facility'', and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.
