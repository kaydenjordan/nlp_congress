 Mr. Speaker, every August, I  participate in a bus tour of South Carolina's Second District with my  wife, Roxanne, and dedicated staff from the Washington and district  offices, visiting schools, job-creating businesses, and chambers of  commerce.   An amazing stop this year was at Sorinex in Lexington. Sorinex is a  family-owned business that makes unique exercise equipment for  professional teams, national Olympic teams, colleges, high schools, and  the military. It is a classic example of a garage-originated business  that now produces equipment worldwide.   The founder of Sorinex, Richard ``Pops'' Sorin, took us around the  impressive facility. The beginning of the visit was a tour with a  historic collection of over 100 years of weightlifting equipment. Not  only does Sorinex create its custom equipment, but it also produces all  of its own branded apparel. I am grateful Lexington is the home of  their success.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Our sympathy to the family of Emily Clyburn and our prayers for  Congressman  Jim Clyburn and daughters Mignon, Jennifer, and Angela.                            ____________________
