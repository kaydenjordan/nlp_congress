 Mr. President, first of all, let me thank my friend the  Senator from New Jersey for his statement. I, too, share the belief  that there was a better way to go about this judicial nomination  process. I think as well that traditions such as a 60-vote margin  should be maintained.   I think, frankly, neither party comes to this issue completely with  clean hands, with the Democrats' action in 2013. But clearly our  colleagues' actions of not even giving someone of such character as  Merrick Garland the courtesy of meetings, a hearing, and then an up-or- down vote--for that and for many other reasons, I will be joining my  friend from New Jersey in voting against Judge Gorsuch and making sure  that we use all of our available tools. So I thank him for those  comments.                         Tribute to Federal Employees
