 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of all Granite  Staters to recognize the life and legacy of Elias ``Skip'' Ashooh who  passed away this week. He embodied the spirit of the Queen City and  left this world too soon.   As a lifelong Manchester resident and Saint Anselm College alum, Skip  dedicated his career and life to bettering his community. He was a  successful businessman, local leader, and philanthropist who never gave  up on the potential of Manchester and all its residents. He was a  community fixture who loved taking in the downtown area he helped  revitalize.   As chair of the Manchester Development Corporation, Skip was  instrumental in making the civic center project a reality, one of the  city's most consequential economic development projects since the  industrial revolution. His immense impact was known by all, which is  why he was named Citizen of the Year in 2000.   I hope we can honor Skip Ashooh's legacy by continuing to work  together to move Manchester and New Hampshire forward.   I offer condolences to his wife, Gail, the Ashooh family, friends,  and all who knew him.   May Skip's memory be eternal.                            ____________________
