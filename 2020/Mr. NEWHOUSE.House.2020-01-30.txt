 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and honor the  life and service of retired Yakima County Sheriff Brian Winter. Sheriff  Winter spent his life dedicated to serving his community and his  country.   After graduating from Central Washington University, he joined the  United States Marine Corps, where he served honorably in Operations  Desert Shield and Iraqi Freedom.   As Brian returned to central Washington and worked his way up in the  police force, he became known for prioritizing safety and security in  schools throughout the county, his ability to build lasting community  relationships, and creating meaningful connections with the Yakama  Nation.   Soon after being elected as sheriff, he was diagnosed with ALS.  Despite his condition, he was determined to serve his full 4-year term,  which he did.   Up until the day he passed away on January 25, 2020, Sheriff Winter  prioritized others before himself.   I urge my colleagues to join me in keeping his wife and children in  our prayers.   His legacy throughout the Yakima Valley will not be forgotten.                            ____________________
