 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his  leadership on this issue and for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, as we approach the 49th anniversary of the Supreme  Court's decision in Roe v. Wade my colleagues and I come together to  remember the more than 63 million children who have had their lives cut  short in this country since 1973.   I stand here today for the sake of the women, for the sake of the  children, and for the sake of the very future of our Nation.   Because of Roe v. Wade and the cases that followed its precedent, the  right of the unborn to be born is denied throughout our Nation more  than 2,000 times every single day, and in several States throughout all  9 months of pregnancy, which Roe permits.   This is a great stain on this great Nation.   We will not be silent here in Congress, nor will the hundreds of  millions of pro-life Americans across this country.   My colleagues and I will continue to stand for life and fight to end  the tragedy that is abortion.   We will remain steadfast supporters of life and serve as voices for  the voiceless and defenders of the defenseless.
