 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking  member for yielding and for her extraordinary efforts to protect  consumers by opposing this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong opposition to H.R. 3299. I don't  think that we should be doing anything to take away States' authority  to enforce their own usury laws, which make it illegal for lenders to  charge outrageously high interest rates on their residents.   This is a core consumer protection issue, and if we allow lenders  that aren't subject to the strict Federal regulations for banks to  circumvent State regulations too, then we are just throwing consumers  to the wolves, removing protections.   I know that some people have claimed that this bill would promote  innovation by allowing financial technology companies to better serve  lower income customers; but let's be clear. The only loans that would  be allowed by this bill that aren't already allowed are loans that  violate State usury laws that are put in place in States to protect  their consumers. Why in the world would we want to do that to people?   I am sorry, but there is nothing innovative about usury, and there is  nothing innovative about gouging low-income consumers with outrageous  interest rates. This is a terrible, terrible bill.   So this bill is not about innovation. It is about taking away  protections for consumers from predatory loans. Why in the world would  we want to do that to people?   I urge my colleagues, I urge them to protect consumers and to oppose  this bill.
