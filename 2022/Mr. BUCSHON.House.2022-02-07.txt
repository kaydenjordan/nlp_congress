 Mr. Speaker, I grew up about 20 miles from Springfield,  Illinois, and President Lincoln's boyhood home is in my congressional  district in Spencer County, Indiana. President Lincoln's birthday is  this Saturday, February 12, so I want to highlight some of his speeches  and recognize the enduring importance of his words.   First is his farewell speech to Springfield delivered February 11,  1861: ``My friends, no one, not in my situation, can appreciate my  feeling of sadness at this parting. To this place, and the kindness of  these people, I owe everything.   ``Here I have lived a quarter of a century and have passed from a  young to an old man. Here my children have been born and one is buried.   ``I now leave, not knowing when, or whether ever, I may return, with  a task before me greater than that which rested upon Washington.   ``Without the assistance of the Divine Being, who ever attended him,  I cannot succeed.   ``With that assistance, I cannot fail. Trusting in Him who can go  with me, and remain with you, and be everywhere for good, let us  confidently hope that all will yet be well.    ``To His care commending you, as I hope in your prayers you will  commend me, I bid you an affectionate farewell.''   Notice the importance of faith to President Lincoln in his farewell  speech to Springfield. I do believe the loss of faith amongst elected  officials has been detrimental to our country. It seems that we go out  of our way to eliminate any mention of faith in public life. This is a  mistake.   Next, Mr. Speaker, President Lincoln's address at Independence Hall  February 22, 1861, on George Washington's birthday: ``I am filled with  deep emotion at finding myself standing here, in this place, where were  collected together the wisdom, the patriotism, the devotion to  principle from which sprang the institutions under which we live.   ``You have kindly suggested to me that in my hands is the task of  restoring peace to the present distracted condition of the country. I  can say in return, Sir, that all the political sentiments I entertain  have been drawn, so far as I have been able to draw them, from the  sentiments which originated and were given to the world from this hall.   ``I have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the  sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence. I have often  pondered over the dangers which were incurred by the men who assembled  here and framed and adopted that Declaration of Independence.   ``I have pondered over the toils that were endured by the officers  and soldiers of the army who achieved that Independence.   ``I have often inquired of myself, what great principle or idea it  was that kept this Confederacy so long together.   ``It was not the mere matter of the separation of the Colonies from  the motherland; but that sentiment in the Declaration of Independence  which gave liberty, not alone to the people of this country, but, I  hope, to the world for all future time.   ``It was that which gave promise that in due time the weight would be  lifted from the shoulders of all men. This is a sentiment embodied in  that Declaration of Independence.   ``Now, my friends, can this country be saved upon that basis? If it  can, I will consider myself one of the happiest men in the world, if I  can help to save it. If it cannot be saved upon that principle, it will  be truly awful.   ``But, if this country cannot be saved without giving up that  principle, I was about to say I would rather be assassinated on this  spot than to surrender it.  [[Page H981]]    ``Now, in my view of the present aspect of affairs, there need be no  bloodshed and war. There is no necessity for it. I am not in favor of  such a course, and I may say, in advance, that there will be no  bloodshed unless it be forced upon the Government, and then it will be  compelled to act in self-defense.   ``My friends, this is wholly an unexpected speech, and I did not  expect to be called upon to say a word when I came here. I supposed it  was merely to do something toward raising the flag. I may, therefore,  have said something indiscreet. I have said nothing but what I am  willing to live by, and, if it be the pleasure of Almighty God, die  by.''   It is impossible to compare any situation we, as a Nation, are in  today with a battle between families, brothers, sisters, and Americans  that was the American Civil War. I am not attempting today in any way  to do so. With that being said, the words of President Lincoln in his  second inaugural address, which I am about ready to read, is an  inspiration, I think, and should be to all of us.   ``With malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the  right as God gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the  work we are in to bind up the Nation's wounds, to care for him who  shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all  which may achieve and cherish just and lasting peace amongst ourselves  and all nations.''                            ____________________
