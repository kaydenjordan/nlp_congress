 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act today.   At its core, reforming our Nation's Tax Code is about how we, the  policymakers, view the role of government in our economy and society.   Over the past 10 years, the American people have seen a stagnant  economy and a steady decline in labor force participation. Meanwhile,  the government has grown to an unprecedented level, the economy has  slowed, and our debt has nearly tripled. All the while, government has  given away sweetheart deals to select companies, leaving Main Street  job providers to hold the bag.   But all of that ends today. Today we reduce the burden on job  creators and families. Today we create an environment that will  generate real economic growth.   The conference committee report before us today is about our  constituents, about allowing our constituents and neighbors to keep  more of their hard-earned money. For starters, we double the standard  deduction, which means for joint filers, the first $24,000 of their  income is free from Federal income tax liability. That is real money  back in the pockets of working class families across America.   The plan expands the child tax credit to $2,000 per child to help  families with the cost of raising children. For students struggling  with debt, the bill preserves the student loan interest deduction and  graduate students will continue to receive tuition tax waivers tax  free.
