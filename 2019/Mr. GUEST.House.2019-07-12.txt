 Mr. Speaker, on Sunday, Mississippi lost a talented young  woman when she tragically died in an airplane accident.   Lake Little had accomplished a great deal in her lifetime. She was an  honors student, a skilled athlete, and a volunteer in her local  community.   Lake had a bright future. She held dreams of serving her country in  the United States Air Force and had already enlisted in the Mississippi  Air National Guard.   Mississippi is proud of the life that Lake lived, and we are grateful  for the positive impact she had in her community and on our State.   Today, Lake's friends, family, and community have gathered to  remember her and celebrate her life.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence on the House floor at this  time as we join Lake's loved ones in honoring her memory.                            ____________________
