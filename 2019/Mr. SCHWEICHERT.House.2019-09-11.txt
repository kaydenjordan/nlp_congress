 Mr. Speaker, just before we got back there was a  jobs report, and I know that it is going to be a little geeky, but I  wanted to go walk through some of those underlying numbers that lay in  there. And it's actually good news, the fact that there are really  terrific things happening in our economy.   But I still want to put it in context: I have been coming to this  microphone for quite a while now to say, What is the biggest issue we  as a society have?   If you think of my little girl that is going to turn 4 next month,  what is the biggest impairment to her economic future? And we are going  to walk through some of the math, but we are going to also walk through  some of the solutions, because it turns out it is demographics.   We always put up this slide to basically sort of point out that the  days of yesteryear, where Members would get behind these microphones  and say, Well, if we just raise the tax on this population, or if we  just do this entitlement reform over here, or we just do premium  support over here that the fact of the matter is that 30 years from  now, if you remove Social Security and Medicare from the budget, this  country is 20-some-trillion dollars cash positive. If you pull Social  Security and Medicare back into the math, we are $100 trillion upside  down. Mathematically, we just can't get there.   And so, if we actually care about keeping our promises to those, you  know, the 10,300 Americans that turn 65 every single day and start to  move into their benefits, we really need to get serious, because we are  already in a time--we don't tell the public this because it is hard. We  are not honest, I believe, with ourselves, but there is already things  Congress would desperately like to be doing, our constituents would  desperately like us to do that we are not doing because of the squeeze- out factor that is already happening because of our demographics.   There is this thing called baby boomers. I am one of them. And the  math to keep our promises basically takes away the resources that would  be doing other things. And they are promises, we have to keep them.   So how do you create the economic vitality, the labor force and all  those other things? And we are going to spend a little bit of time on  labor force today.   So just some points of reference. Every 5 years just the growth of  Social Security and Medicare healthcare entitlements, just the growth  portion equals the entire Defense Department. So if you came into the  office and said, ``David, tomorrow my solution for being able to keep  our promises in Medicare is let's just get rid of the Pentagon,'' you  only covered the growth portion of the spending for Social Security and  Medicare healthcare entitlements for 5 years. So then every 10 years,  two full Pentagons is just the growth. Ninety-one percent of the  spending increases that are basically slated for the next 10 years are  solely the growth in Social Security and Medicare.   Understand, it is math. It is not Republican or Democrat. And we have  lunacy around here. We have done this on the floor before, where we  walk through some of the solutions that are thrown out that are  completely make-believe. Well, if we just raised taxes on the rich and  do this, if we just raised this number, and you understand, the math  doesn't work. You are going to have to do something that is really hard  for a broken political system. And we are going to have to do something  that is big, complex, and actually holistic.   So one of the reasons we put this board up almost every time we are  behind this microphone is trying to say, We actually sort of have come  up with about five pillars, everything from, you know, one pillar being  tax policy, trade policy, regulatory policy to maximize economic  velocity, incentives to be in the labor force to maximize that, because  labor force participation is crucial.   Let's explain. After tax reform, the modelers kept coming back and  saying, We believe the headwinds for the economic growth are going to  be what they call capital stock, savings. Will the country have cash in  its banks and those things?   Well, we have already blown the wheels off or the charts off or  however you want to say it in everything from repatriated cash coming  back into the country which has been substantially greater than we have  ever expected. Foreign investments. But also, Americans have been  saving substantially more of the tax reform savings to them than we  actually modelled.   But it was labor force. And we are going to come back to that because  there is actually some really interesting, good news, but we have got  to get our heads around it, but the two headwinds were labor force and  capital stock.                                time  1830    We have proven capital stock is working in our favor, and all of a  sudden, we got a jobs report that looks like the labor force. This  violates all the smart people and the demographers who never thought  that, at this point in our demographic cycle, we would be hitting these  numbers.   Another thing we talk about is, how do we have population stability?  Immigration, family formation. Our birth  [[Page H7657]]  rates, now we are at functionally negative population growth if we look  at domestic birth rates. That is a real problem. If we are going to  redesign immigration, can we move to a talent-based immigration system  so it maximizes economic velocity?   Once again, you see a theme here. We must grow like crazy.   Other things: Can we put incentives into our earned entitlement  programs? When you earn your Social Security, you earn your Medicare,  could we build some incentives in there saying, if you are healthy and  feel of sharp mind, or if you want to be an entrepreneur, what can we  do as incentives to stay in the labor force, to continue that, because  we need you?   We have done some time on the floor where we have walked through  things that are happening in countries like Japan, where they are  desperately trying to get populations to stay or come back into the  labor force just for economic survival.   The one we have had the most fun with behind this microphone--and the  next slide will make some sense, and then we will go on to the labor  force issues--is that I believe we are in a time when technology may be  one of the things that saves us. We have done time on this floor where  we have walked through amazing technology that is about to do  stunningly great things for the environment.   We now have a couple of big experimental power plants that are  working outside of Houston where they are burning coal and natural gas  with no smokestack. They are collecting every bit of the  CO2.   We have proven that technology works. Now we have had a breakthrough  on being able to carbon mine the air. We have learned how to do a  couple things. There is a type of genetic engineering in certain food  stocks so your cow doesn't produce as much methane. Remember, twice as  much comes out of the mouth as--a bit of trivia.   It turns out, instead of just regulating and controlling and crushing  the very economic growth we must have to be able to keep our social  entitlement promises, let's embrace technology.   There is technology that is about to be a disruption in healthcare  costs. Our problem is that we have to legalize it.   Are you prepared to allow technology to write you a prescription if  we can demonstrate that the algorithms and the sensors and those things  are incredibly accurate? Are we prepared to work out some financing  mechanisms for these new biological drugs that are about to cure  diseases that are crushing to both individuals and families but also to  the economics of healthcare?   Remember, 5 percent of our brothers and sisters who have chronic  conditions are the majority of our healthcare expenditures.   Where is the excitement and optimism that there are a number of these  horrible, horrible afflictions that are about to be cured?   I have been up here and brought the charts and those things about  diseases like hemophilia. The fact is that we believe we are heading to  a single-shot cure. The 8,600--I believe that is the accurate number-- of our brothers and sisters who suffer hemophilia, which is a horribly  expensive disease, can be cured, but the drug is also really expensive.  For instance, are we prepared to think through how we finance cures, a  drug that stabilizes ALS but is going to be really expensive?   What happens when I can use technology on one end to keep us healthy  and technology on the other end to cure?   This has to be a radically different way to think about how we are  going to crush the price of healthcare than the insanity, the  mathematical insanity, that seems to be part of our public discourse  right now of, ``Well, let's just nationalize healthcare,'' because that  removes no costs. If you lay it out and look at the underlying math, it  doesn't save anything. It is just, once again, playing the game of  shifting.   Shifting things, like the debate we have had for the last 10 years  between Republicans and Democrats on who gets subsidized, who has to  pay, who should pay, and who gets subsidized, it is absurdity.   We now need to do those things that reduce the price or cure our  brothers and sisters who have these afflictions.   As we are walking through the math, and we went back and double- vetted this a couple of hours ago, and we talked about this before, if  you look at the next 30 years and remove Social Security and Medicare,  our country is $23.1 trillion cash positive. If you take Social  Security, Medicare, and their associated interest costs on the  borrowing, we are over $100 trillion negative.   If you look carefully, it is not Social Security. Social Security is  a big deal, but two-thirds-plus of it is Medicare.   We need to have a fixation on what we do as a society to crack the  cost of healthcare. That is why we are working on a piece of  legislation in our office to allow technology to be truly--think about  a Blockbuster video moment.   How many of us went to Blockbuster video last weekend? I know it is a  silly example, but it is a good one because didn't it feel like,  overnight, we used to go get those little silver disks, and now we go  home and hit a button?   We, as a society, engage in technology disruption all the time.   The problem with healthcare, similar to what we have in education, is  that we have so much government intrusion in it, so much government  regulation, so much trying to keep people safe. The ability to  have technology innovation that crashes the price--we have all seen  some of the new wearables and some of the things you can blow into that  look like they are going to diagnose everything from several types of  cancer to being able to tell if you have the flu. The algorithms  associated with that, if we can demonstrate they are highly accurate,  what should they be allowed to do?    That disruption is coming, but what do we do about this? We know what  is driving the debt and what is going to drive us off the rails.   Could I beg of us, as policymakers, to fixate on the revolution that  changes this cost curve? Instead, we will do absolutely ridiculous--my  father used to refer to it as the shiny object theory. It is, you could  have something that is incredibly important in your life, but if I can  come up with a shiny object over here and wave it around and, in this  case, get the press and others and maybe talk radio and maybe the cable  news, we will talk about the shiny object. We will go run over and  worry about that and deal with that, even though this over here is the  thing that is so critical to the survival of our society.   Let's talk about where we are having some success right now.   It was only a couple years ago--I remember it was the Joint Economic  Committee--we were sitting down with some demographers and researchers.  We were talking about the aging of America and how labor force  participation was going to crash. Because of that, we were going to see  a real headwind in our ability to grow as a society, as an economy.   Without growth, we are not going to have the revenues. We are not  going to have all those pillars that we talked about in the beginning  moving forward.   Last Friday, we got the unemployment numbers. Underneath it, there is  that thing called the U6 data where you start to dive into it and  understand what is really going on.   As we get ready to walk through these really positive things, I need  everybody to work with me on a concept. How do we have a society--and  let me grab my little notes here--that, all of a sudden, we have 163.4  million Americans working? We are now back above 63 percent labor force  participation. We are back up to, like, 63.2, which those very  researchers in that meeting a couple of years ago said by now we would  be maybe as low as in the high 50s, that the available labor was going  to crash.   You start to understand that there is a miracle happening in our  society because, to quote some of the folks recently, workers came out  of the woodwork this last month and have been entering the labor force.   The best way I can describe this is, remember a few years ago when we  used to come behind these microphones and talk about the real  unemployment data: Hey, I know they are saying we are only at 6 percent  unemployment, but if you add in all those people who are not looking  for work, discouraged workers, if I can use a pop-culture term from the  1980s, worn-out workers, the unemployment rate was 14, 16, 18 percent  of the society.  [[Page H7658]]    We have data that, last month, when they do the real unemployment  calculation, it is the lowest it has been in modern times. We are back  at 7 percent and ticking lower. The official unemployment rate stayed  at 3.7.   Work with me here. The official unemployment rate doesn't change, but  we know we had a few hundred thousand new entries into the labor force.  A big chunk of that was not being calculated in unemployment numbers  because they weren't even looking. Something happened in society where,  all of a sudden, folks who were underemployed, who had not been  looking, all of a sudden came back.   This is really, really important. I know it is geeky, but the math is  absolutely critical.   The other thing that was happening was, if you dug into that  unemployment report on Friday, if you take the last 3 months, all of a  sudden, wages and productivity have started to spike. If you analyze  the last 3 months, all of a sudden, wages are moving at about a 4.2  percent increase in a time with very low inflation.   We all remember our econ classes. What are the two things that make  an employer pay you more money? It was really simple. It was  productivity and inflation.   What happens if we are in a world where there is very little  inflation and, all of a sudden, we are paying people more? It turns out  maybe we have to add a little labor force squeeze, a society with more  jobs than available workers. All of a sudden, we get the spike of  productivity we see in the last 3 months. These are good things.   We have talked behind these microphones for years now about how  working men and women aren't getting ahead, that the actual real wages  have stayed flat for a couple of decades, except for substantially this  last year. We really should figure out what are we doing right and  continue to do more of it.   Look, it is math. Is it Republican math or Democratic math? It is  math, but something is working in our society where they are coming  back into the labor force.   Look, why isn't there joy in this place? Has our partisanship become  so dark that something that would be a conversation of joy, a 3.3  percent unemployment rate for adult women--this is close to the 1953  rate, and in 1953, it was a dramatically smaller population that was  looking.   How about a 5.5 percent African American unemployment rate, a record  low? Where's the joy? A 4.2 percent Hispanic American unemployment rate  has now tied the all-time record low. A 3.3 percent unemployment rate  for adult women, near the lowest rate since 1953. A 2.8 percent Asian  American unemployment rate, almost touching up against the record low.   If you want to take prime age, which there is a whole reason we  calculate that for productivity numbers, a 76.3 percent labor force  participation, the highest rate since February 2002, and an 80 percent  prime age, 25 to 54, employment rate for the first time since 2008.   There are other numbers in here.                                time  1845    You would actually think for a moment there would be some level of  joy of something is working in our society, where the very people we  walk around here claiming that we are fighting for and that we care  about is working. We just need to figure out what is working and do  more of it.   U.S. household income finally matches the 1999 peak, while the  poverty rate is at its lowest since 2001.   How many of you actually saw that discussed over this weekend and  over the last couple of days?   It is working. For the first time, most new working age hires in the  U.S. are people of color. It is working.   When I get up behind this mike and I keep trying to say we have these  five pillars that we need all of these cylinders to be clicking to be  able to grow the economy so we can generate the revenues, so we  actually have a fighting chance to keep our promises, that labor force  participation one is working right now.   Doesn't this body understand how powerful this is?   They will be out tomorrow, and it is always dangerous to guess, but  last month you saw the reality of what we call receipts, tax receipts.  Tax receipts so far this year are functionally 3.1 percent higher. They  have grown. They are the highest in U.S. history. And if you actually  use even what they call inflation adjusted dollars, it is the second  highest in history.   So the misinformation campaign saying, well, tax reform didn't--no,  tax reform is working. The revenue receipts are up.   If we could actually get some decent data on understanding social  needs, Social Security and disability, we know the numbers have fallen.  TANF needs have fallen. Many of these are no longer needing the U.S.  Government subsidies, our taxpayer dollars, because they are working  again.   Where is the joy? Yet why is the spending functionally up about 6\1/ 2\ percent?   Well, a big portion of that was displaced on what we call  discretionary, but a big portion of that growth is demographics. We  don't do a particularly honest job of showing in a chart saying, look,  this is on autopilot.   Every day, 10,300 Americans turn 65, they move into benefits, and we  have set aside not nearly enough resources to cover that. As a matter  of fact, the Medicare part A portion of the trust fund is gone in a  couple of years.   So as we walk through this--and this chart is almost impossible to  read and understand, but the trendline of African American women, of  Hispanics, of White workers, of African American men, of Hispanics and  others coming back into the labor force is a miracle. It is a  demonstration of our five-pillar proposal of how we grow, how we deal  with those healthcare costs that are the driver of the crushing debt  that is coming down upon us not tomorrow, but today.   One of the pillars is actually working right now. We have  demonstrated that sort of holistic theory that, when you get tax policy  right, regulatory policy right--could you imagine, when we finally get  ourselves and some of the trade issues all cleaned up, where we can go  economically?   But it is a demonstration that, economically, this affects what is  happening over here on people's ability to have the honor of work.   Mr. Speaker, I just desperately wish, when we have our debates--I  know we are always going to have those moments where we have to do the  shiny object because that is great politics, but the demographics and  over $100 trillion of debt being handed to my little girl over the next  three decades is a level of cruelty.   And it is not Republican or Democrat, it is math, could we ever get  our heads around the fact of doing those things that remove that  cruelty and make the next three decades for my little girl, for all of  us, one of the most amazing portions of American history.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
