 Madam President, before I speak on the topic that I came  to the floor to speak about, which is the resolution currently before  the Senate, I wanted to just echo the commentary made about our  colleague Senator Heller. I have enjoyed our time working together.   I spent 6 years of my childhood growing up in Las Vegas, so we have a  lot of mutual friends. He knows a lot of the people I grew up with and  is a part of our family. He will be sorely missed here. I am sure he  will be warmly welcomed back home to the community and to his family.  We all look forward to seeing the future endeavors lying ahead for him.  I know he still has much to offer the Nation and the State of Nevada.                                 S.J. Res. 54    Madam President, one of the things that makes service in the Senate  meaningful is when we get to discuss big issues of great importance. I  want to start by thanking the authors of this War Powers Resolution on  Yemen because, while I may not agree with it--and I am going to  describe why in a moment--I think it is important that the Senate have  big debates about big topics and play its rightful role. The Senate and  the legislative branch have an important role to play in setting the  foreign policy of the United States.   I actually don't think the War Powers Act is constitutional. I  believe it is an unconstitutional restraint on the power of the  Commander in Chief, and even if it were constitutional, I do not  believe that our engagement, or what we are doing in Yemen with the  Saudi UAE coalition, rises to a level of triggering it.   That doesn't mean that Congress should not be involved. Frankly, the  one way to be involved if you wanted to, if you wanted to pronounce  yourself on a matter of this topic, you should file to cut off the  money. I wouldn't support it, but that is where Congress's power really  comes from. Shut off the money; say that no money can be spent on this  effort. Few people are willing to do that, so we rely on these other  mechanisms that exist in our law.   But I want to talk more about why I think it is bad idea to vote for  this and why I hope more of my colleagues will join me in opposing it.   First of all, I understand what is happening. This resolution is not  new; it has been discussed before. It existed for a number of months,  well before Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi's brutal murder  at the Saudi consulate in Yemen. So this is not a new issue, but it has  become for many Members proxy--a vehicle by which they can express  displeasure at the way the administration and the President have  responded to the murder of Mr. Khashoggi.   I think what has happened to Mr. Khashoggi is an outrage. I don't  need a smoking gun or an intelligence briefing to tell me that the  Crown Prince is responsible.   If you know anything about Saudi Arabia, if you know anything about  how their government works, and if you know anything about the Crown  Prince, you know that there is no way that 17 guys close to him get on  an airplane, fly to a third country, chop up a guy in a consulate,  dispose of the body, and fly back, and he didn't know anything about  it. It is just not real.   It is also consistent with a pattern of behavior by the Crown Prince.  He literally kidnapped the Prime Minister of Lebanon about a year and a  half ago. He has jailed multiple members of his family and government  because they weren't in support of his being the successor to the King.  This is a pattern of behavior that needs to be dealt with. I do not  believe dealing with it requires us to shatter the Saudi-U.S. alliance.   Foreign policy is hard because it must be infused with our values and  [[Page S7539]]  the defense of human rights. And I say this with humility--I hold my  record up to that of anyone in this Chamber when it comes to fighting  on behalf of human rights and humanitarian causes, and we have a lot of  great champions of that in the U.S. Senate. But we also have to  recognize that this has to be balanced sometimes with realism, and it  requires us to make difficult decisions.   The interesting thing about foreign policy is that it is often not a  choice between a great idea and a bad idea; it is often a choice  between two less-than-ideal outcomes, and you are trying to figure out  which one would do the least harm and make the most sense. In many  ways, that is what we are facing here in this debate about the Saudi- U.S. alliance.   I have long recognized and condemned the horrifying human rights  violations that occur at a systemic level in Saudi Arabia, and I will  continue to do so. But I also recognize that there is a threat in the  Middle East posed by Iran and their ambitions that must be confronted,  and it must be confronted now, regionally, or eventually it will pull  the United States into direct conflict. Saudi Arabia and our alliance  is a key part of that coalition, so it would be a mistake to shatter  it.   In the case of Yemen, this has become a proxy issue for the broader  issue of the murder of Mr. Khashoggi. Hopefully later today, there will  be a resolution offered by the chairman of the Foreign Relations  Committee and the majority leader--I hope others will join in--that  makes very clear that the vast majority of Members in this Chamber  condemn what happened to Mr. Khashoggi and hold the Crown Prince  responsible for his murder.   There is no disputing that what is happening in Yemen is a horrifying  humanitarian tragedy. The numbers speak for themselves. Over 57,000  human beings have lost their lives. Half the country's population of 28  million people is starving to death, including many women and children,  and 2.3 million people have been displaced from their homes. It is  horrifying, and there is plenty of blame to go around, including Iran  and their Houthi surrogates.   The first question I would ask is, If this resolution passes and were  to become law, would it end this conflict? If we pass this and the  White House were somehow forced to do what we are asking them to do, it  wouldn't end this conflict. This conflict will continue, this fight  will continue, and the reason why is pretty straightforward: The Saudis  view the Houthis as agents of Iran. They already see agents of Iran via  Hezbollah, Syria, and Iraq obviously for a long time in Lebanon, and  now, to their west and south, Yemen. They are not just agents of Iran.  They have launched rockets and ballistic missiles into Saudi Arabia, at  their civilian populations, including efforts to kill members of the  Saudi royal family and government leadership. They have threatened  global shipping in the region, where over 400 million barrels of oil a  day transit--critical to the world's energy supplies. So they are going  to have a war. There is no way Saudi Arabia or the UAE or any of these  countries are going to allow themselves to be encircled by Iranian  agents.   This conflict will continue irrespective of what we do, and the  Saudis will have no problem buying weapons. One of the sad facts about  the world today is that countries have plenty of sources from which  they can buy this weaponry and plenty of countries and arms dealers who  are willing to sell it to them.   Will this resolution, if it passes, end the suffering? The answer,  sadly, is no, it will not. In fact, it is the Houthis who have blocked  the two access roads that lead to the port, making it difficult to  deliver aid. It is the Houthis who have placed mines at the entrance of  the port. It is the Houthis, by the way, who are torturing people-- torturing people. We have seen reports of faces being smashed by  batons, of people hanging from chains by their genitals and by their  wrists for weeks in places, people being scorched with acid. That is  the Houthis. That will continue.   Will this end the warfare? It will not. It will not end the warfare.  In fact, I think it has the potential to trigger broader warfare.    First of all, it won't end the warfare because right now they are  having peace talks. Put yourself in common sense for a moment, and ask  yourself: If you are the Houthis and you just read in the newspaper  that now the U.S. Senate has voted to end support for Saudi Arabia--do  you know what they are thinking? We don't need a peace deal; we might  be able to win this thing now. They don't know that it is not going to  become law, that the House is not going to take it up. They don't know  any of that. They just read that the United States is weakening in its  support of Saudi Arabia, and they think, we don't need a peace deal. It  is going to embolden them to not strike a peace deal.   But here is where I think it really gets dangerous. The United States  stops its support of Saudi Arabia. Houthis establish more control and  more stability in their control in areas of Yemen. What are they going  to do then? Are they then going to go and rebuild the country, build  roads and bridges, and move on to an era of prosperity and peace? They  are not. They are going to become what they are but in an expanded  way--agents of Iranian influence and of Iranian-sponsored violence.   Here is what you can expect to see if the Houthis establish control  of key areas of Yemen and are able to reach a stalemate or, worse, are  able to solidify their grip on power: You are going to see hundreds of  ballistic missiles launched against Saudi Arabia--missiles that, by the  way, in a contingency where there is a crisis between the United States  and Iran, would also be able to target American service men and women  serving in the region. You are going to see these explosive UAVs that  they have already used in attacking Saudi Arabia.   Do you know what Saudi Arabia is going to do in response? They are  going to hit them back even harder. In fact, they may even hit Iran,  triggering an even broader war. And it gets worse. It gets worse  because you can also see them using explosive boats and anti-ship  missiles to cut off shipping lanes in the Arabian Gulf. At that point,  you will see the U.S. Navy called upon to go in there and reopen  shipping because the global energy supply is relying upon it, and the  world looks to the United States as a guarantor of the freedom of the  seas.   In essence, this could very well lead, in the long run, to an even  broader and more dangerous conflict that could involve us and could  pull us in. That is the way we need to think about these issues--not  just what is before us now. You have to think two or three steps ahead,  and two or three steps ahead is that this could become a broader  conflict that forces us in.   Imagine it for a moment. We know for a fact that Iran's plans are to  use surrogates to attack the United States in instances of a crisis.  That is why these Shia militias in Iraq are so dangerous. At a moment's  notice, they could decide they are going to start attacking American  troops in Iraq, and Iran is going to say: It wasn't us; it was the Shia  militia. That is why Hezbollah in Syria is so dangerous. That is why  Lebanese Hezbollah is so dangerous. That is why they have cells all  over the world ready to be activated at a moment of crisis as an  asymmetrical way for Iran to attack the United States without direct  attribution. And now we are going to give them one more--the Houthis in  Yemen to target our service men and women and our allies in the region,  and then we will have to respond, and then we will be in a war  involving American service men and women.   Nothing we are doing now guarantees that won't happen anyway, but I  am telling you that if we pull out of this effort, it makes it likely.  I think it makes it likely that we will see a broader conflict in the  very near future that will directly involve the United States of  America.   On this final point, I will say that it is important for us to think  about these things pragmatically because we lose our influence over the  conduct of this war. The Saudi authorities and their military do not do  a good job of respecting the rules of war. In fact, they have a  military culture in Saudi Arabia where you are more likely to get  punished for not taking the shot than for blowing up a bus full of  children or hitting a residential project.  [[Page S7540]]  You are more likely to be punished for not taking the shot than for  taking the shot that kills innocents. That has to change, and we have  some level of influence now, given the fact that we are engaged with  them, to sort of steer them in that direction and explain to them what  troubles our alliance here in Washington. We lose that influence if we  walk away.   I do sympathize with the two points behind this resolution:  reasserting congressional authority on foreign policy--I agree we need  to have more oversight and engagement, and I agree that the conduct of  this war in Yemen is horrifying and that what is happening to civilians  there is terrible. I just don't think our pulling out makes it better.  I actually think it makes it worse, and I actually think that in the  long run, it sucks America into a much broader and more dangerous  conflict. That is why I hope more Senators here today will oppose this  resolution.   We do need to send a clear message to Saudi Arabia that what the  Crown Prince did to Mr. Khashoggi is unacceptable, but this is the  wrong way to do the right thing.   I yield the floor.
