 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of millions of our  Nation's teachers who fight for our children's future every single day.   Last year, tens of thousands of educators from Arizona helped lead  the Nation, walking out of their classrooms to protest cuts to schools  and funding. They told me about outdated textbooks, overcrowded  classrooms, and school supplies so limited that kids were taking tests  with crayons.   They succeeded in securing much-needed pay raises for teachers. But  the Arizona Legislature refused to provide sufficient money for support  staff, classroom supplies, and other resources they need to effectively  do their jobs. So, today, Arizona teachers and I are wearing red,  because the fight to ensure that every child receives a quality  education is not over.   Our students deserve better. They deserve fully funded schools with  state-of-the-art classrooms to ensure our kids have the skills they  need to succeed in a quickly changing world. They deserve the  challenges and opportunities that come from taking advanced placement  classes that promote academic achievement and extracurricular  activities to stimulate creativity and a passion for lifelong learning.  They deserve teachers, aides, administrative staff, and bus drivers who  are paid a fair and living wage.   Instead, the State continues to shortchange our children by asking  educators to do more with less.   Madam Speaker, I know firsthand the importance of properly funding  the public school system. I am a product of it. I would not have the  honor to stand here today and advocate for teachers on the floor of the  House of Representatives if it wasn't for the help and advice and  mentorship of one of my own high school teachers, Mr. Gustafson--or Mr.  G, as I called him--of Evergreen Park Community High School. He is just  one example of the many passionate, selfless educators who inspire  students every day.   That is why I stand today, tomorrow, and every day in solidarity with  America's teachers demanding more resources for educators and the young  people that they have dedicated their lives to.   Our Nation's future depends on it.                            ____________________
