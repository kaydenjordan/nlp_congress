 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  outstanding patriot and advocate for Tennessee veterans, James  Patterson of Columbia, Tennessee, who recently passed away.   James was a Vietnam veteran who earned medals for his service. He had  a 35-year career at Union Carbide, but locals know him best for his  many volunteer affiliations in life. He was the true embodiment of what  makes America great.   James was an American Legion commander and Legionnaire of the Year,  also a member of the Disabled American Veterans and Veterans of Foreign  Wars.   He was Maury County's veterans services director, and every week, as  sergeant at arms, he led the Pledge of Allegiance at Columbia's Rotary  Club.   James loved his country and loved, most of all, the men and women who  fight for it. My staff and I have worked with him often to help  Tennessee veterans receive the benefits and honors they deserve.   We were saddened to learn of his passing. The entire community lost a  friend.   My condolences to the Patterson family. Here in the Capitol and in my  home State of Tennessee, I will do my best to carry on James' work on  behalf of the brave men and women who risk their lives to defend the  United States of America. He set an example for all of us.   Thank you for your service, James.                            ____________________
