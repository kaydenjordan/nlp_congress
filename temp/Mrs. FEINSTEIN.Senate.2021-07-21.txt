 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the  bipartisan ``Protecting Access to Lifesaving Screenings Act,'' which  would protect access to annual mammograms by ensuring breast cancer  screenings are covered through insurance for women starting at age 40.   With the exception of skin cancers, breast cancer continues to be the  most common cancer in American women and second leading cause of cancer  death in women behind lung cancer. According to the American Cancer  Society, in 2021, about 281,550 new cases of invasive breast cancer  will be diagnosed in women and about 43,600 women will die from breast  cancer.   Fortunately, we're seeing the death rate for breast cancer go down  with a decrease of 1 percent per year from 2013 to 2018. According to  the American Cancer Society, this has been largely credited to earlier  diagnosis of breast cancer through screening and patient awareness, in  addition to improvements that have been achieved in breast cancer  treatments.   Mammography has been the best test we have at finding breast cancer  early, providing a better chance of survival after diagnosis. According  to the Kaiser Family Foundation, women with insurance coverage are more  likely to report having had a mammogram in the past two years compared  to uninsured women. But while regular breast cancer screenings have  helped tremendously in the early detection of breast cancer, health  insurance coverage of these screenings for women in their forties is at  risk.   While leading medical groups, including the American College of  Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Cancer Society, and the  American College of Radiology support women having no-cost access to  breast cancer screenings starting at age 40, the actual decision of  coverage is typically determined using recommendations by an  independent volunteer panel known as the U.S. Preventive Services Task  Force (USPSTF).   Unfortunately, when USPSTF updated its breast screening guidelines in  2015 to recommend that women should start mammography screenings at age  50, health coverage without cost sharing was put in jeopardy for women  in their 40s.   The ``Protecting Access to Lifesaving Screenings Act'' was first  introduced shortly thereafter to postpone these recommendations that  would have limited coverage for breast cancer screening. Congress has  subsequently acted to extend this moratorium several times since then,  most recently passing an extension in December 2020 that is set to  expire January 1, 2023.   The benefits of screenings are clear, and we need to ensure that  women in their forties continue to have coverage for, and access to,  these screenings. To that end, we are reintroducing the ``Protecting  Access to Lifesaving Screening Act'' to further protect access to  mammography screenings that are covered at no cost to patients ages 40- 49. If passed, the current moratorium on USPSTF breast cancer screening  guidelines would be extended through 2028.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the  total number of breast cancer screening tests received by women through  CDC's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program  declined by 87% during April 2020 as compared with the previous 5-year  averages for that month. This decline is attributed to reduced routine  medical visits due to COVID-19. Consequences of these prolonged delays  in screening include delayed diagnoses, poor health consequences, and  an increase in cancer disparities among women already experiencing  health inequities. Further removing barriers to screening by ensuring  patients are covered at no cost will be crucial as the public begins to  resume routine preventive health services.   I am honored to be joined by Senators Blackburn and Shaheen in  introducing this legislation. I am also very grateful for supporters of  this bill, including the American College of Obstetricians and  Gynecologists, American College of Radiology, American Women Unite for  Breast Cancer Screening, Black Women's Health Imperative, Breast Care  of Washington, Check for a Lump, DenseBreast-Info, FORCE: Facing Our  Risk of Cancer Empowered, Living Beyond Breast Cancer, Men Supporting  Women With Cancer, National Association of Nurse Practitioners in  Women's Health, National Black Nurses Association, National Consortium  of Breast Centers, National Hispanic Medical Association, National  Medical Association, Prevent Cancer Foundation, Servicewomen's Action  Network, Sharsheret, Society of Breast Imaging, Society of Breast  Imaging, Susan G. Komen and the Tigerlily Foundation.   I urge my colleagues to join us in protecting access to lifesaving  screenings by supporting the passage of this bill.   Thank you Mr. President, and I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Moran):   S. 2425. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to ensure the  provision of high-quality service through the Suicide Prevention  Lifeline, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions.
