 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1362 a  bill to name the Department of Veterans Affairs community-based  outpatient clinic in Pago Pago, American Samoa the Faleomavaega Eni  Fa'aua'a Hunkin VA Clinic. This is a fitting way to honor the life and  service of my good friend and colleague former Congressman Eni  Faleomavaega of American Samoa. During his 26 years of service in the  House of Representatives, Congressman Faleomavaega displayed unwavering  commitment to addressing a wide range of issues affecting veterans in  the Pacific. His focus on access to health care and veteran services in  remote areas of the Pacific ensured that veterans had access to the  critical resources and services they needed and deserved after serving  their country. His efforts directly contributed to increasing the  quality of life of veterans throughout the Pacific region. Naming the  VA facility in Pago Pago in his honor is a tribute to his service and  commitment to the veterans in the Pacific region.   Congressman Faleomavaega's compassion for veterans can be attributed  to his own service as an Army officer during the Vietnam conflict.  Serving in this capacity gave him firsthand knowledge of the sacrifices  servicemen make to protect our way of life.   I deeply miss Eni's advice, friendship and compassion for veterans.  His passing has created a void for all that have known him. On behalf  of the people of Guam, I extend my condolences to his family and the  people of American Samoa. Our lives are richer for knowing Eni. I also  extend my appreciation to Congresswoman Radewagen in putting forward  this legislation. It is a very appropriate way to memorialize an  important part of Eni's work on behalf of the people of American Samoa.   Un dangkulo na si Yu'os ma'ase (with deepest gratitude), Eni. You are  deeply missed.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        March 7, 2017, on page H1547, the following appeared: Ms.  BORDALLO.
