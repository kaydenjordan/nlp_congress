 Madam President, I rise today because my home State of  California is on fire. Nearly half a million acres have burned in the  last month by the Dixie Fire alone. That is more than 10 times the size  of the District of Columbia. It is larger in size than the city of Los  Angeles. Thousands of Californians have been forced to flee their homes  with only the clothes on their backs and the belongings they can carry  in their cars. Entire towns have burned to the ground. As of Sunday,  Dixie is the largest single-source fire in California's history.  California is not alone. The entire Western United States is on fire.   Colleagues, this morning, the IPCC, the world's foremost body of  climate scientists, presented a new report. I am hoping you have seen  it. There are 195 countries, including the United States, that have  agreed on every statement that it makes, and the verdict could not be  clearer: Climate change is happening, and we must act now.   As the report says, in more than 1,000 centuries, the Earth has never  seen a decade as hot as we have seen in the last 10 years. Scientists  can show that particular disasters are fueled by climate change. The  heat wave that is fueling fires, destroying crops, and sending areas  across California into drought--that is on us. Devastating floods from  Texas to Central Europe--those are on us.   We have pushed our planet to this point, and if we continue to stall,  the pace of recordbreaking catastrophe will only increase. This is  planet Earth's 10-alarm fire. Yet, my Republican colleagues pretend  that they can't see the smoke blowing across the country--smoke that is  visible from space.   But the good news is, we have a Democratic majority, and we know how  to fight this fire. If we race to zero out our carbon emissions, we can  slow the pace of climate change. We can even bring down temperatures by  the middle of the century. But our path to avert a catastrophic cycle  is narrowing by the day. We must act boldly and with urgency to tackle  this crisis head-on.  [[Page S6078]]    Across the country, across industries, and across the world, we need  to end our dependence on fossil fuels. We also need to aim high and  fully fund transformational infrastructure that will allow us not just  to survive this transition but to come out better than we were before.  On a zero-emissions schoolbus, students won't have to breathe dirty  air. In an economy rebuilt to meet this challenge, millions of  Americans will work in high-paying, sustainable jobs.   Sometimes, I have worried that we have grown numb to the idea of the  climate crisis. If we truly understood the meaning of those words, how  could we even contemplate business as usual? If my colleagues across  the aisle were to listen to scientists, how could a single one of them  argue that we need to spend less on climate?   As many of you know, my wife and I are raising three sons, trying to  raise three gentleman. Today, they are age 14, 8, and 6 years old. We  are trying to get them ready to go back to school. Protecting them and  giving them every opportunity to thrive is the cause of my lifetime.  But the IPCC report makes clear that we will blow through the 1.5  degrees of global warming by the year 2040--it is right here--no matter  what we do today.   Come 2040, my sons will be ages 33, 27, and 25. I think about what  their lives will be like at that stage--just starting their careers,  maybe starting their own families. What will their adulthood look like?   If we act now, we have a chance to turn the tide to begin the  planet's recovery as my children--my children--reach middle age. If we  fail, they will face a world of accelerating disasters; up to 4 degrees  of warming, the report says--4 degrees.   Now, as an engineer, I understand how deadly serious it is to upset  the delicate balance of our environment, but if 4 degrees does not  sound significant to you, just listen to the scientists warning of what  4 degrees of warming will create: global conflict over food, water, and  safe shelter; millions of climate refugees and desperate migrants.   Failure is not an option. I refuse to tell my boys that we knew what  to do but could not muster up the political will to act. I refuse to  leave to them a world where their lives are defined by climate disaster  and where they fear that every summer will bring the fire or drought or  storm that consumes their home. I refuse to leave that world for my  children or for anyone's children. That means time is of the essence.   Climate cannot be on the chopping block of any budget. It is  nonnegotiable. So let's rise to meet the challenge of our generation.  We cannot, we will not let our home burn.                            Budget Reconciliation    Madam President, on a different topic, I rise to speak today on the  budget resolution that will soon come before us and the opportunity  that it represents to finally provide a pathway to citizenship for  millions of our neighbors, friends, and family members.   I rise today on behalf of the people who are the subject of our  immigration debate and the immigrants who have lived and worked in  communities throughout the United States for years, sometimes decades,  while stuck in a limbo that Congress has created.   Our Nation depends on the labor of immigrants. There has been  bipartisan agreement on this for generations. But while our Nation  depends on the labor of immigrants, we do not provide the pathways to  citizenship that these individuals and their families have earned.  Today, we stand on the brink of a historic opportunity to adopt long  overdue reforms to our immigration system.   I rise to share just a few stories of the people on whom our Nation  depends and for whom we must act.   In May, I had the honor of welcoming Rose Tilus to testify before the  Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border  Safety, the Subcommittee which I chair.   Rose was born in Haiti but fled gang violence and political  instability at the age of 17. Alone, in an unfamiliar country, she  dreamed of becoming a nurse, but Rose's immigration status kept that  dream out of reach.   For 10 years, she sustained herself working as a housekeeper and as a  babysitter to make ends meet. But Rose's life changed in 2010, when a  devastating earthquake in Haiti allowed her to obtain a work permit  under a program called temporary protected status, or TPS.   Now, she seized this opportunity to return to school and fulfill her  dream of becoming a nurse and going out to serve and care for others in  nursing homes, in hospitals, in community health centers.   Now, while Rose's story is the story of the American dream, her legal  status in this country remains all too temporary.   Our Nation's economy has always depended on the dreams, the  dedication, and the contributions of immigrants. No State knows this  better than my home State of California, which also represents the  fifth largest economy in the world and which nearly a quarter of  America's immigrants call home.   Immigrants make up 27 percent of California's population, and, yes,  they are essential to our success in every industry, from farm workers  in the Central Valley to tech innovators in the Silicon Valley, to  construction and domestic workers throughout the State, and to nurses  and teachers, and more.   In fact, the COVID-19 pandemic has made us a country that relies even  more on the essential work of immigrants. More than 5 million  undocumented workers have held jobs that the Federal Government deems  essential during the pandemic.   TPS holders, like Rose, who care for our loved ones in hospitals and  nursing homes; DACA recipients, like Erika Henriquez, a medical  assistant who works helping to distribute COVID tests and lifesaving  vaccines; farm workers, like Vicente Reyes and his parents, who show up  to work every single day to keep grocery store shelves stocked and for  us to be able to put food on our table--as has been the case since the  founding of our Nation, immigrants are serving at the heart of the  American story.   An overwhelming bipartisan majority knows that people like Rose,  Erika, and Vicente have earned the right to live here without fear of  deportation. Seventy percent of Americans support creating a pathway to  citizenship for TPS holders, for Dreamers, and farm workers. That  includes a majority of Democrats and Republicans and Independents.   Colleagues, right now, we have an opportunity to provide stability  and security for the very workforce that the Department of Homeland  Security, beginning during the Trump administration, has deemed  essential to our Nation's economy and security. So as we write a  reconciliation bill to create an equitable and sustainable economic  recovery, we must include immigration reform. We have strong arguments  and precedent from this very body in our corner.   The logic is simple: Providing a pathway to citizenship is a direct  government action, not some carrot-and-stick approach involving private  businesses and private actors.   Newly eligible immigrants would pay fees directly to the U.S.  Government, as part of this direct government action, which would then  be processed by government employees. Every step of this process  involves direct government action and direct government revenues,  expenditures, and personnel.   And by expanding pathways to citizenship, we will grow our economy  and improve the workplaces for all. That is precisely the spirit and  the intent of the infrastructure investments that we are developing as  part of the budget reconciliation bill.   Research by the Center for American Progress shows that providing a  pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, TPS holders, farm workers, and all  essential workers will boost GDP by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. It  will raise wages for all American workers. It will create 400,000 new  jobs, and it will generate billions of dollars of spending and tax  revenue, fueling our economic recovery.   We have more than just an opportunity; we have an obligation to pass  meaningful immigration reform as part of the upcoming reconciliation  bill--for Rose; for Erika; for Vicente; for the millions of essential  workers and long-term residents who lack permanent status; for the  bipartisan majority of Americans who support reform for their immigrant  friends, families, and neighbors; and for every one of our  constituents, because all Americans will see the economic benefits of  immigration reform.  [[Page S6079]]    (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)         Madam President, we have more than an opportunity--we have       an obligation--to pass meaningful immigration reform as part       of the upcoming reconciliation bill.        For the millions of essential workers and long-term       residents who lack permanent status.

And for every one of our constituents--because all       Americans will see the economic benefits of immigration       reform.    I recently met with President Biden in the Oval Office to discuss  California's immigration needs. And I am so thankful for President  Biden and Vice President Harris's unequivocal support for including  immigration reforms in the budget reconciliation process.   As I said, we have an opportunity and a responsibility to bring  security to millions of federally recognized essential workers and  their families.   I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the essential work and  economic contributions of immigrants by opening the pathway to  citizenship and the American dream.   Thank you.   I now yield the floor.
