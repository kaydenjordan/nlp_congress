 Mr. Speaker, today I would like to honor the Fayette  High School marching band from my district for being selected to march  in Washington's upcoming Memorial Day Parade.   The Marching Falcons found out in the fall that they had been  selected to march in the parade, and their small community quickly  rallied around them to raise the money they needed to go. Tomorrow they  will board a bus, bright and early, to make the 14-hour drive here.   The band's director, Alex Kirby, told me the group has put in many  hours of practice. School has already let out for summer vacation, but  the dedicated band members still show up for practice 5 days a week,  even the seniors who have already graduated.   I am so proud of this marching band and the dedication the students  have shown in perfecting their music. I know that they will do a great  job.   Congratulations.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this en bloc  package.   Mr. Chairman, this package includes a bipartisan amendment to ensure  that video surveillance equipment is included in the scope of the  NDAA's prohibition on using certain Chinese technology in government  agencies.   China is actively expanding the role of its companies in the U.S.  domestic communications and public safety sectors. Video surveillance  and security equipment sold by Chinese companies exposes the U.S.  Government to significant vulnerabilities due to built-in backdoors  baked right into their products.   These backdoors can be used to covertly funnel data, including live  video and audio surveillance of America's sensitive military  installations and embassies, back to Chinese operatives.   Given what we know about China's intentions and the security risks  posed by these firms, we have absolutely no business helping China  extend its networks further and further into our agencies.   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Thornberry and Ranking Member  Smith for including this amendment in the package.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this  amendment. I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for bringing this  important issue into the forefront.   We need to face the reality that China is actively pursuing a whole- of-nation approach to gain global influence. This includes targeting  U.S. universities by exploiting our student visa program in order to  gain access and steal sensitive, proprietary, and classified  information.   According to DOD, in 2014, almost a quarter of foreign efforts to  steal sensitive information happened through academic institutions.  What is even more alarming is that, under Chinese law, citizens are  required to provide data, information, and technological support or  assistance to the Chinese Government upon request. This means that  China can intimidate and coerce its citizens to provide information.   The amendment offered today will ensure that this form of espionage  is thoroughly considered as we develop our whole-of-government China  strategy. I do support what the gentleman said that we need to go on  the offensive as well, but that doesn't mean we give up the defense,  and we need to be smart in that strategy as well. I urge my colleagues  to vote ``yes.''    Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the Transportation  and Infrastructure Committee as well as the House Judiciary Committee  for working with me and the Armed Services Committee to include an  important amendment in this bill that will expand DOD's ability to  interdict drones that pose a threat to certain military installations.   My amendment adds mobility airlift to the list of mission sets  permitted to use counter-drone technology. If a drone were to attack  the mobility mission, it could mean a reduction in our ability to  provide logistic support globally to joint and coalition warfighters.   Additionally, a drone attack on our mobility forces could prevent our  capacity to conduct global operations by severely limiting our ability  to conduct aerial refueling. This is a commonsense proposal necessary  to protect a critical aspect of our national defense.   I am delighted it is included in an en bloc package, and I want to  thank Representatives Garamendi, Hanabusa, Rosen, and Austin Scott for  cosponsoring this bipartisan amendment.
