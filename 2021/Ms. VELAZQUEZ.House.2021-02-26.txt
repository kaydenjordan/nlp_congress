 Madam Speaker, half a million lives lost, over 400,000  small businesses closed for good, 700,000 new unemployment claims filed  last week, 54 million are food insecure. This is a crisis the scope of  which none of us have seen in our lifetimes in this country.   The Federal Government has a responsibility to show up for the  American people, and that is exactly what President Joe Biden is doing,  to assure them that their struggles aren't theirs alone, that this  relief is coming, and we will get through this together.   As chairwoman of the House Small Business Committee, I am proud this  bill includes $50 billion to get our small businesses back on their  feet. We are providing targeted assistance for those hardest hit,  including grants for small entertainment businesses, cultural  institutions, and independent restaurants, plus an additional $15  billion for EIDL advances, and more for PPP. Let's pass this rule and  let's move forward.
