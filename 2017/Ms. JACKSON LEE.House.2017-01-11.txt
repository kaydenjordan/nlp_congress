 Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, January 11, 2017, I was  unavoidably detained attending to representation duties and was not  present for rollcall Votes 32 through 34. Had I been present, I would  have voted as follows: On rollcall 32, I would have voted ``no.'' On  rollcall 33, I would have voted ``no.'' On rollcall 34, I would have  voted ``aye.''                            ____________________
