 Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate the Voices of Freedom  choir at the University of Connecticut on their 50th anniversary.   Voices of Freedom is a unique ensemble of approximately 80 or more  students that provides personal elevation and enlightenment of the  gospel and spiritual music of the Black experience church.   Gospel music promotes a spirit of hope. Music has healing power, and  the existence of this choir on this campus at this time is more  important now than ever.   I also extend heartfelt congratulations to the Voices of Freedom not  only on celebrating 50 years of ministering through music at the  University of Connecticut, but a special congratulations to their  director, Reverend Lisa Clayton, who is celebrating 27 years leading  the choir. Reverend Lisa Clayton's steadfast leadership has been key to  the success and longevity of the Voices of Freedom Gospel Choir.   I thank them for all they do to elevate the importance of stories  through song.                            ____________________
