 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to Big  Pharma cheating taxpayers.   As pharmaceutical companies prepare to sell vaccines on the private  market, they are jacking up the price tag on our public health.   After tens of billions of dollars of sales, vaccine manufacturers  have floated commercial prices over four times higher than the price  currently paid by the government.   Taxpayers contributed to every aspect of these vaccines, from the  underlining science, to the clinical trials, to purchasing agreements,  but only the manufacturers will profit.   Just two vaccine manufacturers control 97 percent of the market. They  will not compete because they do not have to.   I have worked on legislation to prevent anticompetitive pricing in  consolidated markets, like vaccines. This is especially important for  products that our tax dollars paid for.   We cannot continue to ask taxpayers to help cover the risk, while  letting Big Pharma collude to reap the profits.                            ____________________
