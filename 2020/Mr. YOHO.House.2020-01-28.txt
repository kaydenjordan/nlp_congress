 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul and Mr. Phillips for  their leadership on this. Also, Mr. McGovern has been a strong leader  on this, and I appreciate it.   This is the way Congress should work. We come together on a common  goal; we get things passed; and it makes a significant difference.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4331, the Tibetan  Policy and Support Act of 2019.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative McGovern for his work on this  important and timely legislation, which would reauthorize the Tibetan  Policy Act of 2002 and reaffirm our commitment to the Tibetan people.   Since the 1950 invasion of the Chinese PLA forces, Tibet has been a  land of occupation and oppression. For too long, the Chinese Government  has utilized campaigns of aggression and intimidation in trying to  silence and bully its neighbor and territories.    In that regard, the people of Tibet have not been spared. The number  of displaced Tibetans number in the hundreds of thousands, with 110,000  taking refuge just in India alone.   I join my colleagues in Congress in reiterating our support for  Tibet, the Tibetan people, and the protection of their distinct  cultural identity.   I also believe that as one of Tibet's strongest partners, the U.S.  Congress should hear from Tibet's political and spiritual leaders,  which is why I introduced legislation last year to invite the Dalai  Lama to address a Joint Meeting of Congress via teleconference to  discuss the peaceful solutions to international conflicts.   Madam Speaker, this legislation has wide bipartisan support in the  House. To the people of Tibet, know that we support your fight against  adversity and for religious freedom.   This legislation makes it clear that the U.S. Congress will not sit  on the sidelines and watch as a spectator but, rather, advocate  strongly for increased protections for the Tibetan people.
