 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Hawaii for  yielding. I thank Chairman Grijalva for his work on this committee, and  I thank the ranking member even though we don't seem to agree on too  much about this bill.   I rise today in support of H.R. 729, which includes my bipartisan  bill to protect America's working waterfronts at a time when  environmental pressures and rapid development threaten their future.  More than 30,000 Mainers rely on marine-related industries for their  livelihoods. Yet out of 5,000 miles of coastline, just 20 miles of  workable waterfront remain in our State.   Coastal communities across the country are feeling that same squeeze.  Further reducing our usable coastline will adversely impact everything  from aquaculture and boatbuilding to coastal tourism and commercial  fishing.   My bill will help to reverse this disturbing nationwide trend of  shrinking waterfronts. It will protect jobs and preserve the character  of coastal communities. It establishes a working waterfronts grant  program and a 5-year loan fund pilot program for waterfront  preservation. It sets up a task force within the Department of Commerce  to identify and prioritize critical needs for the Nation's working  waterfronts.   Through the task force, the bill will also help communities identify  and mitigate the impacts of the climate crisis. At a time when 42  percent of Americans live in coastal communities, this task force is  not only a vital planning measure for today, it will support the  generations who will follow us.   For 8 years, House leadership on the other side stalled critical  initiatives like this one to address the climate crisis. The scope and  severity of this crisis require comprehensive action. Though my bill  addresses just one small piece, it will make all the difference for  communities in my State and across the country.   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of working waterfronts and  vote ``yes'' on this bill.
