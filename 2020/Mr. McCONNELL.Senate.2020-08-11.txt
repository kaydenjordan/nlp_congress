 Mr. President, there has been a lot of focus lately on  the drama here in Washington. For weeks now, as leading Democrats  blocked more pandemic relief over unrelated liberal demands, the press  has covered their stonewalling like any ordinary political standoff.  Who talked to whom? Who said what in which meeting? What new metaphor  did Speaker Pelosi use today to explain that she was blocking progress?  But it does the Nation a disservice to act like the last several weeks  were just another routine political standoff. It does struggling  families and laid-off workers and stressed-out school principals and  healthcare professionals a disservice to act like this has just been  more Washington gridlock.   The New York Times proclaimed a few days ago that ``[Speaker] Pelosi  is playing hardball on coronavirus relief.'' Well, that is one way to  put it. You could say it is ``playing hardball'' to refuse any outcome  for the country. You could say it is ``playing hardball'' to insist on  non-COVID-related liberal policy changes that the Speaker and the  Democratic leader know would never pass the Senate or be signed into  law by the President.   But if Democrats are ``playing hardball,'' their opponents aren't us  Republicans--not really.   They are playing hardball against kids, workers, and vulnerable  Americans who need help.   They are playing hardball against our medical system when the Speaker  and the Democratic leader say they won't allow another dime for  testing, treatments, or vaccines unless they can bring home a massive  tax cut for millionaires in San Francisco and New York City.   They are playing hardball against our Nation's ability to detect and  fight the virus.   They are playing hardball against science when the Speaker and the  Democratic leader say they will not allow another cent for schools to  reopen or for the job-saving PPP unless they get $1 trillion for a  State and local slush fund that is completely out of proportion to  actual needs.   They are playing hardball against children and parents when the  Speaker and the Democratic leader say they will not allow any  resolution on any issue unless Democrats can pay people more not to  work.   They are playing hardball against millions of households that ought  to get another stimulus check and against the ability of jobless people  to get any Federal benefit whatsoever.   There are life-and-death matters at stake, but Democrats have treated  this historic national crisis as a political game. Just look at the  redlines the Democratic leaders have drawn around these negotiations.  Imagine sitting down with a working family at their kitchen table and  explaining that these are the kinds of issues over which the Speaker  and the Democratic leader are refusing--refusing--to let them have  relief.   First, as I mentioned, the Democratic leader has made clear he  doesn't want any pandemic relief to become law unless--unless--it  carries a special State and local tax carve-out for high earners in  places like New York.   Just imagine these Democratic leaders from New York and San Francisco  going anywhere in the middle of the country and telling a working  family of four, earning $40,000 a year, that they aren't getting a  relief check that could increase their income by 10 percent until  millionaires in Manhattan get a tax cut.   Economists on all sides have panned this. A huge, costly tax cut for  wealthy people in blue States is not the life raft that struggling  people need. Even liberal economists have jumped ship. Here is what one  self-identified progressive told reporters: ``This is not a good idea.  . . . It would not help the economy heal and it would not benefit the  people who need help.'' These are the economists on their side? But  forget about the experts. Forget about laid-off people. Forget about  Middle America. The Speaker and the Democratic leader want to cut off  funding for our war with the coronavirus unless they get this special  carve-out.  [[Page S5386]]    Here is another one of those dead-on-arrival demands: Democrats  insist that working families, small businesses, and healthcare  providers will not get any more help unless a new trillion-dollar slush  fund for poorly managed States tags along. Bear in mind that States and  localities have only spent about a fourth--a fourth--of the money we  already sent them last spring.   Even Senate Democrats seem to acknowledge this, for example, by  sponsoring legislation that would extend the deadline for the States to  spend down their CARES Act aid. The States need extra time to spend  what we have already sent them, and the serious estimates of the COVID  shortfall that State and local governments may face are a fraction--a  fraction--of the Democrats' trillion-dollar demand. Their demands  aren't based on math. They aren't based on the pandemic. They want a  massive slush fund to make up for decades of mismanagement.   It is just how the Speaker explained her view of the crisis. This is  what she said:         This is an opportunity. Every crisis is.    That same opportunism leads them to another absurd demand. Democrats  say nobody should get any more help unless--unless--the Federal  Government sends out jobless benefits that pay more than what people  made working. Republicans support extending a Federal supplement for  unemployment--make no mistake about that--but we share the view of  Democrats like the House Democratic majority, the senior Senator from  Maryland, the Democratic Governor of Connecticut, all of whom indicated  it should be doable to land somewhere smarter than a flat $600.   This is not complicated. Both sides want to help unemployed people.  Republicans never wanted the Federal benefit to lapse to zero and tried  to extend the money. But as our economy tries to reopen, there is no  reason Uncle Sam should take taxes out of essential workers' paychecks  to pay other people more to stay home.   This is just a flavor of the Democratic demands. The two parties  should have been able to agree on a huge sweep of subjects--from  testing to school money, legal protection to direct payments and more.  Republicans wanted to reach an agreement everywhere we could and then  continue to fight over the contested questions later. Democrats said no  because they know their unrelated wish-list items would have no  prayer--no prayer--of standing on their own merit.   Only these hostage tactics could possibly get their bad ideas across  the finish line. So struggling people have waited and waited and gotten  nothing. That has been the Democrats' decision. Reporters can call it  ``hardball,'' like this was some ordinary standstill, but families are  suffering. Americans are dying. This is not a Washington game; it is a  national crisis. It would serve the Nation better if the Democratic  leaders would act like it is a crisis                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 11 a.m.,  Wednesday, August 12; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for  their use later in the day; finally, that following leader remarks, the  Senate be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 12:26 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, August 12, 2020, at 11 a.m.                            ____________________
