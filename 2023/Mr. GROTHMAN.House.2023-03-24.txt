 Mr. Speaker, I would like to call attention to a  disturbing trend that is going on in our colleges and universities.   We all know--or at least anybody on this side of the aisle--from  talking to college students, they feel there are certain things they  just can't say. It is going to cost them a grade. When you are dealing  with young professors, it is going to cost them tenure, and that is the  intolerance for conservative ideas or religious ideas in America's  universities.   Lately, we have had universities say they are not going to deal with  standardized tests anymore, the SAT, that sort of thing. It is another  way--and people have to remember this. It is fun not to take a test,  but it is another way to go after people who are at all conservative.   Right now, you can be as religious as you want, you can be as  Republican as you want, you can have a lifestyle that includes, for  example, hunting, and if you get a good SAT score, they have got to let  you in even though they don't want to, or they will let you in even  though they don't want to.  [[Page H1428]]    As we get rid of SAT scores, it opens things more to subjective  determinations, and the liberals who run our universities are going to  use those subjective determinations to keep our conservatives out of  the important universities in this country.                            ____________________
