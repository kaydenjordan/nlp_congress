 Madam Speaker, why should all Americans care about  free trade with Mexico and Canada?   We should care about the USMCA because just about every aspect of our  lives, the food on our table, the clothes on our backs, the fuel in our  cars, depends on free trade with Mexico and Canada.   We should care about USMCA because 14 million jobs across the Nation,  including the jobs of over half of my constituents in south Texas,  depend on free trade with Mexico and Canada.   We should care about USMCA because we live in a world where U.S.  military and economic dominance is no longer guaranteed, and a strong  North America is essential for us to remain competitive as China tries  to replace America as the most important economy in the world.   So let's get the USMCA to the President's desk so we can start  talking about increasing North American competitiveness in the rest of  the world.   I support this bill.
