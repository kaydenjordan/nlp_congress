 Madam Speaker, it appears that the Biden administration is  going to do everything it possibly can to destroy our economy and hurt  working-class people.   Headline in today's Washington Times: ``Biden piles up red tape after  Trump's trims: Long arm of regulation reaches businesses for vague  objectives.''   ``President Biden accelerated the regulatory state on his first day  in office by ordering agencies to consider aspirational but vaguely  defined goals and benefits when imposing new rules on businesses large  and small.   ``The order greenlighting regulations even when the benefits `are  difficult or impossible to quantify' sent shudders down the spines of  CEOs. They fear business growth will be smothered in pursuit of vague  objectives such as `human dignity' and `the interests of future  generations.'   `` `It is the most aggressive thing I have ever seen by an  administration,' said Doug Holtz-Eakin. `It is one thing to put out a  bunch of regulations, but this changes the way regulation is done. It  allows you to jam through any regulation you want regardless of the  impact [on] the private sector.' ''   We know we are having historic increased inflation and historic debt  levels and now regulations. It is a disaster coming.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3110.   This act puts overly burdensome, one-size-fits-all requirements on  businesses.   While I believe empowering women in the workplace is important, we  must not saddle businesses with rigid policies that will open them up  to legal action. We, instead, must support flexible policies that allow  women to thrive in the workplace.   This bill's flawed scheme and expansive mandate do more harm than  good and will further bog down businesses that are already struggling  to recover from the pandemic. During this difficult time, the last  thing small businesses need is more sweeping mandates.   More than 2 million women left the labor force in 2020. Now more than  ever, we need to advocate for flexible workplace policies that improve  conditions for, and empower, working mothers.   I fully support women who wish to enter and return to the workforce,  and I understand the challenges that can come with this, especially for  nursing mothers. Yet, I don't believe one-size-fits-all mandates are  beneficial, not for women and not for employers.   Workplaces are as varied as the people they employ. Putting every  workplace under the same standard, despite a job creator's needs or  ability to meet that standard, will ultimately be bad for the American  worker.   Airlines are just one example of an industry that will be negatively  impacted if this bill is signed into law. Under this bill's rigid  requirements, airlines may have to rethink plane designs or modify  aircraft to provide a private space, other than a bathroom, for nursing  mothers to pump, as required under the bill.   The rigid break requirements in the bill are also inappropriate for  airlines because flight crews have varying responsibilities in  preparation for and throughout flights, which ensure the safety and  security of passengers.   Exposing airlines and other businesses to such inflexible  requirements will hurt struggling businesses.   Further, not all nursing mothers have the same needs. Pretending that  they do might be convenient, but it also demonstrates ignorance about  the diverse circumstances that mothers are in.   I wholeheartedly believe that it is possible to provide women with a  healthy environment in which to work and simultaneously to allow  businesses flexibility in providing accommodations.   When I first entered the workforce, nursing-accommodation  requirements for women in the workplace were not even on the horizon.  Countless workplaces now provide such accommodations, and rightly so.  Current law provides accommodations for hourly workers.   Creating a healthy place for women to thrive is important to us all,  but there is a right way to go about this and a wrong way. H.R. 3110 is  the wrong way.   Most employers have their employees' best interests at heart, but  H.R. 3110 treats our job creators as if they are out to harm the very  women they depend on to keep their businesses running.   Again, this is the wrong way to go about empowering women in the  workplace.   This bill's excessive penalties, expansive mandate, and lack of  clarity will create a perfect storm for frivolous lawsuits. Unfounded  lawsuits cost businesses billions every year in the United States. We  should do all we can to prevent opening businesses up to harmful legal  action.   I would like to remind my colleagues that Representative Miller-Meeks  submitted her bill, the Supporting Working Mothers Act, to the Rules  Committee as an amendment to provide a commonsense alternative to the  PUMP Act.   That is a sensible amendment that meets the actual needs of nursing  mothers without forcing overly burdensome regulations on our job  creators.   That amendment, unlike the PUMP Act, expands access to nursing  accommodations in the workplace without  [[Page H5800]]  relying on punitive mandates that expose businessowners to costly  litigation.   The Supporting Working Mothers Act adds nursing-accommodation  coverage for white collar executive, administrative, or professional  employees, ensuring that over 80 percent of currently exempt women are  covered.   That amendment also includes a fair and workable process to ensure  accommodations are provided for nursing mothers by encouraging  collaboration between workers and employers to identify and make  improvements when accommodations are insufficient.   Representative Miller-Meeks' commonsense amendment serves nursing  mothers in the workforce without sacrificing the well-being of our job  creators. This is the right way to empower women.   I am extremely disappointed that the Democrat majority refused to  make the amendment in order. Democrats chose to stifle debate on this  commonsense approach to nursing accommodations in favor of a flawed  mandate.   Because the bill is impractical and overly punitive, I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 3110.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Mrs. Miller).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3110 leaves a whole host of unanswered questions  for employers regarding their obligations under the bill as written.  H.R. 3110 threatens job creators with disproportionate penalties for  technical or unintentional violations of the FLSA's accommodation  requirements.   For example, are employers required to build a separate room to  provide these accommodations?   H.R. 3110 fails to answer this question or the circumstances and  specifications an employer would need to know to comply with such a  requirement, or how such requirements would interact with other Federal  laws.   For instance, the bill does not clarify whether the space must be  compliant with Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, accessibility  requirements, or how it will fit in with the ADA requirements, such as  clear path of travel. Nor does the legislation give appropriate  guidance as to whether the space must be permanent or temporary. In  addition, the remedies in H.R. 3110 go far beyond what is recoverable  with respect to other proven wage-and-hour and break violations under  both Federal law and State laws.   The expansion of remedies in the bill will increase litigation and  result in a financial windfall for trial lawyers. But these penalties  do not address the employees' main interest in obtaining appropriate  break time and space. Expanded monetary damages will undoubtedly lead  to more litigation and the additional delays that litigation brings in  already overburdened courts. It also should be noted that the  Department of Labor is better suited to enforce technical violations of  the FLSA quickly and effectively; litigation is no solution.   DOL has institutional knowledge of Federal labor laws, including the  FLSA, and is equipped to provide accurate guidance to employers.   To understand the implications of H.R. 3110, one only needs to look  at the proliferation of lawsuits for ``gotcha'' technical violations  throughout various Federal and State wage-and-hour laws or the ADA to  recognize that costly litigation will follow and positive results for  employees will be delayed.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, supporters of H.R. 3110 claim the bill merely fills  unintended gaps in the nursing-accommodation requirements signed into  law in 2010, but this description is not accurate.   H.R. 3110 imposes a flawed scheme full of unreasonable expanded  mandates, including overly-broad coverage coupled with gratuitous and  disproportionate penalties. The bill expands the Fair Labor Standards  Act's coverage of break time for nursing mothers to all 143 million  employees covered by the act. As a result, H.R. 3110 will require one- size-fits-all nursing accommodations and impose substantial compliance  burdens on a wide variety of workplaces and industries.   Admitting this problem in the underlying bill, the manager's  amendment attempts to mitigate the bill's requirements so that they are  compatible with ensuring safety and security for airline passengers and  flight crews.   H.R. 3110 requires that airline employees have access to an enclosed  area for pumping breast milk, even though aircrafts designs are  regulated by the FAA for safety, security, and reliability, with  limited ability to add additional enclosed space. Remote and rural  airports also face unique challenges because of the smaller planes in  use at those airports. It is even more challenging to provide a private  space in a commercial aircraft other than a bathroom, as mandated by  H.R. 3110.   Additionally, many of these planes have small flight crews with few  redundancies in duties. Under the bill, they would be hard-pressed to  maintain appropriate staffing levels and access to services. Exposing  businesses to inflexible and unworkable requirements, coupled with  increased penalties for alleged violations, will clearly create new  incentives for trial lawyers.   H.R. 3110 will only encourage trial lawyers to file more lawsuits of  questionable validity targeting unsuspecting business owners.  Supporters of H.R. 3110 say the bill is about providing women with  better accommodations in the workplace, but the truth is the bill fails  to live up to that promise.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, consideration of H.R. 3110 marks the latest in a  series of affronts to small businesses perpetuated by House Democrats  throughout the 117th Congress. Last month, Democrat members of the  Committee on Education and Labor voted to increase drastically the  penalties on employers, including a 512 percent increase in  Occupational Safety and Health Act penalties and a whopping 900 percent  increase in Fair Labor Standards Act penalties on job creators,  including small businesses.   Democrats also voted to authorize the National Labor Relations Board  to levy $50,000 and $100,000 fines on small business owners for  business activities that are currently lawful.   Republican Members offered several amendments at the committee's  reconciliation markup to exempt small businesses from the devastating  impacts of those provisions. However, these commonsense amendments were  voted down by committee Democrats on party-line votes.   The bill we are debating today was reported out of committee with  disturbing implications for smaller employers. Currently under the  FLSA, businesses with fewer than 50 employees may demonstrate that the  FLSA's nursing-accommodation requirements would impose an undue  hardship. The FLSA's unique hardship provision is an affirmative  defense to claims that small businesses must demonstrate in court.   Committee Democrats chose to cut the undue hardship exemption in half  to fewer than 25 employees. While this Democrat affront to small  business was corrected in the manager's amendment, more changes are  necessary to protect small businesses fully.   H.R. 3110 imposes excessive penalties for minor or technical  violations of the FLSA's nursing-accommodation requirement, while  failing to anticipate workplace realities in providing accommodations.  These excessive penalties, combined with the high probability of minor  or unintended infractions related to compliance with a complex mandate  on hundreds of thousands of new businesses, will lead to a  proliferation of expensive and protracted lawsuits, resulting in  delayed accommodations for workers.   In contrast to the shortcomings of H.R. 3110, Dr. Miller-Meeks  submitted a responsible substitute amendment for consideration, which  implements commonsense and workable alterations to the FLSA's nursing- accommodation requirements. The Miller-Meeks' amendment adds nursing  accommodation coverage for white collar executive, administrative, or  professional employees while preserving FLSA treatment of unique and  disparate workplaces.   Her amendment also preserves the Secretary of Labor's FLSA  enforcement authority to address shortcomings in workplace  accommodations through injunctive relief or levy civil monetary  penalties against repeat and willful violators.   Dr. Miller-Meeks' amendment would not only ensure that the needs of  small businesses are protected, but would also update FLSA nursing- accommodation requirements in a way that meets the needs of both  mothers and employers.   It is disappointing and unfortunate that the Democrat leadership  prevented the Miller-Meeks' amendment from being considered today.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3110 is not the right way to empower women in the  workplace.   I support expanding flexible nursing accommodations in the workplace  for women, but not in such a way that will unnecessarily increase  liability for employers without helping nursing mothers.   Furthermore, this bill levels excessive penalties for minor technical  violations, opening our job creators to expensive and spurious  lawsuits.   Dr. Miller-Meeks' Supporting Working Mothers amendment is a  responsible alternative. It expands nursing accommodation coverage to a  variety of workplaces but also maintains exceptions for unique  workplaces.   That is the kind of flexible pro-woman and pro-jobs solution we need.  We have had enough of Democrats' one-size-fits-all approach and overly  broad mandates that hurt the very job creators we are relying on to  help our economy recover from this pandemic. It is very disappointing  that the majority denied debate on a practical alternative that will  meet the needs of working mothers.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 3110.  This bill would do much more harm than good. I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, this amendment does nothing to address the  shortcomings of H.R. 3110. We do not need a GAO report to know that  employers will face numerous challenges in complying with the sweeping  requirements imposed by H.R. 3110.   The Fair Labor Standards Act ensures that hourly workers have access  to time and space to pump breast milk, while exempting certain  professions and industries with unique operating environments.   Working mothers deserve proper accommodations to nurse in a clean and  safe environment without fear of losing their jobs, but failing to  account for differing workplaces, as H.R. 3110 does, is not the way to  help women.   The bill imposes one-size-fits-all treatment on a wide variety of  businesses and industries without providing feasible compliance  options.   H.R. 3110 would also impose new and excessive penalties for minor or  technical violations of the FLSA's nursing accommodation requirement.  These unrealistic penalties, combined with compliance challenges  resulting from the bill's mandate, will lead to a proliferation of  costly and protracted lawsuits. The result will be delayed  accommodations for workers.   A report which acknowledges the complexities and liabilities inherent  in H.R. 3110 and is released 2 years after the bill takes effect will  do nothing to mitigate the bill's failures.   Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose the  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I have  the right to close.    Madam Speaker, we have a unique situation here this morning  with two Representatives from North Carolina who have totally different  opinions of this bill and this amendment.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill. We  can do better. And I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the  amendment; it is a day late and a dollar short. We should know what  these things are in advance and not after the fact. It is what some of  us might call a run-on amendment. We should have had the GAO study  earlier to get a better feel for what this bill would do to working  mothers and to businesses in our country.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3110 exposes a sweeping, one-size-fits-all  mandate on businesses of all sizes that is unworkable and unreasonable.  The bill treats all nursing mothers and workplaces as if they are the  same, despite known differences in employees' needs, industry-specific  challenges, and employers' abilities to meet the requirements.   This amendment calls for a Government Accountability Office study on  racial disparities with respect to access to workplace accommodations  to pump breast milk and for GAO to submit recommendations to Congress-- after the bill becomes law.   Madam Speaker, let me be clear, crystal clear. I abhor any type of  discrimination. There should be no place for discrimination in our  country, in our employment, or anywhere.   A study of this kind, however, should have been commissioned before  the committee debated far-reaching legislation to impose a flawed  mandate on all businesses in the United States. Instead, H.R. 3110 was  rushed to a committee markup within 2 weeks of introduction. Democrats  often put the cart before the horse, and this amendment does nothing to  remedy the shortcomings of this legislation.   Nursing women are not a monolith. They have unique needs that this  legislation ignores. H.R. 3110 is reductive and, working women deserve  better.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, let me reiterate again: I have no tolerance  whatsoever for any type of discrimination in the workplace or anyplace  else. However, if we are going to do a study about potential  discrimination, it should be done before a bill is drafted, introduced,  and voted on.   This amendment does not improve the very bad underlying bill, H.R.  3110. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the amendment,  vote ``no'' on the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
