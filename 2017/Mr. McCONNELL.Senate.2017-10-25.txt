 Mr. President, Senate Republicans had a productive  discussion with President Trump yesterday about our shared agenda. We  were particularly focused on how to bring tax relief, economic growth,  and jobs to the middle class through tax reform.   It is clear we share a lot of the same goals. It is clear we are  united in an effort to take more money out of Washington's pockets and  put more in middle-class pockets. It is also clear we are all excited  about this once-in-a-generation opportunity to get America going again  and growing again.   So we are watching our friends in the House with anticipation as they  consider the comprehensive, responsible budget that cleared the Senate  last week. We anticipate they will pass it by the end of the week. Once  they do, we will have important legislative tools to move tax reform  forward. That is something everyone can look forward to. More  importantly, that is something the American people deserve, especially  after so many years of an economy that failed to reach its potential-- an economy that, so often, failed them.   Tax reform represents the single most important thing we can do today  to get the economy reaching for its full potential. We are looking  forward to taking the next steps very soon to get it done.   Mr. President, on another matter, I would like to again commend  President Trump for the outstanding judicial nominees he has sent us  this year. So far, every nominee we have brought to the floor has been  confirmed by a majority vote in the Senate. In some cases, those  majority votes have been bipartisan and massive, like 95 to 1, like 97  to 0. Yet almost every time a judicial nominee is brought to the  floor--even nominees with votes like these, nominees whom both parties  support--Democrats throw up partisan procedural roadblocks. For what  reason? Certainly, it is not to change the outcome. No. Like I said, in  many cases, Democrats actually support the nominees. They are just  wasting more of the Senate's time because they can. They are doing it  again now. Let's take the two judicial nominees who are currently  before the Senate.   First, there is Scott Palk. After nearly two decades as a State and  Federal  [[Page S6778]]  prosecutor, Mr. Palk has the legal skill and community support to excel  as a U.S. district judge for the Western District of Oklahoma. The  Senate Judiciary Committee approved his nomination by a large,  bipartisan vote of 17 to 3.   Then there is Trevor McFadden. Mr. McFadden's sterling record of  public service makes him an ideal candidate for the U.S. District Court  for the District of Columbia. Not a single Member--not one--of either  party opposed him.   These nominees should have sailed to confirmation yesterday. Instead,  Democrats are forcing us to waste time so we can again arrive at the  exact same conclusion, but simply later this week.   This really has to stop.   In President Obama's first year in office, Republicans forced this  procedural hurdle for a single judicial nominee, and it was a  controversial one.   Let me say that again. In President Obama's first year in office,  Republicans forced the procedural hurdle we have had to endure many  times for one nominee, and that nominee was controversial.   In President Trump's first year in office, Democrats have forced this  procedural hurdle for every single judicial nominee except one, even if  they actually supported him or her in the end. This is just the kind of  partisan game that Americans are so sick of.   President Trump should be commended for his strong judicial picks.  The Senate is going to keep working hard to confirm them, and we are  going to succeed. The only question is whether the Democrats are going  to keep wasting more of the Senate's time getting there. I hope they  won't. I hope they will end these pointless games so that the Senate  can keep its time and focus where it belongs.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I thank my friend from Illinois.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
