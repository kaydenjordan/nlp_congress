 Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and  Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes statutory  limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to  those limits. In addition, sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to  establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels  consistent with those adjustments.   The Senate recently considered three measures that were signed into  law to combat the coronavirus. These measures, the Family First  Coronavirus Response Act, P.L. 116-127; the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and  Economic Security Act, P.L. 116-136; and the Paycheck Protection  Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, P.L. 116-139, provided  supplemental emergency appropriations to support activities related to  public health and response to the coronavirus that qualify for cap  adjustments under section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of BBEDCA.   The Family First Coronavirus Response Act included emergency  appropriations totaling $82 million in revised security budget  authority and $2,389 million in revised nonsecurity budget authority.  The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, estimates that these  appropriations will result in $843 million in outlays in fiscal year  2020.   The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act included  emergency appropriations totaling $10,525 million in revised security  budget authority and $319,158 million in revised nonsecurity budget  authority. CBO estimates that these appropriations will result in  $98,789 million in outlays in fiscal year 2020.   The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act  included emergency appropriations totaling $162,100 million in revised  nonsecurity budget authority. CBO estimates that these appropriations  will result in $113,132 million in outlays in fiscal year 2020.   As a result of the emergency designations, I am revising the budget  authority and outlay allocations to the Committee on Appropriations by  increasing revised security budget authority by $10,607 million,  revised nonsecurity budget authority by $483,647 million and outlays by  $212,764 million in fiscal year 2020. Further, I am increasing the  budgetary aggregate for fiscal year 2020 by $494,072 million in budget  authority and $212,655 million in outlays.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      REVISION TO BUDGETARY AGGREGATES (Pursuant to Sections 311 and 314(a) of the  Congressional Budget Act of                                   1974)                              ($ in millions) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                  2020 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority.......................................    3,824,732     Outlays................................................    3,734,450 Adjustments:     Budget Authority.......................................      494,072     Outlays................................................      212,655 Revised Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority.......................................    4,318,804     Outlays................................................    3,947,105 ------------------------------------------------------------------------    REVISION TO SPENDING ALLOCATION TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR                             FISCAL YEAR 2020 (Pursuant to Sections 302 and 314(a) of the  Congressional Budget Act of                                   1974)                              ($ in millions) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                  2020 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Allocation:     Revised Security Discretionary Budget Authority........      746,000     Revised Nonsecurity Category Discretionary Budget            662,748      Authority.............................................

Today, I rise to  submit the required filing to fulfill that instruction.   Specifically, section 205 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019  requires the chairman to file: (1) allocations for fiscal year 2021 for  the Committee on Appropriations; (2) allocations for fiscal years 2021,  2021 through 2025, and 2021 through 2030 for committees other than the  Committee on Appropriations; (3) aggregate spending levels for fiscal  year 2021; (4) aggregate revenue levels for fiscal year 2021, 2021  through 2025, and 2021 through 2030; and (5) aggregate levels of  outlays and revenue for fiscal years 2021, 2021 through 2025, and 2021  through 2030 for Social Security.   The figures included in this filing are consistent with the  discretionary spending limits set forth in the Bipartisan Budget Act of  2019 and the Congressional Budget Office's March 2020 baseline, as  adjusted to reflect legislation enacted since the publication of the  baseline. Enforceable figures in this filing exclude the direct  budgetary effects of provisions in legislation enacted after the  release of the baseline that were designated as an emergency pursuant  to section 4112 of the fiscal year 2018 congressional budget  resolution, H.Con.Res. 71, 115th Congress, which excludes those effects  from calculations related to sections 302 and 311 of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974. In instances where enforceable discretionary levels  are required to be adjusted for spending designated as an emergency  pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act,  those adjustments are included.   In addition to the update for enforceable limits above, section 205  of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 allows for the deficit-neutral  reserve funds included in title III of the fiscal year 2018  congressional budget resolution to be updated by 3 fiscal years.  Pursuant to this authority, all deficit-neutral reserve funds in the  aforementioned title of the fiscal year 2018 congressional budget  resolution are updated and available for use.   For purposes of enforcing the Senate's, pay-as-you-go rule, which is  found in section 4106 of the fiscal year 2018 congressional budget  resolution, I am resetting the Senate's scorecard to zero for all  fiscal years.   All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables detailing  enforcement in the Senate be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:             ALLOCATION OF SPENDING AUTHORITY TO SENATE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021 (Pursuant to Section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and Section 205 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of                                                       2019)                                                  ($ in billions) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                              Budget authority       Outlays ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Appropriations:     Revised Security Category Discretionary Budget Authority \1\..........            671.500                n/a     Revised Nonsecurity Category Discretionary Budget Authority \1\.......            626.500                n/a     General Purpose Outlays \1\...........................................                n/a          1,584.277 Memo:     Subtotal..............................................................          1,298.000          1,584.277     On-budget.............................................................          1,292.349          1,578.566     Off-budget............................................................              5.651              5.711     Mandatory.............................................................          1,175.792         1,155.439 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ The allocation will be adjusted following the reporting of bills, offering of amendments, or submission of   conference reports that qualify for adjustments to the discretionary spending limits as outlined in section   251 (b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (BBEDCA). The outlay figures included   in this table reflect enactment of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (P.L. 116-127), the Coronavirus   Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (P.L. 116-136), the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care   Enhancement Act (P.L. 116-139), which generated $178,246 million in outlays from appropriations that were   designated as emergencies pursuant to section 251 (b)(2)(A)(i) of BBEDCA.
