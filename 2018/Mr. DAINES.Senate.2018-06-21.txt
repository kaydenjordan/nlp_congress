 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Tiffany and Waide Satre of Sweet Grass County for the years  of hard work they put in to grow Thirsty Turtle Burgers & BBQ and serve  their local community.   Tiffany and Waide opened the Thirsty Turtle Burgers & BBQ in February  of 2011. What started as a bar quickly grew with a kitchen and now  operates as a full-service restaurant. The restaurant has continued to  grow, turning it into a community staple.   Tiffany and Waide built both their marriage and their restaurant  around each other, and that partnership has fostered growth within the  business. Together, they employ around 20 people, including their son  Shadow, who is a cook in the restaurant. While their leadership  provides the vision behind the restaurant, Tiffany and Waide believe  the restaurant would not be where it is without the hard work and  dedication of their employees.   While Tiffany and Waide appreciate the business from visitors in the  summer months, they rely on their Big Timber regulars to carry them  through the off-season. It is this sense of community that has cemented  the success of the Thirsty Turtle Burgers & BBQ.   I congratulate Tiffany and Waide on the success of their business and  their impact on the greater Sweet Grass County. I look forward to my  next visit to the Thirsty Turtle Burgers & BBQ.                            ____________________
