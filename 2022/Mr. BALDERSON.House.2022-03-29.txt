 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  [[Page H3924]]    I rise in support of the Don Young Coast Guard Authorization Act,  which ensures that the dedicated men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard  are adequately trained and equipped to fulfill their critical mission  of securing America's coastlines.   It has been an honor for me, as a 3-year Member of Congress, to serve  alongside Don Young and always sit behind him and hear him.
