 Mr. Speaker, I am here today to thank the American  Legion Post 469 of Longport, south Jersey, for their work to honor our  wounded veterans and their families with their annual Wounded Warrior  Week in south Jersey.   During the week, the Legion hosts a wounded warrior and their family  with an all-expenses-paid vacation to south Jersey that includes a  parade with a police escort and numerous preplanned outings that  include: fishing trips, days at the beach, and nights on the famous  Ocean City, New Jersey, boardwalk.   All of this is a celebration that brings together the south Jersey  community to honor our heroes in the military and to display the  gratitude the citizens of the United States have for the many  sacrifices of our soldiers and the many sacrifices that they make.   I thank the American Legion Post 469 for their continuous efforts to  uplift our heroes in the Armed Forces and for having a positive impact  on the south Jersey community.   I also thank Joseph Hahn for being a hero and thank the wonderful  community that has hosted this year after year. And may God bless them  and may God bless our heroes.                            ____________________
