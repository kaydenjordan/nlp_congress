 Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the  nomination of Colin Kahl to serve as Undersecretary of Defense for  Policy.   Our Nation needs leaders at the Department of Defense who are not  driven by a partisan agenda and are committed to making sure our troops  have all the resources and support they need to succeed. We need  leaders who understand that our adversaries are regimes like those in  Communist China and Iran and that our friends are countries like Israel  and its partners in the Middle East. That is not Dr. Kahl. I have grave  concerns about Dr. Kahl's lack of support for one of our great allies,  Israel, weakness toward Communist China and desire to rejoin the  disastrous Iran Deal.   The Undersecretary of Defense for Policy serves as the Defense  Secretary's top national security adviser, a position that requires  sound judgement and an even temperament. Dr. Kahl's history of partisan  rhetoric makes him unfit for this position.   For all these reasons, I oppose Mr. Kahl's nomination and urge my  colleagues to do the same.
