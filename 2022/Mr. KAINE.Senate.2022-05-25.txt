 Mr. President, I rise to just share candid emotions about  yesterday's tragic shooting of schoolchildren who were 2 days from the  end of the school year in Texas--19 deaths of little ones and 2  teachers and others injured. This is rough. I don't have any notes  because I am really emotional about it. These shootings kind of give me  PTSD, I have to admit.   I was the mayor of Richmond, and our city had the second highest  homicide rate in the United States. At a much younger period of my  life, I found myself going to too many funerals, to too many wakes, to  maybe the most memorable crime scenes, then also to homicide victims'  family support group meetings in church basements in my city.   Then I got to be the Governor of Virginia. In April of 2007, my wife  and I landed in Japan while leading a trade mission, and we went to a  hotel and immediately got a phone call saying that there was a shooting  underway on the campus of Virginia Tech University and that I should  turn on CNN, which I did, in Japan.   As I saw the events unfold, I said: Take us right back to the  airport.   We had flown 14 hours. We were in the hotel for about an hour but  went right back to the airport and flew all the way back home to what  was the worst day of my life in trying to comfort 32 family members who  had lost kids or their spouses who were faculty members--and that  process went on for years--in the days right after the horrible tragedy  but then commissioning a study about what went wrong and then trying to  find an appropriate settlement with these families that would honor  their loved ones.   I had to deal with State police officers--hardened, hardened law  enforcement veterans--who walked into the classrooms at Virginia Tech,  to find carnage and on each body a cell phone ringing because a parent  had seen it on television and wanted to call to make sure it wasn't one  of their children who had been killed. My law enforcement officers  talked about how those rings that would never be answered just haunted  them, haunted them.   So when there are these shootings at a school, at a nightclub, at a  concert, in a grocery store, in a church, in a synagogue, I feel like I  am back in April of 2007, experiencing those emotions for the first  time.   I was analyzing my own emotions for the first time last night. Why  have I not been able to reach a point of more--I don't know--emotional  equilibrium about this after 15 years? I realized that the reason was  that my emotional reaction that is kind of a PTSD thing is not just  because of the shootings, not just because of the deaths, not just  because of the promising lives cut short; it is compounded by a  realization that, here in this body, we have done nothing.   It would be bad enough to experience the violence and be reminded of  that most painful time in my life, but to experience it as a U.S.  Senator, as a Member of a body, and to say, ``Well, what have we done?  We didn't do anything at the Federal level after Virginia Tech, and we  didn't do anything after Pulse, and we didn't do anything after Las  Vegas, and we didn't do anything after Sandy Hook, and we didn't do  anything after one tragedy after the next,'' then that compounds in  some ways, and that is the thing that makes the emotional reaction a  reaction that is as fresh today as it was in April of 2007. It is a  wound that can't heal until we do something to heal the injury, to heal  the problem.   I was thinking about this last night, and I was trying to, you know,  think, what is some wisdom that I can derive to make me feel less down  and less despondent? And I just thought of two things that I wanted to  share. One is a spiritual insight, and the other is a practical reason  not to lose hope.   So, as a spiritual insight, a few years ago, Pope Francis was kicking  off a yearlong effort to encourage the revitalization of parish life-- not the life of the big, universal church but the life of parishes. He  challenged parishes, but this challenge could go for people, and it  certainly could go for political leaders. He challenged parishes to be  (statement made in Spanish) ``islands of mercy in the midst of a sea of  indifference,'' and I thought, what an interesting challenge.   The thing about that challenge that I thought was so beautiful and a  little bit unexpected is he didn't counterpose mercy to evil or mercy  to cruelty or mercy to hatred; he contrasted mercy with indifference-- with indifference.   There is evil in the world, and there is hatred in the world, and  there is cruelty in the world. Yet usually those forces are not strong  enough to succeed for very long unless--unless--there is widespread  indifference. We are challenged not to be indifferent.   If we assess why the Senate, this great deliberative body, has been  unwilling to act for 15 years, I don't think it is cruelty or evil; it  is indifference. It is the very thing that Pope Francis was warning us  to avoid.   We should be merciful. We should not be indifferent. Evil doesn't  thrive for very long absent indifference. Yet, despite what we often  say after tragedies like this, with our thoughts and our prayers and  our sincere emotions, if we don't demonstrate by more than just words  that we are touched by these tragedies, then we are committing the sin  of indifference.   I hope very much that the tragedy of these little children's deaths  may push us out of the indifference that we have been sunk in at least  on this issue. I really hope that it will.   Then, finally, there is a practical reason I am not going to give up  hope that it will. I mentioned that I was the mayor of Richmond,  dealing with a homicide problem, and that I was the Governor during  what was at the time the worst mass shooting in the history of the  United States. Sadly, it has been eclipsed. The Virginia Tech shooting  is no longer the most tragic shooting in history. Others have eclipsed  it in terms of the numbers of those killed.    I felt that same despair then, and I threw myself into trying to make  changes. I made the changes in the Virginia laws that I could make as  the Governor by executive action, but there are some things I couldn't  do by executive action. I needed the support of my legislature to do a  comprehensive background check bill because, in the case of the  Virginia Tech shooting, Seung-Hui Cho, the disturbed 19-year-old who  committed that crime, was legally barred from owning a weapon, but  weaknesses in the background check system didn't catch that, and he was  able to get the weapons that led to that carnage.   I couldn't get my legislature, even in the aftermath of the worst  shooting in the history of the United States, to be willing to take  action, but we never gave up. We kept pushing. We kept pushing in  Virginia, the headquarters' State of the National Rifle Association. We  kept pushing and pushing and pushing, and in 2019, 12 years after the  tragedy at Virginia Tech, my legislature passed a set of commonsense  gun safety rules: one handgun a month, a ban on certain kinds of  weapons that nobody needs, a comprehensive background check, mental  health support--a series of initiatives. My legislature did pass it in  2019, and my State is safer as a result, but 12 years was a  [[Page S2689]]  long time to wait. There were a lot of tragedies that happened between  2007 and 2019.   Thank God for the Virginia Tech family members and for the other  advocates who said: We will wait. We are not going away. We are  patient. We are discouraged. Each loss we feel afresh, but we are not  stopping until we make that happen.   In my first months in the Senate, we voted on the floor on a  comprehensive background check bill. I think that was the last time we  had a meaningful debate about gun safety policy on the floor of this  body--9 years ago. It is like there is a gag rule here. You know, it  used to be, in Congress, you were not allowed to have debate or to vote  about issues dealing with slavery during the 1830s. It is like we have  a gag rule about debating gun safety on the floor of this body.   But I remember voting that day, and it was on the anniversary of the  shooting at Virginia Tech that we voted on a bipartisan background  check bill in this body in 2013. The Sandy Hook families were sitting  in the Galleries, and many of the Virginia Tech families had come up to  join them to offer them support. I was reminded of the Scripture and  the letter of Paul to the Hebrews being surrounded by a great cloud of  witnesses. And here we were on the floor, trying to respond to this  tragedy and do something to ease their grief, and we fell a couple of  vote shorts. We couldn't get to 60. I think we had 57 votes that day  for a background check bill. That was painful. It was painful. It was  especially painful to fall short in the view of all of these grieving  family members.   But I draw hope from this. If we can make progress on this issue in  Virginia--the headquarters of the NRA--we can make it in the U.S.  Senate. It may not happen as quickly as I want, and it may not happen  while I am still here to see it, but there is no reason to give up. If  we can do this in Virginia, we can do this in the U.S. Senate, and we  ought to. There is nothing we can do to bring back the lives of these  young people, but if we can act to decrease the chance that this will  ever happen again, they will at least have the ability to grab on and  say: Our advocacy made a difference, and kids who go to school will be  safer in the future.   This is the last thing I will say, and I will sit down. I was walking  around the building this morning, and because I am fluent in Spanish  and people around here know it--a lot of the Capitol staffers are  Latinos, and they talk to me in Spanish--I passed by a longtime Capitol  staffer who said in Spanish: Senator, what is going on? What is going  on with this country?   I said: I know what you are asking me about, and it is such a  tragedy.   Then she said this to me. She is from El Salvador. She said: My  country is a mess, and the violence is awful, and the homicide rate is  unacceptable, but no children in schools feel unsafe. No people going  to church services feel unsafe. What is going on, Senator?   I didn't have a good answer for her. I didn't have a good answer for  her.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the Food and Drug Administration's ``Purple  Book'' provides patients, providers, and public health experts with key  information about FDA-licensed biological products. Providers rely on  accurate and up-to-date information from this searchable online  database to make crucial decisions regarding the treatment of their  patients. The ``Purple Book'' provides transparency on the availability  of biological products. This can help inform public health decision- making and increase competition among manufacturers to lower prices.  Improvements to the ``Purple Book'' clarifying when biological products  leave the market would allow the FDA and the public to monitor the  availability of these key medications.   That is why I am proud to join my colleagues, Senators Marshall,  Hassan, and Cassidy, in introducing the Biologics Market Transparency  Act, legislation that would extend to biological products certain  reporting and transparency requirements that already exist for small  molecule drugs. This is the Senate companion to legislation introduced  by Representatives Kathy Manning and Richard Hudson in the House. It  would require manufacturers of biological products to confirm that  their products listed in the ``Purple Book'' are available for sale.  This bill would also require manufacturers to report to the Secretary  of Health and Human Services when their products are withdrawn from the  market. These updates to the ``Purple Book'' would provide patients and  providers with real-time access to changes in drug availability,  allowing physicians to make informed decisions about the best treatment  for their patients. These changes would also improve the ability of the  FDA to respond to and anticipate drug shortages.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass these  commonsense reforms to strengthen public health and increase  transparency for patients and providers.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Ms. Collins):   S. 4303. A bill to provide for a period of exclusivity for first  interchangeable biological products; to the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. President, biologics, or complex large molecule drugs  typically derived from living organisms, play a critical role in our  healthcare system, treating a range of conditions such as diabetes,  arthritis, and cancer. Yet spending on these products accounts for an  alarming and significant portion of overall drug spending in the United  States. In 2018, biologics accounted for 40 percent of spending on all  prescription drugs, with spending on biologics growing twice as quickly  as overall drug spending since 2015.   Biosimilars are drugs that are highly similar to existing biologics,  and interchangeable biosimilars are biosimilars that can be substituted  for a biologic product without the intervention of a healthcare  provider. Biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars can play a  significant role in reducing drug spending. For example, Medicare Part  D spending for both beneficiaries and the program is less than spending  on reference biologic products even as the use of biosimilars increases  with increased availability. As of April 2022, there were 33 biosimilar  products on the market including interchangeable  [[Page S2710]]  biosimilar products. Food and Drug Administration, FDA, approval of  additional interchangeable biosimilars could provide patients with more  treatment options, increase competition, and lower costs. We must take  steps to provide clarity around the FDA's review process for  interchangeable biosimilars to facilitate development of these  products, bringing them to market faster.   That is why I am proud to join my colleague, Senator Collins, in  introducing the Interchangeable Biologics Clarity Act, legislation that  would make key improvements in the FDA's review process for  interchangeable biosimilars. Specifically, this bill would clarify the  FDA's authority to tentatively approve a second or third  interchangeable before the end of the first interchangeable's  exclusivity period, allowing additional products to enter the market  more efficiently when that exclusivity period ends. This legislation  would also specify that two interchangeable biologics approved on the  same day could share an exclusivity period. These provisions would  allow the FDA to issue additional guidance around the review of  interchangeable biologic products and ensure increased transparency  about the exclusivity periods for interchangeable products.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass these important  improvements to the FDA's biosimilar review process that will increase  patients' treatment options and help foster competition.                            ____________________     Mr. President, biologics, or complex large molecule drugs  typically derived from living organisms, play a critical role in our  healthcare system, treating a range of conditions such as diabetes,  arthritis, and cancer.
