 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Federal Government has become too big and  too expensive, and it has been this way for quite a long time. It is  not without its impact. It has been borrowing and  [[Page S423]]  spending far too much money and doing too many things even before the  COVID-19 global pandemic, but this emergency has really shown how badly  we need to return to some semblance of federalism, some semblance of  Federal restraint with respect to what it does and particularly what it  spends.   I say this because emergencies, national emergencies, will arise from  time to time. It happens. And when those things happen from time to  time, the Federal Government will need to expend some significant  resources and borrow money. That is exactly why we should not be  running multitrillion-dollar deficits at the top of the business cycle  to begin with.   During a period of significant economic expansion, not a recession,  we were already spending more than we had. It makes it much harder for  us to respond, be nimble, and do the things we need to do. This has  been a long-term problem because Washington, DC, has been centralizing  political power and political decision making now for generations. It  has not made the Federal Government more effective but, rather, weaker  and less effective. It has made it slower, less nimble, more rigid, and  inflexible.   We need to start turning policy in the other direction, localizing  more decisions so all Americans in red States and in blue States alike,  regardless of where they live, can live under policies that they are  more likely to agree with. That is the beauty of federalism. It allows  more Americans to have access to more of the kind of government they  want and less of the kind of government they don't want.   That is the goal of the budget resolution amendments that I will be  introducing this week. I will be introducing a number of amendments,  and I will cite a few examples here.   First, I am going to propose an amendment to ensure that Congress's  voice and the voices of our State governments are heard in the  designation of national monuments.   Utah has been home to two significant, massive national monument  designations over the last 25 years. One thing they both had in common  was they were made contrary to the expressed will of local and  statewide elected officials and Utah's congressional delegation at the  time they were made.   These two monument designations in and of themselves are larger than  two Delawares. Yet they were made without any input from Congress and  without any input from the host State's legislature. The Antiquities  Act currently allows this to happen. My amendment would propose that we  allow the people's elected representatives in Congress and the affected  State legislature to have input.   I will also be filing an amendment to ensure full funding for a  program known as PILT. PILT is an acronym; it stands for payment in  lieu of taxes. It is something very important to public land States  like mine.   You see, the Federal Government doesn't pay property tax on land that  it owns. In a State like mine where the Federal Government owns most of  the land--two-thirds of it, in fact--it can be very difficult for many  of our communities to survive because without that property tax  revenue, they find it difficult to fund everything from schools to  search and rescue operations, police and fire services, and so forth.   The Federal Government makes up for some of this through this payment  program that is supposed to in some ways replicate the property taxes  that the taxing authority would otherwise receive, and they call it  payment in lieu of taxes. The problem is, they haven't accurately  assessed the value of the land. My amendment would call for a more  accurate assessment of the land so that these taxing jurisdictions can  get what they need.   I will also be proposing a significant amendment to increase access  of the American people to health savings account systems. HSAs, health  savings accounts, do nothing to undermine the efficacy or the  prominence of government-run healthcare systems. They do, however, do a  lot of good for those who have them. They simply add a private option  for American families who would like to make some of their own  decisions about how they would like to spend their healthcare dollars.  If they would like to spend more on nutritional supplements, they  should be able to do that. If they would like to spend more on  preventive care, they should be able to do that. HSAs give them the  answer, and one of my amendments would expand their opportunities.   I will be offering an amendment to streamline the regulations under  the environmental law known as NEPA, the National Environmental Policy  Act. NEPA has achieved significant environmental gains in this country,  but it needs to be updated and modernized so as to make i easier for us  to complete infrastructure and construction projects, which have become  too slow and too expensive.    I have a number of other amendments, including one that would  increase the child tax credit significantly in order to further  diminish a little-known but pernicious aspect of our Federal Tax Code  known as the parent tax penalty.   I will be introducing another amendment to increase the recognition  and the credit that Americans receive for making charitable  contributions--especially important during a global pandemic like this  one.   I have another amendment protecting Americans' Second Amendment  rights, one protecting religious freedom, and one dealing with gasoline  tax, which I don't think should be increased, especially during  difficult times like these and especially given the regressive nature  of the fuel tax.   I have another amendment dealing with some legislation I have  developed called the PROMISE Act. This would help to make sure that  interactive online providers--entities including but not limited to  social media platforms--make clear what their standards are, what they  will be doing to moderate speech on their platforms, for example, how  they will be enforced, and gives them incentive, with possible  penalties under law if they deceive their customers about what their  policies are and how they will be enforced.   The bottom line here is that the Federal Government's size has not  been making it stronger or more nimble or more effective; its size and  its bureaucracy have undermined its work, from our COVID response to  our entitlement crisis, to our dysfunctional welfare system, which,  while intended to alleviate poverty and make it rare, has instead  sometimes made it longer lasting.   Reform doesn't mean just doing the same exact things but spending a  little bit less; it means modernizing and streamlining processes and  devolving, where appropriate, certain government functions to State and  local governments that are closer and more accountable to the people.   The way we serve the American people is not just by letting  bureaucrats and politicians make decisions for them thousands of miles  away in Washington, DC. The way we achieve true, effective government  and fair government is by giving all Americans up and down the income  scale and across the political spectrum the power to make their own  decisions and to make them as locally as possible.   Thank you.    Mr. President.    Mr. President, with due respect to the majority leader, I  understand what he is suggesting. But the Senator from Utah has made a  motion which has absolutely nothing to do with the number of votes that  we are going to be taking tonight.   Look, 365 days a year, we are told, as individual Senators, to wait  our turn; we will get to vote on whatever we want to vote on if and  when we vote on them. This is the one time, with budget vote-arama,  where anybody can ask for a vote on anything.   Now, I don't see anything wrong with the Senator from Utah's request  that we limit the amount of time it takes to vote to the amount of time  it takes to call the roll and then to add to that any additional time  that might be taken up by waiting for the Vice President in the event  of a tie.   So I would like to resuggest what the Senator from Utah has asked.  That is, I ask unanimous consent that we so limit the amount of time we  take to vote to the time it takes to call the roll, subject to the need  to wait for Vice President Harris to come and break any tie.    Madam President, I call up my amendment numbered 821 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Madam President, the right to live by faith--any faith of  our choosing or no faith at all, if we choose--is part of what defines  us and allows us to live out our lives in dignity and respect. It is  also what makes for a well-ordered society. It provides relief for  those who are suffering.   Members of our communities, citizens of our country, were able to  live out their lives with religious freedom prior to the pandemic. With  the pandemic and the corresponding growth of government, we have seen  some of those rights threatened and infringed.   I introduce this amendment for the simple purpose of making sure that  we, as the Senate, have the ability to protect the religious freedom of  all Americans, even when--especially when--government is growing as a  result of a crisis.   I urge each of my colleagues to support this and, with it, freedom of  religion.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 15 seconds to  respond.    Madam President, there is absolutely nothing in this  amendment and absolutely nothing about the suggestion that we ought to  respect religious freedom that suggests what my friend and colleague  from Illinois has just suggested.   It is offensive to the cause of religious freedom. It is contrary to  the Supreme Court's ruling in Employment Division v. Smith and the  Religious Freedom Restoration Act. It is contrary to the Constitution  for people to sue religious orders, forcing nuns to purchase  contraceptive coverage.    I ask for the yeas and nays and demand a vote on religious  freedom.    I call up my amendment No. 770 and ask that it be reported  by number.    Mr. President, the Biden administration has taken early and  sweeping steps to halt oil and gas leasing on Federal public lands.  This, in addition to being dangerous to our Nation's energy security,  also presents a very significant economic threat to the stability of  communities, especially in public-land States like mine, where most of  our energy is found, where their economies are going to be shut down.   This amendment would allow the budget numbers to reflect ongoing  lease revenues that would go to the States and to the Federal  Government. We need this, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 253 and ask that  it be reported by number.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Utah [Mr. Lee], for himself and others,       proposes an amendment numbered 253.    The amendment is as follows:     (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to                     expanding health savings accounts)         At the end of title III, add the following:       SEC. 3___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND RELATING TO EXPANDING                     HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS.         The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate       may revise the allocations of a committee or committees,       aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this resolution,       and make adjustments to the pay-as-you-go ledger, for one or       more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, amendments between       the Houses, motions, or conference reports relating to       expanding health savings accounts by the amounts provided in       such legislation for those purposes, provided that such       legislation would not increase the deficit over either the       period of the total of fiscal years 2021 through 2025 or the       period of the total of fiscal years 2021 through 2030.    Mr. President, health savings accounts are good for the  American people. They increase the availability that families have--the  access that families have to healthcare. They make it more affordable,  and they also bring about competition in healthcare, which tends to  bring up quality and also bring down cost. That is good for everyone.   Now, the expansion of the use of health savings accounts could be  encouraged by allowing any health insurance plan to be considered HSA  eligible, by increasing the maximum HSA contributions, and by allowing  for more preventive and health maintenance expenses to be covered,  including the use of dietary supplements and nutritional supplements.  This would not directly affect ObamaCare, and expanding HSAs would  simply give Americans more opportunities and would bring down cost  while increasing the quality of the healthcare they receive.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    I call for the yeas and nays.
