 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, I want first to recognize the hard work of my colleague  from Connecticut, Congressman   Joe Courtney, on the underlying bill  and for making workplace safety a priority.   Workplace violence is a serious problem and occurs more often than we  may realize. According to the Occupational Safety and Health  Administration, incidents of serious workplace violence were 12 times  higher among healthcare and social service workers, and 70 percent of  nonfatal workplace assaults occurred in the healthcare and social  assistance sectors.   Nurses, physicians, emergency responders, medical assistance, and  social workers care for our families in our times of need, and violence  against them has reached epidemic proportions.   The range of patients, clients, and demands these workers encounter  on any given day can expose them to occupational risks with little  training on what they should do if those interactions turn violent.   With uneven Federal enforcement, States are leading the way to  address this issue, establishing a process for recording, responding  to, and tracking incidents of workplace violence and requiring regular  workplace violence prevention training.   Similarly, the underlying bill addresses training needs for employees  who may be exposed to workplace violence, hazards, and risks. However,  each situation is not always the same. Not all circumstances and  patients are the same. We must adjust our training to reflect all  communities and situations that professionals may face on the job.   My amendment ensures additional training for employees who work with  victims of torture, human trafficking, and domestic violence. As a  result of trauma, many survivors develop emotional and mental health  problems that require timely, comprehensive, and compassionate  treatment, even if the situation involved physical or psychological  assaults.                                time  1100    These factors necessitate a different approach from our medical  professionals and must be a part of workplace violence trainings,  particularly in healthcare settings.   Proper training on best practices like de-escalation can help ensure  the safety of both the patient and the healthcare worker. In doing so,  we can prevent further trauma that could be detrimental to the  survivors' recovery.   I have long been a champion for survivors of abuse and will continue  to do so. Safe work environments and quality care are mutually  reinforcing; both must be considered in order to promote positive  outcomes for patients in our communities.   I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this amendment and the  underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield the balance of my time to  the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.
