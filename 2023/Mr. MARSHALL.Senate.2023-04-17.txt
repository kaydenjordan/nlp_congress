 Madam President, I rise today to honor,  recognize, and celebrate the 125th anniversary of the Smoky Valley  Roller Mill in Lindsborg, KS.   On October 14, 1897, the Smoky Valley Roller Mill went up in flames,  and while the communities' efforts to fight the fire saved the town,  the mill was lost. One week later, Theodore Teichgraeber, owner of the  mill, vowed to rebuild. By May of 1898, the mill was back in operation  turning wheat into flour. The Smoky Valley Roller Mill would serve as a  vital agricultural and commercial hub to Lindsborg and the surrounding  region for over a half century, as the mill was in operation from 1898  to 1955 under the leadership of the Teichgraeber, Hagstrom, and Runbeck  families.   Through the efforts of community members and the leadership of Malcom  Esping, Mary Borg, and George Teserek in particular, the historic mill  and original equipment were restored and preserved throughout the  1960s, `70s, and `80s. Through their hard work, Smoky Valley Roller  Mill was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. The  mill continues to be in good, working condition under the ownership of  the Lindsborg Old Mill and Swedish Heritage Museum and continues to  serve as a historical treasure, cultural center, and landmark of the  community. In fact, it is the only operable flour mill in the Midwest  still using roller mills.   This year marks the 125th anniversary since Smoky Valley Roller Mill  was rebuilt, and the city of Lindsborg will be celebrating the Mill's  quasquicentennial anniversary at their annual Millfest on May 6, 2023.   I now ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the 125th  anniversary of the Smoky Valley Roller Mill, as well as celebrate all  those who have contributed to the mill's 125 years of history and  success.                            ____________________
