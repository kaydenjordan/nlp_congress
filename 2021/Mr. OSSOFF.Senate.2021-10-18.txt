 Mr. President, Marissa McCall's positive impact on  Georgians' lives will be felt for generations.   Marissa was a tireless and effective advocate for those who otherwise  had none. She poured her heart and her work into the defense of those  who faced brutality at the hands of the justice system; into advocacy  for those who lacked the resources and connections to defend  themselves; and into urgent reform of a justice system in which class  and race bias are endemic and the rights and dignity of individuals are  daily violated. Marissa made a huge difference for so many.   Born in Santa Ana, CA, Marissa earned her degree in political science  from Georgia's Spelman College and her law degree from Louisiana State  University in 2008.   Marissa developed a first-of-its-kind program at the Georgia Justice  Project to help address the systemic barriers facing formerly  incarcerated people.   She joined the Southern Center for Human Rights in 2016, cementing  her role as one of Georgia's foremost champions for civil and human  rights.   Marissa's keen legal mind and deep empathy powered her work for  reform. She fought persistently and effectively to end the broken cash  bail system at Atlanta's Municipal Court, to reform the criminal record  system, and to ban the shackling of incarcerated women during  pregnancy.   In 2020 and 2021, after the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, Marissa was  instrumental in the repeal of Georgia's citizen's arrest law. As a  result, Georgia the first State in the Nation to pass such a reform.   Marissa is remembered by her family as a loving mother, a devoted  sister, a cherished daughter, and a loyal friend.   Georgia and the United States are fairer and more just for Marissa's  service.   I thank my colleagues in the U.S. Senate for joining me in honoring  the work and life of Marissa McCall.                            ____________________
