 Mr. President, I oppose Jeffrey Rosen's nomination to  be Deputy Secretary of the Department of Transportation. Mr. Rosen has  a troubling history of standing with industry over consumers and  opposing common sense public health and environmental protections.   In both his time as general counsel at the Department of  Transportation in the George W. Bush administration and his private  sector work on behalf of industry, Mr. Rosen advocated for limits on  the agency's authority to protect health and safety through the  regulatory process. In one case when he was at the Department of  Transportation, the National Highway Transportation Safety Agency  proposed a weak standard for the required strength of vehicle roofs,  which could collapse in rollovers. In addition to the weak standard,  the rule would make it difficult for consumers who had been in  accidents to seek damages from the companies responsible.   Mr. Rosen has also repeatedly questioned the necessity of limiting  carbon emissions from vehicles. He opposed efforts to improve fuel  economy standards that have spurred innovation, cut pollution, and  saved consumers at the pump.   Mr. Rosen's ideological approach to regulation appears bent on  minimizing rulemaking at any costs, regardless of the need. He has  advocated for one-in, one-out regulatory schemes and ``regulatory  budgeting'' that place arbitrary limits that would interfere with the  ability of agencies to implement the law.   Agency leadership must focus on their mission and use the best  available science and data to guide implementation of the law. Based on  Mr. Rosen's history, I am concerned that he may politicize rulemaking,  so I must oppose his nomination today.
