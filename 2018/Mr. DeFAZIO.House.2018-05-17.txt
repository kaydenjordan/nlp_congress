 Mr. Speaker, it is Infrastructure Week. You can tell  from all of the activity across the country: all of the rebuilding of  the 140,000 bridges that need repair or replacement; the 40 percent of  the national highway system that has failed to the point where we have  to rebuild the whole thing, not just resurface it; and the $100 billion  backlog in transit. It is all--well, actually, none of that is  happening.   In fact, despite the President being right here and talking about a  $1.5 trillion plan--wow, a big surprise, up by $500 billion--during the  State of the Union, the net result of what this President and this  administration have done is actually to reduce spending on  infrastructure and put forward a paper plan that would say you are on  your own.   It is called devolution; that is, we are going to say to the States  and the territories: It is your obligation to build a national  coordinated transportation infrastructure.   This is a grand new idea from some of the rightwing think tanks: Make  the States do it.   How is that going to work?   Well, actually, it is not a new idea. We tried it once before.  Actually, we tried it by default until we had the Eisenhower plan, a  Republican President, to build a national highway system.   This was the net result of devolution: Kansas, Oklahoma; you build  it, we will build it.   Well, Kansas built it.   What is this?   Oh, that is the State line.   This is Oklahoma: Sorry, we don't have the money to build and  continue that beautiful new freeway--1956.   For 3 years, cars crashed through a wooden barrier they built at the  end at the State line into Amos Sweitzer's farm field until we had a  national transportation plan, from a Republican President, funded by a  user fee, a gas tax, to build out the system nationwide.   And then it was Ronald Reagan who said: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  We can't just have highways. We need to have transit to serve our  Nation's largest cities and our hubs.   So we added transit into this.   That is all well and good. We built a system that was the envy of the  world 40 years ago, 30 years ago, maybe even 25 years ago. Since then,  it has been crumbling with neglect.   We haven't raised the Federal gas tax since 1993: 140,000 bridges  need repair or replacement; $100 billion backlog in transit, just to  build out to a state of good repair for what we have and not even give  people new transit options to get out of the congestion and the  traffic.   We are wasting billions of dollars a year, wasting fuel from people  sitting in gridlock all around the country. They are damaging their  cars through potholes, and they don't have the transit options that  were promised to them.   So what is going on? Well, it seems like the Republicans love to talk  about it. Oh, they just love to talk about infrastructure. Everybody  loves to talk about it--we are going to fill those potholes; we are  going to build those bridges; we are going to take care of you--but  they refuse to fund it. That is the bottom line.   We need to fund an ambitious new national infrastructure plan:  transit, roads, bridges, highways, harbors and ports, wastewater, clean  water, and the list goes on and on and on.   You can't be a great nation if your people are mired in gridlock, if  your roads are potholed, if your harbors are silted in, if your jetties  are failing, if your wastewater systems are 50 years  [[Page H4144]]  old and can't take any new capacity and actually are polluting our  rivers, and clean water is not available to people in some of the  largest cities in the United States of America.   Where is the Federal partner? There is no Federal partner with the  Republicans in charge. Let the States do it. Let's devolve this  obligation to the States. That is their solution: The States should pay  for it.   Well, it didn't work in the fifties. How the heck is that going to  work in the 21st century?   Even if one State decides now to increase capacity to move freight-- say California wants to move all of the freight that comes into Los  Angeles out of California to the rest of the Nation where it is going  and bring the goods in to export from there, how is that going to work  when you get to the Nevada State line and there is a two-lane road--or  no road--on the other side?   This is an abject failure, and it is time for Congress to act. If the  Republicans won't act, maybe we need to replace them with a party that  will act to rebuild America and make us competitive in the world for  the 21st century, not devolution. We need a Federal partnership. We  need Federal investment. We need a coordinated 21st century national  transportation system.                            ____________________
