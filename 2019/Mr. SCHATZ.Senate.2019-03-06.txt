 Mr. President.    Mr. President, will the Senator from Iowa yield to a  question?   I am interested in whether she believes that climate change is real,  caused by humans, and requires Federal action.    Excuse me, Mr. President. May I ask a followup question  through the Chair?    I just would like to get clarification. She did say  climate change is real, but my question is whether--   --manmade climate change is real, and I did not get an  answer.    If she's unwilling to answer that question, I understand.    I yield the floor.
