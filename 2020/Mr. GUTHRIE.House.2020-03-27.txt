 Mr. Speaker, as all of our colleagues came in yesterday  and this morning and make an effort to get back, it was important that  we were all home last week.   I was home last week and got to talk to a barber, sole proprietor,  has his own shop and had to close down because of the order. Now he is  going to have an income.   I talked to a businessman, who said, almost in tears: I am going to  have to lay people off for the first time in 40 years of business.  After this bill passes, he will not have to do that.   And the businesswoman who says: I have a rent payment due at the end  of the month; after this bill passes, she will be able to pay her rent.   Mr. Speaker, I am humbled, and today, I am going to vote for the  largest bill in American history. I think it should make us all a  little nervous, but it is, after being home, listening to the stories  of those in our communities, the right thing to do.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support our communities and  support those making our country better, and I am here to say I am  going to support this bill, and I encourage my colleagues to do so as  well.
