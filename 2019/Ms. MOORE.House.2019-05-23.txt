 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership and  for moving this bipartisan legislation forward. This is really a  necessary step to ensuring that more Americans can save for retirement.   I also commend the chairman for his swift action to redress the harsh  tax rate and unintended consequences caused by the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act of 2017 on Gold Star families, low-income children, and young  adults who receive payments from Tribal governments.   Our special tax rules on unearned income of children and young adults  to prevent wealthy families from engaging in tax planning to  artificially lower their tax burden, of course, is not relevant to  these payments made to Gold Star families, survivor benefits, and  Tribal children.   The 2017 rate repeal only partially addressed an underlying problem  where additional legislation is required relative to Tribal youth. Mr.  Estes and I introduced bipartisan legislation, H.R. 2018, to fix the  underlying problem of the kiddie tax on taxable disbursements made by  Tribal governments.   So, Madam Speaker, I ask the chairman to tell Members of this Chamber  and the Tribes who are watching closely throughout the country what his  intentions are relative to the underlying problem with the kiddie tax.    Madam Speaker, this is a first step toward meeting our  trust obligations to the sovereign first peoples of this country.   I thank the chairman for yielding.
