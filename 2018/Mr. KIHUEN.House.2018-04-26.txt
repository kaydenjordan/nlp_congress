 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to remember the life of Adrian  Murfitt, who went to Las Vegas on October 1 for the Route 91 festival.   Adrian had a love for fishing. He would spend months on a commercial  fishing boat to catch and sell fish. When it was not fishing season, he  would repair appliances, tinker with cars, and spend time with his  friends.   Adrian was a very hard worker and decided to reward himself for a  successful fishing season by traveling to Las Vegas. He loved to listen  and sing country music with a voice that friends described as  ``beautiful.''   He enjoyed his two dogs, Laika and Paxson, and always made sure to  spend time with them. Adrian had many friends who remember him as being  silly and goofy and wanting to make people laugh, no matter what.   I would like to extend my condolences to Adrian Murfitt's family and  friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada,  and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
