 Madam Speaker, I rise today to continue the call for an  independent commission to investigate the President's ties with Russia.   Congress has the responsibility to ensure we investigate these  matters appropriately. We must provide the American people with  answers, transparency, and accountability. We know that there are  issues with the House Intelligence Committee on the Republican side, so  it is time that we ask for an independent commission to take the lead.   Let's be honest, at the end of the day, you are the company you keep.  So far, President Trump's team has included a national security adviser  who was paid by Russian companies to appear at Russian events, a former  campaign manager who had a multimillion-dollar contract to advance  Putin's agenda, and now we have the issues again with the Republican  side of the Intelligence Committee to cover up tracks left by the Trump  administration.   As we further untangle the web created by Trump and his team, it is  clear that some Republicans are fearful of what potential  investigations may reveal. The American people deserve answers.                            ____________________
