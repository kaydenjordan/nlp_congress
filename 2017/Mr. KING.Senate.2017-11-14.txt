 Mr. President, I would like to recognize the efforts of the  many organizations that have agreed to come together to establish a  single continuum of care for the State of Maine. Continuums of Care are  supported by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to  promote a communitywide commitment to the goal of ending homelessness.  They are a vital partner in the works to quickly rehouse homeless  individuals and families to minimize trauma and dislocation; promote  access to and effective use of mainstream programs; and optimize self- sufficiency among individuals and families experiencing homelessness.  Continuums of Care make important decisions about priorities for  Federal funding of programs that provide significant services.   Prior to establishing this single continuum of care for Maine, there  were three separate entities that existed: the City of Portland,  Greater Penobscot, which was centered on Bangor, and everything else  fell under the ``Balance of State'' Continuum. While receiving funding  to operate a continuum of care funding requires a competitive  application process, these three groups have consistently worked  closely together and coordinated their means. In 2012, the Greater  Penobscot Continuum and ``Balance of State'' merged together to create  the Maine Continuum of Care. Then, in 2017, the Portland Continuum  consolidated with the Maine Continuum--achieving a single continuum of  care--an effort that greatly advanced the level of collaboration among  the member agencies and has proven to be an important step in  streamlining efforts and assuring available resources are meeting the  needs of those who become homeless. The merger of the two continuums  has resulted in more accurate collection and management of data about  the extent and characteristics of homelessness in Maine.  [[Page S7212]]    A single continuum of care has achieved efficiencies in  administrating the responsibilities delegated by the Federal Government  to meet the challenge of ending homelessness in Maine. As a unit, they  identify the homeless service priorities and distribute resources  accordingly. The organizations and agencies that participate in  continuum of care include: Maine's network of 37 emergency shelters  serving the entire State; MaineHousing and the Department of Health and  Human Services; homeless youth providers; veterans groups; mental  health and substance abuse service providers; supportive housing  developers; local governments and public housing authorities; and  homeless advocacy organizations. In addition to providing housing and  services, the members of the Maine Continuum of Care play a major role  in several other statewide initiatives, including participating in the  data collection and entry for the annual homeless assessment report  AHAR, and new system performance measure reports.   This significant merger was a collaborative endeavor involving  Maine's homeless provider organizations, social service providers, and  State and Federal agencies. I especially want to thank the leadership  and guidance provided by MaineHousing, the State's housing authority,  and the chairs of Maine's continuums throughout the merger process. I  am honored to recognize all who were involved and to thank them for  placing the individuals and families who are struggling to meet this  basic human need for a warm, safe, and stable home at the center of our  collective efforts to end homelessness in the State of Maine.                            ____________________
