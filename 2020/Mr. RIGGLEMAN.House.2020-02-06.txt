 Madam Speaker, I rise today to salute a life of  service. Next week, Fire Chief Mike Brent will hang up his helmet and  enter a well-deserved retirement.   Mike joined the Fluvanna County Volunteer Fire Department in January  of 1977 as a member of the Palmyra Volunteer Fire Company. He quickly  rose through the ranks, and just 10 years later he was elected to serve  as the Chief of Fluvanna County Volunteer Department; leading  volunteers from Palmyra, Fork Union, and Kents Store.   During his 32 years as chief, he was instrumental in many significant  improvements to the delivery of fire and EMS services in Fluvanna  County, to include a capital improvements plan for three new, state-of- the-art firehouses.   Even after retiring as chief, Mike continues to volunteer as a member  of the Palmyra Volunteer Fire Company; a true testament to his resolute  commitment and unwavering service to our community.   Chief Brent truly embodies what it means to be selfless and putting  others' needs before his own. We are forever grateful for his service.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in an America with a booming economy,  strong military, and optimistic future. On Tuesday, President Trump  outlined  [[Page H864]]  the ``best is yet to come'' blueprint during the State of the Union  Address.   This agenda is an optimistic plan to continue the record-setting  economic growth we are seeing and provide solutions to problems that  ail American citizens. It is imperative that Congress step forward and  support this agenda as I do.   It is an agenda that dramatically lowers prescription drug prices and  raises wages for hardworking Americans, an agenda that will build an  inclusive society and make sure every young American has the  opportunity to achieve the American Dream, and an agenda that will  ensure every citizen can have access to high-speed internet, including  in rural areas.   With a national unemployment rate of 3.5 percent and a Virginia  unemployment rate of 2.6 percent, it is clear the economic policies the  President has implemented are working. The ``best is yet to come''  blueprint will continue this growth and build upon it.   The American economy is stronger than ever, and we should work to  continue this growth.   I have a district that is 10,000 square miles large, bigger than the  State of New Jersey. Seeing the optimism and excitement in Virginia and  Virginia's Fifth District is something to behold. We have built an  inclusive economy where the least well-off are making some of the  fastest gains and unemployment is at an all-time low.   There is no doubt that we are in the midst of a blue-collar boom in  this country. Those who support the previous question are opposing the  economic boom. That is why I will be voting against the previous  question.   A vote against the previous question is a vote for lowering the  number of impoverished Americans on food stamps. A vote against the  previous question is a vote to continue the booming economic growth we  have experienced. A vote against the previous question is a vote for  enacting all these policies into law and furthering President Trump's  agenda.   Madam Speaker, I urge defeat of the previous question so that we can  consider my resolution and support the policies outlined in the ``best  is yet to come'' policy blueprint.
