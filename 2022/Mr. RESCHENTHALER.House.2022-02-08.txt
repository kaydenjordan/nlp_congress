 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and my friend  from Maryland for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield  myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the rule before us today makes in order H.R. 6617, a  resolution to fund the Federal Government through March 11, 2022, and  H.R. 3076, the Postal Service Reform Act of 2022.   I know that Appropriations Chairwoman DeLauro and Ranking Member  Granger continue to engage in bipartisan discussions to find a path  forward on a fiscal year 2022 funding package, and I want to thank them  sincerely for those efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to commend Chairwoman Maloney and Ranking  Member Comer for working together to put forth a truly bipartisan  package to stabilize the financial health of the U.S. Postal Service  and to improve efficiency and transparency for senior citizens and  other Americans who rely every day on the Postal Service.   Mr. Speaker, for the past 3 years, Democratic leadership has written  major legislation behind closed doors with little to zero input from  House Republicans and, frankly, almost zero to little input from even  the committees that, of course, the Democrats control. This has truly  been a behind-closed-door process that I have seen for the last 3  years.   So, it is finally refreshing to see the House consider a bill that  was the subject of a robust bipartisan negotiation and that actually  went through the normal committee process for once. I want to say that  I hope my colleagues across the aisle will make this the new normal, as  it has previously been the norm.   Mr. Speaker, I also hope the majority will continue the  bipartisanship that I have seen here today and continue to work with  House Republicans to address the serious and pressing issues facing  American families across this Nation.   For example, thanks to President Biden's open border policy, deadly  fentanyl continues to just pour across our southern border, which is  ravaging our communities, literally killing people in the heartland of  this country.   For example, in 2021, drug overdose deaths in the U.S. topped 100,000  for the first time in a single year. In fact, fentanyl overdoses are  reported to be the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45.  It is past time that Congress acts to stem the tide of deadly fentanyl  coming into our Nation  [[Page H1026]]  largely through our porous southern border. The fentanyl that comes-- let's just say it--is largely from China. It is time we address that  issue.   At the same time, America is in the midst of a crime crisis like we  haven't seen before, largely thanks to the Democrats' demonization of  our police in what I view as one of the worst public policy positions I  have ever seen, their push to actually defund police.   In 2021, at least 16 cities set new records in homicides. It is no  wonder that 64 percent of Americans disapprove of how President Biden  has handled crime. Congress should be working to address this crime  surge and working to back the blue as well.   Finally, Americans continue to pay higher prices to do everything,  from feed their families, heat their homes, and even fill up their gas  tanks. Instead of doubling down on the failed far-left radical policies  and out-of-control spending that actually caused this economic crisis,  we should be reclaiming our energy independence. We should be  eliminating burdensome regulations that hamstring our job creators. And  we should be working to ensure American families keep more of their  hard-earned paychecks.                                time  1230    I want to applaud the bipartisanship work that went into these bills.  I want to applaud the Committee on Oversight and Reform and, of course,  the Committee on Appropriations. But there are many other pressing  issues that we can also be working on and should be working on for the  benefit of American families.   I therefore urge my colleagues to oppose this rule, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Issa).    Mr. Speaker, while I respect my good friend and  colleague, especially for what he has done in the private sector as  well as the public sector, I do have some concerns.   I believe the Postal Service Reform Act is a strong bipartisan act,  and I urge its passage. This measure will bring increased transparency.  It will improve operations for senior citizens and Americans who use  the Postal Service every day. It will help this institution that is  critical, especially to rural America.   Again, I have deep respect and admiration for my friend from  California. I just would urge passage of this, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from the great State of Texas (Mr. Burgess), who is my good friend and  fellow Rules Committee member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Across this country, Democratic Governors and local officials have  forced children to wear masks in schools. They have done this without  real concern for the social developmental and emotional consequences of  their authoritarian actions. These are the actions of petty tyrants,  people who do not care about real science.   In stark contrast, House Republicans have been consistent this whole  time. We have been fighting for the rights of America's children, and  the American parent.   That is why if we defeat the previous question, I will personally  offer an amendment to the rule to immediately consider H.R. 6619, the  Unmask Our Kids Act. This legislation would block education agencies  from receiving Federal funding unless schools are open for in-person  learning and school mask mandates allow parents to opt out on behalf of  their children.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record along with any extraneous material  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, here to explain the amendment is the  legislation's author, Representative Ashley Hinson of Iowa, my good  friend.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs.  Hinson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I find it interesting that my good friend from Maryland  would say the former President was ``reckless'' during the pandemic.  This is a man who put together Operation Warp Speed, one of the  quickest vaccination programs and one of the most effective the world  has ever seen.   If we are talking about numbers, let's just talk about the numbers.  More people have died in this pandemic under Joe Biden than ever died  under President Trump. The numbers don't lie. During President Trump's  first year with the pandemic, there were just over 390,000 deaths and,  again, every death is tragic. But to say that President Trump was  reckless, look at the numbers of Joe Biden. Since Joe Biden has taken  office, over half a million people, 500,000-plus people have died.   So if President Trump was reckless, what word would you use to  describe President Biden? I am interested to hear that. But there are  two kinds of science; there is real science and there is political  science. The risk of severe disease from COVID-19 to healthy children  is very low. This is real science. The CDC data shows that 863 total  pediatric deaths related to COVID-19 have occurred since the beginning  of this pandemic, which is less than--and, again, for the party of  science, this is real science--that is less than 0.001 percent of all  COVID deaths in the United States. Many of these children had  underlying medical conditions making them more vulnerable to severe  COVID-19 than the average child, meaning that many of these children  died with COVID not of COVID.   But again, that is real science, not political science. Talking about  real science versus political science, I have got a photo of Stacey  Abrams. This is political science, and here is why. Because the kids in  this photo trying to learn, all of them are masked up. Statistically,  these children are at very low risk of contracting COVID and even lower  risk of dying from COVID. Again, the stats don't lie; 0.001 percent.    The real person in this photo who bears most of the risk is a  governor-in-exile Stacey Abrams who is not wearing a mask. This photo  is political science. If the mask wearing was reversed, that would be  actual science.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr.  LaTurner), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   My good friend from Maryland referenced Dr. Birx. Let's be honest:  Dr. Birx is an unelected career bureaucrat who has been wrong  repeatedly, just like Dr. Fauci has been wrong repeatedly.   Although my friend on the left might cite Dr. Birx, I can cite Johns  Hopkins University, which just did a study. According to this massive  study from Johns Hopkins University--not a bastion of conservative  ideology, I might add--they found that lockdowns only reduced COVID  mortality by 0.2 percent in the United States. In sum, lockdowns didn't  work at all.   What is worse is that those on the left have failed to take into  account that the lockdowns actually led to more deaths than they  prevented, arguably, with drug overdose and suicide. But that is real  science, not political science.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs.  Miller-Meeks) to talk about more real science.    Madam Speaker, look, for the record, I would bet  on Dr. Miller-Meeks any day of the week over Dr. Birx. She believes in  the real science, not the political theater and political science that  the CDC and Dr. Birx speak of. A great example: The CDC never even  studied the effects of school mask mandates before mandating masks in  school.   Say what you will, but that is not how science works.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Hudson), who is my good friend.    Madam Speaker, talking about more science, here is  some more science: A North Carolina study, where my good friend  resides, conducted before vaccines were available, found that not a  single case of student-to-teacher transmission occurred when 90,000  students were in school. That is the real science.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time as I am prepared to close.   Madam Speaker, thanks to President Biden and thanks to House  Democrats and their far left, radical policies, Americans are currently  facing a border crisis, a crime crisis, and an economic crisis.  [[Page H1031]]    Despite a lack of scientific evidence to support masks in schools,  Democratic Governors, officials, unelected bureaucrats, petty tyrants,  have mandated the use of masks in schools, damaging the educational and  social development of our students. It is past time that Democrats stop  prioritizing their woke agenda and work with Republicans to address  these and other pressing issues facing American families today.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question; I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule; and I yield  back the balance of my time.                                time  1315     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
