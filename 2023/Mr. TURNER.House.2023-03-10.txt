 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 199, I call  up the bill (S. 619) to require the Director of National Intelligence  to declassify information relating to the origin of COVID-19, and for  other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  into the Record extraneous material on S. 619.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 619, a bill that would require  the Director of National Intelligence to declassify information  relating to the origin of COVID-19. The House companion bill, H.R.  1376, passed unanimously out of the Intelligence Committee.   I thank Ranking Member Himes for his dedication to bipartisanship and  professionalism as we work together to try to ensure that the  Intelligence Committee responds to the needs of the House.   Madam Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc across the  country, with almost every household feeling its effects. The United  States death toll from this virus has surpassed 1 million people.   Although concrete data is hard to lock down, millions of Americans  are suffering from the long-term effects directly attributed to this  virus.   COVID-19 has also negatively affected our communities, especially our  kids. It has become increasingly clear that school-age children face  major educational hurdles because of distance learning and long-term  school closures.   The American public deserves answers to every aspect of the COVID-19  pandemic, including how this virus was created, and specifically,  whether it was a natural occurrence or was the result of a lab-related  event.   The House Intelligence Committee which oversees our intelligence  community is aware of classified information that could help inform the  public why COVID-19 as a lab leak theory is not just a possibility but  approaches the idea that it is likely.   The intelligence community does have more information about COVID-19  than the public is led to believe. Much of the information they have  can be declassified and disseminated to the public. In fact, the bill  we are discussing today would give the American public just a glimpse,  albeit a very important aspect, of the classified information the  intelligence community holds.   S. 619, if passed by the House and signed into law, would give the  American public a unique insight as to what was happening at a  biosafety level laboratory in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and early  2020. This laboratory and who was working there might be the key to  unraveling the truth.   For those concerned about declassifying COVID-19 origins information,  I can assure you that the intelligence community could release this  information while protecting their sources and methods of how it was  collected. In fact, I believe that the intelligence community could go  further than what is called for in S. 619 and release most of what it  knows about COVID origins, but this is a good start.   COVID-19 ranks as one of this century's most important events. No  community was spared, and every corner of the world felt its effects.  Everyone deserves to know what our intelligence community knows, and S.  619 is the right step in the right direction.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate my ranking member's very  thoughtful comments and remarks.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Garcia).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Crawford).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Mississippi (Mr. Kelly).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. Stewart).  [[Page H1258]]         Madam Speaker, the issue of the origins of COVID are so  important that our Speaker has appointed a select subcommittee on the  origins of COVID. Our next speaker, Dr. Wenstrup, is the chair of that  subcommittee.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Wenstrup).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Murphy).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. McCormick).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Pfluger).    Madam Speaker, I have no more speakers. I am prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to begin by thanking my ranking member. This bill comes to the  House floor from the Senate with bipartisan support in the House, and  it does so as a result of the leadership of the Ranking Member,  Jim  Himes. I appreciate his commitment to both the declassifying of  information and to the importance of this information concerning COVID- 19, and for the fact that we are working in a bipartisan manner to do  so.   This will be a very strong statement from this House today that we  want to know the origins of COVID-19. The American public deserves to  know the  [[Page H1260]]  answers, and that we are moving to declassify the information that we  have available.   Madam Speaker, I ask for support of S. 619, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 419,  nays 0, not voting 16, as follows:                               [Roll No. 143]                                 YEAS--419       Adams      Aderholt      Aguilar      Alford      Allen      Allred      Amodei      Armstrong      Arrington      Auchincloss      Babin      Bacon      Baird      Balderson      Balint      Banks      Barr      Barragan      Bean (FL)      Beatty      Bentz      Bera      Bergman      Bice      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (GA)      Bishop (NC)      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Boebert      Bonamici      Bost      Bowman      Boyle (PA)      Brecheen      Brown      Brownley      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Budzinski      Burchett      Burgess      Burlison      Bush      Calvert      Cammack      Caraveo      Carbajal      Cardenas      Carey      Carl      Carson      Carter (GA)      Carter (LA)      Carter (TX)      Cartwright      Casar      Case      Casten      Castor (FL)      Chavez-DeRemer      Cherfilus-McCormick      Chu      Cicilline      Ciscomani      Clark (MA)      Clarke (NY)      Cline      Cloud      Clyburn      Clyde      Cohen      Cole      Collins      Comer      Connolly      Correa      Costa      Courtney      Craig      Crane      Crawford      Crenshaw      Crockett      Crow      Cuellar      Curtis      D'Esposito      Davids (KS)      Davidson      Davis (IL)      Davis (NC)      De La Cruz      Dean (PA)      DeGette      DeLauro      DelBene      Deluzio      DeSaulnier      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Dingell      Doggett      Donalds      Duarte      Duncan      Dunn (FL)      Ellzey      Emmer      Escobar      Eshoo      Espaillat      Estes      Evans      Ezell      Fallon      Feenstra      Ferguson      Finstad      Fischbach      Fitzgerald      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Fletcher      Flood      Foster      Foushee      Foxx      Frankel, Lois      Franklin, C.
