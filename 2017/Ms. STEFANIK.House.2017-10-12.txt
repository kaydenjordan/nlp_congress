 Mr. Speaker, when you eat today, you can thank a  farmer.   Across this great Nation, over 3 million farmers work tirelessly each  day to produce the food that feeds our families and keeps our country  running.   From Grace-Way Dairy Farm in Lowville to Everett Orchards in Peru, I  have been blessed to meet with so many farmers that make up the  backbone of our north country economy. Many of these family farms in my  district produce dairy, apples, honey, wine, and the most delicious  maple in the country.   As Congress works on the next farm bill, we need to focus on  supporting those who support our Nation's food supply.  [[Page H7988]]    Mr. Speaker, today, on National Farmers Day, I urge my colleagues to  join me in thanking the men and women who rise before the sun each and  every day to make sure our families are fed.                            ____________________
