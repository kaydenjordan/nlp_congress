 Madam President, I rise this afternoon to speak in  support of the historic legislation we are considering today, the  Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.   A little over a week ago, when I heard the news that there was an  agreement reached to move forward on this legislation, I could not help  but feel an overwhelming sense of relief and of joy, and I am not alone  in feeling that way. I felt relief in knowing that, after months of  negotiations and years of hard work from volunteers, from activists,  from policy experts, from leaders at all levels of government and  industry, and from so many others, we had finally broken the logjam on  major climate and clean energy legislation. I felt joy in knowing that  we were one step closer to delivering a major victory for the American  people, one that will help reduce inflation and create good-paying jobs  at the same time. My belief is that this legislation is an answer to  our prayers for a brighter future for our Nation and for our planet.   I might say to all of these young people who are sitting up here--we  have a bunch of our pages who are here from all over the country; they  are, for the most part, rising juniors and seniors--that they remind me  a lot of our grandchildren, frankly, in my family and, for folks, of a  lot of their children.   This is for you. This is for your generation.   This is for our kids, our grandchildren, our nieces, our nephews.   This is for you.   After enduring a deadly global pandemic for the last 2 years and the  resulting political and economic turbulence flowing from it, the truth  is that far too many Americans are struggling. They are hurting from  the high cost of healthcare; they are hurting from rising living  expenses and energy bills; and they are hurting from extreme weather  that is costing us in terms of dollars and of lives.   I know this because that is what I hear when I travel home to  Delaware almost every night. I don't live here; I live in Delaware. I  go back and forth on a train--a lot like a guy named Biden used to do  when he was a mere Senator, along with Senator Chris Coons and Lisa  Blunt Rochester, a Congresswoman. Whether it is a senior on a fixed  income who is struggling with the cost of lifesaving prescription drugs  or a young person who is living in a community that is prone to  flooding from rising sea levels, many Delawareans of all ages are  anxious about their futures, and they are pleading with us to do  something about it.   Scientists are also pleading with us for action, too, before it is  too late. For years, they have warned us that time is running out, that  we must shift away from fossil fuels to avoid a future of unrelenting  extreme weather. Now scientists are telling us it is code red for  humanity and for our planet.   We are already experiencing a climate crisis, and Americans from  communities large and small are feeling its impact, most notably in the  form of extreme heat, wildfires, and floods.   As I speak here today, nearly 100 million Americans from Texas to  Maine are under heat advisories--100 million. There are also more than  50 wildfires raging across the West, burning tens of thousands of acres  in States like California and Montana and Idaho and Alaska. Just last  week, catastrophic flash floods in Eastern Kentucky, not far from where  my mom spent the last years of her life, have tragically claimed some  37 lives.   We know that these deadly, extreme weather events will only get worse  in  [[Page S4064]]  the years ahead without coordinated action--without coordinated  action--and we know that the most vulnerable among us, including many  communities of color, will suffer the most if we fail to act.   The best science available tells us that to avoid the worst impacts  of global warming, we must achieve something that is referred to as  ``net zero carbon emissions'' no later than the year 2050. Achieving  this ambitious goal will not be easy, but it is achievable.   As some of my colleagues will tell you, I am by nature an optimist. I  always have been. Out of great adversity comes great opportunity. Those  are the words of Albert Einstein. In adversity lies opportunity. There  is huge adversity here but also great opportunity.   I am proud to say that we are on the precipice of passing legislation  that will channel American ingenuity to address this crisis, lower  costs for families, and fight inflation. How will they do all of that?  The Inflation Reduction Act includes nearly $370 billion in funding for  climate and clean energy provisions. In other words, it will be the  most ambitious climate legislation to ever emerge from this body. It  does so by not raising taxes on people whose incomes are under  $400,000, on families whose incomes are under $400,000, and it does so  in a way that is not inflationary and that is fully paid for and  offset.   What will the impact be of this transformational climate legislation?  Well, according to an analysis from Energy Innovation--some the  smartest people here in this country who work on issues like this-- according to their analysis, passing this legislation will reduce net  greenhouse gas emissions by a little bit over 40 percent by 2030. And  as President Biden might say, that is a very big deal. He might say it  differently but something along those lines.   This legislation will, along with action from executive Agencies and  State and local actors, will put us within reach of meeting our  national target of cutting emissions in half by the end of this decade.   In addition to slashing emissions from across our economy, this  legislation will also unleash the potential of the American clean  energy industry and create good-paying jobs throughout our country. In  fact, it will create a ton of jobs. The analysis from the Political  Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst  projects that the Inflation Reduction Act--this legislation that we are  debating--will help create 9 million jobs over the next decade--9  million over the next decade.   And the benefits to this historic package aren't just limited to  emission reductions and to job creation. As its name suggests, this  legislation will fight inflation and lower costs for many Americans.  Again, ask: How?   For starters, the Inflation Reduction Act will help homeowners save  up to $220 a year on electricity costs, according to an analysis by the  Resources for the Future.   This legislation also includes huge healthcare savings for families  across our country. For example, on average, median-income families in  Delaware with exchange-based care will save upward of $1,000 annually.  That is $1,000 back in their pockets.   This bill will also ensure that our seniors don't face financial ruin  paying for lifesaving prescription drugs. It does so, in part, by  capping patients' out-of-pocket costs in the Medicare Part D Program at  $2,000 per year.   And the Inflation Reduction Act will help strengthen our tax system  to better ensure that everyone pays their fair share and also to ensure  that we have got decent constituent services for our constituents in  our States. I don't care whether it is Minnesota, I don't care whether  it is Delaware, or some other place, the IRS just hasn't had the  resources, the people, the technology, to actually provide good  constituent services. We are still waiting for people to get their  returns from last year and their refunds from last year. That is just  totally unacceptable. And over the last probably 30, 40 years, we have  reduced by roughly a quarter the amount of resources that are available  to actually serve people through the IRS.   At the end of the day, the programs in this bill will help create  jobs, lower costs for many American families, and fight inflation, all  while addressing the imminent threat of climate change and doing so in  a way that leaves no community behind. It is proof that we can do well  and do good at the same time.   As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I am  especially proud that our $41 billion title within the purview of our  committee prioritizes climate action in low-income and disadvantaged  communities. This is part of ensuring that all communities, especially  those most susceptible to the negative impacts of climate change,  benefit from our funding to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reduce  air pollution where they live--where they live.   As part of that commitment, we provide $27 billion for the  Environmental Protection Agency to create a greenhouse gas reduction  fund, known as the Green Bank. It will help leverage private  investments in projects that combat climate change, with over 40  percent of these investments going to underserved communities. The  climate impact of this program will be huge, removing the equivalent of  some 15 million gasoline-powered vehicles from our roads over the next  decade.   We also provide $3 billion in competitive grants to States, Tribes,  and municipalities--and to community-based nonprofit organizations--for  financial and technical assistance to address clean air and to  eliminate pollution in environmental justice communities.   Our EPW title also provides some $3 billion to help reduce carbon  emissions flowing from our Nation's ports. Doing so not only cleans up  the air in nearby communities but also reduces our reliance on foreign  fuels. And we provide $1 billion to replace dirty medium and heavy-duty  vehicles with zero-emitting vehicles on our roads, reducing fuel  consumption while allowing businesses that run those trucks to save  significantly on their energy costs.   While I wish I could discuss this afternoon every program in our  title of the Environment and Public Works Committee, let me just close  by sharing a few words on one program I am particularly proud of, our  first-ever Methane Emission Reduction Program to rein in excess methane  pollution from the oil and gas industry.   Why did we create a program to reduce methane emissions? Why was this  so important? Well, let me tell you this: Methane is more than 80 times  more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. I will say that  again. Methane is more than 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide as  a greenhouse.   There was a guy who used to be a bank robber named Willie Sutton back  in the Great Depression. My friend from Iowa probably remembers Willie  Sutton, not personally. But Willie Sutton robbed a lot of banks back in  those days. He finally got caught and was brought to trial. And  standing before the judge, the judge said: Mr. Sutton, why do you rob  banks?   Willie Sutton responded famously: That is where the money is, judge;  that is where the money is.   Well, there are huge emissions--huge emissions--that flow from  methane. They ought to be captured; they can be captured, and the  programs that we offer here, the funding we offer here, will help that  to happen.   We designed this commonsense program to provide $1\1/2\ billion to  help businesses invest in existing technology to reduce potent methane  emissions. It then ramps up a fee over time for emitters that fail to  take advantage of this assistance. All told, we expect this program to  raise about $6\1/2\ billion--that is billion with a ``b''--to offset  the costs of other climate and environmental justice investments in the  title of our committee's bill.   Years from now--years from now--folks are going to gather here in  this Chamber, and they will look back at what we had before us, what we  were confronted with, and whether or not we made a difference. I hope  they will judge us favorably.   Let me just say, in closing, 2 weeks ago, they reported in London,  England, a temperature of 105 degrees. For those of us who have been to  England, you may know this: They don't even have air-conditioning in  most places in England. The temperature there, 105 degrees. In the same  week that the temperature was 105 degrees, folks were trying to run the  bicycle event, the French bicycle event that is so famous, and they  could not run parts of it because the pavement was melting. They  [[Page S4065]]  had to put tens of thousands of gallons of water on the roads just so  they could run the French bicycle race.   I will close with this: In Louisiana, they have problems, they have  challenges from sea level rise. How serious are they? Well, every 100  minutes in Louisiana, they lose a piece of land to the ocean from sea  level rise. Every 100 minutes they lose a piece of land the size of a  football field. And today, this week, we are seeing incredible heat,  incredible drought. From the west coast to the east coast, people are  suffering, suffering, in some cases, injury and death. We have got to  do something about it, and we are going to do that with this  legislation and also make sure that a lot of folks who need jobs in the  years to come will have a good-paying job. That is not a bad day's  work.   With that, I am pleased to take this piece of paper and read it to my  colleagues, including the Senator from Iowa, who is waiting patiently  for me to stop talking.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be a  period of morning business for debate only until 4:15 p.m., with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each, and that  Senator Schumer be recognized at 4:15 p.m.    I thank the Senator from Iowa for his patience today.  Thank you so much.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Almost everything that is good that he has just talked  about came out of the Finance Committee, terrific staff work, terrific  leadership. Thank you.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of entering into a  colloquy with the chair of the Finance Committee, Mr. Wyden, concerning  section 13204, clean hydrogen, which establishes for the first time tax  incentives for the production of clean hydrogen, and section 13701,  Clean Electricity Production Credit, which establishes for the first  time technology neutral tax credits for clean electricity production.   I would like to commend my friend from Oregon, the chairman of the  Senate Finance Committee, for his leadership in crafting title I of the  Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes new tax incentives that  will promote clean energy, fight climate change, and help create good- paying, American jobs. I want to especially say thank you for including  in the clean energy package, section 13204 of title I of the Inflation  Reduction Act of 2022, which is similar to my legislation, S.1807, the  Clean H2 Production Act.   Section 13024 of title I of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022  provides a production and investment tax credit for the production of  clean hydrogen.  [[Page S4166]]  In Section 13204, the term ``lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions'' for a  qualified hydrogen facility is determined by the aggregate quantity of  greenhouse gas emissions through the point of production, as determined  under the most recent Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy  use in Technologies--GREET--model. It is also my understanding of the  intent of section 13204, is that in determining ``lifecycle greenhouse  gas emissions'' for this section, the Secretary shall recognize and  incorporate indirect book accounting factors, also known as a book and  claim system, that reduce effective greenhouse gas emissions, which  includes, but is not limited to, renewable energy credits, renewable  thermal credits, renewable identification numbers, or biogas credits.   Is that the chairman's understanding as well?    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   Additionally, I would like to clarify that the intent of section  13701 allows the Secretary to consider indirect book and claim factors  that reduce effective greenhouse gas emissions to help determine  whether the greenhouse gas rate of a qualified fuel cell property,  which does not include facilities that produce electricity through  combustion or gasification, is ``not greater than zero.''   Is that the chairman's understanding?    I thank the Senator from Oregon for his comments on these  issues and his leadership.    Mr. President, the amendment by our colleague Senator  Capito would strike $45 million in the bill that would fund the EPA to  use its existing narrow Clean Air Act authorities to address greenhouse  gas emissions.   Our colleague sought to argue that this provision did not comply with  the Byrd rule, but the Parliamentarian ruled that it does. We are now  presented with an amendment to strike the provision altogether.   The EPA has lots of authorities and tools already at its disposal to  reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than midcentury.  The quickest way we can jump-start government-wide climate action is to  help empower Agencies to use the tools that they already have. The $45  million in the bill before us would help the EPA to do just that.   I spoke earlier today about the urgent need for climate action. We  are witnessing record heat, more extreme weather, and devastating  floods on an almost daily basis. We should fund the EPA to use all of  the authorities at its disposal to tackle the climate crisis. The  urgency of this problem demands no less.   I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 5382     Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to this  amendment, which would make sweeping changes to bedrock environmental  laws. This amendment would modify the regulatory authorities of the  Environmental Protection Agency and multiple other Agencies. It would  undermine protection of our water quality, weaken air quality  protections, harm wildlife, and would have significant impacts on  vulnerable communities.   At a time when we need to be moving toward stable clean energy  sources, it would focus instead on fracking and would prohibit us from  considering the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions in Federal  decisions.   And thus, I urge my colleagues to vote no.                                Point of Order    Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment  violates section 313(b)(1)(D) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
