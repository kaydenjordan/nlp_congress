 Mr. President, this shouldn't take very long.   I was most disappointed tonight when the President of the United  States put out a statement that tried to divide us based on party when  it came to support of our military. There is no such division. Everyone  in this Chamber knows it. So, as we have in other instances where we  have had a shutdown--I remember, in 2013, we did this right off the  bat. I want to make sure that tonight we send a very clear signal that  we don't want one moment to pass with there being any uncertainty that  any soldier anywhere in the world will be paid for the valiant work  they do on behalf of our national security.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of Calendar No. 36, H.R. 1301; that the  amendment at the desk, providing for continuing appropriations for pay  and death benefits for members of the Armed Services, be considered and  agreed to, the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and  passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate.
