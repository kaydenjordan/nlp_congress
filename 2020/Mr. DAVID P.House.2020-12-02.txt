 ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  opposition to this bill. This bill would shift the constitutional power  to coin money and regulate its value from Congress to the executive  branch.   While I applaud the effort to give the Mint flexibility to reduce  costs, this bill has the unintended effect of relinquishing Congress'  constitutional power to coin money to the executive branch. We see this  shift of power all the time in this body.   It is the prerogative of Congress to regulate the country's coinage.  Let's vote to maintain this prerogative. Mr. Speaker, I urge my  colleagues to oppose suspending the rules and passing H.R. 7995.
