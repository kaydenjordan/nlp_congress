 I thank the chairman for yielding me this  time.   Mr. Speaker, President Obama made it his mission to bankrupt the coal  industry when he took office, and through a slew of job-killing  regulations, he has nearly made good on that promise. His  administration spent 7 years and over $10 million in taxpayer dollars  writing the stream protection rule. Even though the bipartisan 2016  omnibus appropriations bill directed the Interior Department to engage  with the States before finalizing this rule, the agency refused to  comply, leaving crucial voices out of the rulemaking process.   Under this midnight regulation, at least half of the Nation's coal  reserves would be restricted from mining, and one-third of current  coal-related jobs would be at risk. This would mean more devastating  job losses in coal communities across the country, especially in  Kentucky, where we have already got nearly 13,000 miners out of work.   It is time to end the madness and give our communities in the coal  areas a chance to rebuild. I urge support of this resolution.
