 Mr. President, I don't think I am overstating the  severity of the situation when I say that this past week has been one  of the most chaotic and divisive in our Nation's history. The American  people met the news of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's  death with an outpouring of sympathy; but, of course, rather than let  an opportunity go to waste, radicals and activists, fueled by the same  hatred that still fills our streets with violence, emerged from the  shadows and exploited a nation's grief.   Rarely--or perhaps, never before--in the history of this country have  the so-called progressive movement, the activist left, and even some  members of the Senate minority worked so tirelessly to scare the  American people into submission.   Their willingness to use differences in family, religion, and  personal morality to impugn the integrity and competence of Supreme  Court Associate Justice nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett without giving  her the benefit of even a single conversation shocks the conscience. It  is a scandal beneath the dignity of this body.   In the coming weeks, I would encourage my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle to meet with Judge Barrett, as I did today. I think you will  find that she is not trying to get off easy. As a fellow conservative  woman who cherishes a deep faith and commitment to family, I can assure  you, she has already been tested by fire and passed with flying colors.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week, the Senate Committee on  Commerce, Science, and Transportation subpoenaed testimony from Mr.  Jack Dorsey of Twitter, Mr. Sundar Pichai of Alphabet, Inc., and Mr.  Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook.   I supported the issuance of these subpoenas, and I look forward to  hearing testimony on the content moderation policies used by their  respective platforms.   Over the past few months, I have worked with many members of this  body on a statutory fix to section 230 of the Communications Decency  Act, specifically to the ingrained liability shield that platforms like  Facebook use to defend their content moderation policies. Over the  years, we have seen Big Tech's biggest players stretch this shield  beyond all recognition, far beyond the limits Congress envisioned when  they passed the original act in 1996.   Now, content moderators wield their power with abandon, banning and  deleting content they disagree with right alongside content of the most  vile, universally repulsive nature. Last month,  [[Page S6024]]  in response to growing outcries over censorship, I introduced the  Online Freedom and Viewpoint Diversity Act with Chairman Lindsey Graham  and Chairman Roger Wicker to introduce accountability into our dealings  with digital platforms and services.   This bill is unique because it doesn't do specifically what so many  here in Washington would like it to do: It doesn't delete section 230  from the U.S. Code, nor does it put the power to decide what  information should and should not be available online in Congress's or  regulators' hands. All it does is remove ambiguities from the original  statutory language to help companies and consumers better understand  when that liability shield is and is not applicable.   Still, as we move forward with legislation, it is important to  remember that we are creating policy for the internet we have now and  will have in the future and not the internet we had back in 1996, hence  the reason for the subpoenas we are sending to those three Silicon  Valley executives. They are the ones who created the internet we have  today, and their justifications and perspectives regarding the future  of content moderation could prove useful. Subpoenas do change the tone  of the conversation, but we view this as a rare opportunity to glean  both insight and accountability from the tech industry.                            ____________________
