 Mr. Speaker, soulless, disgusting, sickening,  reprehensible, and repulsive--these are not my words but the words of  my Democratic colleagues when asked about the decision of 15 Members  who refused to condemn Hamas' brutal terror attacks on innocent  Israelis.   Some of those 15 didn't stop there. Several of these Members have  gone on to use their massive platforms to accuse Israel of apartheid,  genocide, and war crimes. This rhetoric by Members of Congress is not  only careless, it is dangerous.   American cities and the cities around the world have been flooded  with anti-Israeli protests. Protestors scream for an intifada. They  demand a cleansing of Jews from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean  Sea, the destruction of Israel, and the destruction of the United  States of America.   They ripped down the pictures of Jewish children and Jewish babies  being held hostage in Gaza. It is reprehensible. It is unacceptable.   Hamas is a terrorist organization that does not care about the  Palestinian people. Their goal is to wipe Israel from the face of the  Earth. Babies were burned alive. Babies were beheaded. Women were  raped, beaten, displayed, and then murdered. Children, mothers,  grandmothers, fathers, grandfathers, they were all killed.   Anyone who supports this or refuses to condemn it has no place in the  United States Congress. I don't like censure--I hate censure--but we  have to draw a line in the sand somewhere. We do not entertain hate in  this Congress. We confront it, and we must do it with absolute  conviction.   This is not a freedom of speech issue. This is an issue of the  Congress of the United States having the right to say this is wrong.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this.
