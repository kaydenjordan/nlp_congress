 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman, the ranking member,  for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4323, the  Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act.   I led this bill with the gentleman from Florida because finding ways  to improve higher education for veterans is essential to our economy  and critical to keeping our promise to those who serve.   This legislation advances the great work being done by the National  Science Foundation by requiring NSF to develop a plan to help more  veterans enter science, technology, engineering, and math fields.   In addition, it requires NSF to report available data on veterans  participating in STEM fields.   NSF will also be required to recruit veterans for existing NSF  programs, including the Noyse Teacher Scholarship program, and for  cybersecurity-specific education and training programs.   Finally, this bill creates an interagency committee to help veterans  and their spouses transition to STEM careers, including reporting on  their progress.   All of us understand the challenges veterans face when trying to  further their education, but we have also seen what happens when former  servicemembers are empowered to success as civilians. After World War  II, soldiers returned home to a GI Bill that sparked an era of  innovation and economic growth.   By helping veterans enter STEM education and research programs, this  bill will help build a workforce that is prepared to succeed in the  modern economy. At the same time, it will drive some of our best and  brightest into fields where they can make new discoveries and create  new technologies that will redefine the world for future generations.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to work with my Republican  colleague, Mr. Dunn, and I encourage all Members to support this  legislation.                                time  1815
