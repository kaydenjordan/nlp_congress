 Madam Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.    Madam Speaker, only three times in the history of our  country has the House moved forward with an impeachment process.  Currently, Madam Speaker, in all three of those cases, the House has  taken an actual vote to start the process.    Madam Speaker, my parliamentary inquiry is this: Has the  House been authorized to conduct an impeachment inquiry into President  Trump?    Madam Speaker, we ought to know the answer to that  question.                            ____________________
