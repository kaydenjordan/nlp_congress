 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a  great leader of workers throughout North America and, indeed, the  world, Leo Gerard, who retired this afternoon as the president of the  United Steelworkers.   Leo rose through the ranks and was a dynamic leader of the  steelworkers for 40 years, and he was president for the last 18 years.  He led on so many issues.   He was a fierce negotiator for his members, but he was also a leader  for all workers. For example, he brought the environmental movement and  the labor movement together to tackle tough issues about keeping our  water and air clean for everyone and for future generations, while  protecting our jobs.   But one thing I think stands out. I want to pledge to Leo Gerard on  his retirement that we are not going to pass a replacement NAFTA unless  it honors the workers of Mexico, Canada, and the United States.  [[Page H5816]]    What a great champion for workers in North America. I assure Leo that  we are going to carry on his work.   God bless him.                            ____________________
