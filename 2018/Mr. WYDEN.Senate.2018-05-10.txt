 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I must regretfully object to the Senate  proceeding to the nomination of Christopher C. Krebs of Virginia to be  Under Secretary of the National Protection and Programs Directorate at  the Department of Homeland Security, DHS.   Since November of 2017, I have urged the Department, and Mr. Krebs  specifically, to be more open with the American people about the threat  posed by foreign governments using cellular surveillance technology to  target phones in the United States, including those used by senior  government officials.   In a March 26, 2018, letter, Mr. Krebs revealed to me that DHS ``has  observed anomalous activity in the National Capital Region (NCR) that  appears to be consistent with International Mobile Subscriber Identity  (IMSI) catchers.''   However, as I noted in an April 18, 2018, follow-up letter to Mr.  Krebs, which was also signed by my colleagues Senator Paul, Senator  Gardner, and Senator Markey, DHS has in recent months shared additional  information about these and other incidents with Federal agencies.  Specifically, an official from the DHS National Coordinating Center for  Communications, NCC, gave a detailed presentation to an audience of  Federal Government employees on February 6, 2018. That presentation  included important information that I believe the American people have  a right to know. My colleagues and I asked Mr. Krebs to remove the  ``For Official Use Only,'' FOUO designation from the slides used at  this presentation and make them available for public release.   I remain hopeful that this is an issue we can work through and  resolve soon. However, until the FOUO designation is removed from those  slides and they are made available for public release, I will object to  the Senate proceeding with the Krebs nomination.                            ____________________
