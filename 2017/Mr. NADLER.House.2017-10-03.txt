 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlemen for yielding the  time to me.   Madam Speaker, more than 40 years ago, the Supreme Court held that  women have the constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy prior to  viability or at any time to protect the life and health of the mother.  This bill is flatly unconstitutional on both counts.   The Supreme Court has blocked every other 20-week ban because 20  weeks is well before the point of viability. Further, the bill includes  no exception for the health of the mother, only waiving the ban if a  woman's life is at imminent risk, in clear violation of a woman's  constitutional rights.   Shamefully, the bill places new and cruel restrictions even on women  accessing abortion after rape or incest.   Once again, the Republicans are proclaiming the falsehood that 20- week-old fetuses can feel pain, contrary to the conclusions of every  reputable researcher in the field.   What about women like Danielle from New York, who found out in the  29th week of her pregnancy that her baby's brain was dangerously  deformed and that, if she and the baby were to survive the pregnancy,  the baby would only live a short, extremely painful life.   Danielle and her husband had two young children and faced a  heartbreaking decision: Should they put Danielle and their family  through the pain and suffering of a dangerous pregnancy and birth and  allow their baby to suffer and die in pain, or should she terminate the  pregnancy and mourn their baby as a family?   The Constitution guarantees Danielle the right to make that choice  with her family and her doctors. It does not grant that right to the  politicians sitting in this room.                                time  1630    I will close with Danielle's words: ``What my husband and I  experienced was just so horrible. Unless people have walked in my  shoes, they don't understand. I did what was right for my son and my  family, and it's no one else's business.''   On behalf of Danielle, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  horrible bill. We must stop the bans.
