 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 9640,  the Presidential Tax Filings and Audit Transparency Act of 2022.   This week, I was shocked to find that the IRS did not comply with its  own mandate to conduct annual audits of the President's tax returns.   This mandatory Presidential audit has been in place since 1977. Yet,  during Trump's 4 years in office, only one mandatory audit was even  started and none of the audits were completed. The majority of audits  weren't even started until Trump left office.   The American people deserve transparency and checks and balances for  the President, the most powerful person in the world. The bill before  us would ensure the integrity of this audit in Federal statute and show  the American public that no one is above the law. I urge my colleagues  to vote ``yes.''
