 Mr. Speaker, the consequences of Roe have been  nothing short of devastating. Reporting data indicates that nearly 64  million souls have perished since the fateful decision in 1973.   I want to take this 50th anniversary, a dark moment in our history,  and turn it into an opportunity to remind my fellow Americans of the  gift of life, a gift that I have been so blessed and fortunate to  witness.   My greatest joy has been the birth of my two children, Madeline and  Oliver. In October, we welcomed our son, Oliver Theodore, who was a  month early after my wife, Erin, had a very debilitating and uncertain  pregnancy.   As we spent time in the NICU, we were blessed that our little boy got  stronger every single day. He is now very healthy. We also saw those  parents in the NICU that were praying for their babies' survival after  deliveries at 23 weeks.  [[Page H269]]    We witnessed the true miracle of life and the power of life. We must  be a Nation that cherishes life and gives support to women facing  unintended pregnancies.   Every soul has value and purpose, and it is my pledge that my work in  this distinguished body will be to fervently and faithfully protect the  unborn.                            ____________________
