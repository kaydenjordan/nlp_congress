 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the  life of my good friend and the friend of many Savannahans, Mr. Howard  Morrison, who passed away on January 24.   Mr. Morrison, with his exceptional talent for bringing people  together propelled Savannah to make great strides throughout the  community. A Yale graduate, Mr. Morrison served in the Navy before  embarking on a 30-year banking career in the Savannah banking industry.   He always held firm that the most important contributions to Savannah  were education, healthcare, and community development. To that end, he  worked hard to bring a Georgia Tech campus to the Savannah area.  Georgia Tech Savannah recently presented him with the Opportunity  Award, given to those who have created opportunities for others.   One of Mr. Morrison's closest friends remembers him coaxing numerous  individuals to move to Savannah because of the opportunities, many of  which he was creating himself.   Madam Speaker, I am proud that Savannah had someone like Howard  Morrison, who helped it become the city it is today. His family and his  many friends will be in my thoughts and prayers.
