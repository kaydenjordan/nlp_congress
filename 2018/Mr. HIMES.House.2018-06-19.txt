 Mr. Speaker, I stand to address this Chamber at the start  of this legislative week in a slightly different mode of thinking than  I usually do, because as we have become aware in the last couple of  days, this country is in the midst of a moral and ethical emergency.   Mr. Speaker, we debate lots of things on this floor, and that is a  good thing. We argue about taxes. We argue about our budget. We argue  about the best way to take care of our children, regulations, all sorts  of things where the debate in this Chamber is constructive, sometimes  to a good solution.   What we have become aware of on our southern border is not a  debatable thing. It transcends ideology. It transcends political party.  It gets to the very moral core of all of us as individuals and at the  very thing that makes this country truly exceptional.   We are exceptional for a bunch of reasons. We are a very powerful  country. We are a very wealthy country. But there are other powerful  and wealthy countries.   What makes this country exceptional is that we stand up for values  and morals and ethics. And there is no ethical or moral way to look at  an agent of the United States Government removing a small child from  the arms of his or her mother and to in any way say that that is a  moral act consistent with the values that make this country  exceptional.   There is no debate. There is no ideology. There is no deterrent  effect that would make that okay.   Since our President is uninterested in doing what we all know he  could do, which is to stop this immoral action right now, it is time  for the Congress of the United States, the Representatives of the  people of the United States, of the good people of the United States,  to stand up today and say: That act will not be done in my name.   We should have debates about immigration. We should solve the  immigration challenges that face us. But never ever, ever should we go  to where we are today where the lives of young children are being used  for a deterrent, are being used as legislative leverage.   My colleagues, we have been here before. We interned American  citizens of Japanese descent, because at the time in World War II, we  thought that they might be a threat.   The President promulgates the notion that immigrants are a threat. To  him, immigrants are MS-13. We are all immigrants. This country is great  because we are a Nation of immigrants.   So it is time for us to set aside whatever calculations, whatever  ideology, whatever arguments might be made around the vexing problem of  immigration, and to stop the separation of babies from their parents in  our Nation today.   If we don't do that today, we will be complicit. The Representatives  of the people will be complicit in a moral act that resonates with the  internment of American citizens of Japanese descent. And I don't think  any Democrat or Republican in this Chamber wants their legacy to be  that act.   The President could fix this problem right now. It will take us a  little longer, but because it will take us a little longer and because  I do believe for all the arguments and dysfunction in this Chamber that  we are fundamentally a moral group of people, reflective of the ethical  aspect of our constituents and of our country, that this afternoon is  the time to come together to stop babies being taken from the arms of  their parents in our country and in our name.                            ____________________
