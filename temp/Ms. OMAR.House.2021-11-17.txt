 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of Minnesotans who  are facing the highest housing affordability and childcare  affordability crisis, a massive racial wealth and education gap.  [[Page H6349]]    I rise because Minnesotans spend an average of $16,000 a year on  childcare, as much as they spend on mortgage payments, and Build Back  Better would address it.   I rise because the people of my district have faced the worst housing  shortage in the entire country and Build Back Better would create a  housing acquisition fund to address it.   I rise because we need good union jobs and Build Back Better would  invest in a civilian climate corps, AmeriCorps, and home healthcare  workers being paid fair wages.   I rise because the people of my district need the Build Back Better,  and they can't wait any longer.                            ____________________
