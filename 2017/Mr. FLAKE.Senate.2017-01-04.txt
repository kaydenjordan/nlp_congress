 I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise to speak today about legislation I  am introducing, the Health Savings Account Expansion Act.   Earlier this month, individuals across this country were once again  faced with fewer choices and increased costs when purchasing health  insurance coverage. Unfortunately, this has been a common occurrence  since the Affordable Care Act's inception, but no State, I can tell  you, is feeling the pinch more than my State of Arizona. Prior to the  flawed rollout of the exchanges in 2013, Arizona had 24 health  insurance companies offering plans in the individual market. Just last  year, residents in Arizona's most populous county Maricopa, where I  live, had only 8 private providers to choose from on the exchange--so  from 24 to 8. Then, if that wasn't bad enough, a few months ago,  individuals all across Arizona received notification that their  insurance plans were no longer being offered, despite the current  administration's hollow promise that they could keep their plans. Now  nearly stripped of their preferred health insurance, residents in 14 of  15 Arizona counties--14 out of 15 counties--logged into the ObamaCare  exchanges to shop for new plans only to discover that instead of the  vibrant marketplace they used to have, they were left with only one  insurer to choose from--so from 24 to 8, to 1 for 14 of Arizona's 15  counties.   So today, when I hear my friends on the other side of the aisle  talking about preserving this wonderful program, I am saying ``What  State of denial do you live in?'' because it is certainly not working  in Arizona. In fact, Pinal County in Arizona briefly held the  unfortunate distinction as the only county in America without a single  insurer willing to offer plans on its exchange, not a single one.  Fortunately, a few months later, one stepped in--just one. Of the plans  that were ultimately made available to Arizonans on the exchange, the  average policy came with a premium hike of nearly 50 percent--an  average of nearly 50 percent. With only one game in town, there was no  shopping around for a better deal.   To help put this in perspective, I would like to compare the average  cost of health care coverage in Arizona to one of the most important  purchases a family will ever make, and that is a home. Throughout most  counties in Arizona, it is now cheaper to put a roof over your family's  head than it is to pay your monthly health insurance premium under  ObamaCare.   Let me say that again. Throughout most counties in Arizona, it is now  cheaper to put a roof over your family's head than it is to pay your  monthly health insurance premium under ObamaCare. This is for Maricopa  County. It is the county in which I live and includes Phoenix.  Homeowners can expect to pay nearly $500 more per month on their health  insurance than they do on their house--$500 more on their health  insurance than they do on their house. This is for the ObamaCare silver  plan premium. This is a family--age 40 with two children. So that's  about the median, and this is the median mortgage payment with respect  to Maricopa County--$500 more.   Let's see the visual for Pima County. Pima County is home to Tucson.  Health care premiums ran an average family $100 more per month than  their mortgage. So in Pima County you are still paying more--$100 more  for your health insurance premium than you are for your mortgage.   Then there is Pinal County, the third largest in Arizona. According  to Arizona's Department of Insurance, the average premium for a silver  plan in Pinal County for the average family of four is over $1700. That  is double the median monthly mortgage payment for the same county. If  you live in Pinal County, AZ, you are paying twice as much for your  health insurance premium.   Keep in mind, we are talking about the premium, to say nothing of  what happens when you go to the hospital or to your doctor and you have  to pay deductibles that are through the roof or co-pays that people  have never experienced before. So when they utilize that coverage they  paid for with their premium, they realize they can't afford that  either.   The situation isn't unique to these counties, the three most populous  counties in Arizona. In all 15 of Arizona's counties, premiums for a  family of 4 dramatically exceed the median monthly mortgage.   It is unacceptable for the Federal Government to force families to  spend upwards of $1,700 per month of their hard-earned income on a  substandard product without options or choices, only to then slap them  with a draconian penalty that they simply can't afford to pay for an  untenable law.   Arizona is, without a doubt, ground zero for the structural failures  that are plaguing insurance markets around the country. Insurance  exchanges are on the verge of collapsing; premiums, deductibles, out- of-pocket expenses are skyrocketing; and our health care system is in  desperate need of reform. That is why I stand here today to introduce  the Health Savings Account Expansion Act.   The Health Savings Account Expansion Act goes a long way toward  reforming our health care system by putting consumers back in charge of  their own health care. The bill provides individuals and families with  freedom to choose the health care that best meets their needs and  allows them to use their health savings accounts on medical products  and services they value most.  [[Page S61]]    HSAs give consumers greater control over their health care dollars by  providing them with a tax-advantaged savings option for their medical  expenses. This means that the dollars they work so hard to save can  grow over time, tax free, and can be withdrawn tax free for qualified  medical expenses. The HSA Expansion Act strengthens this important tool  by nearly tripling the arbitrarily low contribution limits, thus  allowing for greater tax equity and more universal participation in  HSAs. The bill would then allow individuals to use these expanded HSAs  to help cover the costs of their monthly health insurance premiums.  This is a critically important feature, particularly for middle-class  families whose incomes fall slightly above the qualified threshold for  subsidies but whose health insurance has become unaffordable.   In Arizona, I like to go to the gym in the morning, and I like to get  on an exercise bike. By that bike is kind of a hallway where people  will walk by. Inevitably, in the morning, I will have a lineup of  people who will stand to tell me their ObamaCare horror stories--how  much their premiums have gone up or that they no longer have any  options or that they have had to pay the penalty or that when they go  to utilize their care, they simply can't afford the co-pays and  deductibles. I can tell you, it is sobering to hear these stories again  and again and again.   In addition to further incentivizing prudent savings for health  expenses, this legislation repeals existing restrictions put in place  by ObamaCare on over-the-counter medications while also reducing the  penalty for withdrawing HSA funds for nonqualified purchases. These  reforms will help streamline HSAs while also making them more user- friendly for consumers.   Arizonans are struggling. They are struggling under the weight of  bureaucracy that is complicating their health care decisions that are  some of the most personal and important decisions individuals make for  themselves and their families. If we hope to lift that burden off the  backs of our constituents, we have to recognize that the key to  reforming our health care system is not more government intervention;  rather, it is allowing individuals the freedom to take back control of  their health care and incentivizing prudent decisionmaking.   As the Senate looks to repeal this disastrous law and replace it with  real reforms that would successfully lower health care costs and  improve choice, I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure  that this legislation is included in those negotiations.                                  ______                                         By Mr. SCHUMER (for Mrs. Feinstein (for herself, Mr. Cornyn, Ms.          Klobuchar, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Franken, Mr. Tillis, Mrs.          Gillibrand, Mr. Markey, and Mr. Flake)):   S. 30.
