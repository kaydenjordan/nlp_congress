 Mr. Speaker, 7 years ago, my son was violently torn from  my life, a victim of gun violence, a victim of a person who had a gun  who should never have received one.   Today, I join my colleagues and former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords  to prevent more families from facing the horror and heartbreak wrought  by gun violence.   Later today, Congressman King and Congressman Thompson will introduce  bipartisan legislation to ensure that no one is able to get a gun from  an unlicensed sale without a background check. Background checks  empower law enforcement to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and  domestic abusers. Quite simply, they save lives.   I am honored to cosponsor this bipartisan legislation for my son,  Jordan, and for the safety of every family in this country. I ask my  fellow parents, my fellow Members, and my fellow Americans to stand  with me today, in support of universal background checks. Together, we  will make our communities safer.                   Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
