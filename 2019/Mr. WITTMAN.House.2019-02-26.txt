 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 47,  the Natural Resources Management Act.   Mr. Speaker, this bill signifies a strong bipartisan consensus and  commitment to protecting our Nation's public resources, including  parks, wildlife, habitat, and access to the outdoors.   Today's vote will help preserve thousands of acres of public land so  that Americans can visit, explore, fish, hunt, and enjoy wildlife in  the outdoors for generations to come.   I am particularly proud of the measure which will provide long-term  sustainability of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I am also proud  to see the important sportsmen's titles included in this bill that will  expand access for recreation, fishing, and hunting on public lands.   I would like to thank Ranking Member Bishop and Chairman Grijalva for  their tireless work to help make this bill a reality.   As a lifelong sportsman and supporter of our Nation's refuges, parks,  and public lands, I urge every Member of this body to support this  legislation so that we can provide permanent stability for the Land and  Water Conservation Fund to improve access for sportsmen and to conserve  wildlife habitat for future generations.
