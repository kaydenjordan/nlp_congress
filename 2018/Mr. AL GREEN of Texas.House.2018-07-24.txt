 Mr. Speaker, I, too, am not enthralled with  the idea of a temporary fix. My preference is a long-term remedy.   While we have different reasons for being opposed to a temporary fix,  the truth is we have no choice at this point. In about a week, the  program will expire.   I know what happens when we are, unfortunately, coping with  hurricanes such as Katrina, which cost us $160 billion. I saw what  happened in New Orleans, Louisiana, after Katrina. The ranking member  and I were there on the ground to see how people who had been quite  prosperous were now having to abandon what was their home, and they had  to move to other places. The Astrodome in Houston, Texas, became the  home for many thousands of people who were fleeing the aftermath of  Katrina.   I saw what happened after Harvey and how people were suffering and  trying to go back into homes that were completely devastated. They had  nowhere else to go.   So we have no choice. We must reauthorize. And 4 months, while it  seems like it is an inappropriate amount of time, does give us some  additional time. My hope is that we will come to some conclusion that  will be acceptable such that we can have a long-term extension.   The Realtors are constantly calling to my attention the need for  certainty in this program. It helps the economy to have certainty. My  belief is we can have certainty, and we must extend.    My belief is we must have certainty and we  must extend. My belief also is this: If not us, who will extend it? If  not now, when will we extend it?
