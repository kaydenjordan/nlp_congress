 Mr. President, today I would like  to commemorate and recognize a weekend-long event happening in a place  I hold very near and dear to my heart, my hometown, Charleston, SC. In  2013, 36 bodies were discovered and unearthed near Anson Street in  downtown Charleston. After years of further historical, archeological  and DNA analysis research, we have learned much more about the stories  of these men, women, and children.   Buried between 1750 and 1800, these people of African descent--some  born in Africa, others born in South Carolina--most likely were  enslaved individuals who helped build the nearby port of Charleston.  This weekend, 6 years after unearthing these individuals and more than  250 years after they were buried, the Gullah Society and the Charleston  community are coming together to hold a naming ceremony, official  release of DNA ancestry results, a reburial ceremony, and an ecumenical  service.   It is the hope of the Gullah Society, a hope shared with myself and  many fellow Charlestonians, that we lay these individuals to rest the  proper way, as well as remember, celebrate, and honor them. While we  recognize these 36 ancestral sons and daughters of South Carolina, we  also will have a chance to remember all others whose graves have been  lost and all others  [[Page S2605]]  upon whose backs Charleston was built.   While Charleston's past is certainly complicated, I believe events  like this serve to inspire us all to create a future of greater  reconciliation, truth telling, equality, and healing in our shared  community. I thank the Gullah Society and all individuals who helped  create or participated in this project, as I believe they do so for the  true benefit and education of us all.                            ____________________
