 Mr. Speaker, the Greek physician Hippocrates once  said: For extreme diseases, extreme methods of cure are most suitable.   While this medicine will have some short-term side effects, it is our  best hope for curing the crisis.   Our Nation is fighting a global pandemic and the prospects of a  looming national disaster. While I have serious concerns with some bad  policies, partisan provisions, and the overall price tag of  this legislation, I am more concerned about inaction, delaying support  for millions of hurting Americans, and the threat of an even costlier  recession for our country.    This national emergency has wreaked havoc on our country and upended  every aspect of our lives. We must move quickly to provide temporary  relief for our working families, small businesses, and frontline  healthcare professionals.   Mr. Speaker, this is uncharted territory. This is an unprecedented  crisis. Extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures.   I stand united with my colleagues and my countrymen in these  difficult days.
