 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member  for yielding, and I thank the gentlewoman for her sponsorship of this.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4300, the Veterans in  Parks Act.   Across the country, our national parks provide endless opportunities  for Americans to learn about our Nation's history and culture.  Additionally, national parks generate significant recreational  opportunities, which encourage visitors to spend time in the outdoors  and enjoy nature.   From Gettysburg to Independence Park, and the Allegheny Portage  Railroad to Valley Forge, Pennsylvania is home to 19 national parks and  7 heritage areas providing these benefits to Pennsylvanians throughout  the Commonwealth and visitors alike. As the representative of  Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District, it continues to be an honor  to serve our veterans, Active-Duty servicemen and -women, and proud  military families.   This legislation would simply give veterans and Gold Star families  free access for life to public lands and also provide free annual  passes to Active-Duty servicemembers. Studies show outdoor recreation  is an effective way to decrease symptoms of PTSD and help veterans  reintegrate with civilian life. This legislation is a step in the right  direction when it comes to assisting our veterans and Active-Duty  servicemembers' health.   H.R. 4300 is one way that we can say thank you to our brave men and  women in uniform who have selflessly served and have already given so  much to protect our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, as the father of a combat-wounded soldier and as the  ranking member of the Committee on Agriculture, which also received  referral on this legislation, I support this legislation. I urge my  colleagues to vote in its favor.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the anniversary of the signing of the Americans with  Disabilities Act.   As someone who spent their career before Congress as a healthcare  rehabilitation professional, I experienced  [[Page H3890]]  firsthand how with the right tools and accessibility, disabled  Americans can live a life of independence, economic self-sufficiency,  and pride.   The Americans with Disabilities Act is a monumental piece of  legislation, opening the doors of opportunity to the millions of  Americans who have a disability, whether it be physical, learning,  cognitive, or any other.   Whether it is protection from discrimination in the workplace,  additional support in school, or added accommodations in our public  venues, the ADA provides the support to better empower those  individuals living with disabilities.   Madam Speaker, while we saw this landmark legislation signed into law  31 years ago today, we must continue to advocate for the rights of  Americans who are living with disabilities. The ADA is an incredible  milestone for Americans living with disabilities, but there is still  more work to be done. We can all continue to do more for those living  with disabilities, from defying prejudice to empowering those with  disabilities in everyday lives.                            ____________________
