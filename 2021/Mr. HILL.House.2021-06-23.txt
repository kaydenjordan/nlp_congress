 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and appreciate him calling  us together tonight to talk about the mistakes that President Biden is  making, the crises that his policies are brewing across a number of  areas.   Tonight, I rise, Mr. Speaker, to address the state of our economic  future.   In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress came together last  year on a bipartisan basis and targeted relief to provide for families  and hardworking Americans.   Now, as vaccines are distributed and Americans are returning to work,  the Biden administration is spending an unprecedented amount of money  in an untargeted way. Six trillion dollars, Mr. Speaker, and $6  trillion of deficits for 10 years to come. They are funding a manic,  untargeted wish list that, in my view, is going to impoverish our kids  and grandkids and contribute to too many dollars chasing too few goods.   When you combine this fiscal policy with the Federal Reserve buying  of $120 billion of Government debt every month, you are brewing  inflation, Mr. Speaker. In my view, inflation is just a tax on  hardworking Americans trying to save for retirement, trying to save  money for kids in college, trying to buy the necessities of gas, food,  build a new home, add onto a home; and this inflation is a tax on  working Americans. Joe Biden and his illiterate economic policy, both  in monetary policy and fiscal policy, are contributors.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans have a better way. We have a better way to  target spending, balance our budget, and not impoverish our kids and  grandkids. If Republicans take this House back, Mr. Speaker, we will  get our economic house in order.
