 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of critical  legislation to support our key ally Israel on the Iron Dome technology  we worked with them to develop.   For 73 years, the United States and Israel have fostered and  strengthened a remarkable relationship rooted in our shared values of  freedom and democracy.   We continue to see those values attacked today.   Israel's national security is key to America's national security and  to our fight against terror.   Earlier this year, terrorists in Gaza including Hamas and the  Palestinian Islamic jihad fired more than 4,500 rockets at innocent  civilians in Israel in just 11 days.   We thank God each day for the Iron Dome, which intercepted 90 percent  of the incoming rockets, saving countless lives.                                time  1300    Unfortunately, some of my colleagues recently used support for this  defense system as a political football. They threatened to shut down  the Federal Government, putting at risk hurricane disaster relief and  help for Afghan refugees, all over support for Iron Dome. It was  outrageous, but now we have a chance to act.   Let's pass this bill, support Iron Dome, and continue our historic,  bipartisan support for the U.S.-Israel relationship. The Senate should  then immediately take up this standalone measure and not let it get  bogged down in the ongoing debt ceiling and continuing resolution  debate.   Mr. Speaker, we must protect our ally, the only democracy in the  Middle East. Our national security is on the line.
