 Madam President, today, I am honored to recognize  in the Record Mrs. Jeri Barr of Marietta, GA, who announced earlier  this year that she would step down from the Center for Family Resources  and whose service to the community will soon be celebrated at a special  event in her honor.   The Center for Family Resources provides service to families and  individuals who are homeless or who are in danger of becoming homeless.  Through short-term housing, job-hunting help, food assistance, and  other services, the organization accomplishes much for the community.   Jeri Barr has been at the helm of the Center for Family Resources in  Cobb County, GA, for 35 years. Cobb is my home county, and I have been  glad to watch this organization grow under her leadership.   When Jeri took over in 1984, the organization had a staff of 11 and a  budget of $350,000. Today, the Center for Family Resources owns and  operates the Mansour Center, a $10 million, 60,000-square-foot facility  that offers space to other nonprofits and conference space for the  public, allowing for additional revenue to benefit the center's  mission. Now, there are 25 staff members, and the organization's budget  is nearly $3.5 million.   For many years, Jeri has given back to the community. She served the  United Way, including as the director of their Volunteer Cobb service.  She also led the East Cobb Newcomers Club, Cobb Christmas, Cobb County  Rape Crisis Center, and Cobb County Community Council. Numerous other  organizations have also benefitted from her work on their boards.  Thanks to her leadership, each of these organizations has benefitted.   While she will be missed by the staff and all those involved with the  Center for Family Resources, I am confident that she has prepared the  organization well for the future. As Jeri and her husband, former U.S.  Representative Bob Barr, prepare for this next exciting chapter, I  congratulate them and wish them much happiness enjoying their children  and grandchildren.                            ____________________
