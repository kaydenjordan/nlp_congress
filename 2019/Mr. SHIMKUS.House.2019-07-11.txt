 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, if this amendment were limited to the 18 per-  and polyfluorinated compounds that EPA knows about and has rendered a  judgment on, we would be having a different debate. Formulations like  PFOA and PFOS, for example, have been studied and have already been  taken out of commercial use.   But this amendment, like others we will be debating, emotionally and  politically requires severe action on an entire class of chemicals,  maybe as many as 5,000 substances. It does so without due diligence and  scientific inquiry.    Nobody denies that there are real concerns and frustration in  communities affected by PFAS contamination. My colleague has raised  those concerns, and we certainly want to help those communities,  especially those that host our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines.  The use of firefighting foam in those areas has caused PFAS to enter  into ditches and canals and seep into groundwater formations.   But while we can and should take action to limit or even prohibit  uncontrolled releases of PFAS-containing firefighting foam, we can't  lose sight of why this foam is used in the first place. If you or your  loved one are on a nuclear submarine that is carrying nuclear weapons  under the Arctic icecap or involved in a fiery aircraft accident on the  runway, you want the best firefighting foam available, not the second  best.   The concern of these communities needs to be addressed, but this is  not what is happening in this process.   Many of the compounds targeted by these amendments are parts of  manufactured goods that when disposed of are not soluble in water.   Let me highlight a couple that have been approved by the Food and  Drug Administration to be inserted into the human body as medical  devices. Yes, lifesaving PFAS-related chemicals have been approved by  the FDA. They are in medical devices and have been approved to be  inserted into the body.   Mr. Chair, to the ranking member and to the chairman, the reason for  the importance of going through regular order in the committee process  is because we understand the chemicals. We deal with healthcare.   As far as lifesaving equipment, we are going to go through a couple  of those. Many recognize what a stent is. This stent is there to open  up arteries, and it saves lives and allows people to live a normal  lifestyle.   This is one that was brought into my office a couple of weeks ago.  Many more children than we would ever guess are born with holes in  their heart. It is tough, but modern medicine and technology have  allowed these children to lead and live normal lives.   How? Well, there is a medical device that is part of these 5,000  compounds of the PFAS community that saves these children's lives and  allows the heart to repair itself, and they go on to live a normal  life.                                time  1815    This is a National Defense Authorization bill, not a healthcare bill,  not a chemical, science, EPA bill. So let's look at national defense.   Here is the F-16, with all the components that have per- or poly- fluorinated compounds as part of the F-16 platform. Do we really want  to essentially ban all these parts that would eventually go into some  landfill, and they are not soluble, and create a Superfund situation  for the landfill into which they go?   We have heard a lot from municipal landfills that are disposing of  legal nonsoluble items in regulated landfills. Do we really want to  place farm land under the Superfund designation because a farmer used  wastewater treatment sludge as a fertilizer?   That is why we must do our due diligence and go through regular order  through the committee of jurisdiction.   I serve as the ranking member on the Committee on Environment and  Climate Change. It is our duty to have oversight over the USEPA; it is  our duty to protect our communities; and it is our responsibility not  to overreact.   Chairman Tonko and I are actively engaged on this issue. As I have  raised this, it is very complicated, but it is not impossible.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject these shortcuts and allow  the committee process to work. That is the only way we can hope to  address PFAS concerns without the significant unintended consequences  this and these other amendments would create. Please vote against the  amendment. Please allow bipartisan discussions to continue.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I want to start talking about science and  jurisdiction and why it is important to go through regular order.   We just heard my colleagues talk about PFAS or PFOS or PFOA, three  different things that mean three different things. What my colleagues  have done is lumped them all into one category. If you eliminate one  class of chemicals, you take the F-16 and you ground it. You have got  Ethernet cables, fiber channel assemblies, round cable assemblies,  shielded twisted pair, EMI.   This is a National Defense Authorization bill, and the Rules  Committee has allowed an amendment on the National Defense  Authorization bill that would ground the F-16s without doing due  justice to science and the committees of jurisdiction.   There are a couple of other problems with the en bloc amendment.   Again, this amendment requires action on all PFAS, all of it. There  may be 3,000 to 5,000 different permutations of this chemical. All  these substances are not alike.   Also, EPA has said it knows little of the PFAS class and only has a  valid tool to really identify 18 out of the 3,000 to 5,000  formulations. If EPA can only identify right now 18, how do you  identify 1,500 permutations of this chemical?   Second, the amendment skirts scientific risk criteria and dismisses  expert administration review, especially the provisions banning PFAS in  MREs--we heard that--and containers.   According to the Food and Drug Administration, I mentioned this  earlier on another amendment, this would ban substances used in  assembling and packaging, which there is no known safety concern. The  FDA approves packaging for food, but we are going to ban packaging for  food when it is the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration,  which is not the jurisdiction of HASC.   Third, as drafted, these amendments could create confusion,  overreach, and mismatched responsibility among Federal partners. The  PFAS ban and the MRE language requires the Defense Logistics Agency to  implement it, but MREs are sold at commercial grocery stores. So are we  going to have the Defense Logistics Agency police PFAS MRE packaging in  the local Piggly Wiggly or Walmart or other guns and knives stores?                                time  1900    The incineration provisions require the Secretary of Defense to  administer and enforce requirements on incineration of items.    So we have been attacking the administration of the  Department of Defense saying they can't do their job, they don't meet  the IG standards, and now we are going to put them in control of air  emissions and clean air standards.   That is what this does when you allow amendments to a bill that are  not germane to the underlying committee.   Last, provisions require the U.S. Geological Survey to come up with  PFAS detection performance standards, instituting a nationalized  sampling program at PFAS-contaminated sites and own the results. Yet  the Environmental Protection Agency, which only has a minor ability to  consult role, has statutory responsibility for cleanup sites. USGS will  be messing around with and will be dependent upon the USGS to obtain  its data.   So it is the EPA that is responsible for cleanup, but we are going to  give  [[Page H5650]]  the U.S. Geological Survey the responsibility.   Many of these amendments are not germane to the defense authorization  or have received process to ensure they don't create problems. Quality  work in these areas would have followed regular order. Americans  deserve that we are as careful doing our jobs as they are doing theirs.  We mentioned this in the other amendment.   I am working with Chairman Tonko to address perfluorinated compounds.  It is a very difficult issue. We have experts in the majority; we have  experts in the minority that deal with chemicals. This is not the place  to do it, and I would ask people to vote against the amendment en bloc.
