 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor two valued members  of Missouri's defense community, Staff Sergeant Ryan McCarthy and Staff  Sergeant Chad Hickey. They are both stationed out of Fort Leonard Wood  in Missouri's Fourth District, and these soldiers are exceptional  representatives of their base, their State, and their service branch-- the United States Army.   Both men recently received top honors at the Association of the  United States Army's Annual Meeting and Exposition, where they were  recognized for their leadership, excellence, and achievements.   Staff Sergeant McCarthy, who is right here, was named the  Noncommissioned Officer of the Year by AUSA. A combat engineer with  more than 9 years of service, McCarthy has served multiple deployments  in Iraq and Afghanistan. His dedication and leadership represent the  best ideals of our Army and America's fighting forces.   Another Fort Leonard Wood soldier, Staff Sergeant Chad Hickey,  pictured here, was named Drill Sergeant of the Year. Hickey received  the honor after winning a grueling fitness, endurance, and combat- readiness competition  [[Page H7989]]  against the Nation's top drill sergeants.   The fact that Staff Sergeant McCarthy and Staff Sergeant Hickey are  both from Fort Leonard Wood is no surprise. The men and women stationed  there serve with strength, seriousness, and purpose, setting an example  of military leadership for the entire Army.   To Staff Sergeants McCarthy and Hickey, and to all of the soldiers  stationed at Fort Leonard Wood, I wish to extend to each and every one  of you and your families our gratitude and congratulations.                            ____________________
