 Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the Liebengood  Family Statement on the January 6 Commission and Security Supplemental.   Liebengood Family Statement on the January 6 Commission and Security                                Supplemental         ``We believe a thorough, non-partisan investigation into       the root causes of and the response to the January 6th riot       is essential for our nation to move forward. Howie's death       was an immediate outgrowth of those events. Every officer who       worked that day, as well as their families, should have a       better understanding of what happened. Uncovering the facts       will help our nation heal and may lessen the lingering       emotional bitterness that has divided our country. We implore       Congress to work as one and establish the proposed       Commission.        Additionally, improved mental health for USCP officers has       been one of our goals for the past four months. Through the       tireless efforts of Congresswoman Wexton, we are honored a       wellness program bearing Howie's name has been proposed in       the security supplemental along with more resources for the       program. We welcome and support the new funding and staffing       initiatives that will help prevent future tragedies among the       USCP.''     Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this  legislation. The January 6 insurrection led to the deaths of U.S.  Capitol police officers Brian Sicknick and Howie Liebengood and Metro  Police Officer Jeffrey Smith.   We have heard many stories of the broken bones and broken spirits  that officers are still suffering to this day. They have been working  around the clock since the insurrection, and are facing unsustainable  hours due to being understaffed. It is heartbreaking. And it is also  infuriating to hear other Members on this floor attempt to rewrite  history and gaslight those officers with lies about January 6.   I am proud to have helped secure millions of dollars in funding  through this bill for enhancement of mental health services, which  includes six new counselors who will help the Capitol Police during  this crisis and into the future.   I want to especially thank the family of fallen Capitol Police  Officer Howie Liebengood, his wife, Serena, his siblings, John and  Anne, for their advocacy on this bill. I hope that it is some solace to  them that during this tragic time, that once this bill is signed into  law, the Capitol Police Wellness Center will be renamed after Howie, so  his life, legacy, and service to our Capitol will forever be  remembered.   Madam Speaker, the Capitol Police cannot wait until the end of the  year for the funding. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting  this legislation.
