 Madam President, I rise today to discuss the nomination  of Scott Pruitt.   I understand when we hit high noon, there will be time for prayer.  You tell me, and we will yield back and get this done.   I want to talk about the nomination of Scott Pruitt and how this  important vote will impact my home State. So many folks call Montana  home today because their parents or grandparents or great-grandparents  pushed west to start a new life in the homestead era. My family is no  different.   I am proud and honored that my wife and I are still able to farm the  land that my grandparents homesteaded over a century ago. I know that  it does not matter if you are growing alfalfa, winter wheat, spring  wheat, safflower, or garbanzo beans. I know it doesn't matter if you  are raising cattle or sheep or hogs. You have to have access to clean  water or you cannot succeed in agriculture.   In Montana, agriculture is the number one industry. Local economies  around our State are driven by that agriculture economy, whether it is  farms or ranches. In a good year, our State's wheat production alone  will clear a trillion dollars.   This production not only helps create jobs and farms and ranches but  it boosts the bottom line for the local grocery store, the hardware  store, and local construction crews keep busy. Agriculture is the  backbone of Montana's economy, but it is not the only industry in  Montana that relies on clean air and clean water.   Montana's outdoor economy is growing rapidly every year. Hunting,  fishing, hiking, and camping generate over $6 billion and sustain over  64,000 jobs in Montana each and every year. More folks are visiting  Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks every summer.   And when they visit, these folks spend millions of dollars in  communities outside the parks. Communities like Gardner, Livingston,  Coram, and Columbia Falls constantly have packed restaurants and bars  and hotels, thanks to our clean water and our clean air. Folks are  flocking to Montana because of those assets.                                    prayer     Madam President, folks are coming to Montana from all  over this country because of our clean air and clean water and the  habitat it provides. Not only Montanans, but this entire country  respects clean air and clean water. In fact, in Montana, it is  Montana's Constitution that says we value clean air and clean water.   The reason we place such a high importance on clean air and clean  water is because we see what happens when it is put at risk. On  numerous occasions, Montanans have been victims to corporations who  treated Montana like a Third World country. They reaped the value of  our natural resources, and then they left the American taxpayer to  clean up the mess. Folks like the Anaconda Company, W.R. Grace,  Glencore, just to name a few.   They left a mess. It wasn't the EPA that left that mess. It was these  corporations, and it is the EPA's job to make sure they clean up this  mess, not out of the pocketbook of the American taxpayer. These folks,  these corporations, have put our clean air and clean water at risk. Not  only did they contaminate the land, they contaminated our local  economies. One of the largest Superfund sites in this country is in  Butte, MT. It took 16 years, nearly $150 million to clean up just a  portion--just a small portion of what the Anaconda Company left behind  after mining copper in Southwest Montana.   In Libby, hundreds of people have died, and over 1,000 people are ill  because of asbestosis due to asbestos exposure. Even though a local  vermiculite mine closed in 1990, folks are still getting sick due to  asbestos-related diseases.   And for years, I have been fighting alongside the folks at Columbia  Falls, MT, to hold Glencore accountable to that community for the  cyanide and arsenic they left abandoned on the banks of the Flathead  River near the gateway of Glacier National Park.   Companies that put our clean water at risk cannot be trusted because  they never stick around to clean up the mess they have made. We have  seen it firsthand. And that is why we need an EPA Administrator who is  going to side with the American taxpayer, with local economies, with  local families, and hold the polluters and contaminators accountable  for their shortsighted actions.   It is for these reasons that I cannot support Scott Pruitt's  nomination for Administrator of the EPA. Throughout his career, he has  consistently sided with the big polluters over the local businesses and  the local families.   I am not convinced that Mr. Pruitt understands the critical role that  clean air and clean water plays in agriculture and our outdoor  economies. In my conversations with Mr. Pruitt, I received no  assurances that he will be a  [[Page S1388]]  champion for Montana's family farmers, ranchers, those who love to  hunt, fish, and hike in Big Sky Country. Mr. Pruitt has endorsed  policies that will put Montana jobs at risk and put our outdoor  heritage on the ropes.   Don't just take my word for it. Thousands of Montanans have contacted  my office regarding Mr. Pruitt's nomination. Caitlin from Libby wrote  me:         No community understands the grave impact lack of       regulation or failure to enforce environmental regulations       can have on a community like Libby does. Four hundred people       died in Libby because W.R. Grace mined vermiculite that was       contaminated with asbestos. . . . These people died . . .       when they were just doing their job. Libby doesn't want or       need another person that looks the other way while big       corporations prey on hard-working people.    Stephen from Corvallis wrote:         I am a farmer in Montana, and I regularly use pesticides,       where I hope the EPA has my back to make sure these things       are safe for me and the environment. . . . Farming continues       to be less predictable, due to a change in climate. I want       someone in that position that has my back as a farmer, not       someone that questions broad scientific consensus.    Rich is a retired public lands manager from Stevensville who wrote me  saying this about Pruitt:         Is not fit to be leading an agency responsible for       protecting wildlife, clean water, clean air, and leading the       charge of addressing a changing climate. Pruitt is anti-      science, routinely disregarding well-established studies       involving climate change. I recently retired . . . the       thought of the possible damage and undoing of what I've lived       and worked for over my [entire] life by this man is       disheartening to say the least.    Look, folks, the Earth's climate is changing. There is no ifs, ands,  or buts about that. If we want to be able to continue to take our fly  rod and go fishing down those rivers, you have to have somebody in the  EPA who will ensure that we have clean water and clean air. I will tell  you something that happened in Montana for the first time this year.  The Yellowstone River closed. The bottom reason for it was the water  warmed that much. If you are going to have good habitat for fisheries,  if you are going to have good habitat for elk and big game hunting, if  you are going to be able to go up in the mountains and hike, fish,  bike, and do the things we do in Montana, you have to have somebody in  the EPA that makes a difference.   What we do today will not be felt today. It will be felt tomorrow.  That is why today we need a man in the position of EPA who will fight  for clean water and clean air. It is critical to our survival, no ifs,  ands, or buts about it.   Stephen, Caitlyn and Rich are right. We need folks in the  administration who will stand up and understand the value of clean air  and clean water. Unfortunately, the President has nominated someone who  can't deliver. Therefore, I will oppose Mr. Pruitt's nomination and  urge my colleagues to do the same.   I yield the floor.
