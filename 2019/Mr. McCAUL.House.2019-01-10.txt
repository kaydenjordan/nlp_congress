 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Let me first congratulate Mr. Engel on his ascension to the  chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I can't think of a  better chairman to work with than Mr. Engel, who is always bipartisan,  always says that partisanship stops at the water's edge. And I know,  being a national security committee, that we will conduct ourselves  with dignity and respect for each other. We may disagree from time to  time, but we will always respect each other. I look forward to working  with him in this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a bill I sponsored with Mr.  Castro of Texas, the Protecting Diplomats from Surveillance Through  Consumer Devices Act.   Last year, a report revealed the risk of using wearable technologies  such as Fitbits and Apple watches which use GPS tracking. As the report  stated, researchers were able to track the movements of deployed troops  in overseas locations. This obviously poses an enormous security risk  for our soldiers overseas. Enemies could track patrol routes or  discover the location of secret foreign installments.   This exposure puts our diplomats at risk as well. We have men and  women engaging in diplomatic efforts all over the world, often in  sensitive and high-risk areas. We must not make it easier for our  enemies to track their movements.   As such, our bill requires the Department of State to establish a  policy on the use of location tracking consumer devices by diplomats at  U.S. facilities around the world. We introduced this bill last year,  and it passed in a large bipartisan fashion.   I want to thank Mr. Castro for his leadership, as well as Chairman  Engel for his work on this important legislation. I urge my colleagues  to support.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I think protecting our diplomats  and ensuring sensitive and classified areas is really critical to our  national security. This bill does that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of the U.S.-Mexico Economic Partnership Act  authored by my good friend and fellow Texan, Mr. Cuellar.   As a native Texan, I know how critical the U.S.-Mexico relationship  is to the prosperity and security of our two nations. And as the former  chairman of the U.S.-Mexico IPG, I had the honor of leading  congressional delegations to sit down with our Mexican counterparts to  discuss bilateral issues, such as trade and security, and just recently  went down for the President's inauguration. These legislative exchanges  have been imperative for furthering the relationship between our two  nations.   However, we must look beyond traditional and shared connections and  foster cultural and academic partnerships and grow the U.S.-Mexico  relationship among the younger generations. This bill achieves that  goal by creating academic exchanges in the private sector that are  focused on health and energy. This academic pipeline will strengthen  our energy infrastructure and develop new generations of medical  professionals who could work in both of our countries.   This bill complements the economic growth initiatives and the  recently negotiated USMCA trade agreement, and it promotes the U.S.- Mexico relationship at the committee level.   Again, as I mentioned just a few weeks ago, I had the pleasure of  attending the inauguration of President Lopez Obrador in Mexico City  with many of my colleagues. Our two countries have had a very proud  history together, and I think these are times, trying times, as the  chairman mentioned, but I think that is why this bill is so important.  I think we can have a brighter future together between our two nations.  I urge my colleagues to support it to strengthen this relationship.   In closing, I would like to once again thank Mr. Cuellar for leading  this message. Growing up in Texas, I dealt with our Mexican  counterpart, their largest trading partner, have done a lot with  Mexico. When I was in the Attorney General's Office, I met with Mexico  periodically, and also as a Member of Congress.   This is an important relationship between our countries. While there  have been moments of disagreement, I think it is important that our  countries remain allies and we are friends with our neighbors to the  south.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of my bill, the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism  Partnership Act. This bill passed the House last year. I am pleased  that the chairman and I were able to make it an early priority in this  Congress.   This legislation strengthens our counterterrorism operations in  Africa, an area where the terror threat is rapidly rising.                                time  1515    Our military successes in Iraq and Syria have splintered ISIS,  squeezed terrorists out of the Middle East, and sent them fleeing to  Africa. The numbers are alarming.   On the eve of 9/11, al-Qaida had only a few hundred followers. Today,  it is estimated that 10,000 ISIS and al-Qaida jihadists have  established bases across the continent.   Along with other existing terrorist organizations, such as Boko  Haram, terrorism is taking hold in Africa and prohibiting its  prosperity. We know that these groups have plotted attacks that  threaten U.S. interests, and some have succeeded.   The Trump administration recently released their Africa strategy. It  appropriately prioritizes U.S. efforts to counter radical Islamic  terrorism on the continent. I applaud their continued focus on this  issue.   My bill, which I introduced with my friend Mr. Keating, authorizes  for the first time a program called the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism  Partnership. This program works with countries such as Chad, Mali,  Niger, and Nigeria to build their capacity to conduct counterterrorism  operations, prevent the spread of violent extremism, and strengthen the  rule of law.   Furthermore, it requires the State Department, USAID, and the Defense  Department to work together to develop a counterterrorism strategy in  Africa. By taking a multifaceted approach and better coordinating our  efforts, we can prevent terrorism from gaining a larger foothold in  these countries.   Again, I thank Mr. Engel and I thank Mr. Keating for their shared  support of this cause, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank Chairman Engel and Congressman  Keating. The bill authorizes a really important interagency effort to  combat terrorism and prevent the spread of radical Islamist extremism  in Africa. As ISIS and other terrorist ideologies are degraded in the  Middle East, they are, unfortunately, finding a safe haven in Africa.   We must partner with other nations to work to combat these threats  before they impact the homeland. This bill will increase congressional  oversight from our committee and better coordinate U.S. assistance.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill to ensure that  American efforts to fight the scourge of anti-Semitism are as strong as  possible.   In December, the European Union released the results of a survey of  over 16,500 European Jews. The results of this survey are, frankly,  disturbing.   In its report, the EU wrote that anti-Semitism pervades everyday  life. It also stated that anti-Semitism undermines Jews' feelings of  safety and security and that anti-Semitic harassment is so common that  it becomes normalized.   Europe is not alone in seeing a resurgence of anti-Semitism.  Textbooks across the Middle East teach children to hate Jews.  Malaysia's Prime Minister has repeated offensive, anti-Semitic  statements. Here in the United States, we were devastated by the attack  on a Pittsburgh synagogue in October. No region or country is immune  from this hatred.   In 2004, the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act was passed into law,  establishing a Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism. This  position was created to combat this threat worldwide through bilateral  relationships and international organizations such as the European  Union and the United Nations. Fifteen years later, we need to modernize  the way our government is set up to fight this hatred.   This bipartisan bill, which has been previously introduced in the  House and passed in the House, requires the President to appoint a  Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism. The bill also  elevates the Special Envoy position to the rank of Ambassador and  ensures direct access to the Secretary of State. It is finally time for  the stature of this position to reflect the level of work that must be  done.   Unfortunately, a Special Envoy has yet to be nominated under this  administration, and I strongly urge the President to appoint a  qualified candidate as soon as possible.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank Congressman Chris Smith for  introducing this important bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Smith), who is the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), the cosponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) for his  hard work to ensure that anti-Semitism remains at the top of our  country's foreign policy agenda. I, too, echo my colleagues' on the  other side of the aisle plea to this administration in a bipartisan way  to appoint a Special Envoy.  [[Page H437]]    If I can just conclude by saying that I am the son of a World War II  veteran. My father was a bombardier on a B-17. He was part of the D-day  air campaign. He bombed the Nazis. We saw the horrors of Nazi Germany.  I have been to Auschwitz to see the horrors of the gas chambers and  what the Nazis perpetrated against the Jewish people. We thought it was  stamped out then. We thought it was over. And yet it is not. It is hard  to believe that so many years later, anti-Semitism and neo-Nazis still  exist in this world.   It is my sincere hope, with this Special Envoy we can truly make a  difference--the Greatest Generation fought against it--and that this  scourge will be eliminated entirely from the planet.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
