 How humbled I am to be on the floor of the House  with fellow Americans who can speak eloquently about the history that  is so deeply seated in my history and the history of so many Americans.   How honored I am, Congresswoman Scanlon, that you come from the great  State of Pennsylvania that has a storied history. For some of us, we  remember Gettysburg, but there are many other aspects, which I have had  the privilege of visiting.  [[Page H2857]]    I always say to America: Learn America. It is a beautiful place, but  it is a historic place.   To my friend from Pennsylvania, the manager and Rules Committee  member, how honored I am to have you, a fellow Pennsylvanian, in terms  of the minority's manager, on the floor today. You know full well the  fight of the Union soldiers, and I am sure that you have in your  constituency or in the State descendants of those fights.   Mr. Speaker, I can stand here today to say, with Senator Markey,  Senator Cornyn, Senator Smith, and my colleague of long-suffering,    Danny Davis, who began this journey with me, the act or the thought of  racial divide crushes to the floor on this bright and sunny day as we  bring from the Senate the legislation that I offered, H.R. 1320, in the  form of S. 475, the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, companion  legislation to H.R. 1320 in the House.   The House was the leader, although I am always glad to embrace the  dynamic leadership of the Senate. We have over 160 more sponsors  coming, bipartisan sponsors.   My good friend and colleague from Texas, Randy Weber, actually  represents Galveston, and I want to share his name on the floor.                                time  1445    But I introduce this to make Juneteenth a Federal holiday to  commemorate the end of chattel slavery, America's original sin, and to  bring about celebration, crushing racial divide down to a point of  unity to this Earth, and it is because of the perseverance, the  strength of our mutual communities, African Americans that struggle for  equality.   Now, I would be remiss if I did not at least appoint that slavery was  real. These are the brutal backs upon which the whip went over and over  and over again, not only men, women, children, possibly, as history  recounts.   The history is limited because it is slave narrative, that I might  very humbly and respectfully say, those stories are in broken English.  But I remember one where a woman slave said to a husband that had been  either taken away or had been a freed slave to another plantation; she  said, Husband, come back, come back, they are about to sell me and your  children to different places. That is what this moment in time in  history represents for us.   But look where we are today. Look where we are. In the midst of what  people have described as racial divide, we have now come to a place  where we acknowledge the 47 States that have done a celebratory,  unified, and multicultural celebration of Juneteenth. Let me tell you  why, just for a moment.   Juneteenth is as significant to African Americans as it will be to  Americans because we, too, are Americans, and it means freedom.   Juneteenth. On June 19, 1865, General Granger found himself on the  shores of Galveston--Senator Cornyn and myself will be in Galveston  this very Juneteenth. How coincidental. Can you imagine, how short I  am, I will be standing maybe taller than Senator Cornyn, forgive me for  that, because it will be such an elevation of joy, but we will be there  for a historic celebration.   But Juneteenth came in June of 1865, and shortly thereafter, in the  next few months, the 13th Amendment declared slavery unconstitutional  in the United States. I think it is important to read these words.  These are the words of General Granger, coming all the way from  Washington, D.C., of General Order No. 3.   You know, we like legislation, but I will tell you, can you imagine  all of the slaves who were not free 2 extra years? They gathered  around, they knew something was happening. There was no telegram and  there was no cyber, there was no email or tweets.    Mr. Speaker, the people of Texas are informed that,  in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United  States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of  rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and  the connection therefore existing between them becomes that of employer  and hired labor. It is a day of freedom.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Rules Committee, Chairman McGovern,  and Ranking Member Cole. I want to thank them for their commitment in  bringing this to us. I want to thank Majority Leader Hoyer, Speaker  Pelosi, the whip, Mr. Clyburn, the chairman, Mr. Jeffries, and all of  the leadership on both sides of the aisle that have brought us to this  point.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, the  Chair of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security,  and the principal sponsor in the House of the Juneteenth National  Independence Day Act, I rise in strong and enthusiastic support of the  Rule and the underlying legislation, S. 475, the Senate companion to  the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, which establishes June 19  as a federal holiday.   I applaud the U.S. Senate for passing S. 475, Juneteenth National  Independence Day Act, companion legislation to H.R. 1320, which I  introduced to make Juneteenth a federal holiday to commemorate the end  of chattel slavery, America's Original Sin, and to celebrate the  perseverance that has been the hallmark of the African American  struggle for equality.   I thank Senator Markey of Massachusetts, my senior senator, Senator  John Cornyn of Texas, and others who spearheaded this effort in the  Senate, and Senate Majority Leader Schumer for his support and for  using his legislative skills to ensure the bill was voted on and  passed.   Mr. Speaker, now it is time for the House of Representatives to act  swiftly and bring to the floor, vote on, pass the Juneteenth National  Independence Day Act, and send it to the desk of President Biden for  signature.   With the President's signature, the federal government will join 47  states in recognizing as a holiday Juneteenth, the day that has been  celebrated by African Americans for 156 years and has been called  rightly as 'America's second Independence Day.'   Let me extend on behalf of all of us who have labored to pass this  important legislation our deep appreciation to the House leadership,  particularly Majority Leader Hoyer, for their support which paved the  way for the House last year to pass by unanimous consent H. Res. 1001,  the resolution I introduced recognizing Juneteenth Independence Day.   As I have said many times, Juneteenth is as significant to African  Americans as July 4 is to all Americans because on that day, June 19,  155 years ago, General Gordon Granger, the Commanding Officer of the  District of Texas, rode into Galveston, Texas and announced the freedom  of the last American slaves; belatedly freeing 250,000 slaves in Texas  nearly two and a half years after Abraham Lincoln signed the  Emancipation Proclamation.   When General Granger read these words of General Order No. 3 set off  joyous celebrations of the freedmen and women of Texas:   ``The people of Texas are informed that in accordance with a  Proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are  free. This involves an absolute equality of rights and rights of  property between former masters and slaves, and the connection  therefore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired  laborer.''   Juneteenth thus made real to the last persons living under the system  of chattel slavery, of human bondage, the prophetic words of President  Abraham Lincoln delivered November 19, 1863, at Gettysburg ``that this  nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom--and that  government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not  perish from the earth.''   Juneteenth was first celebrated in the Texas state capital in 1867  under the direction of the Freedmen's Bureau and remains the oldest  known celebration of slavery's demise, commemorating freedom while  acknowledging the sacrifices and contributions made by courageous  African Americans towards making our great nation the more conscious  and accepting country that it has become.

It commemorates freedom while acknowledging the sacrifices and  contributions made by courageous African Americans towards making our  great nation the more conscious and accepting country that it has  become.   As the nation prepares to celebrate July 4th, our nation's  independence day, it is a time to reflect on the accomplishments of our  nation and its people.  [[Page H2858]]    General Granger's reading of this order ended chattel slavery, a form  of perpetual servitude that held generations of Africans in bondage in  the United States for two-hundred and forty-eight years and opened a  new chapter in American history.   Recognizing the importance of this date, former slaves coined the  word ``Juneteenth'' to mark the occasion with a celebrations the first  of which occurred in the Texas state capital in 1867 under the  direction of the Freedmen's Bureau.   Juneteenth was and is a living symbol of freedom for people who did  not have it.   Juneteenth remains the oldest known celebration of slavery's demise.   It commemorates freedom while acknowledging the sacrifices and  contributions made by courageous African Americans towards making our  great nation the more conscious and accepting country that it has  become.   The celebration of Juneteenth followed the most devastating conflict  in our country's history, in the aftermath of a civil war that pitted  brother against brother, neighbor against neighbor and threatened to  tear the fabric of our union apart forever that America truly became  the land of the free and the home of the brave.   The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once said, ``Freedom is never  free,'' and African American labor leader A. Phillip Randolph often  said ``Freedom is never given. It is won.''   Truer words were never spoken.   We should all recognize the power and the ironic truth of those  statements, and we should pause to remember the enormous price paid by  all Americans in our country's quest to realize its promise.   Juneteenth honors the end of the 400 years of suffering African  Americans endured under slavery and celebrates the legacy of  perseverance that has become the hallmark of the African American  experience in the struggle for equality.   In recent years, a number of National Juneteenth Organizations have  arisen to take their place alongside older organizations--all with the  mission to promote and cultivate knowledge and appreciation of African  American history and culture.   Juneteenth celebrates African American freedom while encouraging  self-development and respect for all cultures.   But it must always remain a reminder to us all that liberty and  freedom are precious birthrights of all Americans, which must be  jealously guarded and preserved for future generations.   I urge all members to support the rule and the underlying  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York  for her courtesies.   Mr. Speaker, it has been a long journey. It has not been yesterday,  the day before, or last month, or a few years before. One could argue  that it has been 12 years on this floor of the House.   So many people have been involved:   Danny Davis; my colleagues in  the United States Senate, Senator Cornyn and Senator Markey; Barbara- Rose Collins, some 25 years ago with a resolution; others unnamed; and  organizations across the Nation and some international.   It has been a long journey. It has not been an easy journey. When we  stand here today, we should be reminded of the fact that there were  people who continued to experience the whips of a whip for 2 more  years, even as Abraham Lincoln stood in the shining sun in the  aftermath of Gettysburg to unite the Union and proclaim the slaves free  in 1863.   Just a few years ago, I had the teary privilege of being, at  midnight, in the National Archives, looking at that document. Then, of  course, it took 2 years for General Granger to get to Texas. But in  that 2 years, we realize that tragedy continued and brutality  continued, even into the 20th century.  [[Page H2866]]    I salute the miraculous coming together today of the House  leadership, the Speaker, Leader Hoyer, Whip Clyburn, Chairman Jeffries,  and others who brought this to the floor through a rule, Chairman  McGovern, and then a debate. Then, of course, here we are today. It is  a long journey, but here we are.   I am grateful, as I said earlier, that racial divide has fallen out  of the sky, and we are crushing it to the Earth for this day, for the  Juneteenth holiday.   H.R. 1320 was a bipartisan bill with over 166 sponsors, as well as  now S. 475. We are delighted to note that the President will sign this  bill.   When the words of General Granger were said--the people of Texas and  other places are informed that in accordance with the proclamation from  the executive, all slaves are free--then, in the same year, the 13th  Amendment was passed.   This bill and this day are about freedom. At Gettysburg, that is what  President Lincoln said in 1863, that this Nation under God shall have a  new birth of freedom.   Why can't we continue on this pathway as we push the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act, as we come together on the Voting Rights Act,  as we realize that there is another path for America to take, that my  freedom is your freedom and your freedom is my freedom?   Yes, slaves suffered continuously. Even in the 20th century, they  were hung. Yet, we have a time today, miraculously, to be able to  debate and vote on the floor of the House. Diverse persons can stand  and join this.   So, I offer to my colleagues: Be reminded that this has been a long  journey. There have been mountains and valleys, but we stand here  today, free to vote for the Juneteenth National Independence Day, a  Federal holiday for America. Freedom is now.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, the  Chair of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security,  and the principal sponsor in the House of the Juneteenth National  Independence Day Act, I rise in strong and enthusiastic support of S.  475, the Senate companion to the Juneteenth National Independence Day  Act I introduced on February 25, 2021, which establishes June 19 as a  federal holiday.   I applaud the U.S. Senate for passing S. 475, Juneteenth National  Independence Day Act, companion legislation to H.R. 1320, which I  introduced to make Juneteenth a federal holiday to commemorate the end  of chattel slavery, America's Original Sin, and to celebrate the  perseverance that has been the hallmark of the African American  struggle for equality.   I thank Senator Markey of Massachusetts for contacting my office with  his request to introduce the Senate companion to H.R. 1320 for this  Congress, and to my senior senator, Senator John Cornyn of Texas for  his steadfast support of the Juneteenth holiday over the years, and  others who spearheaded this effort in the Senate, and Senate Majority  Leader Schumer for his support and for using his legislative skills to  ensure the bill was voted on and passed.   Mr. Speaker, the process that has brought us to this day has been  bipartisan, bicameral, cooperative, and constructive beginning with my  collaboration in the 116th Congress with former Senator Doug Jones of  Alabama and Senator Cornyn of Texas to coordinate the introduction and  cultivate the necessary support for the Juneteenth National  Independence Day Act.   That partnership has continued through the 117th Congress with the  addition of Senator Markey of Massachusetts as the lead Democratic  sponsor in the Senate.   The bipartisan H.R. 1320, the House version of S. 475, is sponsored  by 166 Members from all regions of the country, including two of my  Republican colleagues from Texas, Congressman Van Taylor and  Congressman Randy Weber.   Mr. Speaker, now it is time for the House of Representatives to act  swiftly and bring to the floor, vote on, pass the Juneteenth National  Independence Day Act, and send it to the desk of President Biden for  signature.   With the President's signature, the federal government will join 47  states in recognizing as a holiday Juneteenth, the day that has been  celebrated by African Americans for 156 years and has been called  rightly as 'America's second Independence Day.'

As the Nation prepares to celebrate July 4th, our Nation's  independence day, it is a time to reflect on the accomplishments of our  Nation and its people.   The celebration of Juneteenth followed the most devastating conflict  in our country's history, in the aftermath of a civil war that pitted  brother against brother, neighbor against neighbor and threatened to  tear the fabric of our union apart forever that America truly became  the land of the free and the home of the brave.   Juneteenth honors the end of the 400 years of suffering African  Americans endured under slavery and celebrates the perseverance that  has been the hallmark of the African American experience in the  struggle for equality.   But as the poet Langston Hughes reminds us in his famous poem,  ``Mother to Son,'' life in America for African Americans ``ain't been  no crystal stair.''   The post-bellum period in America was marked by violence and  terrorism against African Americans as they sought to make real the  promises of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.   General Granger's reading of General Order No. 3 ended the remaining  vestiges of the system of chattel slavery, a form of perpetual human  bondage that held generations of Africans in captivity in the United  States for 248 years and opened a new chapter in American history.   Recognizing the importance of this date, former slaves coined the  word ``Juneteenth'' to celebrate the occasion, the first of which  occurred in the Texas state capital in 1867 under the direction of the  Freedmen's Bureau.

It commemorates freedom while acknowledging the sacrifices and  contributions made by courageous African Americans in the quest to make  our lives more perfect.   The celebration of Juneteenth followed the most devastating conflict  in our country's history, in the aftermath of a civil war that pitted  brother against brother, neighbor against neighbor and threatened to  tear the fabric of our union apart forever that America truly became  the land of the free and the home of the brave.

In recent years, a number of National Juneteenth Organizations have  arisen to take their place alongside older organizations--all with the  mission to promote and cultivate knowledge and appreciation of African  American history and culture.   I am reminded that the first legislation introduced in Congress  recognizing Juneteenth occurred a quarter century ago, in 1996, when  H.J. Res. 195 was introduced by Congresswoman Barbara Rose Collins of  Michigan, and I have introduced similar legislation annually since the  109th Congress.   So it has been a long road we have travelled to get to this day, even  longer that the  [[Page H2867]]  15-year journey taken to pass the bill making the Birthday of the Rev.  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. a national holiday.   Juneteenth celebrates African American freedom, and in so doing  celebrates America's history and promise, while encouraging self- development and respect for all cultures.   But it must always remain a reminder to us all that liberty and  freedom are precious birthrights of all Americans, which must be  jealously guarded and preserved for future generations.   In conclusion, I wish to take a moment to salute two of the unsung  heroes who helped bring us to this day: the late Texas State  Representative Al Edwards and nonagenarian Opal Lee, known  affectionately as the ``Grandmother of Juneteenth.''   In 1852, Frederick Douglass famously asked: ``What to the slave is  the 4th of July?''   In 2021, we can reply that it is the beginning of the American  Promise that would be fulfilled and made real for all Americans,  including the descendants of slaves, on June 19, 1865, `Juneteenth  Day.'   That is why we celebrate Juneteenth and that is why I urge all  Members to join me in voting to pass S. 475, the ``Juneteenth National  Independence Day Act.''    Mr. Speaker, it is not often when you can stand on  the floor of the House and use the terminology: I feel full or filled.   It is a terminology that many of us are familiar with in the  religious communities of our Black American tradition.   But after a journey of 10 years, I just want to take this moment to  thank all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, who showed  America that there is unity in the understanding of our history, that  the history of slavery is the original sin and should never be ignored.   But now we have a national independence holiday for Juneteenth. Let  us come together.   I thank Senator Markey; Senator Cornyn; Senator Smith; our friend    Danny Davis; Doug Matthews; the Moody family; and, of course, Reverend  Thomas and many others from the Galveston area; Opal Lee; and the  father of Juneteenth, the late Representative Al Edwards.   Opal Lee still lives. She brought 1.6 million petitions to the United  States Congress in the dead of summer.   On behalf of all who have waited for this, I thank them. And to the  Congressional Black Caucus, Joyce Beatty as the Chair, we stand here as  the conscience of the Congress thanking them with all my colleagues.   Again, we say our message is our power. We are here to serve, and  there is more to come in changing lives for justice, equality, and  freedom. That is what happened today.                            ____________________
