 Mr. President, this resolution being offered by my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle is a partisan political stunt  to distract the American people from the crisis created by Donald  Trump's zero tolerance policy.   Almost 3,000 children were ripped from the arms of their parents and  traumatized by the President's cruelty.   Yesterday, the Senate Judiciary Committee had a closed-door briefing  with officials from the Department of Justice, the Department of Health  and Human Services, and the Department of Homeland Security. The  American people deserve to hear from these officials in public and  under oath. All these officials provided at this briefing--not under  oath--was more obstruction and obfuscation. The witness from  Immigration and Customs Enforcement even claimed that they ``did not  mess up here.''   Separating almost 3,000 children from their parents, not meeting  judicially set deadlines for reunifying these children--the trauma  continues. Is there anybody in America paying attention to this issue  who actually believes there was no mess-up?   We need a public hearing to hear from these officials under oath.   Donald Trump is weaponizing fear to pursue his anti-immigration  agenda, and we are not going to be party to that. We should be focused  like laser beams on reuniting the children with their parents.    I yield to the Senator from Illinois.
