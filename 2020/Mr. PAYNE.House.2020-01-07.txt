 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise the unsung heroes of  the terrible shooting in Jersey City, New Jersey, last month.   When tragedy strikes a community, we all hear about the criminals who  committed the horrible acts. Only now and then do we hear about the  heroes who risked their lives to save others.   In Jersey City, it was heroes like Sergeant Majorie Jordan. She  walked into the line of fire to pull a wounded police officer to  safety.   Heroes like Anayah Bey; she cared for one of the shooting victims  until help arrived.   These are two of the many stories of individual bravery, from  officers and civilians alike, that happen during national tragedies  like Jersey City. These unsung heroes represent the best of America  during the worst of times, and they deserve our thanks and praise.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing these  brave and honorable citizens and their care for their fellow man.                            ____________________
