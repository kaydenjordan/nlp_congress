 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of  Campbell County, Virginia's, finest: Captain Mike Lawhorn.   On May 30, Rustburg High School's faculty and staff named Captain  Lawhorn the winner of this year's Hugh D. Pendleton Award of  Leadership, which recognizes exceptional community leadership.   As a graduate of Rustburg High School, a lifelong resident of  Campbell County, and a veteran of the United States Air Force, Captain  Lawhorn has dedicated his life to bravely serving his Nation and his  community.   Captain Lawhorn has climbed the ranks in the Campbell County  Sheriff's Office, beginning as a school resource officer at Rustburg  High School in 1998, and now serving as captain of the administrative  services division where he has been dedicated to ensuring school and  court safety since 2018.   Captain Lawhorn participated in the FBI National Academy in 2022,  becoming the first only Campbell County Sheriff's employee to complete  this distinguished and challenging program.   I am honored to represent such an outstanding member of the Campbell  County community, and I thank and congratulate Captain Lawhorn for his  lifetime of service.    NCAA DIII Men's Baseball Championship Winner--University of Lynchburg     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  extraordinary accomplishment of the University of Lynchburg's men's  baseball team.   On June 8, the Lynchburg Hornets earned a 7-6 victory over Johns  Hopkins University to win the NCAA Division III National Baseball  Championship, representing the program's first national title.   In the third and final game of the championship series, the  University of Lynchburg fell behind by four runs in the top of the  first inning, but they clawed their way back with two runs in the  bottom of the first and second innings, and three in the fifth, to  claim the lead for good and clinch the title.   The Hornets' 48 wins this season set an Old Dominion Athletic  Conference record for victories and reflects the countless hours of  discipline and dedication required to reach this pinnacle of success.   I congratulate the Lynchburg Hornets for their victory in the NCAA  Division III National Championship, and I am honored to represent this  championship team from my hometown and the Fifth Congressional District  of Virginia.                       A Path to Fiscal Responsibility     Madam Speaker, the number one responsibility of  the House of Representatives is to secure and protect the fiscal  stability of the United States of America. What that means is we are  protecting and ensuring our ability to meet our obligations, to fund  our government, and when necessary, to borrow to meet those needs in  extenuating circumstances.   We just came through a debt ceiling battle where the debt ceiling was  raised unconditionally through January of 2025, and there was the scary  narrative that was used that we were facing some kind of a national  default if we didn't raise the debt ceiling.   However, there was not going to be any default because there is more  than enough revenue coming in to meet the approximately $70 billion a  month that it takes to pay the interest on the Nation's debt, to  service our debts, and to prevent an actual default.   However, if we do not make true reforms and cuts in spending, we will  surely have a national default in the near future.   Madam Speaker, it is incumbent upon us that we use the upcoming  budgetary process, the appropriations process, to cut our spending and  put us on a path to fiscal responsibility.   As the new Republican majority, we must ensure that the  appropriations process reflects the priorities of our majority: that we  secure our border; that we strengthen our military; that we defund  climate extremism; that we restore American energy, reliable and  affordable energy; that we defund DEI; that we defund CRT; that we  defund LGBTQ programs; that we defund abortion; and that we defund  indoctrination in our education systems.   This will have the result, as we restore fiscal responsibility, of  reducing inflation that is crushing the purchasing power of the  American people; that we reduce the interest rates, we allow the  Federal Reserve to stop raising interest rates because we are reducing  inflation, and those interest rates that are crushing the cost of  housing and mortgages for Americans across the country; that we reduce  gas prices that are crushing middle-income, lower income, and fixed- income Americans; that we help our farmers to reduce the grocery prices  that are making it so hard for Americans to put food on the table; and  that, again, we restore fiscal responsibility to ensure the fiscal  future for our children and our grandchildren.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I rise as the designee of Mr. Clyde  from Georgia.    Mr. Chair, again, I rise in support of the Mr.  Clyde's amendment to the REINS Act. This amendment simply says that if  requested in writing by a Member, the Comptroller General shall make a  determination whether an agency action qualifies as a rule for purposes  of this chapter and shall submit to Congress this determination not  later than 60 days after the date of the request.   It further states that the Comptroller General, in consultation with  the director of the Congressional Budget Office, shall make a  determination to whether a rule is a major rule under the provisions of  this act and shall submit to Congress this determination not later than  90 days after the date of the request.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to  the REINS Act.    Mr. Chair, my amendment is a commonsense one  that I hope everyone can support. It would simply require Congress to  do a review of all agency rules within a 5-year period. If Congress did  not vote to continue certain rules that are in place, then the rules  would simply cease to exist. It puts the responsibility where it  belongs, on the people's elected Representatives.   The Washington regulatory state we all know to be cumbersome. It is  actually hurtful to American businesses, families, and the American  economy. By reining in the regulatory state, we can allow Americans to  live and operate in an economy the way they want to. Washington  bureaucrats cannot and should not tell my constituents in Virginia's  Fifth District what they can and cannot do.   The REINS Act will hold the Biden administration accountable for all  major rules they present.   For far too long, Congress has let the executive branch run roughshod  over Congress and the American people. Today that ends.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support the Amendment and  the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, it is bad enough that we have  unelected bureaucrats in the departments and the agencies making rules  that oppress the American people, that suppress their freedom, that  tell them how they can live, how they can heat their home, what kind of  a car they can drive, and it goes on and on.   All this amendment does is require Congress to take responsibility  every 5 years to vote to retain a rule. If it is not worth voting on to  retain, then it probably should not be retained.   Once again, I would hope that all Members of Congress could agree to  operate under their constitutional responsibility for the laws that  affect their constituents and Americans across the country.   Mr. Chair, I encourage all Members to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, the REINS Act is a very important  piece of legislation for us to pass to rein in the unaccountable  bureaucratic state that is telling Americans what kind of cars they can  drive and much more than that with the regulations and rules that are  coming out of the unelected bureaucratic states.   Rules like the VA abortion rule that was recently put in place by the  Biden administration would not qualify as a major rule under the REINS  Act. My amendment would make any agency rule that increases access to  abortion subject to congressional review.   I am proud of this amendment because it is the first standalone pro- life amendment vote the House will take this year. My amendment will  counter the radical, pro-death agenda the Biden administration promotes  throughout their entire administration.   The REINS Act will significantly restore appropriate and  constitutional  [[Page H2910]]  congressional oversight for the out-of-control bureaucracy. It is a  step toward ending the ``Washington knows best'' attitude that too  often prevails in this town. It is a step toward freedom and less  government oppression for all Americans. It is a step toward fiscal  responsibility.   Mr. Chair, in addition to the underlying bill, I urge all of my  colleagues to support my pro-life amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it is refreshing to hear for the  first time, I think, since I came to Congress 2\1/2\ years ago that my  friends on the other side actually care about the freedoms of  Americans, as they continue to try to control every aspect of  Americans' lives.   Yet, the other side used to be the party of ``safe, legal, and rare''  when it came to abortion. I am unashamedly, unapologetically a believer  in life from conception. I don't believe we ought to be negotiating the  timeline when it comes to when you can kill a child in the womb.   However, the other side has become the party of abortion at any time,  for any reason, up until the moment of birth. I challenge my friends on  the other side to tell us when they actually would restrict abortion.   The Republican Party should proudly be the party of life.   The Supreme Court, which recently, about a year ago, overturned Roe  v. Wade and the Dobbs decision, returned the responsibility on abortion  to the people's Representatives. It ought to be up to Congress to vote  to approve any agency rule that increases access to abortion. That is  what this amendment does.   Mr. Chair, I urge everyone to support this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
