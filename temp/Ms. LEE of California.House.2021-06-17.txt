 Madam Speaker, let me first thank our  chairman, Mr. Meeks, for moving this bill through committee. It wasn't  an easy lift, and his leadership was extremely important in getting us  to where we are today.   I also thank Leader Hoyer, Speaker Pelosi, and let me take a minute  to thank our staff: My chief of staff, Julie Nickson, who is here with  us today; my legislative director, Gregory Adams; Congressman Meeks'  staff; and all of the staff members who have worked for 20 years to get  us to this point.   I also want to thank our Democratic and Republican cosponsors and our  outside broad spectrum of groups, like the Friends Committee on  National Legislation, Win Without War, the American Legion, and  Americans for Prosperity that have fought alongside us.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of  Administration Policy and letters of support from many of these groups.                     Statement of Administration Policy     H.R. 256--Repeal of Authorization for Use of Military Force Against        Iraq Resolution of 2002--Rep. Lee, D-CA with 134 co-sponsors         The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 256, to       repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against       Iraq Resolution of 2002 (``2002 AUMF''). This bipartisan       legislation would terminate the October 16, 2002, statutory       authorization for the use of military force against Iraq.        The Administration supports the repeal of the 2002 AUMF, as       the United States has no ongoing military activities that       rely solely on the 2002 AUMF as a domestic legal basis, and       repeal of the 2002 AUMF would likely have minimal impact on       current military operations. Furthermore, the President is       committed to working with the Congress to ensure that       outdated authorizations for the use of military force are       replaced with a narrow and specific framework appropriate to       ensure that we can continue to protect Americans from       terrorist threats.        In working with the Congress on repealing and replacing       other existing authorizations of military force, the       Administration seeks to ensure that the Congress has a clear       and thorough understanding of the effect of any such action       and of the threats facing U.S. forces, personnel, and       interests around the world. As the Administration works with       the Congress to reform AUMFs, it will be critical to maintain       the clear authority to address threats to the United States'       national interests with appropriately decisive and effective       military action.                                   ____                        [Press Release--June 14, 2021]                   CVA Urges Passage of 2002 AUMF Repeal    Grassroots veterans group applauds Rep. Lee, bipartisan leadership on                critical measure to restore balance of power         Arlington, VA.--Concerned Veterans for America (CVA)       Executive Director Nate Anderson released the following       statement urging the U.S. House to pass H.R. 256, Rep.       Barbara Lee's bill to repeal the 2002 Authorization for the       Use of Military Force (AUMF):        ``Debating, authorizing, and exercising oversight of       American military action is one of Congress's most solemn       duties. Unfortunately, Congress has largely deferred to the       executive branch and neglected its role in matters of war and       peace over the last twenty years. Repealing the 2002 AUMF       would be an important step toward Congress reasserting its       constitutional role in shaping foreign policy and giving the       American people a voice. We applaud Rep. Lee for her       continued leadership on this issue along with the broad       coalition of bipartisan representatives and organizations who       have found common ground in this endeavor.''                                  BACKGROUND         Americans for Prosperity, a partner of CVA, issued a Key       Vote Alert for this measure, signaling it will take into       account lawmakers' votes in its annual legislative scorecard.        CVA recently led a coalition in sending a letter to members       of Congress urging support of a bipartisan resolution       introduced by Sens. Kaine and Young to repeal a pair of       obsolete AUMFs. The group was joined on the letter by Defense       Priorities Initiative, Freedom Works, and the R Street       institute.        CVA has been working to repeal the outdated 2001 and 2002       AUMFs for years, making it a priority for its grassroots and       advocacy efforts in its annual policy agendas (2019, 2020,       2021). Notably, though less than a fifth of current members       of Congress voted on the 2001 AUMF, it has been invoked to       justify 41 operations in 19 countries since passage.        In 2019, the group partnered with VoteVets, a traditional       rival, to urge lawmakers to reclaim their constitutional war       powers duties. The New York Times wrote about the unlikely       partnership. Setting the example for lawmakers and the       administration, the groups found common ground on this issue       and flew activists and volunteers in to DC to meet with their       members of Congress to bring lasting policy change in       Washington.        CVA has been staunch in its support of lawmakers who have       taken a principled stand and worked to repeal these measures       in the past. In 2019, CVA welcomed the addition of the       bipartisan War Powers Caucus to Congress, applauding       lawmakers for prioritizing the issue. CVA also launched a       digital ad campaign thanking lawmakers for standing against       endless war, praising lawmakers for voting to ensure proper       Congressional input before any offensive military force       against Iran.                                                 February 17, 2021.        Dear Members of Congress, As organizations from across the       ideological spectrum, we are committed to addressing one of       our country's most critical national security needs: ending       our forever wars. We don't always agree on the reasons to do       so, but we do  [[Page H2901]]       agree that nearly two decades of endless war has failed to       make us safer and a new approach is necessary. To achieve       this goal and reorient U.S. foreign policy away from the       unaccountable, interventionist approach we've seen for nearly       two decades, Congress must sunset the 2001 Authorization for       the Use of Military Force (AUMF) and repeal the 2002 Iraq       AUMF.        Since its enactment on September 14, 2001, the 2001 AUMF       has served as a blank check for endless, global war under       multiple presidents. Despite congressional intent to only       give then-President George W. Bush the authority to use       military force against those responsible for the 9/11 attacks       and those who harbored them, the law failed to include any       time limits, geographic constraints, specific objectives or       an exit strategy. As a result, three successive presidents       have used the law to unilaterally expand the nation's use of       military force against individuals, groups, and even nation       states never intended by Congress. Presidents Bush, Obama,       and Trump have used the 2001 AUMF to justify U.S. military       action in 19 countries at least 41 times. The expansive U.S.       militarized counterterrorism footprint now extends to at       least 80 countries, costing an estimated $6.4 trillion, as       well as the lives of thousands of American soldiers, and       hundreds of thousands of civilians abroad.        Congress passed the 2002 Iraq AUMF to authorize force       against the Saddam Hussein regime. It is not required for any       ongoing military activities, as the executive branch relies       on an overly broad interpretation of the 2001 AUMF for       operations against ISIS, al Qaeda, and other groups. However,       both the Obama and Trump administrations expanded their       interpretation of the scope of the 2002 Iraq AUMF beyond       congressional intent. Most recently, the Trump administration       cited it as a legal basis for the targeted killing of Iranian       general Qassem Soleimani, an action clearly unrelated to the       original scope of the authorization. Retaining this law       renders it susceptible to further abuse.        President Biden has stated a desire to end the forever       wars. With this in mind, Congress should sunset the 2001 AUMF       eight months after a law is enacted and immediately repeal       the 2002 Iraq AUMF. Rather than expediting a new AUMF,       Congress must first publicly debate whether military force is       both necessary and appropriate for addressing current       security challenges and what, if any, new legal authority may       be necessary. In the interim, Article II of the Constitution       provides the president with the legal authority needed to       defend our country against an actual or truly imminent armed       attack.        With a new president who has signalled support for our       government's institutional checks and balances and a U.S.       public that supports an end to endless war, it is time for       Congress seize the opportunity to reassert its constitutional       authority over war powers. In fact, the U.S. Constitution       places the power to declare war squarely in the hands of       Congress for good reason. Our democracy relies on the       foundational belief that it is the people to whom the U.S.       government remains accountable, not the president. By       assigning Congress the sole authority to declare war, our       nation's founders sought to ensure that a decision as       momentous as the one to wage war was properly debated,       scrutinized, and justified. Failing to sunset the 2001 AUMF       and repeal the 2002 Iraq AUMF now will continue to       effectively cede Congress' power over war and peace to the       executive branch.        In the past five years, the House of Representatives or its       committees have voted to repeal both the 2001 AUMF and the       2002 Iraq AUMF, drawing both Democratic and Republican       support. With a new administration who agrees that these       authorizations are outdated, now is the time to finish the       work Congress started. We urge you to join Rep. Barbara Lee's       effort in turning the page on this unsuccessful chapter of       U.S. foreign policy by sunsetting the 2001 AUMF and repealing       the 2002 Iraq AUMF.

Dear Representatives, On behalf of Americans for       Prosperity's activists in all 50 states, I urge you to vote       ``NO'' on H.R. 1187, the so-called ``Corporate Governance       Improvement and Investor Protection Act.''        Businesses can be a force for good when they serve       customers, drive life-improving innovations, and enable       employees to find fulfillment in their work. But the best way       to do that is through bottom-up approaches, not top-down       regulation. Mobilizing the Securities and Exchange Commission       to force industry from all corners of the economy to adhere       to dubious, ambiguous, and one-size-fits all requirements--as       this bill does--will only harm our ability to improve society       and undermine America's capacity to lead in the global       economy.        H.R. 1187 represents a sweeping expansion of government       overreach and dramatic mission creep for the SEC, which has       neither the authority, expertise, nor accountability to       evaluate the materiality of these disclosures to shareholders       and potential shareholders. Further, the standards these       regulations set, and the effectiveness of the methods to       which those standards would be met, are unclear. As an       example, recent evidence has shown there is virtually no       relationship between trends in energy-related carbon       emissions and top-down climate policies such as the       implementation of international agreements, carbon pricing,       cap-and-trade, or command and control sectoral regulation. In       fact, since the 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA decision, countries       as well as states that have not endorsed these policies have       generally reduced per capita energy-related carbon dioxide       emissions at a far greater pace than those that have.        Beyond this, the very act of forcing companies to meet       preset, one-size-fits-all requirements ultimately undermines       the leaps in innovation we need to actually achieve our       shared goals for the environment and society as a whole.       Business leaders and consumers--not politicians and appointed       Washington officials--are the driving force to innovate and       deliver superior products and services that solve for the       needs of today while also pushing our country toward a better       future that benefits all.        This bill would also impose new costly burdens on       companies, open the floodgates to cronyism, undermine       businesses' ability to create new value, and ultimately put a       drag on our recovering economy.        We look forward to working together to improve the       environment and address other great challenges facing our       country. The best way to do that is through bottom-up       innovation, not top-down regulation such as those mandated by       this bill.        I urge you to vote ``NO'' on H.R. 1187. This vote will be       recorded in our legislative scorecard for the 117th Congress.            Sincerely,                                                  Brent Gardner,                                   Chief Government Affairs Officer,      Americans for Prosperity.                                   ____                                                The American Legion,                                Office of the National Commander,                                      Washington, DC, April 7, 2021.      Hon. Barbara Lee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Lee: On behalf of the nearly two       million members of The American Legion, I am pleased to       express support for H.R. 256, which would repeal the       Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq       Resolution of 2002. Congress passed the 2002 AUMF to       authorize force against Saddam Hussein's Iraqi regime in       order to defend the United States against the threat posed by       the regime's alleged possession of weapons of mass       destruction. This threat proved unfounded and the mission       undertaken pursuant to the 2002 Iraq AUMF--designated       ``Operation Iraqi Freedom''--officially ended on December 11,       2011.        Our servicemembers have accomplished their original       objectives in Iraq, a dangerous regime was removed, and the       authorization for the war should end. With the understanding       that complex global threats cannot be solved by military       power alone, we value the importance of sustaining a       civilian-led approach of elevating diplomacy and development       alongside a strong defense. The American Legion stands ready       to assist members of Congress with strengthening our nation's       interests and ensuring that diplomacy is the first instrument       of national power considered at the highest level.        In accordance with American Legion Resolution No. 22:       Addressing the `Forever War', passed unanimously by our       National Executive Committee in meetings held October 14-15,       2020, which urges a renewal of a proper constitutional       balance to American foreign policy decision-making by       encouraging Congress to repeal and replace outdated       Authorizations for Use of Military Force, we strongly support       this bill.        We applaud your leadership in addressing this critical       issue facing our nation's servicemembers, veterans, and their       families.            For God & Country,                                          James W. ``Bill'' Oxford,                                                National Commander.     Let me just take a minute to honor my dear  friend, the late Congressman Walter Jones, a Republican from North  Carolina who was my partner for many years to build bipartisan support  to bring our troops home.   I am proud to stand with everyone as we exercise our most important  duty assigned by the Constitution to decide when and how America goes  to war.   We cannot revise history as it relates to why this authorization was  put into place.   Eighteen years ago, in front of the infamous ``Mission Accomplished''  banner backdrop, former President Bush told the Nation that the major  combat operations in Iraq have ended.  [[Page H2902]]    In 2011, President Obama brought our combat troops home, and yet this  authority remains on the books, vulnerable to misuse because Congress  has not acted to remove it.   The Bush administration, yes, misled the American people by saying  there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, that Iraq posed an  imminent threat by drawing a false connection between the tragic events  of 9/11 and Saddam Hussein. Those lies and misinformation had deadly  consequences. The mistakes continue to haunt us today.   Once the war started, the Out of Iraq Caucus was founded by  Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey, me, and led by Congresswoman Maxine Waters.  Over 80 Members joined. Many of us took our protests to the streets,  joining hundreds of thousands protesting the unnecessary, immoral war  of choice. Year after year, we worked for the safe and orderly  withdrawal of our troops.   I share all this history, not because of nostalgia, but we have to  remember why this authorization was passed, because 87 percent of  current Members of the House were not here to vote on this AUMF in  2002. The Constitution requires that we cannot appropriate funds for  armies for more than 2 years, and yet for almost two decades we have  failed to revisit these AUMFs.   To this day, our endless wars continue, costing trillions of dollars  and thousands of lives in a war that goes way beyond any scope that  Congress conceived or intended.   I want to salute our veterans, our young men and women in uniform.  They did everything we have asked them to do. Many veterans support  this repeal.   The outdated 2002 AUMF bears no correlation to the threats we face  today.    Madam Speaker, the President earlier stated  his support for the bill, saying that the 2002 AUMF will not impact  current military operations, but repeal can prevent our country from  entering another protracted engagement under this outdated authority.   We can't afford to leave this in place indefinitely. For two decades  it has been in place. This is our opportunity to restore our  constitutional role.
