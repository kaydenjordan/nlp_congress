 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Foster Youth Shadow  Day.   Today, I have Wini visiting us from Omaha, Nebraska. She is a junior  at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, studying criminal justice, with  a minor in communications. Wini is in Washington, D.C., along with more  than 100 young adults participating in the seventh annual Congressional  Foster Youth Shadow Day.   Currently, there are more than 400,000 youth in the foster care  system, and we need to make sure the system is working well for all of  our children. I look forward to learning from Wini so I can better  advocate for these children in Congress as the newest co-chair of the  Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth. As a foster parent myself, I know  how important it is for every child to have a safe, supportive, and  loving family.   Wini is an inspiration for all of us, as she wants to attend law  school and continue using her voice as an advocate for young people.   Thank you for being here today, Wini. I know you have a bright future  ahead of you, because you have an indomitable spirit, you have heart,  and you have character.                            ____________________
