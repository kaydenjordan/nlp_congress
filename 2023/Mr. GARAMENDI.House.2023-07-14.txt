 Mr. Chair, I am actually quite amazed that we are  allowing a political ideology to get in the way of reality and facts.   The fact of the matter is that the U.S. military, more than a decade  ago, noticed that the climate was changing and they needed to address  it. Also, the fact is that the largest solar and wind energy systems in  the Nation are in Texas, and Texas is dependent upon those for their  power when a heat wave arrives.   Let's be smart here. Let's not let ideology and the fact that we want  to get into a fight over climate change get in the way of good public  policy. It is absolutely essential that the military build for the  future, that they build for resiliency.
