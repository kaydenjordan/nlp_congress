 Mr. Speaker, not that long ago, the President declared  COVID to be pretty much over with. So I rise today in support of H.J.  Res. 46, which would basically end the fantasy that our current  understanding of COVID-19 and its present spread in the United States  requires Congress to still give extraordinary powers to the President.  It is time to end the emergency.   Similar resolutions have passed the Senate twice. Here in the House,  they have been blocked twice by the Democrats.   Mr. Speaker, this is no longer a new virus or a new pandemic. It is  well past time for the House to follow the Senate's lead and bring a  joint resolution to the floor to end this charade.   With the President wanting to end title 42, so that tens of thousands  of illegal immigrants can come across our border with little to no  health check, why in the world are we still painted into a corner as  American citizens with emergency powers granted to the executive? It is  time to pass H.J. Res. 46.                            ____________________
