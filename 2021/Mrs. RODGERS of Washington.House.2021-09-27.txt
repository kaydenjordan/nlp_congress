 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  bill. We all agree on the need to modernize and invest in our Nation's  infrastructure.   In fact, Energy and Commerce Republicans have led on dozens of bills  to close the digital divide, increase our energy security, clean energy  deployment, make investments in safe drinking water and make our  roadways safe.   Our solutions target Federal investments that are paired with  comprehensive permitting, regulatory, and licensing reforms to reduce  barriers to deployment and spur private investment.   Unfortunately, this bill does not lift barriers that make projects  expensive, and in many cases impossible.   On energy, this bill's rush-to-green will compromise America's  reliability and affordability.   On broadband, this bill fails to target funds to unserved areas based  on accurate FCC maps.   It also ignores the most important policy for safer roads: A national  framework for autonomous vehicles.  [[Page H5450]]    Overall, it prioritizes spending and investments in urban centers at  the expense of more rural areas of our country. This is the wrong  approach.   Finally, this bill paves the way for the radical, multi-trillion- dollar tax-and-spending spree that Speaker Pelosi is rewriting behind  closed doors at this very moment. The programs and funding levels  agreed to by the Senate will be massively expanded in her bill. We have  already seen this from the provisions marked up by our committee.   This tax-and-spending spree will radically expand the Federal  Government's command and control over our lives. It will raise costs on  families and leave us less safe, less prosperous, and more dependent on  foreign adversaries like China.   Again, this is not the approach that we should take. This is taking  us down a dangerous road. To win the future, I urge my colleagues to  reject this bill.
