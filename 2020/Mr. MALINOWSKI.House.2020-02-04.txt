 Mr. Speaker, on December 10, armed extremists,  targeting Jewish Americans and law enforcement, gunned down four people  in Jersey City, including Jersey City Police Detective Joseph Seals.   Today, I am joined by his daughter, Hailey, as my State of the Union  guest. I want to thank her for her commitment to her father's legacy  and for joining us in honoring him.   Detective Seals was a veteran of the Jersey City police force and was  a leading officer in the effort to get guns off the street. He was a  good man and a good father. He worked every day trying to make New  Jersey safer for all of us and I am glad we have a chance to recognize  him.   But I also believe that we owe his family more than just recognition,  more than just remembrance. We owe them a dedicated effort to confront  domestic extremism as seriously as we have rightly confronted  international terrorism, with more resources for law enforcement,  stronger gun laws, greater scrutiny of social media companies that  monetize hatred online, and zero tolerance for politicians who exploit  that hatred for political ends.                            ____________________
