 Madam Speaker, tonight we paid tribute to the 13 fallen  American military who died as Afghanistan was being abandoned by this  administration to the Taliban, who are now more powerful than they have  ever been, have more equipment than they ever had.   What we didn't pay tribute to tonight--it somehow got lost in the  shuffle--is over 2,400 of our precious military lives that were lost  fighting for their country in Afghanistan. They kept us safe,  relatively safe for 20 years. But they should not be forgotten.   There are over 1,800 civilian contractors that were killed. There  were 600 military killed in Afghanistan under Commander in Chief Bush;  1,800 under Commander in Chief Obama. They should not be forgotten.  They served their country.                            ____________________
