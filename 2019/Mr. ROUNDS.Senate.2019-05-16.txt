 Mr. President, today I recognize Peter Petrasko,  an intern in my Washington, DC, office, for all the hard work he has  done on behalf of myself, my staff, and the State of South Dakota.   Peter is a graduate of O'Gorman High School in Sioux Falls, SD, and  Brown University in Providence, RI. He is currently pursuing his master  of data science degree through Harvard Extension School. Peter is a  dedicated and diligent worker who has been devoted to getting the most  out of his internship experience and has been a true asset to the  office.   I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Peter for all of the  fine work he has done, and I wish for his continued success in the  years to come.                            ____________________
