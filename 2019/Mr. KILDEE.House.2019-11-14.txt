 Mr. Chairman, I thank Congresswoman Speier for her  leadership on climate issues in general and specifically on electric  vehicles.   Mr. Chairman, we are suffering the climate crisis right now. In my  home State of Michigan, climate change is changing our environment  impacting the Great Lakes: record lake levels, algal blooms, and  invasive species like Asian carp.   As Members of Congress, we have a duty to act on commonsense policies  that support climate solutions, and this amendment is a good example of  that.   I support this amendment because it will make explicit the Export- Import Bank's role in supporting clean energy in our domestic exports,  especially electric vehicles, their components, and vehicle charging  infrastructure.   As Congresswoman Speier said, China makes more electric vehicles than  anybody else in the world. That doesn't have to be the case. We have to  invest in policy that supports electric vehicles so that the U.S. can  lead the future in transportation. This amendment would help to do  that.   I come from Flint, Michigan, a community with a great auto history.  But I have seen automotive jobs sent overseas over the years, and the  livelihood of families I represent go right along with those jobs,  because we have failed to see the future. We have failed to see around  the corner. We have failed to invest in the future and claim that  future for ourselves.   This amendment will ensure one additional piece that makes sure that  we have a claim on the future and that we can be the leader in electric  vehicles. It is the right thing to do. I support the amendment, and I  support the underlying legislation.
