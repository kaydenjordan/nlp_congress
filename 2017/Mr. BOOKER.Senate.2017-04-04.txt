 Mr. President, I rise today to voice my opposition to the  [[Page S2205]]  nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice on the  Supreme Court of the United States.   The nomination of an individual to serve on the Supreme Court is a  matter of tremendous importance. Supreme Court justices have the  opportunity to shape, literally, and even to define American history  for decades to come. Even more importantly, they have the opportunity  to affect the lives and livelihoods of everyday Americans, now and in  generations yet unborn.   Few decisions in the Senate have a more profound consequence than the  confirmation of a nominee for a lifetime seat on the highest Court in  the land. I recognize that this is one of the most critical votes that  I will take or that any Senator will cast.   After reviewing Judge Gorsuch's record, I have decided to uphold my  constitutional duty of service to advise and consent by opposing Judge  Gorsuch's nomination at all stages of the confirmation process,  including a vote on cloture or an up-or-down vote. I didn't come to  this decision lightly. I arrived at this conclusion because I believe  the next Associate Justice to the Supreme Court must be someone who  understands the importance of judicial restraint, someone who will  adhere to precedent, someone who will respect and has respect for all  coequal branches of government, someone who views the Constitution as a  living--not a static--document, someone whose judicial views actually  fall within the mainstream of judicial thought and jurisprudence, and  someone who has a deep understanding of the law, the Constitution, and  its applications. Critically, I believe the next Supreme Court justice  must be someone who understands the gravity of their work--that their  decisions will affect livelihoods, will affect lives, and will affect  the liberties and the rights that we value--not just for those in  places of privilege and power but for all American citizens, for all of  the people, now and for decades to come.   The American people need the next Justice on the Nation's highest  Court to be someone who will protect the rights for all--for everyone-- and who will ensure that the words literally inscribed above the  Supreme Court--``Equal Justice Under Law''--are made manifest in  everyone's life.   After careful consideration of Judge Gorsuch's record, his judicial  philosophy, and after meeting with the nominee and examining remarks  and answers to questions in his confirmation hearing, I do not believe  Judge Gorsuch meets this high standard, and I cannot support his  nomination to be a Supreme Court Justice.   Judge Gorsuch is truly a well-credentialed jurist, but we must  understand that a good resume is the beginning and not the end point of  a standard by which we must measure nominees to serve on the Supreme  Court. A good resume is necessary, but it is not sufficient to be on  the highest Court of the land.   When it comes to the Supreme Court, the Senate's duty to advise and  consent means more than merely measuring an aptitude or understanding  of the law. It means more than just looking at someone's college and  law school. It means more than just admiring: Does this person have an  impressive resume? It necessitates an understanding of it. It actually  necessitates an empathy for how these decisions will affect the lives  of everyday Americans. Do they have the capacity to stand for all of  us?   I take literally the way the Constitution began. It began with the  words in the preamble to the Constitution. In many ways, it is a direct  point at what is at stake when we nominate an individual to the Supreme  Court. It is a critical way that we began. It begins by saying: ``We  the People.'' The inclusion of these words at the start of one of our  Nation's founding documents is actually no accident. It was the subject  of consternation and even discussion and debate.    It is worth noting that the original draft of the preamble of the  Constitution of the United States, as prepared by a man named  Gouverneur Morris, had a different beginning. It said: We the people of  the States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and so forth.  But Morris and other drafters of the Constitution made the conclusion-- and, really, the conscious decision--to remove references to States, to  bring it back to the people--that the power of government is derived by  the people and that is the fundamental aspect of our society; that it  is ``we the people''--not people of any one State, not people of any  one religion, not people of any one race or class, but ``we the  people''--all of the people.   In a debate about this change, it was James Madison who argued:         In this particular respect the distinction between the       existing and the proposed governments is very material. The       existing system has been derived from the dependent       derivative authority of the legislatures of the states;       whereas, this is derived from the superior power of the       people.    It is a deference and it is a reverence for the understanding of the  power of the people--all people. It is no accident that this is how our  Constitution began, and it is the spirit in our Nation which has helped  us for centuries to expand upon this ideal of ``we the people.''   Understand this: Some of our greatest leaders fought to make sure  that these ideals were far vaster, far more inclusive. I note, for  instance, that Susan B. Anthony said it was ``we the people''--not we  the White male citizens, not we the male citizens, but we the whole  people who formed the Union. And we formed it not to give the blessings  of liberty but to secure them, not to the half of ourselves and to the  half of our prosperity but to the whole people--women and men. You see,  this fundamental understanding of our Constitution expanded to be more  inclusive, to include women and minorities and religious minorities.  This conception of ``we the people'' is critical.   It is unfortunate that too often, even with the best intentions, our  elected officials, Supreme Court Justices, and even Presidents have  forgotten the precision of these words which were chosen. But despite  this, because of heroes like Susan B. Anthony and others, the people of  this Nation have remembered them, and our Nation has grown to be who we  are now. We often actually take for granted the critical role the  Supreme Court has played in focusing on the people--on all the people.  This has been the power and majesty of the Supreme Court--this focusing  of individual rights, the dignity, the worth, the value of all people.   In the Supreme Court case in Hammer v. Dagenhart, the Supreme Court  ruled that Congress has the power to enact labor laws that protect  children. They remembered ``we the people''--in this case, citizens  against powerful corporations.   In West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, the Supreme Court upheld the  constitutionality of a State minimum wage law, again, focusing on the  people--``we the people.''   In Mapp v. Ohio, when the Supreme Court decided about evidence  obtained through the illegal search--the violation of individual  privacy--they remembered, again, ``we the people.''   In New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, when the Supreme Court protected  the rights of everyday citizens to criticize their government, they  remembered that sovereignty, that power, that importance of ``we the  people.''   In Baker v. Carr, when the Supreme Court established the principle of  one person, one vote, they remembered ``we the people.''   There are so many of the rulings during the 1950s and 1960s governing  issues of race in our Nation, to which so many of us in our Nation owe  our very success, the opportunity that was expanded because the Supreme  Court--against social mores, against laws of States--focused on ``we  the people.''   Perhaps most famous of those is Brown v. Board of Education, when the  Supreme Court asserted that separate but equal had no place in the  education of our children, and they remembered ``we the people.''   In Loving v. Virginia, when the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional  the State laws that banned interracial marriage--that ideal of being  able to join in union with someone you love, regardless of race--the  Supreme Court remembered ``we the people.''   In Olmstead v. L.C., when the Supreme Court reinforced the right of  people with developmental disabilities to live in the community and not  be institutionalized, they saw a greater inclusion of all Americans.  They remembered ``we the people.''   I stood on the Supreme Court steps and I sat in on the Supreme Court  arguments in Obergefell v. Hodges, when  [[Page S2206]]  the Supreme Court ultimately ruled that State laws cannot stop you from  marrying whom you love. They remembered. They saw the dignity and the  worth of all of the people and ensured that equality. They remembered  ``we the people.''   In each of these cases, so much was at stake--the rights of workers,  the rights of children, the rights of people with disabilities, the  rights of minorities, the rights of women, voting rights, civil rights,  our rights--American rights. The Supreme Court, with jurists on the  right and the left, jurists appointed by Republicans and Democrats,  looked to people and affirmed dignity and worth and well-being.   But these are not just issues that were done in the past. The Supreme  Court is going to be again confronted by historic and deeply  consequential cases. There is still so much at stake, and that is why  this decision before the Senate is so consequential. The right to gain  access to birth control, the right to criticize your elected officials,  the right to marry someone you love--that is still at stake.   I cannot vote in support of a nominee whom I don't trust to protect  American individuals, to understand the expansive nature of that idea  of ``we the people.'' Judge Gorsuch is someone who, in his own words,  has said judges should try to ``apply the law as it is, focusing  backward, not forward.'' Based on his record and his writing, it is  clear to me that Judge Gorsuch's own judicial philosophy leaves out  critically important elements of democratic governance.   Judge Gorsuch's evasive answers to questions during his confirmation  hearing didn't do anything to allay my concerns. ``We the People'' are  the first words of the Constitution. These words, I fear based on Judge  Gorsuch's record, are not his greatest consideration. In fact, at  times, when he issues his judicial opinions, they look as if those  individuals that make up our society--``we the people''--are the least  of his considerations.   Take for example, Alphonse Maddin, the man who was working through  the night in the dead of winter as a truckdriver when his brakes  unfortunately froze on him. Knowing the danger of continuing to drive  with frozen brakes--the danger to himself and other motorists on the  road--Alphonse pulled over to the side of the road and called for help.   As several of my colleagues have noted in Judge Gorsuch's  confirmation hearing and on the floor, Alphonse waited over 2 hours in  the freezing cold without heat, experiencing systems of hypothermia.  After no help arrived, Alphonse feared for his life, and, ultimately,  left his trailer to find help.   Less than a week after the incident, Alphonse was fired for  abandoning his trailer. He filed a complaint with the Department of  Labor and the case was brought to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals,  where all but one of the judges ruled in favor of Alphonse--a guy who  made a practical decision, an urgent decision, to save his own life and  not risk the lives of others. But the judge who ruled against this  individual, in favor of the corporation, was Judge Neil Gorsuch.   He chose to save his own life and protect the lives of others who had  been put in harm's way if he chose another option, and he was fired for  it. Every judge on the Tenth Circuit supported that decision except for  Judge Gorsuch.   ``We the people'' includes Luke, a student with a disability. He was  diagnosed with autism at the age of 2. When Luke entered kindergarten,  he began receiving specialized educational services from a school  district as ensured by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act,  or IDEA. Congress debated and passed, with Republicans and Democrats,  an act that says children with disabilities are entitled to receive a  free and appropriate public education.   Between kindergarten and the second grade, Luke achieved many of the  goals of his individualized education program. But when Luke's family  moved to Colorado and he enrolled in a new public school, he had  trouble adjusting, and Luke regressed in areas in which he had  previously done well. To better suit Luke's needs, his parents, who  tried to get him better care, eventually withdrew him from his local  school and enrolled him in a private residential school for children  with autism. His parents sought reimbursement for the costs of that  private school, but the public school district refused to pay. By the  time Luke's case reached the Tenth Circuit, a Federal judge and two  administrative courts had agreed that the school district should pay  because Luke did not receive the free and appropriate education to  which he was entitled.   The question for Judge Gorsuch was, What constitutes an appropriate  education? In that ruling, Judge Gorsuch wrote the opinion saying that  the educational benefits mandated by IDEA must be ``merely more than de  minimis.'' That was the standard that he set for one of our American  children. Because the school district gave Luke a merely more than de  minimis education, Judge Gorsuch ruled that Luke's parents were not  entitled to reimbursement.   But just two weeks ago, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected Judge  Gorsuch's ``merely more than de minimis'' standard. They unanimously  rejected Judge Gorsuch's standard as contrary to the intent of  Congress. In fact, at the very moment when Judge Gorsuch testified  before the Judiciary Committee, Chief Justice Roberts wrote an opinion  rejecting Gorsuch's IDEA standard, saying:         When all is said and done, a student offered an educational       program providing ``merely more than de minimis'' progress       from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an       education at all.    Judge Gorsuch's misinterpretation of the law--depriving a child with  a disability of the education he deserves--should be cause for concern  to any of my colleagues as they are promoting him to the highest Court  in the land. It is this idea that the powerless, who fight against  these corporations or big institutions and turn to the court system as  their avenue to get the equal justice under the law that will view  them--whether it is a corporation, whether it is a government--as an  equal under the law and give them their right to be heard.   This is what ``we the people'' is. It means people like Alphonse  Maddin and Luke, whom Judge Gorsuch ruled against. It also means female  workers who want access to contraceptive coverage but were denied by  their employer, denied by a corporation. Judge Gorsuch ruled against  the people and for the corporation.   ``We the people'' means those millions of Americans who rely on  Planned Parenthood centers for healthcare. Judge Gorsuch ruled against  those people seeking what, in some counties, is their only access to  contraceptive care. ``We the people'' means the people harmed by a  medical device manufacturer's urging of unsafe, off-label uses. Judge  Gorsuch ruled against the people injured and for the manufacturers, for  the corporation.   ``We the people'' means that a worker fatally electrocuted while on  the job due to inadequate training, whose families sought justice-- Judge Gorsuch ruled against the individual and for the corporation.   ``We the people'' means the woman prevented from suing for sexual  harassment, not because sexual harassment didn't exist but because she  didn't report it quickly enough. Judge Gorsuch supported the  corporation against the woman.   ``We the people'' means a transgender woman who is denied access to a  bathroom at work. Judge Gorsuch ruled against the individual in favor  of the corporation.   ``We the people'' means that every single American deserves to have  their civil rights, deserves to have their equality protected by the  judicial branch, which is often their last avenue toward justice. It is  often their last hope against the powerful, against the wealthy. But  Judge Gorsuch's record in everything--from workers' rights to women's  rights, to civil rights, to the rights of children with disabilities,  to the rights of a guy on the side of a highway to save his own life-- suggests that he has forgotten perhaps the most important element of  the Constitution: It exists to protect and serve the American people,  not corporations, not lobbyists, not those rich enough to hire big,  fancy law firms. It doesn't exist to serve a political ideology. It  exists to serve ``we the people.''   I am not confident in Judge Gorsuch's ability as a Supreme Court  [[Page S2207]]  Justice to safeguard the rights and liberties of all Americans, to  prioritize judicial restraint over judicial ideology, to ensure equal  justice under the law, and to understand and act in a way that  indicates that the lives of real people who are struggling against  often seemingly insurmountable odds--that for them, everything is on  the line. I am not sure that Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court can  honor this tradition.   ``We the people'' means an independent judiciary that will not close  the courthouse doors on people, on our civil rights--that will not look  at litigants as just pawns in the larger ideological context of ideas  but will see the humanity of every American; that will have a  courageous empathy to understand their circumstances and their  struggles and put that in accordance with the values of a nation where  we all swear an oath for liberty and justice for all the people.   Over 75 years ago, Justice Hugo Black encompassed the basic ideal of  the role of Federal courts in protecting citizens' rights when he wrote  these words:         No higher duty, or more solemn responsibility, rests upon       this Court, than that of translating into living law and       maintaining this constitutional shield deliberately planned       and inscribed for the benefit of every human being subject to       our Constitution--of whatever race, creed or persuasion.    Yet Judge Gorsuch's own writings demonstrate a failure to grasp this  understanding of the role of courts to protect all people--and I quote,  again, Justice Black--``whatever race, creed, or persuasion.''   In an opinion article for the National Review, entitled ``Liberals  and Lawsuits,'' Judge Gorsuch expressed his skepticism about civil  rights litigation as merely a pursuit of a ``social agenda.'' He wrote:         American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom,       relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and       the ballot box, as the primary means for effecting their       social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted       suicide to the use of vouchers for private-school education.        This overweening addiction to the courtroom as a place to       debate social policy is bad for the country and bad for the       judiciary.    I wonder what Oliver Brown, plaintiff in the seminal case of Brown v.  Board of Education would say to Judge Gorsuch? Was he ``addicted'' to  the courtroom to advance his social agenda? Or was the courtroom his  avenue to justice against profound oppression?   I wonder what James Obergefell would say to Judge Gorsuch. Was he  ``addicted'' to the courtroom when he sought to be able to marry the  person he loved? Or did Oliver just want to bring the truth to the idea  that separate but equal was actually discriminatory, demeaning, and  degrading, not just to the individuals who are discriminated against  but demeaning to us as a people and a nation?   Judge Gorsuch's actions call into question whether he understands the  proper role of the courts. Does he understand that Federal courts are  the proper forum for constitutional disputes that protect American's  basic rights? This is not about liberal or democrat; this is about  individuals who are often fighting battles against powerful interests.   It was the journalist and editor William Allen White who said in  1936:         Liberty . . . must be something more than a man's       conception of his rights, much more than his desire to fight       for his own rights. True liberty is founded upon a lively       sense of the rights of others and a fighting conviction that       the rights of others must be maintained.    I do not believe Judge Gorsuch possesses this ``fighting conviction''  that we need in a Supreme Court Justice to forcefully and fearlessly,  without regard to politics or favor or privilege or wealth, protect the  rights of others, to protect the rights of all Americans, to protect  the rights of ``we the people.'' I do not believe that Judge Gorsuch  will work to fiercely defend the rights of all Americans. I do not  believe he possesses that fighting conviction that ``we the people''  must be committed above all else to one another.   Again, I do not take the decision to oppose Judge Gorsuch's  nomination lightly. I understand what is at stake. I am fortunate to  represent hard-working New Jerseyans in the U.S. Senate, and when I  took the oath to support and defend the Constitution, I made a promise  to my constituents and the American people not to only discharge my  duties but at every opportunity to work across the aisle, to protect  their rights and interests. That means a lot to me.   So many of my proudest moments in the Senate are from this bipartisan  cooperation that I have found with so many of my colleagues. I do not  stand here today to question their motives. I do not stand here today  to impugn them in any way because when I go home, people are not  concerned about the partisan politics. They are concerned about their  lives, their livelihoods--about the issues that affect them and their  families, their neighborhoods, their community. They want people in  this body and in the courts across the street to protect the rights of  Americans, protect consumers, protect our kids and our environment, but  this is, in fact, what I believe the nominee we are all considering has  shown that he will not do.   It is no secret that Judge Gorsuch's nomination comes at a very  divisive time for this body and a challenging time for this country. We  have experienced great times of turmoil and polarization before in this  Nation and in this body. In the Federalist Papers, written over two  centuries ago, James Madison warns in Federalist Paper No. 10 about  what he calls the ``mischiefs of faction'' and its inevitability--that  citizens of the Nation and their political parties will undoubtedly  disagree and will possess competing interests. Madison asserted that  the existence of the legislative branch would guard against some of the  worst effects of this reality. He wrote that those elected to represent  the American people in the legislature would be those ``whose wisdom  may best discern the true interests of their country and whose  patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to  a temporary or partial consideration.''   When this body is at its best, I believe that is true. I have seen  that kind of partnership in this body. But I am afraid that we are  indeed at a troubling time--a troubling time in history for the Senate  where it seems that the reverse of Madison's hopes have become  reflective of the truth we are experiencing because we are now facing a  vote on a Supreme Court nominee whose confirmation, I believe, would be  a sacrifice to temporary and partial considerations as opposed to the  larger interests of our country.   In my short time in the body--just over 3\1/2\ years--I have come to  this floor to speak on the nominations of two different Supreme Court  Justices to serve here in the United States. The first was Judge  Merrick Garland. He was not only well qualified, intelligent, and  capable, he was moderate. President Obama even sought input from  Republicans about choosing someone who was a mainstream jurist. He was  more than qualified to sit on the Supreme Court, but he was actually  someone who could bring folks together. His qualifications, his  aptitude to serve, and his moderate philosophy were not reflected in  how we dealt with that nomination.   I believe he deserved an up-or-down vote. Even if it was a 60-vote  threshold, he deserved an up-or-down vote. More than that, he should  have had the opportunity to meet with Senators, Republican and  Democratic, like Gorsuch has met with Senators, Republican and  Democratic. He deserved to have a committee hearing. He deserved to be  voted on up or down in that committee, and he deserved to have his  nomination come to the floor. Whether a 60-vote threshold or a 50-vote  threshold, he deserved an up-or-down vote, but he did not get one.   The Garland nomination was the bookend to an era we have been  experiencing, that I have been witnessing, of obstruction, and there  has been finger-pointing on both sides. But let's be clear about what  happened during the Obama administration. During President Obama's time  in office, we saw historic obstruction like never before. Seventy-nine  of President Obama's judicial nominees were blocked by the filibusters.  Seventy-nine nominees were blocked at a time when the judiciary, an  independent branch of government, was saying: We are in judicial crisis  in many jurisdictions. Seventy-nine of Obama's judges were blocked,  compared to 68 nominees obstructed under all Presidents combined. All  of the obstruction from Democrats and  [[Page S2208]]  Republicans and other parties, and only 68 nominees were obstructed,  compared to President Obama, where there were 79.   I do not possess the same view as those who last year believed this  seat should remain vacant and took the obstruction during the Obama  Presidency to a much higher level. I believe that seat should have been  filled not by an extreme jurist but by someone who could have tempered  the partisanship of our time, someone who could have brought us  together. It was a wise choice at a divisive time in our country.   President Obama did not choose somebody from further left; he chose a  moderate Justice who probably could have--if he had been given an up- or-down vote--commanded 60 votes. At this time, that is what President  Trump should have done--put forward a nominee who could have brought  this country together, a moderate nominee, someone within the judicial  mainstream. But he hasn't.   I believe a 60-vote threshold right now is more than appropriate at  this moment in history. There are Republican judicial nominees who  could garner 60 votes in this Chamber. The 60-vote threshold exists  because a person confirmed to serve on the Supreme Court at this time  should be mainstream and independent enough to garner that two-thirds  support.   The 60-vote threshold exists because confirmation of a Justice to the  Supreme Court is one of the most important duties we perform, one of  the most important positions in all of American Government. It is  someone who will have an impact on our society, shaping it and forming  it for generations to come.   This President should have sought real advice and consent from the  entire Senate, but instead he turned to the judicial extreme.   Now more than ever, we need a threshold that can pull our nominees  back to the mainstream, that can begin to heal the divisions. I do not  believe it is in the best interests of my constituents or the American  people to confirm someone so extreme on a 50-vote margin. It should be  60 votes.   I urge my colleagues to understand that this judge threatens those  ideals we hold precious, those words at the very beginning of our  Constitution, ``We the People.'' I urge people to understand that this  is the time more than ever that we must continue to fight to defend the  marginalized, the weak, the people who do not possess wealth, the  people who are standing against powerful corporations, that we cannot  reverse a tradition where our courts were the main societal avenue in  which people could receive equal justice under the law. We cannot put  someone in office who has shown throughout their judicial record to be  contrary to that.   For the sake of this body, now more than ever, it is my hope that we  can see a judicial nominee who will help to heal wounds and not create  them, help to elevate the unity of us as a people, who will help to  affirm the ideals of our Nation and the very conception that we are one  people, we are one Nation, and we hold one destiny.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Record  Expungement Designed to Enhance Employment Act, or REDEEM Act. This  bill would take meaningful steps towards allowing returning citizens to  obtain employment. As President George W. Bush said in his 2004 State  of the Union Address, ``America is the land of the second chance, and  when the gates of the prison open, the path ahead should lead to a  better life.'' The REDEEM Act would help provide people with that  second chance after their incarceration. I thank Senator Paul for his  tireless work with me on the REDEEM Act.   In the last 30 years, the number of incarcerated people in the United  States has drastically increased. Since 1980, the federal prison  population alone has grown by nearly 800 percent and American taxpayers  are left paying for the bill. In fiscal year 2014, the Bureau of  Prisons accounted for a quarter of the Department of Justice's budget  at $6.9 billion. Our bloated criminal justice system wastes priceless  human potential and fails to make our communities safer. It also fails  to adequately prepare the over 600,000 people each year who are  released from prison for their return to the community.   A high number of Americans living in our communities have criminal  convictions. About 70 million people in the United States have been  arrested or convicted of a crime. That means almost one in three adults  in the United States has a criminal record. In fact, in our Nation's  Capital alone, an estimated 1 in 10 DC residents has a criminal record.   The American Bar Association has identified over 44,500 ``collateral  consequences''--or legal constraints--placed on what individuals with  records can do once they are released from prison. Of those, up to 70  percent are related to employment.   Today, a criminal conviction is a modern-day scarlet letter that,  because of the so-called War on Drugs, has had a disproportionate  impact on communities of color. For example, African-American men with  a conviction are 40 percent less likely to receive an interview. And  the likelihood that Latino men with a record will receive an interview  or be offered a job is 18 percent smaller than the likelihood for white  men.   To increase public safety, reduce recidivism, and protect the future  of our children, I am proud to re-introduce the REDEEM Act. This bill  would incentivize states to raise the age of original jurisdiction for  criminal courts to 18 years old. Trying juveniles who have committed  low-level, nonviolent crimes as adults is counterproductive. They do  not emerge from prison reformed and ready to reintegrate into school,  nor will the criminal record they have help them obtain a job.   This change in law is important for protecting our children's  futures. For kids in the dozen states that treat 17- and even 16-year- olds as adults, no longer would getting into a school yard scuffle  result in an adult record that could follow an individual for the rest  of their life, restrict access to a college degree, limit job  prospects, or lead to likely recidivism.   The bill would enhance Federal juvenile record confidentiality and  provide for automatic expungement of records for kids who commit  nonviolent crimes before they turn 15 and automatic sealing of records  for those who commit nonviolent crimes after they turn 15.   The bill would ban the very cruel and counterproductive practice of  juvenile solitary confinement that can have immediate and long-term  detrimental effects on a youth's mental and physical health. In fact,  the majority of suicides by juveniles in prisons occur when young  people are placed in solitary confinement. Other nations even consider  it torture.   The REDEEM Act would, for adults, offer the first broad-based federal  path to the sealing of criminal records. A person who commits a  nonviolent crime will be able to petition a court for sealing of the  record, so their future job prospects are not harmed.   And the bill would enhance the accuracy of criminal justice records.  Employers requesting a background check from the FBI will be provided  with only relevant and accurate information thanks to a provision that  will protect job applicants by improving the quality of the Bureau's  background check.   Think about this: 17 million background checks were done by the FBI  in 2013, many of them for private providers, and upward of half of them  were  [[Page S2366]]  inaccurate or incomplete, often causing people to lose a job, miss an  economic opportunity, and be trapped with few economic options other  than to reoffend in order to feed a child or pay a debt.   The bill helps guard against gender disparities in federal juvenile  delinquency proceedings. Additionally, it would ensure that programming  and services are distributed evenly among male and female juveniles.  Oftentimes, juvenile females receive less programming and resources  than males because of the smaller size of the female prison population.  This is wrong and this bill take a step forward to fix the problem.   Finally, the REDEEM Act would lift a ban on two critical Federal  benefits: the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program and Temporary  Assistance for Needy Families. The intent of those Federal programs is  to keep low-income families from going hungry. Yet those convicted of  drug felonies lose the right to obtain such benefits. Once an  individual has paid his or her debt to society, a path to the  reinstatement of those benefits should be available.   I am proud to introduce the REDEEM Act today. Again, I thank Senator  Paul for partnering with me on this bill. I urge this bill's speedy  passage.                                  ______                                         By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Ms. Murkowski, Ms. Warren, and Mr.          Markey):   S. 836. A bill to amend the Federal Credit Union Act to exclude a  loan secured by a non-owner occupied 1- to 4-family dwelling from the  definition of a member business loan, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fair Chance  to Compete for Jobs Act of 2017, also known as the Fair Chance Act.  This criminal justice reform bill is designed to help returning  citizens successfully obtain jobs and reintegrate into society. As the  nation's largest employer, it is time the Federal Government leads by  example and delays the criminal history inquiry until later in the  hiring process. I thank Senator Johnson for his leadership on the Fair  Chance Act, and I deeply appreciate Senators Baldwin, Ernst, Brown, and  Portman for joining the bill as original cosponsors.   Everyone deserves the dignity of work and the opportunity for a  second chance to earn a living. But far too many Americans who return  home from behind bars have to disclose convictions on their initial  employment application or initial job interview that often serve as  insurmountable barriers to employment. This legislation would ensure  that people with convictions--who have paid their debt to society and  want to turn their lives around--have a fair chance to work.   By encouraging Federal employers to focus on an individual's  qualifications and merit and not solely on past mistakes, the Fair  Chance Act would remove burdensome and unnecessary obstacles that  prevent formerly incarcerated people from reaching their full potential  and contributing to society. It would also help reduce recidivism,  combat poverty, and prevent violence in our communities by helping  people get back to work.   Creating employment opportunities for our returning citizens benefits  public safety. With little hope of obtaining a decent paying job,  returning citizens are often left with few options but to return to a  life of crime. A 2011 study in the Justice Quarterly concluded that the  lack of employment was the single most negative determinant of  recidivism. A report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that of  the over 400,000 State prisoners released in 2005, 67.8 percent of them  were rearrested within 3 years of their release, and 76.6 percent were  rearrested within 5 years of their release.   Creating employment opportunities for our returning citizens  strengthens our economy. Poor job prospects for people with records  reduced our Nation's gross domestic product in 2008 between $57 billion  and $65 billion. With an increasingly competitive global economy and to  maintain America's competitive advantage, we must promote employment of  all Americans.   Today, I introduce the Fair Chance Act, which would help eliminate  barriers to employment for formerly incarcerated people and bring  America closer to truly being a land of opportunity for all. It would  preclude the federal government--including the executive, legislative,  and judicial  [[Page S2367]]  branches--from requesting criminal history information from applicants  until they reach the conditional offer stage.   This bill strikes the right balance. It would allow qualified people  with criminal records to get their foot in the door and be judged on  their own merit. At the same time, the legislation would allow  employers to know an individual's criminal history before the job  applicant is hired.   This bill would prohibit federal contractors from requesting criminal  history information from candidates for positions within the scope of  Federal contracts until a conditional job offer has been extended.  Companies that do business with the Federal Government and receive  Federal funds should espouse good hiring practices. The Fair Chance Act  would permit Federal contractors to inquire about criminal history  earlier in the hiring process if the job requires a candidate to access  classified information.   The bill includes exceptions for sensitive positions where criminal  history inquiries are necessary earlier in the application process.  Exceptions include positions involving classified information,  sensitive national security duties, armed forces, and law enforcement  jobs, and jobs where criminal history information is legally required.   Finally, the Fair Chance Act would require the Bureau of Justice  Statistics, in coordination with the U.S. Census Bureau, to report to  Congress on the employment statistics of returning citizens. Currently,  no comprehensive tracking of data on the employment histories of people  with convictions exists. This provision would change that and allow us  to better understand the scope of the problem people with convictions  face when trying to find a job.   I am proud to reintroduce the Fair Chance Act. I want to again thank  the bill cosponsors and their leadership on this issue. I urge this  legislation's speedy passage.                                  ______                                         By Ms. HASSAN:   S. 848. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to encourage  entrepreneurship by providing loan deferment and loan cancellation for  founders and employees of small business startups, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Record  Expungement Designed to Enhance Employment Act, or REDEEM Act. This  bill would take meaningful steps towards allowing returning citizens to  obtain employment. As President George W. Bush said in his 2004 State  of the Union Address, ``America is the land of the second chance, and  when the gates of the prison open, the path ahead should lead to a  better life.'' The REDEEM Act would help provide people with that  second chance after their incarceration. I thank Senator Paul for his  tireless work with me on the REDEEM Act.   In the last 30 years, the number of incarcerated people in the United  States has drastically increased. Since 1980, the federal prison  population alone has grown by nearly 800 percent and American taxpayers  are left paying for the bill. In fiscal year 2014, the Bureau of  Prisons accounted for a quarter of the Department of Justice's budget  at $6.9 billion. Our bloated criminal justice system wastes priceless  human potential and fails to make our communities safer. It also fails  to adequately prepare the over 600,000 people each year who are  released from prison for their return to the community.   A high number of Americans living in our communities have criminal  convictions. About 70 million people in the United States have been  arrested or convicted of a crime. That means almost one in three adults  in the United States has a criminal record. In fact, in our Nation's  Capital alone, an estimated 1 in 10 DC residents has a criminal record.   The American Bar Association has identified over 44,500 ``collateral  consequences''--or legal constraints--placed on what individuals with  records can do once they are released from prison. Of those, up to 70  percent are related to employment.   Today, a criminal conviction is a modern-day scarlet letter that,  because of the so-called War on Drugs, has had a disproportionate  impact on communities of color. For example, African-American men with  a conviction are 40 percent less likely to receive an interview. And  the likelihood that Latino men with a record will receive an interview  or be offered a job is 18 percent smaller than the likelihood for white  men.   To increase public safety, reduce recidivism, and protect the future  of our children, I am proud to re-introduce the REDEEM Act. This bill  would incentivize states to raise the age of original jurisdiction for  criminal courts to 18 years old. Trying juveniles who have committed  low-level, nonviolent crimes as adults is counterproductive. They do  not emerge from prison reformed and ready to reintegrate into school,  nor will the criminal record they have help them obtain a job.   This change in law is important for protecting our children's  futures. For kids in the dozen states that treat 17- and even 16-year- olds as adults, no longer would getting into a school yard scuffle  result in an adult record that could follow an individual for the rest  of their life, restrict access to a college degree, limit job  prospects, or lead to likely recidivism.   The bill would enhance Federal juvenile record confidentiality and  provide for automatic expungement of records for kids who commit  nonviolent crimes before they turn 15 and automatic sealing of records  for those who commit nonviolent crimes after they turn 15.   The bill would ban the very cruel and counterproductive practice of  juvenile solitary confinement that can have immediate and long-term  detrimental effects on a youth's mental and physical health. In fact,  the majority of suicides by juveniles in prisons occur when young  people are placed in solitary confinement. Other nations even consider  it torture.   The REDEEM Act would, for adults, offer the first broad-based federal  path to the sealing of criminal records. A person who commits a  nonviolent crime will be able to petition a court for sealing of the  record, so their future job prospects are not harmed.   And the bill would enhance the accuracy of criminal justice records.  Employers requesting a background check from the FBI will be provided  with only relevant and accurate information thanks to a provision that  will protect job applicants by improving the quality of the Bureau's  background check.   Think about this: 17 million background checks were done by the FBI  in 2013, many of them for private providers, and upward of half of them  were  [[Page S2366]]  inaccurate or incomplete, often causing people to lose a job, miss an  economic opportunity, and be trapped with few economic options other  than to reoffend in order to feed a child or pay a debt.   The bill helps guard against gender disparities in federal juvenile  delinquency proceedings. Additionally, it would ensure that programming  and services are distributed evenly among male and female juveniles.  Oftentimes, juvenile females receive less programming and resources  than males because of the smaller size of the female prison population.  This is wrong and this bill take a step forward to fix the problem.   Finally, the REDEEM Act would lift a ban on two critical Federal  benefits: the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program and Temporary  Assistance for Needy Families. The intent of those Federal programs is  to keep low-income families from going hungry. Yet those convicted of  drug felonies lose the right to obtain such benefits. Once an  individual has paid his or her debt to society, a path to the  reinstatement of those benefits should be available.   I am proud to introduce the REDEEM Act today. Again, I thank Senator  Paul for partnering with me on this bill. I urge this bill's speedy  passage.                                  ______    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fair Chance  to Compete for Jobs Act of 2017, also known as the Fair Chance Act.
