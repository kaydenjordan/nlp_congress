 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  honor the passage of one of my great constituents, Lee Jernigan of  Oroville, California.   During Lee's lifetime, he had joined the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1943  and served as an aerial gunner and airplane mechanic on a B-17 during  World War II, where he flew 23 missions in the Asian Pacific.   Lee graduated from Chico State in 1950 and received his master's  degree in 1959 in education. Lee was known specifically for his passion  and commitment to God, his family, and for educating the young people  of our community.   It should come as no surprise that Lee was a beloved elementary and  middle school teacher and then went on to be my principal at Central  Middle School in Oroville, California, for 54 years of career. Lee was  known to be kind, with a sense of humor, and this was one principal I  was never really in trouble with.   Lee was devoted to teaching, but also devoted to his loving wife,  Hazel, whom he married in 1948 and remained with for 72 years until his  passing.   Lee was a man of extreme dedication and commitment to his wife, to  his country, and to learning for the children of his community. Of  course, we can all learn from that, as well.   Madam Speaker, God bless Lee Jernigan and his family.                            ____________________
