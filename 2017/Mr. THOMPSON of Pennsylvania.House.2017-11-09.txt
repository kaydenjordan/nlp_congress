 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks the 242nd  birthday of the U.S. Marine Corps.   In today's own unpredictable world, the Marines are as important and  essential now as ever before.   I am proud to have a member of the Marine Corps serving in my  Washington office as a legislative fellow. Paul Camacho achieved the  rank of staff sergeant during his service from 2000 to 2008. He is a  native of Philadelphia and served as a field artillery cannoneer.   At one point, Paul was the youngest marine in the entire Marine  Corps, an achievement that is celebrated each year during cake-cutting  ceremonies.   To Paul and all those who are part of ``The Few. The Proud. The  Marines,'' I say happy birthday and thank you for your service. Thank  you to all who have served in one of the most respected fighting forces  in the world.   Mr. Speaker, it was President Ronald Reagan who said ``some people  spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference in the  world. But, the Marines don't have that problem.''   Happy birthday.                            ____________________
