 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Bill Hamilton, Jr. of  Overland Park, Kansas, who passed away on January 4, 2018. Bill was  born in Dallas, Texas, on February 18, 1918. In 1940, he graduated from  the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, now known as Texas  A&M University, with a degree in civil engineering.   In World War II, Bill served as a lieutenant in the Army. He was in  command of an antiaircraft unit in the Philippines at Corregidor  Island. Bill was part of the American defensive forces trying to hold  Corregidor Island from the Japanese.   Fighting valiantly, the American forces held the island for 5 months,  only surrendering to Japanese forces after all ammunition and supplies  were exhausted. The Japanese had expected to take the island in 3  weeks.   On April 21, 1942, while defending Corregidor, he and approximately  24 other Texas Aggies gathered together at The Rock, as Corregidor is  now known, to observe Aggie Muster. While Japanese bombs fell on the  island, those Aggies participated in this proud tradition and called  the roll for those Aggies who had lost their lives during the preceding  months. This event during wartime brought the solemn Aggie Muster  tradition to the attention of the entire world.   With the passing of Bill Hamilton, we have lost the last of the  survivors of the 1942 Muster at The Rock.   After being captured at Corregidor Island, Bill spent 3\1/2\ years as  a prisoner of war, being held at camps, including Camp Cabanatuan in  the Philippines and Camp Fukuoka in Japan.   Amazingly, Bill was a passenger on three Japanese prisoner ships that  were struck by the U.S. Army Air Force, yet he survived all three  incidents.   In August of 1945, he was finally liberated by the American forces  from Camp Hoten in Manchuria. For his honorable and distinguished  service, Bill received many honors, including a Bronze Star, a Purple  Heart, the Distinguished Unit Badge, three Oak Leaf Clusters, and the  Prisoner of War Medal.   After the war, Bill resumed life in America, and he married the love  of his life, Margaret Jacobs, in 1946. He also began working for the  Santa Fe Railroad as a bridge engineer. Bill worked for the Santa Fe  Railroad company for 38 years and was known as an exemplary employee.   A man of great character, Bill was an integral part of the veterans  community and was a member of the Reserve Officers Association,  Defenders of the Bataan and Corregidor, and American Ex-Prisoners of  War.   Mr. Speaker, selfless service to those around him defined Bill  Hamilton's life. He worked tirelessly to defend our freedom and to  better communities in which he lived. He is loved by his community, and  he certainly left an enduring impression on our Nation. He will be  forever remembered as a selfless soldier, community member, husband,  father, friend to hundreds, and an honorably fighting Texas Aggie.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Hamilton family. We also lift up the family and friends of Bill in  our prayers.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol  to honor the life and legacy of Bill Hamilton, Jr.   As I close today, I urge all Americans to continue praying for our  country during these difficult times, for our military men and women  who protect us from external threats, and for our first responders who  protect us here at home.                          Honoring Wilton A. Lanning     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Wilton Lanning of  Waco, Texas, who passed away on January 10, 2018.   Wilton was born on June 12, 1936, in Waco. He graduated from Waco  High School and would go on to graduate from Baylor University and  would be a proud Baylor Bear for the rest of his life. At Baylor,  Wilton met his wife of 57 years, Lanell ``Lee'' Lanning.   Wilton was a lifelong Waco resident, a proud advocate for Waco  businesses, and an avid amateur historian of the city. He worked for 40  years at Waco's then oldest business, Tom Padgitt, Inc., where he  served as president and CEO.   Always looking for ways to push development in Waco, he served as the  executive director of the Waco Business League, chairman of the Greater  Waco Chamber of Commerce, and he was a member of the Baylor Waco  [[Page H5006]]  Foundation. He also served on several boards, including the Hillcrest  Baptist Medical Center, the Waco Industrial Foundation, the Waco  Mammoth Foundation, the Brazos Higher Education Service Corporation,  and as president of the board of the Waco YMCA.   Upon his retirement from the Waco Business League, Wilton received  the Waco Business League Lifetime Achievement Award. He was also the  recipient of awards such as the James H. Lockwood Masonic Lodge 1343,  the A.F. & A.M. Community Builder Award, the National Philanthropy  Lifetime Achievement Award, and the Silver Eagle Award from the Boy  Scouts of America.   Wilton built his life on a foundation of serving and giving back to  others, a value he learned as an Eagle Scout and certainly reenforced  by his father who served as a captain in the United States Army.   Wilton was a lifelong supporter of Baylor University and an active  member of the Baylor Alumni Association. In recognition of this, his  family has received the Baylor Alumni Association's First Family of  Baylor Award.   Wilton also held a special place in his heart for the Waco-born soft  drink, Dr Pepper. As a result, he cofounded the Dr Pepper Museum in  Waco, which details the origins of this famous soft drink.   When he became a grandfather, he asked to be called ``Dr Pepper'' by  his grandkids. When he was rebuffed, he settled on being called,  simply, ``Pepper.''   Mr. Speaker, Wilton Lanning worked tirelessly to better the Waco  community. From his 40 years at Padgitt's to his time with the Business  League, Wilton certainly left an impression on central Texas. He will  be forever remembered by his passion for Waco as a great  philanthropist, a businessman, a husband, a father, a grandfather, and  a friend.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Lanning family. We also lift up the family and friends of Wilton in  our prayers.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol  to honor the life and legacy of Wilton Lanning.   As I close, I urge all Americans to continue praying for their  country during these difficult times, for our military men and women  who protect us from external threats, and for our first responders who  protect us here at home.                         Honoring Beatrice Rodriguez     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Beatrice Rodriguez of  Bryan, Texas, who passed away on February 28, 2018.   Beatrice was born in Somerville, Texas, in 1941. Her father was a  railroad worker, who was paralyzed on the job while he was in his  thirties. Her mother took care of the home and her father after he was  paralyzed.   Beatrice was one of nine children and learned to cook at an early age  to help her family. She also worked as a waitress, picked cotton, and  worked at a grocery store to earn money for the family.   When Beatrice was 18 years old, she met the love of her life, Richard  Rodriguez, at a dance in Caldwell, Texas. After the dance, Richard and  Beatrice became inseparable.   Richard asked Beatrice's father for her hand in marriage, but her  father refused. The couple then decided to elope, which they did on  October 31, 1960. They were married for 57 loving years and had three  daughters.   In their thirties, the couple started their first restaurant and  named it the Buccaneer. When a chance to move the business to downtown  Bryan came up, the couple took the opportunity and named the new  restaurant Casa Rodriguez. Opened in 1978, the restaurant serves  authentic home-style Mexican cuisine and has repeatedly been voted as  one of the best restaurants in the Brazos Valley.   Beatrice was a local celebrity in our Brazos Valley community. She  was known to always keep up a distinguished appearance in public, and  she owned a large collection of hats, which earned her the nickname  ``The Hat Lady'' around town. She had a warm and fun-loving demeanor,  which helped her easily connect to those who encountered her.   Her caring heart came, in part, from her deep faith in God. She was a  devout Catholic and attended Santa Teresa Catholic Church in Bryan. You  could often find her in the church praying for loved ones.   She was also a loving grandmother and affectionately called Grandma  Bea by her seven grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, selfless service to her community and to our community  defined Beatrice's life. She worked tirelessly to uphold the values of  Bryan-College Station and brought smiles, great food, and love to those  around her. She is loved by our residents and certainly left an  enduring impression on our Brazos Valley community. She will be forever  remembered as a selfless community leader, a wife, a mother, a  grandmother, and a dear friend.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Rodriguez family. We also lift up the family and friends of  Beatrice Rodriguez in our prayers.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol  to honor the life and legacy of Beatrice Rodriguez.   As I close today, I ask all Americans to continue praying for our  country during these difficult times, for our families, for our  military men and women who protect us from external threats, and for  our first responders who protect us here at home.                            Honoring Joe Rodriguez     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Joe Rodriguez of Waco,  Texas, who passed away on March 15, 2018.   Joe was born in 1941 in Ansonia, Ohio. His family soon moved to  Texas, where he grew up under difficult circumstances in a tough  neighborhood between Bellmead and Waco. The neighborhood was known as  No Man's Land, where residents were known to dig their own wells for  water. Joe attended La Vega High School and went on to attend McLennan  Community College in Waco. During that time, he also met and married  the love of his life, Alice Martinez.   Overcoming his difficult upbringing, Joe became a leader in the Waco  area. He served two terms as mayor of Bellmead and was a union leader  at the General Tire and Rubber Company plant. He also served as the  director of the Economic Opportunities Advancement Corporation's Head  Start program. In one of his more prominent roles, Joe also served as  the CEO of the Cen-Tex Hispanic Chamber of Commerce for over 20 years.   Always sticking to his principles and looking for ways to better our  community, Joe was committed to providing equal opportunities for all,  empowering youth, and helping Hispanic-owned businesses in the area  succeed. He was a strong advocate for minority communities and believed  that there was strength in diversity, and he advocated for higher  education as a way so that anyone could make it in America.   Mr. Speaker, selfless service to those around him defined Joe's life.  He worked tirelessly to better our community, and he built strong  relationships throughout Waco. He is loved by his city, and he has  certainly left an enduring impression on our central Texas community.  He will be forever remembered as a selfless community member, leader,  husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and friend.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Rodriguez family. We also lift up the family and friends of Joe in  our prayers.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol  in honor of the life and legacy of Joe Rodriguez.   As I close today, I ask all Americans to continue praying for our  country during these difficult times, for our military men and women  who protect us from external threats, and for our first responders who  protect us here at home.                           Honoring Arnold Mathias     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor my dear friend, Arnold  Robert Mathias, of Waco, Texas, who passed away on April 27, 2018.   Arnold Mathias was born in 1922 in Copperas Cove, Texas. While born  in very modest circumstances, his parents would raise both him and his  brother in a loving and nurturing family during the Great Depression.   After graduating from Copperas Cove High School, Arnold attended the  University of California at Berkeley and Texas Tech University, from  which he received a bachelor of business administration.  [[Page H5007]]    Shortly after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Arnold volunteered for the  U.S. Army. While initially, as an 18-year-old, the bombing meant little  to him, he ultimately experienced a surge of patriotism for our great  Nation, and he felt committed to serve. That patriotism and commitment  stayed with him throughout his lifetime.   During World War II, Arnold was the leader of a tank platoon in the  13th Armored Division, 24th Tank Battalion that was incorporated into  General Patton's 3rd Army. He was wounded in the battle for the German  Ruhr Valley when his tank exploded while under heavy fire from the  Germans.   After recovering from his wounds, he returned to the front lines.  Once victory was declared in Europe, he was told to prepare for the  Japanese invasion. He was spared from being deployed to Japan after  President Truman ordered the use of atomic bombs to achieve victory  over Japan.   After the war, Arnold married Margie Dane Calhoun in 1950. Their 68- year marriage produced a loving family with three daughters who blessed  him with four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.   Upon leaving Active Duty, Arnold began a long and fruitful career of  public service. He managed a couple of community chambers of commerce  in central Texas before becoming a district manager for the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce headquartered in Houston. He also served as  chairman of the zoning commission and was elected to the city  commission and served as the mayor of a small city in Harris County,  Texas. He then served as the southwestern regional manager for the U.S.  Chamber in Dallas.   Upon retiring from the U.S. Chamber, Arnold served as district  director for the 11th Congressional District, which at the time  included Waco and other portions of central Texas. He then went on to  continue working in politics and public affairs as a consultant.                                time  1245    In addition to his professional career, Arnold served and  participated in many civic and service associations, including central  Texas chairman of the Girl Scouts of America, chairman of the United  Way, board member of the Lions Club, the Downtown Dallas Rotary Club,  the Waco Rotary Club, a Paul Harris Fellow, the National Trust for  Historic Preservation, the Cameron Park Zoological Society, Keep Waco  Beautiful, and the Waco Historic Foundation.   Arnold's Christian faith was also very important to him and his  family. At one time or another, he headed nearly every office in the  local congregation of which he was a member. He also held leadership  positions as the president of the Lone Star District of the Walther  League, as state treasurer of the Lutheran Laymen's League, and as a  member of the Board of Directors of the Texas District of the Lutheran  Church.   As a veteran, Arnold's post-military affiliations included the  Disabled American Veterans, the American Legion, and the Military Order  of the Purple Heart.   In 2012, Arnold was nominated by members of our community to receive  the Texas 17th Congressional District Veteran Commendation. It was an  honor to bestow him with this unique award that recognized not only his  selfless service to our Nation, but also a community volunteer to our  central Texas community.   Even after Arnold's death, his service continued as he had his body  sent to the Anatomical Board of the State of Texas for use in teaching  and scientific purposes.   Mr. Speaker, selfless service to those around him defined Arnold's  life. He worked tirelessly to better our community and built strong  relationships in Waco. He is loved by his city, and certainly left an  enduring impression on our central Texas community. He will be forever  remembered as a selfless community leader, a war hero, a veteran, a  husband, a father, a grandfather, a great-grandfather, and a dear  friend.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest condolences to the Mathias  family. We also lift up the family and friends of Arnold in our  prayers.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol  to honor the life and service of Arnold Mathias.   As I close today, I ask all Americans to continue praying for our  country during these difficult times, for our military men and women  who protect us from external threats, and for our first responders who  protect us here at home.                         Honoring Emily Tooker-Blake     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Emily Tooker-Blake of  Waco, Texas, who turned 100 years old on March 18, 2018.   Emily was raised during the Great Depression, and worked as an  assistant to her father, who was a dentist in Waco. Money was difficult  to come by, and her father used to trade dental work for eggs or  chickens to feed their family.   Graduating from Waco High School, Emily soon married Leslie Tooker,  who worked for his father and who owned an ice cream shop in town.  Leslie eventually learned the dental tradecraft from his father-in-law  and followed in his footprints to become a dentist in Waco. Emily  worked alongside her husband, working as a part-time dental assistant  until her retirement at age 60.   Emily and Leslie raised three children: Max; Leslie, Jr.; and their  daughter, Leroy. Emily and Leslie also had a knack for adventure and  followed their son, Leslie, Jr., to South America, living there until  moving back to Texas in 1990.   Today, Emily lives with her daughter in Waco. She still makes her own  food and her mind is super sharp. She listens to talk radio daily and  is a strong Republican. She loves to tell stories about her colorful  past to friends and family, and she is surrounded by a community who  loves her.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize Emily Tooker-Blake on this  joyous occasion, and I know that her family and friends love her and  are proud of her. I wish her many more years of health and happiness.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol  to honor Emily Tooker-Blake on the occasion of her 100th birthday.   As I close today, I ask all Americans to continue praying for our  country during these difficult times, for our military men and women  who protect us from external threats, and for our first responders who  protect us here at home.         Honoring the Brazos County World War I Centennial Committee     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the men and women who  trained in Brazos County, Texas, who defended our freedom during World  War I. I also rise to recognize the Brazos County World War I  Centennial Committee, who are making sure these veterans are honored on  the 100-year anniversary of the United States entering World War I.   Brazos County has a deep history with World War I. In 1917, the  United States Council of Defense selected Texas A&M University as one  of the six colleges in the United States to host training for a  division of the United States Army Signal Corps. Signal Corps members  received instruction in: electrical engineering, telegraphy, radio  work, induction sets, pack sets, field work, visual signaling,  telephony, dry and storage batteries, outside wiring, switch boards,  and construction of lance pole and tripod lines.   Texas A&M University was also the only Allied training location for  meteorology, and trained nearly 4,000 troops and mechanics.   The Brazos County World War I Centennial Committee has identified  over 800 veterans buried in Brazos County, and it is committed to  honoring their memory as the centennial of their service approaches.  Among those veterans buried in Brazos County are men, women, African  Americans, Jewish Americans, Hispanics, and first-generation Americans.   It is an honor to recognize their distinguished service to our  country during our time of great need, and to recognize the Centennial  Committee for their work to make sure that these veterans' legacies are  honored and remembered not only on the centennial anniversary, but for  generations to come.    Our Brazos County cities of Bryan and College Station have each  joined with the Brazos County World War I Centennial Committee to  proclaim  [[Page H5008]]  April 17, 2017, as World War I Remembrance Day. I encourage other  communities in our great country to consider taking similar actions.   I have requested that a United States flag be flown over the Capitol  to honor the life and legacy of those World War I veterans who trained  in the Brazos Valley, and to honor the Brazos Valley World War I  Centennial Committee.   As I close today, I ask that all Americans continue to pray for our  country, for our military men and women who protect us from external  threats, and for our first responders who protect us here at home.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
