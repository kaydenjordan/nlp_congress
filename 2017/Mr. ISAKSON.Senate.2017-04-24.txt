 Mr. President, first of all, I have a rare opportunity  to follow Jon Tester, who is a great farmer from Montana, a great  ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and a man who knows  agriculture well.   I grew up picking up pecans off the ground on my grandfather's farm.  I know a little about it. I know the salt-of-the-earth people who grow  our food and our fiber who make our country work. I doubt if many  people have had the opportunity to be a U.S. Senator, but I know this;  that very few have had the opportunity to be a U.S. Senator and serve  with the cousin of an ag commissioner, because the Presiding Officer  who is presiding over this vote is the cousin of Sonny Perdue, the man  we are going to confirm as Secretary of Agriculture under Donald  Trump's administration. I am pleased to be the senior Senator from  Georgia to brag about all of the Perdues whom I know in my State and  all they have contributed to our State and how important Sonny Perdue  is going to be to us as the Secretary of Agriculture.   If one looked in Webster's Dictionary--and if it were a picture  dictionary and every word were described not by words but by a  picture--if one looked up ``Ag Secretary,'' you would see Sonny  Perdue's picture.   Think about this for a second. He grew up on a row crop farm in  Bonaire, GA, which is an ag community in our State. He was in the  fertilizer business and the grain business. He was a partner in a  storage and shipping business with his cousin, the junior Senator from  Georgia, David Perdue. He graduated with a doctorate degree in  veterinary medicine from the University of Georgia--one of the  preeminent veterinary medicine schools in the country. He presided as  Governor of the State of Georgia after he was speaker pro tempore of  the senate of the State of Georgia. He was the president pro tempore in  the senate when he was a Democrat. He was the Governor when he was a  Republican. He did not switch parties for any reason except that he  wanted to do right, and when one party went in the wrong direction, he  took the party in the next direction and took them to lead our State to  bigger and higher heights. He presided over a State that has 42,000  farmers and a $75 billion farm gate product. Georgia is agriculture and  knows agriculture.    I served in the legislature with him in the State senate. I served  under him when he was our Governor. I served with him as the Governor  when I was in the U.S. House, and later in the U.S. Senate. We worked  on agriculture business and port business. We worked on the Port of  Savannah. We worked on everything that was in the interests of Georgia.  Sonny Perdue knows that there is one way to do a job, and that is the  best way he knows how: Do it right the first time, and you never have  to apologize.   President Trump has made a great decision for our State. He has made  a great decision for our country. He has picked the finest person you  could find available in the United States to be the Secretary of  Agriculture for the United States of America.  [[Page S2481]]    He graduated from the University of Georgia, was in the farm business  himself, served as a Governor, served as the speaker pro tempore, and  married the prettiest woman in Georgia--and I will get in trouble for  classifying her that way, but it happens to be the truth, and I never  lie on the floor of the Senate.   I am going to be proud tonight when I cast my vote for Sonny Perdue  as Secretary of Agriculture, along with the Presiding Officer and  everybody else. I commend our President on a great selection, I  congratulate our State on a great favorite son, and I commend the  Senate Committee on Agriculture for the nomination of a great  Agriculture Secretary, as well as Senator Roberts.   I commend my brother and my friend, my fellow Georgian, Sonny Perdue,  to the Senate today, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor  of his nomination.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, today I wish to thank COL Scott Jackson  for his exemplary service and outstanding leadership as the chief of  the Army's Senate Liaison Division. During his tenure with the Office  of the Chief Legislation Liaison, Scott was able to bring more than 24  years of experience in various leadership and staff positions to  provide superior support to the work of the U.S. Senate. Additionally,  I congratulate Scott on his recent selection to command the Army's  first Security Force Assistance Brigade at Fort Benning, GA.   In support of the global war on terror, Scott has deployed to Iraq  three times, for a cumulative 41 months. In 2003, he served as the lead  operational planner for the First Cavalry Division, writing the initial  counterinsurgency campaign plan for Baghdad; subsequently assigned as  the executive officer for 2nd Battalion 7th Cavalry Regiment and  participated in its assault into Najaf, Iraq, August 2004, and  Fallujah, Iraq, November 2004. In 2006-2008, he served as the 3rd Heavy  Brigade Combat Team, First Cavalry Division, deputy brigade commander  with duty as the deputy team leader, Diyala Provincial Reconstruction  Team, where he was the governance team leader and senior coalition  adviser to the governor of Diyala, providing daily coaching,  mentorship, and liaison to the provincial governor.   In April 2008, Scott assumed command of 1st Battalion 5th Cavalry  Regiment and deployed his battalion in January 2009, assuming  responsibility for coalition operations in the Baghdad districts of  Adamiyah, Rusafa, and Taji. During this deployment, his battalion  executed the coalition withdrawal from the cities and transition of  responsibility to the Iraqi Security Forces.   Following command, Scott was selected to be the assistant chief of  staff, G3, Operations and Plans, for the First Cavalry Division and  subsequently selected as an Army War College fellow at the MIT Lincoln  Laboratory. While at Lincoln Laboratory, Scott focused his research on  how technology enables the application of strategy, producing an  original research project entitled, ``An Operational Design Concept for  Wide Area Persistent Biometric Surveillance.''   Following the War College, Scott served as the 3rd Infantry Division,  Rear chief of staff, while the headquarters was deployed in support of  Operation Enduring Freedom. He then went on to assume command of the  2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team, SPARTANS, at Fort Stewart, GA, from  2013 to 2015.   Scott's humble character rarely does justice to his accomplishments  and accolades. However, he does speak very proudly of his wife,  Valerie, and their sons, Benjamin and William. Military families are  true testaments of both strength and pride. They are constantly  challenged by deployments, changes in duty stations, and uncertainties.  These hurdles create resiliency that the Jackson family patriotically  embodies. Scott's family are his pride and joy and will equally be  missed by everyone they have inspired during their time here.   While we will miss having Scott's support and counsel here in the  Senate, I know that he will be moving on to greater things. I want to  again thank Scott and his family for their service to our great Nation  and congratulate him for his selection to command the Army's newest  brigade at Fort Benning.                            ____________________
