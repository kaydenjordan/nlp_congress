 Mr. President, it is my privilege to recognize the  patriots and healers that work at the Central Arkansas Veterans  Healthcare System's Russellville Community Based Outpatient Clinic.  Those exceptional men and women have honored President Lincoln's famous  admonition: ``to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for  his widow, and his orphan.''   The clinic's nurses and doctors care for over 2,300 veterans in the  area and facilitate 14,000 appointments each year. Since it opened 13  years ago, this place of healing has treated and restored the health of  tens of thousands of veterans and their family members. As important as  the quantity of patients they serve is the quality of the service these  caregivers provide. And the Russellville clinic is renowned for showing  their patients the respect and attention that veterans deserve.   One patient, 98-year-old World War II veteran Jock Davis, was so  grateful for the Russellville clinic's professional and diligent care,  that he is helping organize a June 23 ceremony thanking the employees.  I join my fellow Arkansans in gratitude for this clinic and its  selfless public servants.   The employees at the Russellville clinic are fulfilling a sacred  covenant between the Nation and its veterans. Every man and woman in  uniform who serves our country should know that when they return to  civilian life, they will be cared for and honored by the Nation they  sacrificed to defend.   The doctors and nurses of Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare  System's Russellville Community Based Outpatient Clinic are making our  State and country proud. God bless them, God bless our veterans, and  God bless the United States of America.                            ____________________
