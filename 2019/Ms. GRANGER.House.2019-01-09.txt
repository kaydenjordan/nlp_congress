 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 264.   Unfortunately, as with all the appropriations bills we consider this  week, moving this bill across the House floor will not resolve the  partial government shutdown.   It is a job and responsibility of Congress to appropriate funds. We  must come together, both Republicans and Democrats, in the House and  the Senate, to put together a legislation solution that will reopen the  government and fund border security, one that represents the will of  both Chambers and the American people.   By considering only the Senate-passed versions of these  appropriations bills, we are ignoring the will of this Chamber by  eliminating House Members' involvement in the appropriations process.   The bill before us today funds Senate priorities at the expense of  House priorities. In particular, the Financial Services and General  Government bill falls short in several areas: constructing border  points of entry, assisting taxpayers and U.S. businesses, and following  through on commonsense bipartisan financial reforms.   I want to thank my colleague from Georgia (Mr. Graves) for his  efforts today and over the last several months to ensure that the  House's voice is heard in this debate.
