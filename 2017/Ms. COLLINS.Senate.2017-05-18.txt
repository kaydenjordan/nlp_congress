 Mr. President, each May we recognize National Police  Week to honor the service and sacrifice of U.S. law enforcement  officers and to pay tribute to those who have lost their lives in the  line of duty. One meaningful way for us to honor our police officers  and other law enforcement officials this week is to give them the tools  they need to stop the illegal firearms traffickers who threaten their  lives and the lives of those they protect.   Today, I rise to join Senator Leahy in introducing the Stop Illegal  Trafficking and Firearms Act. Our bill would strengthen Federal law by  making it easier for prosecutors to go after gun traffickers, while  fully protecting the rights of the vast majority of gun owners who are  law-abiding citizens.   Straw purchasing is intended to achieve only one result, and that is  to put a gun in the hands of a criminal who cannot legally obtain one.  Today, traffickers exploit weaknesses in our laws by targeting  individuals who can lawfully purchase guns, which are then used to  commit crimes once they are transferred to the criminal, who would be  unable to pass the background check. Right now, a straw purchaser can  only be prosecuted for lying on a Federal form, and that is treated as  a paperwork violation. Our bill would create new criminal offenses for  straw purchasing, which would help our law enforcement officials take  down these criminal enterprises.   The illegal guns that we are targeting in our bill are frequently  sold, resold, and trafficked across State lines, resulting in the  proliferation of the illegal firearms in our communities. This practice  has fueled the violence across our southern border associated with the  Mexican drug cartels, as well as gang violence in our cities and,  tragically, the heroin crisis that is ravaging so many families and  communities and undermining public health and safety in States like  Maine.   Police officers tell me they have seen a major influx of drug dealers  coming from out of State, straight up I-95's iron pipeline and other  interstate highways, with direct ties to gangs in major cities. They  are ready to sell or trade prescription opioids and heroin for illegal  guns.    Heroin flooding into our communities is reaching crisis levels. In  2016, there were 376 drug-induced overdose deaths in my State, the  State of Maine. That is more than car crashes and suicides put  together. It is 104 more deaths than the year before. So this crisis  with opioids and heroin is getting worse, not better. The vast majority  of these overdoses were caused by at least one opioid, whether  pharmaceutical or illicit.   Often, drug dealers and gang members follow a similar pattern: They  target addicts who have no criminal records, and then they trade or  sell them drugs in exchange for guns. These gang members with criminal  records cross into Maine and link up with drug addicts to be their  straw buyers. These addicts are people with clean records who may  legally purchase firearms. The addict then exchanges the gun for heroin  to support his or her drug dependency, and the cycle is repeated time  and again.   Last year I had a deeply disturbing briefing from Federal law  enforcement officials about a case in Maine that fit this exact  pattern. Gang members trafficked crack cocaine and heroin between New  Haven, CT, and Bangor, ME. They committed acts of violence, including  assaults, armed robberies, attempted murder, and murder. They traded  narcotics for firearms and then distributed them to other gang members  back in Connecticut. This is exactly the type of criminal activity our  bill aims to prevent, and it complements existing laws that target  criminals who are profiting from firearms and drug trafficking.   Current Federal law makes preventing and prosecuting straw purchasing  offenses very difficult for law enforcement officials, since a straw  purchaser can be prosecuted only for lying on a Federal form, a  relatively minor offense.   The Stop Illegal Trafficking in Firearms Act would create new,  specific criminal offenses for straw purchasing and trafficking in  firearms. Instead of a slap on the wrist, these crimes would be  punishable by up to 15 years in prison. For those straw purchasers who  knew or have reasonable cause to believe that the firearm would be used  to  [[Page S3045]]  commit a crime of violence, that crime would be punishable by up to 25  years in prison.   Our bill would also strengthen existing laws that prohibit gun  smuggling. Right now, it is illegal for someone to smuggle a firearm  into the United States with the intent to engage in drug trafficking or  violent crime. To combat the drug cartels operating on our southern  border, however, we must also prohibit firearms and ammunition from  being trafficked out of the United States for those illegal purposes.  In so doing, our bill would provide an important tool to combat  trafficking organizations that are exporting firearms and ammunition  from the United States and into Mexico where they are used by the drug  cartels that are in turn fueling the heroin crisis here at home.   In a recent investigation along our southern border, ATF agents  seized nearly 40,000 rounds of illegal ammunition from suspects who  were attempting to smuggle both firearms and ammunition across the  border and into Mexico. Similarly, a large percentage of the guns used  in crimes in our largest cities were trafficked across State lines.   I want to emphasize that our bill fully protects the Second Amendment  rights of our law-abiding citizens. It protects legitimate private gun  sales and is drafted to avoid sweeping in innocent transactions and  placing unnecessary burdens on lawful private sales. It expressly  exempts certain transactions that are permitted under current laws,  such as gifts, raffles, and auctions. Furthermore, the bill expressly  prohibits any authority provided by this act from being used to  establish a Federal firearms registry--something I am strongly opposed  to.   I started my remarks by reminding us all that this is National Police  Week. Let's honor our police officers and other law enforcement by  giving them this much needed tool to crack down on illegal firearm  traffickers who are exploiting our addicts in so many ways in order to  obtain guns that they are not legally able to purchase. I urge my  colleagues to support this much needed legislation.   Thank you, Mr. President.                            ____________________     Mr. President, each May we recognize National Police  Week to honor the service and sacrifice of U.S. law enforcement  officers and to pay tribute to those who have lost their lives in the  line of duty.
