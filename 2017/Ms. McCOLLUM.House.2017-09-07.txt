 Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Heck).    Mr. Chairman, I have no opposition to this en bloc  amendment moving forward, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have no other speakers present at this  time, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Ranking Member Lowey,  I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. O'Halleran).    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.        Amendments En Bloc No. 2 Offered by Mr. Calvert of California     Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this en bloc  amendment.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Kilmer).    Mr. Chairman, I am opposed to all these amendments  included in the en bloc. Many of them use offsets from accounts in the  Environmental Protection Agency of the Fish and Wildlife Service, and  they are already severely underfunded.   I am particularly troubled by one amendment to this group that  threatens our Nation's most visited wilderness area. Let me tell you  why I oppose the Emmer amendment.   The Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, located in northern  Minnesota, is one of the last truly wild places in America. These 1.1  million acres of unspoiled woodlands and more than 1,000 pristine lakes  are beloved by adventurers, canoers, and sportsmen from all across our  country. This national treasure lies in the vast Rainy River Watershed  and flows north into Voyageurs National Park and onward towards Canada.   Recently, there has been a push to conduct sulfide-ore copper mining  less than 3 miles from the Boundary Waters Wilderness. This mining  threatens to irreplaceably damage the waters, the wildlife, and the  landscape. Sulfur ore mining is the most toxic industry in America,  polluting waterways with acid drainage that contains arsenic, mercury,  and lead.   In 2014, the Mount Polley sulfide-ore mine in British Columbia  failed, dumping billions of liters of toxic sludge and leaving  permanent environmental damage in its wake.   To protect the boundary waters from this type of destruction, the  Forest Service acted last December and launched a thorough  environmental analysis with public engagement to assess what type of  mining, if any, is appropriate on Federal lands and this watershed for  the next 20 years. The Trump and the Obama administrations have both  agreed we need a thorough, scientific-based assessment of the best  management of this sensitive ecosystem and conservation of our boundary  waters.   The Emmer amendment upends this careful process. It pushes aside the  Forest Service's ongoing study. It mandates that dangerous copper and  sulfide mining will be allowed in the watershed, regardless of the  conclusions of this environmental study, and it intentionally ignores a  public process that hundreds of thousands of Americans weighed in on  with comments on both sides of the issue. In my opinion, this amendment  sets a horrible precedent, wastes taxpayer dollars already invested in  this study, and threatens a national treasure, and it should never  become law.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I must oppose this amendment that takes  more money away from an already starved Environmental Protection  Agency. The EPA's main operating account is already cut by $240  million.   The EPA plays a critical role in keeping Americans safe both during  natural disasters like Hurricane Harvey and on a day-to-day basis. I  know this because the EPA, right now, is cleaning up a toxic waste site  that has been recently discovered in my congressional district.   Unfortunately, the very air we breathe and the water we drink is  endangered by the funding and policy decisions that are made in this  bill, and their consequences will be negatively felt in communities  across this Nation.   Now, this amendment would increase funding for the National Park  Service, something I do support. I have just been to Glacier National  Park, where I saw their backlog, and I agree wholeheartedly that we  should be investing in our parks, but it cannot be done at the expense  of our public health.   Republicans have chosen to put forward an omnibus bill that leaves  nearly $5 billion of nondiscretionary funds on the table. So rather  than gutting the EPA farther, we should be using all the resources  available to us and working on a bipartisan budget agreement.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose an amendment that takes  more money away from the EPA.  [[Page H7142]]    As I mentioned before, this bill already severely cuts the EPA's main  operating account by $240 million. The air we breathe and the water we  drink are endangered by the policy decisions that are being made in  this bill. The consequences will be felt in communities across the  Nation. I understand, for many, cutting the EPA is an easy target, but  I want my colleagues to understand what this amendment would actually  be cutting, if adopted.   This account funds programs that are important to both sides of the  aisle, including permitting for construction projects across the  country, toxic risk prevention, parts of the successful Brownfields  Program, and pesticide licensing.   So I understand that the money would direct more funding to States in  Appalachia. Appalachia is suffering. They are suffering from the raging  environmental harm caused by coal mining. But, unfortunately, I cannot  support any deeper cuts to the EPA.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, once again, I appreciate the challenges  that the gentleman is suffering in his State and throughout Appalachia,  but I cannot support any more deeper cuts to the EPA, so I must oppose  the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this amendment that  takes more money, again, away from an already starved EPA.   This is a duplicate from the last amendment offered by the gentleman  from Virginia earlier. It cuts another $32 million from the EPA's  operating accounts.   Our country right now is dealing with two catastrophes caused by  hurricanes. The destruction is going to be felt for years. The EPA  right now is one of the primary Federal agencies responsible for  protecting human health, monitoring air and water, and managing  recovery and cleanup, so it would be simply reckless to adopt another  amendment that would further cripple the EPA.   These two amendments would cut the EPA by $108 million.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, once again, I understand clearly what the  gentleman from Pennsylvania is trying to accomplish.   I wish we could accomplish that goal. But with already a $240 million  cut to the EPA and all of the challenges on the EPA--we just recently  agreed on this floor by a voice vote to cut the EPA another $75  million. This would be another $33 million.   So I hope that we can reach a place in the funding that the chairman  and I have where we can address the serious concerns that you bring to  the floor where you had success with programs. But, at the same time, I  would be cutting opportunities for cleanup, especially with all of the  disasters looming--forest fires, disasters, and cleanup I just had  recently in my district that came out of the blue. The EPA wouldn't  have money to respond.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, as the designee of Ranking Member Lowey, I  move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Price).    Mr. Chairman, I want to also commend the chairman and  working with the whole committee to make sure that the arts and  humanities receive the funding that they did.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                   Amendment No. 27 Offered by Mr. Langevin     Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I can't support an amendment taking money  from an underfunded agency, reducing our bottom line, when it is  already $824 million below the FY17 enacted level. Let me give you two  examples of why I think the gentleman's amendment should not be  supported.   One is I have been talking to EPA officials because we have a  surprise toxic dump site that is as close to a residential area as I am  from the Chairman. Barrels. The owner just walked away. Too much for  the city of St. Paul to handle. Too toxic. Too dangerous.   The State of Minnesota, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, had  to call in the EPA for help. It is costing us as taxpayers millions of  dollars to clean that up because the businessowner just walked away.  Nothing that the EPA can do but clean it up, and clean it up they are,  and the neighbors are ecstatic that the Federal Government is there to  help them.   The EPA, by taking more money away from it and putting it in the  spending reduction account at a time when I know that the EPA regions  all across this country are sending men and women down to help cities  and counties and communities out with the disaster that Harvey has  created, this is all money that is being spent right now in an agency  that is $824 million below 2017.   I think it is important that we protect the air that we breathe and  the water that we drink, and the consequences of further cuts to the  EPA, I believe, will be felt in communities like mine, like Houston,  like maybe what we will be hearing in Florida--we haven't had the  assessment yet in the Virgin Islands--all across this Nation. That, to  me, is just irresponsible.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, as I said earlier, this account has already  been cut by $240 million below the 2017 enacted level, another $108  million tonight on the floor, but at least those dollars were going  back into something, in my opinion, meaningful. This is just taking  money away from the EPA, which is underfunded, which is undersourced,  and being asked to do more for less at a time when, as I pointed out,  we don't even know until there is an opportunity for the waters to  subside what we are going to find at the Superfund sites from Harvey.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, while there is nothing more I would like to  do, I think any of us would all like to do, than to provide more  resources for the clean water SRF, it can't be done by reducing the  EPA's environmental programs in management.   This administration has clearly shown that they do not regard the  EPA's work as a priority, which means that they have a blatant  disregard for public health and the health of our environment.   The EPM account includes funding for programs like brownfields  enforcement, environmental justice, geographic programs, and lot of  other critical programs, some of which I gave examples of this evening,  which would suffer with a $250 million reduction.   This amendment illustrates, because I agree with the gentleman, I  wish we had more money to put in that account, what happens when we  don't have adequate 302(b) allocations. To overuse a common phrase, we  are robbing Peter to pay Paul, and it is not making us whole. So it is  with great reluctance that I oppose this amendment, but oppose it I  must because the cuts that have already been made this evening to the  brownfields enforcement, the environmental justice programs, and a  myriad of other programs which are critical to the health and well- being of our communities, and they are out there working every day on  it, is something I can just not support.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the very employees that the gentleman was  talking about that get in a car, they drive to check out the sewer  waste plants to make sure that they are operating. They are making sure  that the water is clean. They are doing their job.   Tonight we have cut this account already by 16 percent. That means we  are cutting programs. We have cut brownfields enforcement,  environmental justice, geographic programs, programs that support the  very account you and I would like to see more money go into. I just  urge my colleagues not to support this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to support this amendment. The  rider that we are talking about here gives an unprecedented amount of  power to the EPA. It puts the agency above the law, letting it get away  with no public comment on its proposals, no  [[Page H7152]]  economic analysis on the cost and benefit of repeal, no justification  for repeal, and not having to defend repeal against court challenges.   As the Congressman pointed out, for some, this rider might serve a  purpose this time. But what about in the future? What do we really want  to say? That it is okay for the executive branch to circumvent laws we  create and that there is no accountability in our courts?   This rider removes the checks and balances that are essential to a  functioning democracy, so I support the gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit the EPA  from requiring agricultural sources to report air emissions under the  Comprehensive Environmental Response Liability Act.   The purpose of this amendment is to circumvent a 2017 court decision  that invalidated an EPA rule which exempted agricultural sources from  such reporting.   Policy riders like this do not belong in the appropriations bills.  The EPA should either accept the court's decision or they should appeal  the decision. At a minimum, something that is this impactive with court  policy does not belong as a rider on an appropriations bill. For that  reason, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I just want to point out that, as a State  representative and, even now, as a Member of Congress, I will encounter  people--and I was just at our State fair--over the years, people who  have built homes in rural areas and are contributing to the schools and  maybe have a soybean farm or a community that is built up over the  years around farms. All of a sudden, a hog farm comes in and people are  sick, they are unable to go to work, their children develop lung issues  and all kinds of problems. They come to the State or they come to us as  Members of Congress and say: What is going on here? The air is so  polluted, it is making me and my family sick. I am losing my home. I am  losing my investment.   So I think that there is a role to have these discussions about what  do we do, as a community, to make sure about people who live in some of  these rural areas who all of a sudden find themselves, after decades of  living in the same area, unable to open up their windows on a summer  day.   As I said, that is why I don't think this policy rider belongs in  this bill. I think we need to have a thoughtful discussion on it and  really hear out both sides on many of these agriculture issues,  especially in rural communities.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment stops the Department of  the Interior from entering into cooperative agreements and providing  financial assistance for the purpose of protecting natural, cultural,  and historic resources in several counties in southeast Colorado.   This amendment restricts the expansion of Natural Heritage Areas,  Natural Heritage Corridors, Natural Heritage canalways, national  heritage tour routes, and national historic districts and cultural  heritage corridors.   All of these preservation partnerships are important tools that  enable the Federal Government to work with private partners to preserve  and protect our Nation's shared heritage. Unfortunately, this amendment  takes those options off the table for the people in southeastern  Colorado.   It is my understanding that the sponsor aims to preemptively prevent  expansion of a Federal footprint in his district, but I would like, Mr.  Chairman, to remind us that the sponsor of the Preserve America  Executive Order was issued by President George W. Bush, a Republican,  and it emphasizes public-private partnerships that limit, not expand,  Federal ownership.  [[Page H7155]]    I have worked on some of these corridors. We always make sure that it  is a partnership and it is not the Federal Government coming in and  taking over land. It is a partnership that the community comes to the  Federal Government and asks for.   So, if there are specific concerns that you have about the Federal  management in this region, I believe the sponsor should work with the  authorizing committee to make sure that they are addressed and not use  the appropriations process to wall off a section of the country from  partnering with the Federal Government to preserve its historical and  cultural natural resources.   These discussions that take place at a local level with sometimes the  business community, sometimes it is schools, sometimes it is churches,  that come together to talk about what can we do to preserve our  cultural history or what can we do to preserve something is driven by  local control.   I have never attended a meeting, once, where it was driven by Federal  control. The Federal Government has asked to come in to be a partner.   I oppose this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, once again, I really think that we need  to better utilize, in this Congress, in this institution, our policy  committees. They should be the first call for help if there are  questions, if there are concerns, if there are adjustments that need to  be made, not the appropriations committee, where there has been no  hearing on this.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I listened very carefully to what the  gentleman from Alaska had to say, and the bulk of my objection, Mr.  Chairman, is that this is better addressed in the Policy Committee than  on the Appropriations Committee as a rider.   BLM does many outreach activities, including public meetings and  interactions with individual miners, and is working with industry to  incorporate best management practices in new science-based reclamation  techniques.   In the course of the reclamation activities, it has been necessary to  increase the annual cost to miners to recover these streams and restore  ecostream function.   This amendment would prohibit the cost of reclaiming these areas to  placer miners who are profiting from mineral extractions on BLM managed  land.   I do hear the gentleman talking about not all business is the same  shape or size, so I really think that we should work through the Policy  Committee. For that reason, I object to this amendment, and I would  encourage the gentleman from Alaska to work through the Policy  Committee.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this new rule updates outdated  regulations and establishes minimum standards for the measurement of  oil production from Federal and Indian leases to ensure that  productivity is accurately measured and properly accounted for.   The administration has aggressively sought to abolish rules that were  developed over many years, and adhere to the process outlined in the  Administrative Procedure Act, which includes consideration of Tribal  and public comments.   Updating this regulation avoids regulatory uncertainty and reflects  the considerable changes in technology and industry practices that have  occurred over 25 years since the previous oil and gas order No. 4--25  years since the previous onshore oil and gas order No. 1. Changes in  technology. We should be embracing changes in technology and industry  practices. We should not be using technology and practices formed 25  years ago.   The new rule also responds to comments made by the GAO, the  Department of Interior's IG, and the Royal Policy Committee regarding  BLM's production and verification efforts.   The objective of this rule is to ensure that the oil volume reported  by the industry is sufficiently accurate to ensure that the royalties  due are paid correctly, the royalties due to the U.S. taxpayer. The  rulemaking process has been comprehensive and it has been transparent.  If there are to be changes to those rules, those changes need to be  done in accordance with the procedures outlined in the Administrative  Procedure Act. There is a way to do that. So, once again, there would  be an opportunity for Tribal and public comment.   This amendment does not provide for an open and transparent process.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment and to  protect the American taxpayer to make sure that the royalties are  accurately recorded.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition for two reasons.   One, this, once again, is a substantial piece of policy work being  done on an appropriations bills on the floor of the House. We have  committees which can take things up, government oversight, and we have  the Natural Resources Committee. There are many venues in which the  gentleman could ask for a hearing and bring people to testify, if there  are things that need to be done. Or just work through the  Administrative Procedure Act, which has opportunities before it, if  people feel that they are not being treated justly.   But the other reason why I rise against this is, 25 years since the  previous update has happened, technology has changed since then and  industry practices have changed. Part of our responsibility--and I  truly believe this in my heart--is to make sure that when we do leases,  when we are to receive royalty payments, we need to be looking out for  the U.S. taxpayer to make sure that they are fairly compensated for  these leases.   Mr. Chairman, I object to the amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this amendment.   This amendment discriminately cuts programs in this bill without any  thought to the merit of what is contained in this bill.   For example, in Indian Health Service, it really means fewer patients  being seen. It means fewer safety inspectors ensuring accidents don't  occur. Deferred maintenance in our drinking water, sanitation, and  infrastructure. We will lose investments in environmental  infrastructure, and, with that, jobs will be lost.   But the EPA, as has been pointed out quite a bit tonight for cuts and  for shifting funding around within this bill, is $2.2 billion less than  2010: 2,000 fewer employees. So employees are being pulled out of my  region and your region and all over to respond down in Harvey, meaning  work isn't being done. And I bet they are going to get the call to  leave their families and go look at sewer systems that have broken  apart, and water systems that don't have the ability for safe drinking  water. This is an agency that was funded and cut again in this bill,  and they have real jobs to do.   So when you discriminately cut across, you are also cutting across  those programs that we are relying right now for the EPA to do in  Harvey.  [[Page H7171]]    And then the Forest Service just notified us that they are out of  money for fire suppression. So we are going to cut the Forest Service  across 1 percent?   There might be places where you and I could agree, Mr. Chairman,  where we could be doing some cuts, and I could work with my colleagues  on it. But across the board, this year, in this bill, is something I  can't support.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment.    So the gentleman was talking about the Paris climate  agreement, which the Trump administration withdrew from?    I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    And then you said you were worried about the  administration using section 115 of the Clean Air Act to impose  regulations.   It has been my experience, from my point of view, representing my  constituents, we were disappointed about the withdrawal from the Paris  climate agreement, and we haven't seen this administration be  aggressive on clean air.   So could you please explain to me your concerns about the Trump  administration and section 115 of the Clean Air Act? Because, if they  are doing things that you are concerned about, maybe I need to take a  fresher look at what the Trump administration is doing, because I have  seen them do nothing but block, cut back, and deny the ability to move  forward on the clean air agreement. So I am confused to the point of  your amendment.   The Obama administration is gone, and the Trump administration has  removed almost everything I care passionately about with clean air.    Reclaiming my time, the Perry amendment would only be  in effect for 1 year because this is not a policy bill. This is an  appropriations bill. So the gentleman's concerns about having long-term  consequences of a future President in the future would not be addressed  by this particular amendment.   So I oppose the amendment. It is a long line of Republican amendments  on the attack of the clean air and the EPA's authority. But I think  this really makes it crystal clear the point that we shouldn't be doing  deep policy that you want to discuss on an appropriations bill because  it only lasts for a year.   As far as I know, the Trump administration has nothing up its sleeve  to improve air quality over the next year, so I urge my colleagues to  oppose this amendment. And I urge my colleagues who care about these  policy situations: You control the House, you control the Senate.  Please go to the committees of jurisdiction.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, once again, there might be some very  legitimate points that can be worked on out of these stripper wells  that are at the end of their life, and we might find some common ground  on some of your issues, but this is the appropriations bills and this  isn't the place to do it. It should be done in the Policy Committee.   Mr. Chair, we should be going to the Policy Committee, and we should  be asking the Policy Committee to take up and have hearings on these  issues that are very important to some of the Members here in this  House.   So when I look at this amendment on an Appropriations Committee bill,  what it says to me is that it is continuing the administration's agenda  that favors oil and gas industry ahead of other uses of our public  lands. It says to me that the administration has rolled back and  abolished a lot of rules that have been made over many years that are  contained and outlined in the Administrative Procedure Act, which  includes a consideration of public and travel comments so you can go  and register your comment and your concern on it.   The whole point of the site security rule is to protect against the  theft of oil and to make sure that the oil and gas production is  properly accounted for.   So this rule that we are talking about today also streamlines the  process for companies to get new measurement technologies to make sure  that they are using the most innovative technology. I think, after 25  years, most businesses, most people who want to make sure that they are  paying for product, want to make sure that it is being measured and  accounted for right.   This rule was also recommended by the GAO and the Department of the  Interior's IG, the Royalty Policy Committee regarding the BLM's  production of verification efforts. And those are things that, quite  often, we do to safeguard and to protect to make sure that the  taxpayer, when involved on public lands, is receiving fair value for  the royalty.   So there is a rulemaking process that is comprehensive. There is a  rulemaking process that is transparent. And there is also a way to  change the rule that is comprehensive, transparent, and allows the  public to have their voice, and that is to address these issues in the  Policy Committee.   So the main reason--and I want to be really clear about this--for  opposing many of these amendments is they are properly done in the  Policy Committee, a committee which I served on when I first came here.  Mr. Chair, I think that is where these amendments need to start being  direct so that we can do the real work and make sure that when Members  come to the floor, that they know that we have had a full vetting and  full transparency.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2245     Mr. Chair, again, I appreciate what my chairman of the  subcommittee is saying in helping Members here, but we have a lot of  work to do just doing the oversight on how money is spent and  appropriated to make sure that we are doing our due diligence when we  appropriate funds, that they are used in the way that this Congress has  asked for them to be used. There is a Policy Committee to look at what  is happening with policy and to make sure that we move policy forward.   Mr. Chair, sometimes when amendments like this come to the floor, I  just think we are failing totally as a Congress to do our due diligence  in the Policy Committee, and then there is so much time spent on policy  in the Appropriations Committee, we fail to do our due diligence on  what has to happen for oversight for the tax dollars that we do  appropriate in these bills.   It is my hope that the Policy Committee will step up, speak out, and  start requesting that these bills be heard in the committee of  jurisdiction and not just put on as riders on our bills.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, as I said, I rise in opposition to this  amendment, as clearly this amendment would prohibit BLM from regulating  flaring, venting, and leaking of methane from Federal onshore oil and  gas operations.   In 2016, the BLM finalized its rule which updated regulations that  were almost over 30 years old. We have learned a lot about how we have  to be more diligent about capturing energy and making America more  energy secure, because this rule would prevent the waste of an  estimated 65 billion cubic feet of natural gas a year and save  taxpayers $330 million annually.   BLM has a responsibility to the taxpayers, and that means capturing  what is flared off, what is burnt off, which is potential energy. We  have developed technologies in the past 30 years to capture this and  make it work even more effectively for the taxpayers when we lease out  these leases and royalties.   Just for a fact, I share that the Bakken oil field, when it was at  its height, flared more--I am from the Twin Cities--flared more and  brighter than the metropolitan area in St. Paul and Minneapolis. That  is how bright the flare was that the satellites captured at night. That  was burning energy, energy consumption that should have been captured  because we owe it to future generations to get it right when it comes  to our energy production.   Mr. Chairman, the amendment is bad for public health, it shortchanges  the American taxpayers, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it. I don't  think we are going to change each other's minds on this because the  bottom line is, and I have been consistent with this, this belongs in  the Policy Committee. This only would change something for a year. You  would have to come back year after year after year. If there is  something where we can find common ground on, we can find it in the  Policy Committee. We can't find it on an Appropriations Committee where  it expires every year.   I ride the elevator with the gentleman, Mr. Chair, and I am sure he  is going to enlighten me some more.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  2300     Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Colorado is right. We  have had this conversation in this Chamber, Mr. Chair, before. The  Service does attempt to comply with the statutory mandate and to review  the status of listed species every 5 years to determine whether or not  it is classified as threatened or endangered.   It is correct. The Service has a backlog in reviews due to funding  limitations. This year it is a 17 percent listing reduction contained  in this bill so that they have been working on the backlog. But the  Service still has only been able to complete 100 to 120 reviews per  year, which is half of what is needed.   So in this bill, you and I might agree that there are things that  could happen and that money isn't always the solution to a problem, but  in this bill you might be surprised to know that it has cut another  $3.4 million, so that only builds up the backlog all the more.   That is not necessarily the fault of the chairman of the  subcommittee, Mr. Chair. It is just the fact that the allocation that  our subcommittee had to work with, tough choices had to be made. I know  that the chairman was trying to balance a lot of things.   The gentleman talked about the court and the environment. I would  love to have a conversation with the gentleman more about that, because  it is my understanding--and I want to make sure I have it correct  before we go into depth about it because, as the gentleman knows, we  have a good relationship, and I want to make sure that I am correct  when I say things--that actually some of the things that have been  happening in court have actually helped to reduce some of the costs  that the gentleman is thinking about because it is in place.   I will get the information, Mr. Chair, and share it with the  gentleman later.   But the fact is that this amendment would not remove species without  review from the list of species protected by the ESA so that the ESA's  prohibition, again, would still remain, and it still would be the  ability of citizens to sue or force compliance even with what the  gentleman is proposing. So funding cannot be used to enforce the ESA  for species with late reviews; it is going to leave the species  unprotected.   Proposed language would prohibit the Service from working with the  agencies. It would prohibit working with developers and landowners to  comply, compliance to section 7 consultations or section 10 permits for  Federal and private projects that could potentially affect the species.  So as you can see, the other thing it doesn't do is the proposed  language would not affect the ability of third parties to sue those  agencies or landowners.  [[Page H7179]]    So I agree with the gentleman that we need to do a better job of  making sure that these reviews are done in a timely fashion. I agree  that, when a species has attained a classification where it is no  longer threatened or it is no longer endangered, it should come off. So  I think we have a lot in common.   But I think that the challenge with this amendment is that, without  the funding, in order for the Service to do the job that it has to do,  it just kind of puts the Service in a box in which we are saying you  are not doing a good job and, therefore, we are going to start changing  the way in which we proceed.   So I, right now, have to oppose this amendment. But as I said, in the  policy committee I think that there is room for some of us to come  together and to make improvement, but legislating this rider for 1 year  at a time on this appropriations bill doesn't allow us to have the  deep, transparent, and open discussion that we need to have to resolve  your issue.   So at this time I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, clearly, what this amendment does--and it  is different from the other amendment--is prohibit the Fish and  Wildlife Service from implementing or enforcing the threatened species  listing of the Preble's meadow jumping mouse under the Endangered  Species Act. It full-out restricts the Service from offering any  critical protections to preserve the species.   Once a species like this is listed under the Endangered Species Act,  the role of the Fish and Wildlife Service is fairly permissive. They  can help parties comply with the act as they carry out their other  activities.   The Service right now is reviewing and considering all the comments  that they received during the public comment period, and a draft  recovery plan is being worked through to develop a final recovery plan.  But with this  [[Page H7180]]  amendment, the Service would not be able to continue to recover the  species. All the Endangered Species Act prohibitions would still apply.   So, in other words, we would stop them from moving forward, but they  would still be under jurisdiction to comply. They wouldn't be able to  comply by working with agencies and land developers and landowners to  provide the ESA compliance.   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would be barred from issuing  permits or from offering exemptions. That means landowners, industry,  and other parties who might need to take the Preble's meadow jumping  mouse incidental to otherwise lawful activities, such as urban  development, are vulnerable to third-party lawsuits.   Another limitation that the Service would have would be undertaking  the required status reviews of subspecies or initiating any rulemaking  or downlisting or delisting species.   So now we are talking about deep dives into what the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife may or may not be impacted by doing or helping landowners or  developers on an appropriations bill.   Quite frankly, as I have been saying all night--and I understand  people have the right to come here with these amendments--the Service  has a responsibility to implement the Endangered Species Act. They are  charged with fulfilling their legal requirements. When they don't  fulfill their legal requirements, it makes them more vulnerable to  lawsuits, which I know is not the goal of the author of this amendment,  Mr. Chair. But when there are lawsuits incurred, it creates more costs  for American taxpayers.   The gentleman's amendment would just undermine the Service's ability  to work collaboratively with States and local communities. It opens the  Service up for lawsuits and it would create even more uncertainty for  landowners and make them vulnerable, as I said, to lawsuits.   I think we should be working to support the Fish and Wildlife  efforts, not blocking the agency from doing its job and going back to  what we discussed earlier, that is working through the committees of  authorization, and then the authorizing committees having conversations  with the Appropriations Committee on how they can achieve their goals,  this being one of them.   Because of those reasons, I do not support this amendment. I thank  the gentleman for bringing this forward, but at this time I cannot  support it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
