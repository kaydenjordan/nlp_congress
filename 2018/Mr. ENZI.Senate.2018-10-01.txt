 Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and  Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes statutory  limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to  those limits. In addition, sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to  establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels  consistent with those adjustments.   The Senate will soon consider the House amendment to H.R. 302, the  FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018. Among other things, this amendment  provides emergency funding to respond to recent natural disasters. The  amendment would increase budget authority by $1,680 million and outlays  by $25 million in fiscal year 2019. The amendment includes language  that would designate its spending as emergency pursuant to section  251(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Balanced Budget and Deficit Control Act of 1985.  The inclusion of this designation makes this spending eligible for an  adjustment under the Congressional Budget Act.   As a result, I am increasing the budgetary aggregate for fiscal year  2019 by $1,680 million in budget authority and $25 million in outlays.  Further, I am revising the budget authority and outlay allocations to  the Appropriations Committee by $1,680 million in revised nonsecurity  budget authority and $25 million in outlays for fiscal year 2019.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      REVISION TO BUDGETARY AGGREGATES  (Pursuant to Sections 311 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of                                   1974) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                     $ in millions                             2019 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority.................................          3,617,479     Outlays..........................................          3,546,394 Adjustments:     Budget Authority.................................              1,680     Outlays..........................................                 25 Revised Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority.................................          3,619,159     Outlays..........................................          3,546,419 ------------------------------------------------------------------------    REVISION TO SPENDING ALLOCATION TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR                             FISCAL YEAR 2019  (Pursuant to Sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of                                   1974) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                     $ in millions                             2019 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Allocation:     Revised Security Discretionary Budget Authority..            715,835     Revised Nonsecurity Category Discretionary Budget            598,897      Authority.......................................
