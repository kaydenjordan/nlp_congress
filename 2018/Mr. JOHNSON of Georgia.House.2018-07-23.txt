 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  historic retirement of broadcast pioneer and Atlanta, Georgia,  treasure, Jocelyn Dorsey. She is really a national treasure.   Jocelyn's list of achievements and accolades are too long for me to  recite here, but needless to say, her groundbreaking 40-plus-year  career has served as an inspiration to so many, and she has been a role  model to so many of us, not just African Americans, but all Americans,  all Georgians.   So we tip our hats to her and wish her the best in her retirement. I  understand that long-distance motorcycle trips may very well be in her  future.   I hope that she will keep us abreast of her exploits in the future.  We will miss her but know that she will always be in our hearts, and we  will always look forward to hearing about her life as she proceeds on.   So I congratulate Jocelyn Dorsey for a job well done.                            ____________________
