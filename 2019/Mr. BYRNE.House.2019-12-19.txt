 Mr. Speaker, for weeks, we were told that we couldn't  wait, we had to go forward with impeachment before Christmas, that the  Republic was at stake. And then this House passed a purely partisan  impeachment yesterday, and the Speaker has decided to hold the Articles  of Impeachment.   That underscores the word ``sham.'' That puts an exclamation point  after the word ``sham.'' That shows what a ridiculous exercise we just  went through.   We can't dictate to the Senate how they handle their trial. They get  to pick that.   This shows that they got cold feet on the other side. They don't have  a case. They can't win a fair trial in the Senate, and they know it,  and they are afraid to send the articles over there where it will get  the fair trial and not the kangaroo court we had here.                            ____________________
