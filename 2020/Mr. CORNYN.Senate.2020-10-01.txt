 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday I had the pleasure of meeting-- or should I say re-meeting--Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who has been  nominated, as we all know, to the U.S. Supreme Court, to the vacancy  left by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.   Over the last few days, Judge Barrett's nomination has been applauded  by people across the political spectrum--and for good reason. Her  background in practicing law and academia and on the Federal bench has  provided her with an unquestionable knowledge of the law. Much of the  praise has come from her colleagues who worked closely with her over  the years.   Marcus Cole, who is dean of the University of Notre Dame Law School,  where she teaches, said:         Judge Amy Coney Barrett is an absolutely brilliant legal       scholar and jurist. She is also one of the most popular       teachers we have ever had here at Notre Dame Law School.    A group of her former students have published a piece recently that  said:         While we hold a variety of views regarding how best to       interpret statutes in the Constitution, we all agree on this:       The nation could not ask for a more qualified candidate than       the professor we have come to know and revere.    We have also seen support for Judge Barrett from unlikely sources.  Harvard University Law Professor Noah Feldman clerked with Judge  Barrett at the Supreme Court more than 20 years ago. He was also a  prominent witness for Democrats during the impeachment process earlier  this year. But he has written an opinion piece titled ``Amy Coney  Barrett Deserves to Be on the Supreme Court.'' He wrote that he knows  her to be a ``brilliant and conscientious lawyer who will analyze and  decide cases in good faith, applying the jurisprudential principles to  which she is committed. Those are the basic criteria for being a good  justice. Barrett meets them and exceeds them.''   There is really no question that Judge Barrett has a brilliant legal  mind and deep respect for the Constitution and an unwavering commitment  to the law, but these qualities alone are not what set this exceptional  judge apart. Both Republicans and Democrats who have worked with Judge  Barrett throughout her career have spoken about her personal qualities,  like humility and integrity. These make her an ideal candidate for this  influential position.   A group of her former students wrote about the kindness that she has  shown to them, both in the classroom and during meals they shared at  her home. They said:         Her genuine interest in the personal lives of her students       outside the classroom, and the seamless way that she modeled       for all of us the integration of her professional and family       life, reinforces that there is more to life than the pursuit       of professional accolades.    She has certainly proven that to be the case. In addition to rising  to the very top of her field, Judge Barrett is a mother of seven  children ranging from the age of 8 to 19. Following her nomination on  Saturday, Judge Barrett credited her family's ability to balance her  and her husband's successful careers with the needs of their children  to the unwavering support of her husband Jesse, who is also an  accomplished attorney.   In every respect, Judge Barrett is an inspiring role model for young  people and I could say as the father of two daughters, of young women  in particular, who are pursuing their professional and personal  ambitions with equal vigor.   If confirmed, Judge Barrett--soon-to-be Justice Barrett--would become  the first mother of school-age children to serve as a Justice and only  the fifth woman throughout American history to serve on the U.S.  Supreme Court. Considering the woman whose seat she will fill if  confirmed, the significance of that fact cannot be overstated.   She would be the only current Justice with a degree from a law school  other than Harvard or Yale and bring much needed educational diversity  to the Bench.    I have always thought it bizarre that, among all the highly qualified  lawyers and judges in America, for some reason, it is overly populated  with people educated in the Northeast, on the coast.   On top of that, she would join Justice Thomas as the only Justice  born in the South and bring another perspective to the Court, whose  members largely hail from the coast.   If confirmed, Judge Barrett would bring an underrepresented view to  the Supreme Court. I know we would all be proud to have somebody like  her--a woman of such strong character--serving our Nation in this very  important capacity.   I want to commend President Trump for selecting this outstanding  nominee. I was glad to spend some time with her yesterday. She has an  unquestionable character, a brilliant mind, and the kind of temperament  needed to serve on the Court. I am eager for the American people to see  that for themselves as we begin the public confirmation process.   As we know, this is the second time Judge Barrett has appeared before  the Judiciary Committee in the last few years. It was 3 years ago when  the committee and the Senate confirmed her to her current position on  the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. However, there were some warning  flags.    During her confirmation hearing back then, 3 years ago, the Democrats  on the committee raised questions over Judge Barrett's strong Catholic  faith and questioned whether it would somehow disqualify her or impair  her ability to discharge her responsibilities.   One Senator went so far as to say: ``The dogma lives loudly within  you, and that's of concern.'' Another asked her whether she was an  ``orthodox Catholic.'' Well, this statement and that insinuation were  discriminatory at best and unconstitutional at worst.   The Constitution itself includes that there is no religious test.  Article VI reads: ``No religious Test shall ever be required as a  Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.''   This is not the first time somebody has been targeted for one's  Catholic faith. I was reminded of the speech that John Fitzgerald  Kennedy gave in 1960 in Houston, TX, to the Greater Houston Ministerial  Association. In addressing some of the explicit and implicit arguments  that somehow he would be beholden to the Vatican rather than be able to  discharge his responsibilities as President of the United States, he  pointed out, as a Catholic, it was not the only concern because, if  people would do that to a Catholic, why not do it to a Baptist or a  Muslim or a Jew?  [[Page S6020]]    He said:         For while this year it may be a Catholic against whom the       finger of suspicion is pointed, in other years it has been,       and may someday be again, a Jew--or a Quaker or a Unitarian       or a Baptist. It was Virginia's harassment of Baptist       preachers, for example, that helped lead to Jefferson's       statute of religious freedom. Today I may be the victim, but       tomorrow it may be you--until the whole fabric of our       harmonious society is ripped at a time of great national       peril.    He made the important point that seems so obvious that he shouldn't  have had to make.   He said:         I am not the Catholic candidate for president. I am the       Democratic Party's candidate for president, who happens also       to be a Catholic.    Finally, he said:         But if this election is decided on the basis that 40       million Americans lost their chance of being president on the       day they were baptized, then it is the whole nation that will       be the loser--in the eyes of Catholics and non-Catholics       around the world, in the eyes of history, and in the eyes of       our own people.    Throughout her career, Judge Barrett has impressed the brightest  legal minds with her deep understanding of the law and commitment to  judicial independence. She made it clear at her hearing 3 years ago  that she would be loyal to her oath, and that is to uphold and defend  the Constitution and laws of the United States.   It is clear, under the appropriate canons of judicial ethics, that if  for some reason a judge can't apply the law because of some personal  opinion or conviction, then one needs to disqualify oneself. President  Kennedy said that, if it violates your conscience and your faith and  you can't reconcile the two, you should resign.   Well, there is just no legitimate reason to question whether Judge  Barrett's religious beliefs would make her unfit to serve on the  Supreme Court, and I hope our colleagues on the other side will refrain  from, once again, imposing a religious test on Judge Barrett as we  consider her nomination.
