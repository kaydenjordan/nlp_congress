 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, from the very beginning, my stated goal  for the July and August work period has been that the Senate pass both  a bipartisan infrastructure bill and a budget resolution with  reconciliation instructions. This is our so-called two-track strategy:  both a bipartisan infrastructure bill and a budget resolution with  reconciliation instructions. And despite some bumps in the road, always  expected on two bills as large and comprehensive as these, we have  remained firmly on track to achieve our two-track goal.   On the bipartisan track, I have worked with my colleagues throughout  the process to help produce an outcome that all parties find  acceptable. I have tried to prod the negotiators when they have needed  it and given them space when they have asked for it.   Deadlines were necessary to advance the negotiations. We are here  right now, during a rare weekend session, in order to move the  bipartisan bill forward as quickly as possible.   The idea here is to produce an outcome, a real bipartisan agreement  that provides a significant down payment toward the level of  infrastructure investment our country needs.   The process from here is simple. Once the legislative text of the  agreement is finalized--and I understand it is being finalized  imminently--I will offer it as a substitute amendment, as I have always  promised, and then the Senate can finally begin voting on additional  amendments.   Given the thoroughly bipartisan nature of the bill, I expect we will  be able to consider all the relevant amendments and finish the bill in  a matter of days.   But we know that this bill is not everything our country needs. That  is why, after the bipartisan infrastructure legislation passes this  Chamber, I will immediately move to the other track: passing a budget  resolution with reconciliation instructions, which will allow the  Senate to make historic investments in American jobs, American  families, and efforts to reverse climate change. Both tracks are very  much needed by the American people and we must accomplish both.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, well, I thank my colleagues for their  fine speeches, and I very much appreciate them.   Now, the bipartisan group of Senators has finished writing the text  of  [[Page S5240]]  the infrastructure bill, and in a moment, I will take the procedural  steps to make their legislative language the base of the bill here on  the floor.   I want to congratulate the Members of the bipartisan group for their  efforts. We haven't done a large bipartisan bill of this nature in a  long time. I want to especially thank the staffs, who burned the  midnight oil many a night, for their diligence, their hard work, their  intelligence, and their skill.   Thank you, staff, listening and a few in the room here tonight.   These days, it isn't easy to do major bills in the Senate, especially  bipartisan ones, so I have tried to prod the negotiators along when  they have needed it and given them the space when they have asked for  it. In the end, the bipartisan group of Senators has produced a bill  that will dedicate substantial resources to repair, maintain, and  upgrade our Nation's physical infrastructure. It has been decades-- decades--since Congress passed such a significant stand-alone  investment, and I salute the hard work that was done here by everybody.   In order for our workers, our businesses, our economy to succeed in  the 21st century, we cannot have infrastructure that is stuck in the  last century. The bipartisan infrastructure bill is designed to bring  our infrastructure up to date for a new century, and that is a  significant achievement.   Now, for the future, for the information of Senators, here is how we  plan to move forward. I will offer the text of the bipartisan  infrastructure bill as a substitute amendment, as I promised, making it  the base of the bill.   Then the Senate will work to consider additional amendments to the  bipartisan framework. Given how bipartisan the bill is and how much  work has already been put in to get the details right, I believe the  Senate can quickly process relevant amendments and pass this bill in a  matter of days.   Then I will move the Senate along the second track of our  infrastructure effort and take up the budget resolution.   A bipartisan infrastructure bill is definitely necessary, but to many  of us, it is not sufficient. That is why soon after this bill passes  the Senate, Democrats will press forward with a budget resolution to  allow the Senate to make further historic, vitally important  investments in American jobs, American families, and efforts to reverse  climate change.   Look, I have set out two very ambitious goals for the Senate this  summer, and we are now on the way to achieving both. As I said, both  tracks, this one and the other, are very much needed by the American  people, and we must accomplish both.   Now, after many days of waiting and a lot of hard work and a lot of  compromise, I ask that the clerk report the pending business.                            ____________________     I call up the Sinema-Portman substitute amendment No.  2137.    I ask to dispense with the further reading of the  amendment so we may get forward to other amendments.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  now resume morning business, with all previous provisions in order.    Would my colleague just yield for a minute for a brief  interruption? I will close the Senate but then allow him to speak for  as long as he should choose.    I see he doesn't have many notes, but it is all sui  generis, I know that.    No comment.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate complete its business today, it adjourn until 12 noon, Monday,  August 2; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  [[Page S5246]]  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon conclusion of  morning business, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 3684.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Lee.   I yield back to the Senator from Utah.
