 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my good friend right  across the Sabine River, for yielding.   No President has ever had a worse first year in office than Joe  Biden.   And sadly, his deteriorating 42 percent approval rating perfectly  mirrors the deteriorating state of our country.   We are facing crises on nearly every front, and our Commander in  Chief who, by the way, is responsible for creating each and every one  of these crises, is doing absolutely nothing to stop them.   However, the most threatening of these concerns is still the  unmitigated disaster that is raging on our southern border.   More than 1.7 million illegal alien apprehensions happened under  Biden's watch last year, and those were just the ones that we caught.   Instead of securing our borders, this administration spent all of  2021 sweeping the rule of law under the rug and using the cover of  darkness to fly thousands of unvetted and untested for COVID illegal  aliens across the country to be released into our neighborhoods.   How many more innocent women and children need to be assaulted,  raped, and trafficked?   How many more Americans need to overdose on Chinese fentanyl that is  being smuggled across the border?   How many more terrorists need to be caught trying to infiltrate our  Nation?   What level of threat do we need to reach to finally garner some  action from this President?   Americans are tired of paying for this administration's ignorance and  political games.   This is a new year, Mr. President. Use it wisely.   It is past time that you live up to the oath that you swore.
