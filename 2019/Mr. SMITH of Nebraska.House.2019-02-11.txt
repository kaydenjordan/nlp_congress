 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the  Beatrice Municipal Airport manager, Diana Smith, on her induction into  the Nebraska Aviation Hall of Fame.   Diana has worked at the airport, located in southeastern Nebraska,  for 47 years, with the past 18 years as its manager. During her tenure,  Diana has presided over a number of improvements to the Beatrice  Municipal Airport, including a new administration building and the  repaving of both its runways.   She went on to chair the Nebraska Aeronautics Commission in 2015,  where she worked to support Nebraska's airports statewide.   Please join me in thanking and congratulating Diana for her service  to her local community and to the entire State of Nebraska.                            ____________________
