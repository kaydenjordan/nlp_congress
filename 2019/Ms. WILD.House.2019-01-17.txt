 Madam Speaker, as a freshman Member of this body, I take  deep offense at the suggestion a little while ago here on the House  floor by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle that House  Democrats are responsible for this government shutdown.   To the contrary, their leader in the Senate has failed his  responsibility to the American people to bring a vote to the Senate  floor on any of the nine appropriations bills passed by the House that  would reopen this government.   A few days ago, I visited Turning Point of Lehigh Valley in my  district, a shelter that assists survivors of abuse and their families  and that has stopped receiving Federal funding as a result of this  shutdown. When I return to my district tomorrow, I will be visiting  with more organizations that have been similarly affected.   The shelter has a long waiting list. So while it does extraordinary  work, it already struggles to maintain the funding it needs to take in  all those who are suffering in the community, and that is the case in  many communities across our country.   So, if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle wish to do  something constructive, they should go see their leader in the Senate  and urge him to bring a vote to the floor.                            ____________________
