 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a  close friend, ally, and devoted public servant, Mr. Carl Adrian, as he  retires from a 16-year career supporting our national security,  environmental cleanup, economic growth, job creation, and furthering  the ever-expanding missions of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation and  Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, PNNL, as well as advancements in  innovation and more tied to each of these in my home State of  Washington.   Mr. Adrian, retiring president and CEO of Tri-Cities Development  Council--TRIDEC--began his service to the Pasco, Richland, West  Richland, and Kennewick cities, also known as the TriCities, on  September 1, 2003. Mr. Adrian arrived in the Tri-Cities as a  transplant, being born and raised in Omaha, NE, where he graduated from  Westside High School. Mr. Adrian then obtained his bachelor of arts in  political science, geography, and later a masters of administration in  urban and economic geography from the University of Iowa.   Prior to Mr. Adrian's tenure with TRIDEC, he spent significant time  supporting economic development throughout the central region of the  United States through his work with multiple organizations. He served  communities in Casper, WY, the Quad-City area of both Iowa and  Illinois, and Cedar Valley located in Waterloo/Cedar Falls, IA, before  embarking upon his last enterprise in the Tri-Cities.   Mr. Adrian has devoted his life to supporting commerce and new  innovation in the region. In his role at TRIDEC, Mr. Adrian has been  one of the Tri-Cities most effective advocates to Congress, frequently  working to ensure members of Washington State's congressional  delegation were abreast of the concerns and needs of the community  while also helping to strengthen federal support for Central Washington  priorities, including working to successfully expand Washington State's  wine industry, signing vital MOUs with Hong Kong to bolster the local  economy, and more. Mr. Adrian's dedication to inclusive collaboration  ensures important stakeholders are never left uninformed on the needs  of the Tri-Cities area, and through his robust advocacy, the region has  seen significant population and economic growth as well as industry  expansion, offering many Tri-Citians a new path to the American Dream.   As TRIDEC's longest-serving president, Mr. Adrian has successfully  led efforts to help expand the Tri-Cities airport and offer nonstop  daily flights to key regional airports; create the Manhattan Project  National Historical Park in 2015; promote services to attract, retain,  and improve commerce and economic development throughout the region,  which led to significant job growth, population growth, and the  development of several new business ventures in the TriCities.   It is clear to me that Washington State has benefited greatly from  Mr. Adrian's vision and passion for promoting what the Tri-Cities  community, its workforce, the Hanford Site, and PNNL have to offer, as  I have seen firsthand both at home and in the other Washington. His  work is evident in the progress that has been made on environmental  cleanup at Hanford, as well as his work to help plan a future for the  Tri-Cities that looks past cleanup operations towards preserving the  region's rich history through designations of the B Reactor as a  National Historic Landmark and Manhattan Project National Historical  Park, and seeking out new, emerging opportunities like small modular  reactors to help grow additional economic opportunities in the region  and boost Washington State's leadership role in cutting-edge energy  technologies to combat climate change. Through all of this, he has  remained as committed as they come. Last August, when I had the good  fortune to get one more visit with Mr. Adrian at PNNL, I was  unsurprised that he still carried the same enthusiasm and pride for his  work as he did during his first visit with me in 2003.   Mr. Adrian has been critical to my work in the U.S. Senate to ensure  the Federal Government is keeping its commitments to central  Washington, and he has made a tremendous impact on the Tri-Cities  community, Washington State, and our Nation. Today, I join with others  throughout the State of Washington in thanking him for his many years  of service. I congratulate Mr. Carl Adrian on his retirement and wish  him and his wife Rheta the best of luck as they write their next  chapter together.                            ____________________
