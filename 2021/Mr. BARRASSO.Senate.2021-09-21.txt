 Madam President, I come to the floor to talk about the  growing list of disasters that is occurring in this country and around  the world as a result of the actions of President Biden.   The most recent disaster is President Biden's surrender of  Afghanistan to global terrorists. For two decades, Americans fought and  died in Afghanistan, and they did it to keep our country safe and free.  On Thursday, August 26, the United States lost 13 servicemembers in  Kabul, Afghanistan. It was the deadliest single day for our military in  more than a decade. One of those fallen heroes, 20-year-old Rylee  McCollum, was from Wyoming.   Despite heroic sacrifice by our servicemembers, the Taliban, today,  is stronger than ever. The Taliban controls more territory than it did  on September 11 of 2001, 20 years ago. Afghanistan is, once again, a  safe harbor for terrorists.   This disaster happened because President Biden paid more attention to  the calendar on the wall than he did to the conditions on the ground.  President Biden wanted symbolism. Well, we got symbolism. We got the  symbol of terrorists. It is the one they wanted. It is the symbol of  helicopters flying, leaving the roof of the U.S. Embassy in  Afghanistan--something that President Biden promised the American  people they would never see, but there it was for the world to see.   The entire world also witnessed desperate Afghan citizens. They were  plummeting to their deaths as they tried to hang onto planes that were  leaving from the airport. President Biden was so eager to pull our  troops out of Afghanistan by an arbitrary date that he left hundreds,  if not thousands, of American citizens trapped--hostages behind enemy  lines. President Biden abandoned the strategically located Bagram Air  Base. It is the one base that could have evacuated people safely.   The Biden administration even gave the Taliban a list of American  citizens. I mean, can you imagine that? The administration gave the  Taliban--the terrorists--a list of American citizens, green card  holders, Afghan allies, people we wanted to get out of the country. To  me and many Americans who heard that this happened, we saw it as a kill  list--a list that the terrorists would use against American citizens  and our allies on the ground--and we may never know how many are  captured or tortured and are killed.   We could have left Afghanistan with our honor intact. Instead, our  enemies are now emboldened, and our friends are furious--furious at us.  Billions and billions of dollars' worth of American military equipment  and military secrets are now in the hands of the Taliban. Joe Biden has  armed the Taliban beyond its wildest dreams. The Taliban has seized  more than 600,000 American weapons. This includes over 2,000 armored  vehicles, like Humvees, MRAPs, and even American tanks. They also have  at least 40 aircraft, including Black Hawk helicopters and drones. The  Biden administration has no plan either to get these weapons back or to  destroy them where they sit on the ground.   President Biden has surrendered America to the terrorists, and now I  believe they are coming for us.   Yet Afghanistan is just one of President Biden's many failures. On  issue after issue, this President has displayed complete incompetence.   For instance, President Biden has displayed gross incompetence and  mismanagement at our southern border. On President Biden's first day in  office--on the very first day--he flipped on a green light at the  border, and he laid out the welcome mat. He shut down the construction  of the border wall even though it had been fully paid for. He illegally  ended the very successful ``Remain in Mexico'' policy, and he stopped  all deportations. Ever since then--ever since that day 1 of his  administration--illegal immigration has been at an alltime high.   Over the last week, we have seen more than 10,000 illegal immigrants  crowding under a single bridge in Del Rio, TX. Since President Biden  became President, more than a million illegal immigrants have crossed  into our country. That is more than twice the population of Wyoming.  Some of these illegal immigrants carry deadly disease; others carry  illegal weapons. Since Joe Biden became President, our border agents  have seized enough fentanyl--it is a deadly drug--to kill every  American man, woman, and child.   The Joe Biden border crisis is--and the word is important to hear  here--``unprecedented.'' That is not my word. It is a direct quote from  the Secretary of Homeland Security. Joe Biden's Secretary of Homeland  Security, a few weeks ago, was caught on tape. He told our Border  Patrol officers that the border situation ``cannot continue.''   He went on to say:         If our border is our first line of defense, then we are       going to lose. . . . This is unsustainable.    Again, this is coming from President Biden's Secretary of Homeland  Security.   Yet Democrats in Washington want to double down on this open border  policy. Senate Democrats have tried to give amnesty to over 8 million  illegal immigrants. Now, they have failed, but if they had been  successful, it would have been the largest amnesty for illegal  immigrants in our Nation's history. Well, that sends a very loud  message to people all around the world. It says, if you come here  illegally, the Democrats are sure going to try to give you government  benefits and maybe even citizenship. This message from this White House  and the Democrats only strengthens the magnet for people to come here  illegally.   Under President Biden, we have chosen chaos on the border, and we  have chaos also in Democratic-governed cities. Over the past year and a  half, we have seen an unprecedented rise in murders, in shootings, and  in violent crime in Democratic-run cities. Last year, the murder rate  went up by a third. This year, it is up again. Nearly all of the  increases are in cities run by Democrats.    Last year, in Democratic cities, what did they do? Well, they cut  more than $1 billion off the funding for our police, for law  enforcement--for the people who are there to keep the cities and the  streets safe. As a result, crime is out of control, and working  families are scared.   There is also something else that is worrying families all across  America, and those are the skyrocketing costs they have to pay every  time they fill up their tanks or when they go to the grocery stores. At  a time when our economy should be booming, the purchasing power of  people's paychecks is getting eaten away. Gasoline is now nearly a  dollar more a gallon than it was when Joe Biden took office. Now it  costs about $25 more to fill up your vehicle. It costs about $25 more  for a weekly trip of shopping at the grocery store. So $25 for gas and  $25 for groceries is $50 a week. That is over $2,000 a year in lost  buying ability--lost power of the paycheck--for American families.   Inflation is happening because of excessive Democratic borrowing and  spending. Gas prices are also rising because President Biden is  restricting American energy. He has killed thousands of good energy  jobs. He took an ax to the Keystone XL Pipeline. He stopped all new oil  and gas leases on Federal land. It is no surprise to Americans that the  price of energy is going up.   And what is President Biden's solution to this? Well, he wants to  raise taxes on energy produced in America. He doesn't want Americans to  explore for energy and oil in the United States. No. His National  Security Advisor, last month, actually asked foreign oil-producing  countries, including Saudi Arabia and Russia--this is the National  Security Advisor--to pump more foreign oil to lower the price of gas.  And you say: How do you know that? Well, it was on the White House's  website, right there for the world to see. The  [[Page S6567]]  President would prefer for us to buy energy from our enemies rather  than produce it here at home.   Under the last President and the previous administration, the United  States became energy dominant. President Biden seems very determined to  make us energy dependent once again.   I could go on. There are so many failures of the Biden administration  to discuss. Every single one of these crises could have been avoided.  Each one was predictable and could have been preventable. They could  have been avoided with competent leadership in the White House. They  could have been avoided if Democrats had stopped their mad dash to the  left.   The American people gave us a 50-50 Senate. They didn't ask for a  leftwing agenda. No wonder recent polls show Americans, overwhelmingly,  say the country is headed in the wrong direction. The American people  know what they want: safe communities, secure borders, higher wages,  lower prices. It is what I hear in Wyoming, and it is what I heard this  past weekend. The incompetence of this administration over the last 8  months cannot be allowed to continue. The American people deserve  better.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to join my  colleagues in opposing the Democrats' reckless tax-and-spending spree.   The bill that we are talking about is the centerpiece of Bernie  Sanders' socialist plan for America. The Democrats' plan does play  favorites, however, and what they really focus on doing, interestingly,  is hurting the working folks in rural America to give tax breaks to  wealthy families in big cities in liberal States.   The reason I tell you this is that this bill includes huge subsidies  for people who buy and drive electric vehicles. You don't see a lot of  that in rural States with long distances between community to  community.   Well, the government is already giving billions of taxpayer dollars  to electric vehicle manufacturers and for owners. Nearly 80 percent of  the tax credits go to households making at least $100,000 a year.   So what is happening now? The thing is, right now, the roads are  being used, chewed up, vehicles on the road, and how is it paid for?  Well, the highway trust fund. And how does that get paid for? People  paying the gas tax.   People who use electric vehicles do the same wear and tear to our  highways and pay nothing in terms of a use fee to use the highways as  they do. So they are paying nothing in, they are using the services,  they use the roads for free, and now they want subsidies.   And that is what the Democrats are offering. This bill would give up  to $12,500 to married couples to buy electric vehicles--12,500.   What kind of income? Maybe there is an income limit. I mean, you  don't want to give it to rich people. So the Democrats said: OK, if you  are a single person earning up to $400,000 a year, you can get a  subsidy. If you are a married couple earning up to $800,000 a year, you  still get the subsidy because, boy oh boy, we are going to push those  electric vehicles for the big cities and for our Democrat colleagues.   Democrats have gone so far as to even want to spend $7 billion to  subsidize luxury electric bicycles--astonishing.   Now, these giveaways have a pricetag, and that is why Democrats want  to pile enormous new taxes on the American people. They propose more  than $2 trillion in additional new taxes. This would be the largest tax  increase in half a century, but it is still not enough to pay for all  the new spending they want to do.   That is why they are trying a backdoor tax increase. What the  Democrats are proposing is putting the IRS on steroids--supersizing the  IRS. They want to increase funding for the Internal Revenue Service by  $80 billion.   The IRS says: Hey, give us a lot more money. We can hire a lot more  agents, and they can collect more money, even more than the $80 billion  that you give us.   So last week, Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen said she wants  to make banks report every transaction that is over $600--she didn't  just say it; she wrote it in a letter to the chairman of the House  Budget Committee--so they can watch and look at, investigate, spy on  families all across the country.   I have heard more from people of Wyoming about this one letter from  the Secretary of the Treasury than I have on many, many issues over the  years.   Every time somebody pays their rent, the IRS will now know about it.  Make a car payment; the IRS will now know about it. Pay the plumber;  the IRS will know about it.   The amount of power that the IRS has will now be more than ever  before. Democrats are going to send the IRS to shake down people for  every last dime they can. It is too much power. It is too much of an  invasion of privacy. The American people find this dangerous and scary.   The IRS is already one of the most powerful and unaccountable  Agencies in the Federal Government, if not the most powerful and  unaccountable Agency in the Federal Government. Now the Democrats want  to unleash it even further.   I just want to talk about one last tax, and it is a hidden tax, but  it surely hurts many Americans, especially the poor. And it is a tax  called inflation.   Inflation is happening because Democrats borrowed and spent too much  money already. If they pass this, prices are going to continue to rise.  People go to the grocery store; they are paying more. People go to the  gas station; they are paying more.   The Democratic Party's priorities are backward, but under the  Democratic Party today, prices are going up. Yet they are giving  kickbacks to the wealthy, their powerful friends. This is heading  America toward bankruptcy. The American people don't want higher taxes.  They want higher wages, lower prices, more jobs, more opportunity. They  don't want this reckless tax-and-spending spree--no, not one bit.   I yield the floor.
