 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the  distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee, and my good friend, for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Madam Speaker, today's rule covers H.R. 4502, a seven-bill  appropriations package for fiscal year 2022, including the Labor,  Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee, where I am the ranking member.   Though I have great affection for my good friend, Chairwoman Rosa  DeLauro, and respect all of my colleagues across the aisle, I think  this package is deeply misguided, and I will be opposing it today.   From the beginning, this package was structured on a flawed premise.  The majority chose to use the 302(b) allocation numbers, the levels  that tell each subcommittee how much money they can spend, that were  totally off the mark.   The majority chose to mark their bills to spending levels that called  for a 17 percent increase in nondefense spending, and an inadequate 1  percent increase in defense spending, less even than the amount the  President requested in his own budget.   At a time when our national security is facing repeated threats,  ranging from the Middle East to Afghanistan to the South China Sea, we  can hardly afford to return to the continual underfunding of our  military that was the hallmark of the Obama-Biden years.   What is worse, these seven bills account for a 21 percent increase  over fiscal year 2021. Across the seven titles, the majority is asking  to spend more than $100 billion more in fiscal year 2022 than we did  just last year. This comes on top of massive spending earlier this year  with the majority's $1.9 trillion COVID spending package, and at a time  when Democrats in the House and the Senate are looking to spend another  $3.5 trillion as part of a new partisan reconciliation bill. This is  truly tax-and-spend politics like we have never seen before.   But the problems with this bill aren't just with the amount of money  that they spend. In drafting this package, the majority has also chosen  to strip out longstanding bipartisan policy provisions and, instead,  has filled this package with partisan, far-left policy that simply  cannot pass both Chambers and become law.   There is no better illustration of this than the majority's shocking  decision to remove the Hyde and Weldon amendments.   For 45 years, through both Democratic and Republican administrations  and Democratic and Republican majorities in the House, the Hyde  amendment has been the law. It is a commitment that no Federal tax  dollars can be used to fund abortions, except in certain rare  instances, and a commitment to protect the conscience rights of the  great majority of American taxpayers who are opposed to publicly  funding abortions.   Since 2006, the Weldon amendment has protected the conscience rights  of healthcare providers to not participate in abortions if they have a  moral objection to the procedure.    The very same Democratic majority that controls the House today had  no apparent issue with the Hyde and Weldon amendments just 1 year ago  since they were carried on their Labor-HHS-Education appropriations  bill without any issue. Yet, this year, the majority has inexplicably  chosen not to include these bipartisan provisions, despite receiving  support from every Democrat on the Appropriations Committee only last  year.   Removing language that has been included in appropriations bills for  decades is not only an overreach by the far left, but it also threatens  to destabilize and upend the entire appropriations process.  Appropriations bills simply cannot pass both Chambers and be signed  into law without this language.   Eliminating the Hyde and Weldon amendments, given all of their  importance to the American people, also eliminates the opportunity for  bipartisanship. Without a bipartisan deal approved by both Chambers, we  cannot reach a successful conclusion to the fiscal year 2022  appropriations process.   Removing this language sends us on a collision course for a yearlong  continuing resolution or, worse, a government shutdown.   Madam Speaker, I filed an amendment to today's package to restore the  Hyde and Weldon amendments. I did not do so alone. I was joined by  every single Republican Member in this body--every single one. All 213  members of the Republican Conference signed on to this important  amendment. Yet, when the Rules Committee met yesterday, I was shocked  that my amendment was not made in order.   Madam Speaker, I find it stunning that the majority would not back  provisions that are this important to the American people. But it  serves to show how deeply partisan the package before us today actually  is. The majority simply prefers to ram through their own partisan  policy rather than provisions that have had bipartisan support for  decades.   I find that deeply disappointing, Madam Speaker. But I know that  today's bill will not be the last word. Whether the majority likes it  or not, at the end of the day, we will have to reach a bipartisan and  bicameral deal on spending for fiscal year 2022. The alternative is too  bleak to contemplate.   But if the majority fails to compromise and fails to work with  Republicans, both here and across the Capitol, then they will have only  themselves to blame. They will bear the responsibility for the  consequences, a continuing resolution or, even worse, a government  shutdown.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule and the underlying  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 4698 for immediate  consideration. This bill addresses the growing problem in American  schools of educators pushing their own ideology onto students by  forcing them to use the pedagogy of critical race theory.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Utah  (Mr. Owens), the author of this amendment to further explain the  amendment.    Madam Speaker, it should be easy to agree that schools,  especially primary schools, should focus solely on facts-based  education, without political overtones.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from South  Carolina (Ms. Mace), who will speak more about the importance of  defeating the previous question because of the potential indoctrination  of school children posed by schools teaching critical race theory.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Bishop), a passionate advocate on this issue, who  will speak more about the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from North Carolina.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Burgess), my very good friend, a distinguished member of  both the Rules Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee.                                time  1300     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Smith), my very good friend and the most distinguished  defender of life in the Congress.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Van Drew), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Smith), my very good friend and the ranking member of the  Budget Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 15  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I would advise the gentleman that I am  prepared to close whenever he is. Madam Speaker, can I inquire how much  time remains?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I want to begin by thanking my good friend, Mr. McGovern, the  chairman of  [[Page H3929]]  the Rules Committee, as we always have a spirited debate and lively  exchange and we don't always agree on things, but I always appreciate  his faith in the institution, his willingness to engage in debate, and  his friendship and decency as we work through our differences.   Madam Speaker, the bill before us today is a deeply misguided bill. I  say that as someone who serves on the Appropriations Committee. The  spending package covering seven different appropriations bills is  marked to numbers that simply don't make sense.   Contrary to what my friend claimed, we haven't had a massive  disinvestment in domestic spending over the last 4 years. Quite the  opposite. There have been steady and, I think, genuinely merited  increases. This is an explosion of spending tied to additional spending  that is promised down the road in the form of a $3.5 trillion  reconciliation bill.   Now, everything is funded except, as my good friend from Missouri  said, the things that keep us safe and free. The defense budget is  laughable. We have had a succession of Secretaries--on both sides of  the aisle, by the way--who have told us we need a 3 to 5 percent  increase beyond inflation in defense over the next several years.   We don't have a defense bill on the floor. We are not likely to see  one any time soon, but the reality is, the defense bill my friends  propose actually is an inflation-adjusted cut in the defense of the  United States, a cut at a time that we are dealing with Russian and  Chinese aggression and dangerous adventurism in other parts of the  world by regional adversaries like North Korea and Iran. That is  irresponsible.   We all know we have a crisis on the southern border. We won't see the  Homeland Security bill either because that is flat funded and not  meeting the obvious needs that we have there. But we do have an  extraordinary explosion in domestic spending, one that is simply not  justified and can't be sustained.   If those were my only objections, I would think at some point we  could probably find some sort of reasonable compromise, because my  friends know at the end of the day they have to get to 60 votes in the  United States Senate. However, in addition to that, they have ripped  out things like the Hyde and Weldon amendments that have been in these  bills for 45 years, in the case of the Hyde amendment, 15 or 16 years  in the case of the Weldon amendment. Those are deal-breaking bills to  us.   Now, my friends have routinely voted for those things for decades;  not for years but for decades, and Presidents of both parties have  signed them. As I have mentioned to my friends yesterday in the Rules  Committee, it was a Democratic Congress that passed the Hyde amendment,  overwhelmingly Democrat in both Chambers.   My friends have changed their view about the life issue. That is  their right. I respect it. We have not. We have not changed our views  on conscience issues. My friends know that if that language in the Hyde  amendment and the Weldon amendment are not restored to the  appropriations bills, they are not going to have any of these grand  bills or even compromise bills. They are going to end up with a  continuing resolution, at best.   For those people who are watching that don't know what a continuing  resolution is, it is simply last year's spending with the Weldon and  Hyde amendments. In effect, a Democratic President, a Democratic House,  and a Democratic Senate will have produced Donald Trump's last- negotiated budget. That is where we are headed unless my friends decide  to restore that language. That is an absolute deal-breaker for us if it  is not.   The other thing that I would mention to my good friends on the other  side is that there is still some time to do some things. This is a long  process, and I understand setting out your negotiating position. But  let's not be under any illusion that what we are talking about today  will ever become law. It will never be passed by the Senate. It will  never reach the desk of the President of the United States.   Madam Speaker, I urge my friends to reject the rule, reject the bill,  and sit down and bargain in good faith. We can get there.   As I have said on many occasions, I have had the great privilege of  having been chairman and ranking member of the largest component bill  in this group. On six different occasions, both as chairman and  ranking member, working with my good friend, the chairwoman of the full  committee, Representative DeLauro, we came to a deal. All six times,  the bill was out of committee, across the floor, signed by the  President. It didn't matter who was chairman or ranking member. It  didn't matter which party controlled. It didn't matter who the  President was.    That is six times in a row. We can do that again a seventh time in  this bill. There are some good things in this bill, as my friend says,  some things I certainly support. But there can be such a thing as too  much of a good thing, and there is way too much of a good thing in this  bill in terms of the amount of money it spends.   At the end of the day, if we are going to have an appropriations  process that works, if we are going to have a deal--and we both should  want a deal--then the defense number is going to have to come up. The  discretionary spending number, which is embodied in this bill, is going  to have to come down, and the Hyde and Weldon amendments are going to  have to be restored.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I will be brief. But I want to begin by  thanking Chairwoman DeLauro and Ranking Member Granger for their help  throughout the process.   However, despite many areas of agreement in the bill before us today,  particularly relating to Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, I  will oppose the bill.   Madam Speaker, at the end of May, President Biden sent us a $6  trillion budget request for fiscal year 2022. The bill presented today,  in many ways, mirrors that budget request. Proposing the highest  spending level since World War II, the price tag alone is utterly  unrealistic. As we continue the see inflation on the rise, such a  proposal is bad for the recovering economy as well.   Instead of focusing on the urgent priorities for all Americans, like  reopening our economy and schools, President Biden's budget request and  this bill, elevate controversial left-wing policies over-pressing  needs, like strengthening our national defense and addressing the  crisis at our southern border.   In fact, this budget calls for billions of dollars to fund  progressive priorities and policies like the Green New Deal, while  recommending an effective cut in the funding for our military. With  China and Russia growing their militaries by the day, this is a very  misguided approach.   Finally, most egregious in the President's budget and the current  deal, which is reflected here, is the removal of the Hyde amendment,  which protects life and prevents Federal taxpayer-funded abortions.  Since it was first enacted in 1976, it is estimated this provision has  saved more than 2 million lives while protecting the conscience rights  of the great majority of Americans who are opposed to publicly-funded  abortions. Also, it removes the Weldon amendment, which provides  important conscience protection for our healthcare providers who object  to participating in abortion proceedings.   This amendment and the Weldon amendment have both been supported  [[Page H4050]]  for generations by Republicans and Democrats alike.   Madam Speaker, you know that the Democrats in Congress do not have  the majorities capable of passing this bill without Republican vote. In  the days and weeks ahead, it is my hope that Members on both sides of  the aisle and both Chambers can negotiate spending that is reasonable  and will not lead us to financial disaster.   But the first step toward negotiation will be the full reinstatement  of the Hyde and Weldon amendments along with similar pro-life  protections contained across the 12 spending bills that we consider as  a committee.   These protections need to be reinstated for this package to move to  the President's desk. Quite frankly, everyone in the Chamber knows this  bill will never pass the United States Senate without their inclusion,  and the majority of American people support that view.   In closing, Madam Speaker, while the bill does fund many good things,  and while I certainly appreciate the openness of the process in which  the gentlewoman from Connecticut and the gentlewoman from Texas have  participated in developing the bill, I do oppose it as drafted.   The price tag is too high. The bill contains too many poison pill  policy riders, and it funds too many unauthorized programs, and bows to  a leftist agenda that does not reflect the views and values of the  American people.   Madam Speaker, I remain hopeful that we can do better, and I urge  rejection of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include the text of  the amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion  to recommit.
