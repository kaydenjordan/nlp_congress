 Mr. Speaker, the FDA Reauthorization Act we are  considering today provides the FDA the resources it needs to ensure  innovative and lifesaving drugs and medical devices are brought to the  market in a safe and expedient manner, while providing transparency and  certainty to manufacturers.   Further, the device inspection and regulatory improvements title  reflects language I introduced with Representatives Brooks, Peters, and  Butterfield, which sets forth a risk-based approach to medical device  establishment inspections and improves predictability for scheduled  inspections, among other provisions.  [[Page H5481]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I look  forward to moving it through Congress and sending it to the President's  desk.
