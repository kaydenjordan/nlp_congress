 Mr. Speaker, this bill involves 80 acres of land  controlled by the Forest Service but not in the actual national forest.   Over the past 50 years, this land has been used by the Space Dynamics  Laboratory, by NASA, by the Naval Research Laboratory, and they have a  great deal of infrastructure on this land.   Unfortunately, the Forest Service decided to list this as disposable  lands without contacting anybody, and now they don't have the ability  of going back and delisting it so these groups can actually use this  land for what they have been doing for the last 50 years.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is the cleanest and simplest way of simply  transferring control of this land back to the entity which is using it  now so they can continue their research, much of which is done in  support of our military. It is a simple and easy and correct way to  solve an administrative lapse, and I urge its adoption.
