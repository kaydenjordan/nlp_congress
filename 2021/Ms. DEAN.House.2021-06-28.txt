 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3385) to waive the requirement to undergo a medical examination  for aliens who are otherwise eligible for special immigrant status  under the Afghan Allies Protection Act of 2009, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3385         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include  extraneous material on H.R. 3385.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3385, the Honoring our Promises through Expedition  for the Afghan SIVs Act--or the HOPE for Afghan SIVs Act--proposes a  small, but impactful, change to expedite the issuance of special  immigrant visas to those who served side by side with American troops  in Afghanistan, and whose lives are at risk as a result.   The Afghan Special Immigrant Visa program allows individuals who  worked for or on behalf of the United States  [[Page H3221]]  Government or for the NATO International Security Assistance Force in  support of the American mission to seek lawful permanent residence to  the United States. To qualify, applicants must meet specific  eligibility criteria and pass rigorous background checks; a process  that, on average, takes 3 years.   Additionally, every applicant who is found to be eligible for a visa  must complete a medical examination before they are approved to come to  the United States. However, in the capital city of Kabul, there is only  one clinic certified by the United States Government to provide these  mandatory examinations.   The already high demand for services was worsened by the  deteriorating security conditions and a new outbreak of an intense  third wave of COVID-19. It is now nearly impossible for applicants to  schedule this mandatory life-changing appointment while in Afghanistan.   The HOPE for Afghan SIVs Act would allow the Secretary of State and  the Secretary of Homeland Security to quickly respond to these  emergency conditions in Afghanistan by authorizing a blanket waiver of  the medical examination requirement for people who are otherwise  eligible for special immigrant visas.   Once safely in the United States and removed from the threat of  violence, those eligible people must complete the required medical  examination within 30 days. To ensure compliance, Afghan special  immigrants would be admitted to the United States as lawful permanent  residents on a conditional basis. Conditions would be removed only when  the Secretary of Homeland Security confirms that the examination has  been completed and the individual is not inadmissible to the United  States on health-related grounds.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join Mr. Crow of Colorado, and I thank him  for championing this issue and working across the aisle to build  consensus and awareness for the importance of this legislation. I also  thank Ranking Member Jordan for his collaboration and support in the  drafting process.   As we draw down our military presence in Afghanistan, many who served  alongside our troops continue to face increasing threats because of  their service to our country. We must do right by these people, and  H.R. 3385 is an important first step.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1800     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Crow).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Crow for his service, his  powerful words, and his commitment. I thank Representative Wenstrup,  too, for his powerful words.   Our Afghan allies serve alongside U.S. troops, diplomats, and  government employees. We must do right by the people who have worked to  protect our country and our servicemen and -women.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to support them through the HOPE for  Afghan SIVs Act. I support this important legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
