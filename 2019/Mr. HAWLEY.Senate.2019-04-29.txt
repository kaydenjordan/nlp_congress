 Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate three  extraordinary World War II veterans from St. Louis who were recently  awarded the French Legion of Honour. Established by Napoleon Bonaparte  in 1802, the Legion of Honour is the highest civilian honor awarded by  the government of France.  [[Page S2482]]    Mr. Eugene Harmack, Mr. Glenn Harrison, and Mr. Alfred Villagran  served when the United States and its allies needed them most. These  heroes bravely fought against the Nazis and helped liberate Europe from  Hitler's fascist regime.   When he was 24, Eugene Harmack fought in one of the deadliest battles  in American history, the Battle of the Bulge. During the battle,  Harmack secured a vehicle trapped behind enemy lines and used its radio  to restore vital communications for the American forces that defeated  the last major Nazi offensive.   In 1944, Glenn Harrison was a 23-year-old B-17 bomber pilot who had  flown 17 bombing missions against the Nazis. On one mission, Harrison  and his crew were shot down on the way to Munich, Germany. Following  the crash, Harrison was captured and forced to march 300 miles to a  Nazi prisoner-of-war camp, where he was held from June 1944 to January  1945.   At the age of 19, Alfred Villagran was a gunner and radio operator on  a B-17 Bomber. On one mission, Villagran's plane was shot and lost two  of its four engines. As the plane flew back to England, Villagran and  his crew came under fire again and lost the third engine. With only one  functional engine, the crew safely landed thanks to the Allied fighter  planes that provided cover.   As we approach the 75th anniversary of D-Day, I wish to thank these  American heroes for their service and bravery. As a nation, we are  forever grateful for their sacrifices.                            ____________________
