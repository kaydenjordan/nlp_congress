 Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the ranking member  of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, for  engaging in this important discussion.   I am proud to stand before my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to  discuss some of the bipartisan work that we have accomplished through  regular order at the Agriculture Committee specifically with regard to  H.R. 1029, the Pesticide Registration Improvement Extension Act of  2017, or PRIA 4.   PRIA, while technical in nature, is critically important with  assisting both EPA in carrying out administrative functions and  industry that relies upon timely, science-based pesticide registration  decisions to get products on the market and in the hands of farmers,  ranchers, and other consumers.   PRIA, historically, has received widespread support from a diverse  coalition of stakeholders, including members of the pesticide  registrant community--both agricultural and nonagricultural uses,  labor, and environmental advocates, which has contributed to Congress's  ability to pass reauthorizations swiftly and by unanimous consent. With  the Widespread support of the PRIA coalition, as illustrated by a  coalition letter addressed to our committee on June 29, 2017, which  expresses support of the amendment to H.R. 1029 and urges swift action,  this effort should be no different.   Our committee held a hearing earlier this year to review this issue  in an open and transparent manner. As we have heard time and time  again, farmers and ranchers want regulatory certainty. EPA and  registrants who rely on PRIA to get new products on the market and in  the hands of farmers, ranchers, and other consumers want certainty.   My colleague raises an issue that has historically been outside the  scope of the technical, fee-based registration process of PRIA. I  certainly understand the concerns that have been raised by some groups  with regard to certain actions EPA is considering with regard to the  Worker Protection Standard and the Certification of Pesticide  Applicators rules. My hope is that EPA and the relevant stakeholders  can constructively discuss areas of concern related to these issues  within the framework of our Federal regulatory process without  jeopardizing PRIA.   Current authority for PRIA expires at the end of this fiscal year.  With that deadline in mind, our recent committee action is timely and  necessary to get PRIA updated.   Should PRIA's authority lapse, pesticide registration will not be  available for a wide range of crops that rely on innovative and new  solutions for pest protection, and a lapse will have a negative impact  on the products requiring registration that are used to protect public  health and ensure public safety.   It is important that we get PRIA across the finish line not only to  provide certainty to the industry but to also provide new products to  growers for crop protection and to consumers to protect public health,  and the timely reauthorization provides resources to ensure safety  education components are maintained.   I thank my colleague Senator Stabenow and other members of the  Agriculture Committee for working with me on this issue together and in  a bipartisan manner. I look forward to working with Senator Stabenow  and the coalition in support of this legislation to get this bill  across the Senate floor as quickly as possible and ultimately enacted  into law.                            ____________________
