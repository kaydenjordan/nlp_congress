 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I am here tonight to speak out on the urgent  need for the appointment of a second special counsel in light of  evidence that raises serious concerns about decisions, activities, and  inherent bias displayed at the highest levels of the Department of  Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation with regard to FISA abuse,  how and why the Hillary Clinton email probe ended, and how and why the  Donald Trump Russia probe began.   The concerns of the American public are serious, and the issues  requiring an immediate, unbiased, independent, and thorough  investigation are broad.   Mr. Speaker, the DOJ and FBI cannot be expected to investigate  themselves. I acknowledge, with immense gratitude, that nearly every  single man and woman in the DOJ and FBI conducts themselves daily with  integrity, independence, patriotism, objectivity, and commitment to the  rule of law. A special counsel is of the utmost importance to ensure  that these historic, legendary, and necessary agencies move forward  more respected and effective than ever before.   Tonight I am joined by my colleagues from across this country, and we  will hear from each and every one of them. Following these speakers, I  will be going into much greater detail on the many specifics on why the  Attorney General must immediately appoint a second special counsel to  conduct a thorough and independent investigation of our significant  concerns.   Without any further ado, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Gaetz) who has been a leader in this cause to fight for justice and  equality under the law.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida, as he  pointed out, and our next speaker signed as well at the end of  February, February 28, a letter signed by over a dozen of our  colleagues to AG Sessions calling for the appointment of a second  special counsel.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Blue Star Mom Claudia Tenney for  being here and for her leadership on this important cause as well.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my distinguished colleagues who we have  heard from, and additional colleagues who will be out here shortly. We  are laying out the very important case here tonight why a second  special counsel is needed with regard to misconduct at the highest  levels of the DOJ and FBI related to FISA abuse; how and why the  Hillary Clinton email probe ended; how and why the Trump Russia probe  began.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot expect the DOJ and FBI to fully investigate  themselves. I have a great amount of respect for everyone at the  Justice Department who has served and continues to serve for all of the  right reasons, as I mentioned earlier, integrity, independence,  patriotism, objectivity, and commitment to the rule of law.   A special counsel can ensure transparency and accountability so that  these historic, legendary, and necessary agencies can move forward with  their important mission better than ever before.   The list of concerns that warrant an immediate and independent  investigation is long and growing by the day. First, tonight I will  discuss the misconduct with regard to how and why the Hillary Clinton  email probe ended. Next, we will cover FISA abuse. And finally, we will  discuss the manner in which the Trump-Russia probe began, was extended,  continued, and became a special counsel probe.   But before discussing each of these topics individually, it is  important to address the political bias that has existed among  individuals at the highest levels of the DOJ and FBI. First, there was  FBI Agent Peter Strzok, who was the chief of the FBI's counter- espionage section.   Additionally, there was Agent Strzok's mistress, FBI counsel Lisa  Page. Aside from the fact that they were in love, it is important to  note that these two individuals exchanged many texts detailing their  personal biases, overcoming their better judgment in performance of  their duties.   Text messages exchanged between Strzok and Page during the period of  August 16, 2015, to May 17, 2017, show substantial evidence of  politicizing Federal law enforcement and improperly handling  investigations within the agency. The texts contain egregious evidence  of bias against President Trump, before and after the November 2016  election.   Page would write: ``Trump should go F--- himself.'' Strzok would  text: ``F--- Trump.'' Now, that is barely even starting to scratch the  surface with those two.   It is also worth noting that their texts, for some reason, were not  stored within the FBI archives system, an egregious oversight blamed on  a technical glitch. And even after these messages were partially  recovered by the agency's inspector general in 2018, many unanswered  questions remain regarding impropriety and bias.  [[Page H3334]]    Then there was DOJ senior official Bruce Ohr, fourth in command at  the agency. While the DOJ and FBI were improperly submitting FISA  applications based on Fusion GPS' work on behalf of the DNC and Hillary  Clinton campaign, it was never disclosed that Bruce Ohr's wife worked  at Fusion GPS, and that he served as the middleman between Christopher  Steele and the Justice Department.   Then there was FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, whose wife, Dr.  Jill McCabe, was running for Virginia State Senate, and received  $675,000 in donations from the Virginia Democratic Party and Common  Good VA, the leadership PAC controlled by Democratic Virginia Governor  Terry McAuliffe, a long-time Clinton associate.   These are just a few of the many highlights of partisan bias at the  highest levels of DOJ and FBI. That list, and the evidence, runs much,  much deeper.                                time  1945    The Hillary Clinton email probe:   While these various rogue agents were busy trying to obstruct Donald  Trump from day one, they were failing to properly complete their  investigation into the Hillary Clinton email controversy.   During her tenure as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton violated  Federal law and State Department rules, regulations, and protocol by  using a private email server in her Chappaqua, New York, home. She  would transmit emails that contained sensitive information or  classified material on this unsecured server. This use of a private  server was meant to blatantly get around FOIA and to avoid having to  turn over incriminating emails in the case of a subpoena.   Her plan proved to be partially successful when various sensitive  emails subject to grand jury and congressional subpoenas were destroyed  through bleach biting and the destruction of hardware before they could  be obtained by investigators.   The FBI, led by then-Director James Comey, began an incomplete  investigation into this serious issue. And according to transcripts  obtained by the Senate Judiciary Committee, Comey was prepared to  exonerate Secretary Clinton as early as April or May of 2016 when he  began to draft a statement announcing the end of his investigation  before up to 17 key witnesses, including former Secretary Clinton  herself and several of her closest aides, were even interviewed.   Cheryl Mills, who served as counselor and chief of staff to Hillary  Clinton during her whole tenure as United States Secretary of State,  was offered immunity from prosecution by the FBI during its  investigation in exchange for access to her laptop that contained many  of the questionable emails.   Why?   And after watching President Trump's personal attorney last week get  a no-knock raid of his home and office, that is especially troubling  how the scales of justice are just not equal under the law. That is a  big problem.   Back to Comey, now he contradicted those transcripts I mentioned when  he stated during sworn testimony before the House Judiciary Committee  on September 28 of 2016 that he made the decision not to recommend  criminal charges for Hillary Clinton after she was interviewed by the  FBI on July 2, 2016. That was a flat-out lie under oath.   Former Director Comey, in the final draft of his statement, allowed  Peter Strzok to replace ``grossly negligent,'' which is legally  punishable under Federal law, with ``extremely careless,'' which is not  legally punishable under Federal law.   Federal law states that gross negligence in handling our Nation's  intelligence can be punished criminally with prison time and/or fines.   And then there was the infamous tarmac meeting on June 27, 2016, just  days before Hillary Clinton would end up being exonerated. Attorney  General Loretta Lynch had a covert meeting with Hillary Clinton's  husband, former President Bill Clinton, aboard AG Lynch's plane on the  tarmac in Phoenix, Arizona. The likelihood of this conversation being  just small talk was zero.   And let's not forget that it was AG Lynch who insisted that the  Hillary Clinton email probe not even be called an investigation.  Instead, she insisted it be called a matter, as if the Clinton campaign  were driving the bus of the investigation and calling the shots.   Soon after, Comey violated DOJ rules and unilaterally exonerated  then-Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in a public statement to  the media. One day later, on July 6, 2016, an announcement followed  from AG Lynch that the DOJ investigation into then-Presidential  candidate Hillary Clinton would be formally closed, with no criminal  charges.   This seemingly endless trail of crimes and misconduct relating to  Hillary Clinton's emails did not end there. In September 2016, the FBI,  during an examination of the personal laptop of former Congressman  Anthony Weiner, as part of an unrelated investigation into him sending  sexually explicit messages to a teenage girl, discovered previously  unexamined State Department classified emails belonging to his spouse,  top Clinton aide Huma Abedin.   The man within the FBI tasked with examining these additional emails  was--guess who--FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, whose wife was then  in the midst of a Virginia State senate campaign generously supported  by Clinton operatives and Clinton-allied money.   It then took until October 28 of 2016 for Comey to announce, via a  letter to the chairmen of the relevant congressional committees, that  he was reopening the investigation, an additional egregious delay after  McCabe failed to even examine the illicit emails for at least 3 weeks  after the FBI discovered them on Anthony Weiner's computer.   The DOJ's inspector general is still conducting an investigation into  whether then-FBI Deputy Director McCabe and other FBI officials sought  to purposely delay the release of these illicit emails for politically  motivated purposes.   Hillary Clinton's privileged status her whole career, and especially  during the Obama administration, as above the law doesn't end with her  legal misuse of classified emails.   Throughout the Obama administration, while she was serving as  Secretary of State, and later as she was running for President, the  Department of Justice also failed to fully investigate serious concerns  surrounding the connection between her, her husband, and the Clinton  Foundation to Russian-controlled company Uranium One, which received  State Department approval to purchase American uranium mines in 2010.   Also in 2010, while Russian state interests were working to both  acquire a majority stake in Uranium One and to purchase American mines,  Bill Clinton was paid $500,000 for a speech in Moscow by a Kremlin- linked Russian investment bank that was underwriting Uranium One stock.   Nothing to see here, right?   The Obama DOJ ignored an FBI probe on the matter. A confidential  informant who worked with the FBI to uncover bribery and other  corruption related to the Uranium One matter was threatened with  reprisal by the Justice Department under AG Lynch when he tried to come  forward in 2016.   The Senate Judiciary Committee launched a probe in October of 2017 to  investigate the Uranium One issue, including whether Federal agencies  such as the State Department knew the FBI was looking into possible  corruption before the deal was approved.   Mr. Speaker, this again brings home the urgent need for an  independent and fair investigation.   Collusion with corrupt Russian actors is, indeed, a very serious  concern and a threat to U.S. national security, especially when  critical resources that impact national and global security, such as  uranium, are up for grabs to questionable companies that were not  properly scrutinized due to their connections with an influential  family.   FISA abuse:   Mr. Speaker, there are also very serious concerns that, in October  2016, the FBI and DOJ used politically biased, unverified sources to  improperly obtain a FISA warrant to spy on an American citizen. This  warrant granted U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies sweeping  power to collect bulk information and conduct ``about collection,''  which results in surveillance of a broad array of private  communications from the past, present, and future, including those of  U.S. citizens not specifically targeted in a FISA-authorized warrant.  [[Page H3335]]    To obtain these warrants, FBI and DOJ officials submitted an  unverified dossier prepared by Christopher Steele to the FISA court,  failing to disclose that Christopher Steele was hired by the firm  Fusion GPS, which was hired by the Democratic National Committee and  Hillary Clinton campaign to prepare this dossier, and that the source  was unreliable and soon thereafter was going to be terminated as an  asset.   The FISA court was not informed that Christopher Steele was actively  opposed to the election of Donald Trump, that he was the unnamed source  cited in the media reports that the FBI used to corroborate his  dossier, and that Fusion GPS had been hired to perform previous anti- Trump research efforts in 2015.   The Woods Procedures, which are the FBI's mandatory vetting process  required for all FISA warrant applications, instituted to ensure that  all facts contained in an application are accurate and verified to  clearly support probable cause for the warrant, was clearly not  followed.   Former-Director Comey then admitted in sworn testimony to the Senate  Judiciary Committee on June 8, 2017, that material contained in the  Steele dossier was known to be both salacious and unverified.   Since FISA applications are rarely turned down and almost never  subject to appeal, are presented in closed court with no public record  where the government is not challenged by any defense, it is imperative  that the government take extra care to validate the information being  utilized to build their case before they take the extraordinary step of  waiving rights of a U.S. citizen without his or her knowledge or the  opportunity to defend themselves.   These are secret documents submitted to a secret court to spy on an  American citizen. The government has a responsibility not only to  provide the best evidence they have in support of their case, but to  also provide the best evidence that they have against their case.   These deeply flawed and questionable FISA warrant applications  utilizing illicit sources and politically biased intelligence were  approved by DOJ and FBI officials at the highest levels before being  submitted to the FISA court.   It was further not disclosed to the FISA court, as I referenced  earlier, that the wife of the fourth ranking DOJ official, Bruce Ohr,  was an employee of Fusion GPS, and Christopher Steele directly  transmitted the dossier and other information through Bruce Ohr for  submission to the FISA court.   Let's talk about how and why the Trump-Russia probe began.   Mr. Speaker, make no mistake, the Trump-Russia probe was launched  because Donald Trump won the GOP nomination for President of the United  States.   It is clear why DOJ and FBI didn't want to turn over the memo opening  the investigation. They didn't come up with a sufficient alternative  justification to start the probe. The Trump-Russia probe was then  continued because Trump became very close to possibly being elected  President of the United States.   It is clear why DOJ and FBI didn't want the Nunes memo released: they  broke the rules and misled a FISA court to improperly secure a warrant  to spy on a U.S. citizen.   The Trump-Russia probe then became a special counsel probe because  Donald Trump subsequently won the election, and the FBI Director then  illegally leaked classified info to the media to trigger a special  counsel appointment.   Director Comey had prepared a series of seven memos containing  classified information, including notes on his conversations with  President Trump. He then admitted in sworn testimony to the Senate  Committee on Intelligence in June 2017 that he had leaked this  classified content to a personal friend and encouraged that friend to  share the material with the press.   That is a blatant violation of Federal law meant to protect sensitive  information from falling into the wrong hands.   An investigation conducted by the Senate Judiciary Committee later  revealed that the personal friend of Director Comey was Professor  Daniel Richman of Columbia Law School, and that Mr. Comey provided him  with four of the seven memoranda, all containing classified  information.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, with all of this grievous misconduct at the  highest levels of the DOJ and FBI, the blatant violations of the  Constitution and law, and so many serious unanswered questions, this  matter must be investigated by someone who can act independently from  outside the Justice Department.    The nearly 2\1/2\ years that the Trump-Russia probe has continued on  with zero accountability still appears to be without any evidence that  President Trump colluded with the Russians. These have been some of the  most tumultuous years in the history of the FBI and DOJ, but with  transparency and accountability, these awesome agencies can get  everything back on track.   In March 2018, former FBI Director McCabe was fired by AG Jeff  Sessions, who noted that Deputy Director McCabe ``lacked candor-- including under oath--on multiple occasions'' and had partaken in  ``unauthorized disclosure to the news media.'' This is among other  violations noted in a report issued by the FBI Office of Inspector  General after a wide-reaching investigation into McCabe's conduct.   A myriad of other DOJ and FBI personnel have been fired, demoted, or  resigned during these past few years: Former FBI Director Comey; chief  of staff to the Director, James Rybicki; FBI General Counsel James  Baker; FBI Agent Peter Strzok; FBI Counsel Lisa Page; FBI Special Agent  Josh Campbell; DOJ senior official Bruce Ohr; FBI Assistant Director  Michael Kortan; and Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik.   The DOJ Inspector General's Office has undoubtedly done great work to  uncover misconduct and expose bias, but the mission of the OIG is  limited only to ``detect and deter waste, fraud, abuse, and misconduct  in DOJ programs and personnel, and to promote economy and efficiency in  those programs.''   A fully independent special counsel has greater autonomy than an IG  or other Federal prosecutors to run a nonbiased investigation and, if  necessary, bring forth criminal charges.   With so much at risk, including the integrity of our Federal law  enforcement agencies, which are tasked with protecting our Nation and  upholding the rule of law, the need is more urgent than ever.   This is not about politics but about the principles that bind  together our Nation and our constitutional system of government.   Equality under the law and impartiality of justice is what brings all  of us to the House floor tonight, urging the Attorney General of the  United States to take immediate action through the appointment of a  second special counsel. Too many questions remain unanswered, and too  much is at stake.   Mr. Speaker, I say to Mr. Sessions: It is very important to take this  action and appoint a second special counsel.   Mr. Speaker, at this point I yield to the gentleman from Virginia  (Mr. Brat), one of the signers of our late February letter to AG  Sessions, a great leader in this cause.                                time  2000     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Brat) for being here and for all of his efforts.   Mr. Speaker, at this time, it is a great pleasure to yield to  Congressman Louie Gohmert from Texas. Oftentimes, for those who are at  home who may be watching C-SPAN late on a weeknight like tonight, I  will encourage them that all other nights when we are here, there is a  pretty good chance that if they turn on C-SPAN late at night, Louie  Gohmert will be standing where he is about to speak from, this wise  man, educating us on his thoughts and reflections of our great country.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his  leadership.   Our next speaker is oftentimes at the very tip of the spear of the  issues that  [[Page H3337]]  matter most all throughout America. He certainly has met the tip of the  spear here, bringing accountability and transparency to the maximum  degree he knows possible.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Congressman  Jim Jordan.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Jordan for all of his  remarks and his leadership on this issue.    It is a great pleasure to introduce General Scott Perry of  Pennsylvania--otherwise known as Congressman General Scott Perry of  Pennsylvania--tonight to participate in our Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Perry and all of our  speakers tonight: Congressman Gaetz, Congresswoman Tenney, Congressmen  Brat, Gohmert, Jordan, Perry, and everyone who has been part of this  cause.   Just to recap, we, over the course of this hour, outlined all the  main reasons why it is imperative for AG Sessions to appoint a second  special counsel to look into FISA abuse, how and why the Hillary  Clinton case ended, and how and why the Trump-Russia probe began.    As Congressman Perry was just talking about the scales of justice, I  remember when Hillary Clinton was publicly being exonerated just days  after a tarmac meeting where her husband was able to meet with AG Lynch  on her plane on the tarmac in Phoenix, Arizona.   I was thinking of the people who had to go into court that day as  defendants. Maybe they got caught making a right on red, and they are a  defendant going before a judge. They are pleading, and they are being  punished. And yet here you have all this evidence with the Hillary  Clinton case and there would be zero accountability, that actually the  decision would be made to exonerate Hillary Clinton before even  interviewing her and well over a dozen others.   There should be equal treatment under the law. The scales of justice  should not be tilted based off of your last name. Cheryl Mills gets  immunity; Michael Cohen gets his offices and home raided. If there was  equal justice under the law, then there might be more understanding and  a greater mandate for actions being taken.   But President Trump is being investigated because he won the GOP  nomination. That is why the investigation got started. The reason why  the DOJ and FBI didn't want to release the memo is because they really  didn't have much of a better reason. They were reaching, and they  really didn't want to have to tell Congress why they started, because  the real reason was because he won the Republican nomination, and they  wanted to continue the investigation because he actually had a shot at  winning.   So they go to a secret court with secret documents to spy on a United  States citizen desperate to try to find information loaded with bias,  clear-as-day bias, an anti-Trump and pro-Hillary bias where their  political bias is overcoming their better objective, and then expanding  the probe and creating a special counsel because the President is  elected.   That is not how we do things in this country where you get  investigated because you win an election, where you identify a person,  and then you empower someone with authority to go out and try to find a  crime anywhere.   So with regard to FISA abuse--the end of the Hillary Clinton probe  and the beginning of the Trump-Russia probe--it is imperative for AG  Sessions to appoint a second special counsel.   I appreciate everyone for tuning in during this hour. We look forward  to continuing the effort until we get this done and over the top.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
