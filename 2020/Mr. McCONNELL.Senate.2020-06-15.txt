 Mr. President, 3 months ago, States were implementing  stay-at-home orders as the coronavirus spread throughout our country.  Three months ago, George Floyd was still alive, and the killing of  Breonna Taylor in Louisville had just begun to reignite a national  discussion around policing.   Our country has confronted what feels like several years' worth of  upheaval in just 3 months. Small businesses and childcare centers are  trying to figure out how to safely reopen. Schools and universities are  trying to plan for the fall. Healthcare professionals and essential  workers are continuing to man their posts, help strangers, and keep our  country going. Peaceful protesters have continued to express outrage  over the killings of Black Americans, and our Nation's police  officers--overwhelmingly good, decent, and brave people who put  everything on the line for their neighbors--have continued to  faithfully serve under trying circumstances.   These are the kinds of challenges our Nation should meet with unity,  like when the Senate wrote and passed the historic CARES Act  unanimously in March. But unfortunately, in some corners of the  country, our Nation's strategic reserve of sanity appears to have run a  little low. We have seen peaceful protests hijacked by violent riots.  Apparently, rioters thought the best way to argue against a strong  police force was to terrorize innocent people and small businesses for  nights on end.   Then, completing the absurd cycle, we have seen the far left hold up  these riots as proof that we should defund or disband the police in  this country--as though the vast majority of Americans in the country  would not interpret the anarchy in precisely the opposite way.   As I noted last week, we have seen some big-city mayors use health  restrictions to construct constitutionally dubious double standards,  where massive protests are blessed and encouraged, but small, careful  church services are still banned. In Seattle, we have  [[Page S2960]]  seen the local officials cede several blocks to a rag-tag band of  demonstrators who call themselves the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone.  Fear of the far left has literally caused local officials to let a  chunk of their own city devolve into a no-go zone for their own cops.   Naturally, left-leaning media outlets have been quick to shower  praise on this legacy and slow to amplify reports of arson and other  unchecked crimes. One story from the New York Times praised the  ``liberated streets''--liberated, as if spray-painting a boarded-up  business were the equivalent of the Normandy landings.   Amid all this, our Democratic counterparts in the House of  Representatives have mostly continued to keep their doors locked and  their lights off. But here in the Senate, we came back in over a month  ago. We have taken smart precautions, but we have not let the people's  business come to a halt.   Our committees have been overseeing the CARES Act and working on  other essential business, like the National Defense Authorization Act.   Our colleagues are considering what else might help the country  reopen, like strong legal protections for schools, colleges, employers,  and healthcare workers.   Under the leadership of Senator Tim Scott, our conference is  developing a serious proposal to reform law enforcement in smart ways  without lashing out needlessly and counterproductively at the first  responders who are a credit to their communities.                            ____________________     Mr. President, just this week, on the floor, we will  complete a major piece of legislation that will benefit generations to  come. Thanks to a number of our colleagues--particularly the junior  Senators from Colorado and Montana--the Senate is poised to take  historic action for the future of the Nation's public lands.   I haven't been the only one coming to the floor to highlight how my  constituents prize our State's national parks, wildlife refuge, and  other managed areas--for recreation and for many livelihoods. We  Kentuckians are proud that our Commonwealth is home to one of the  National Park Service's crowning jewels at Mammoth Cave. We are proud  of our historic sites like Mill Springs Battlefield and our wildlife  refuges at the Clarks and Green Rivers. And I am proud that the Senate  this week will provide permanent, steady support to maintain these  treasures for generations to come.   As we have heard, the same is true for Colorado, where entire  regional economies are driven by outdoor recreation in alpine  wonderlands; for Montana, where Federal and State management work hand  in hand with local sportsmen and Native American Tribes to preserve  millions of acres of pristine, Big Sky wilderness; for West Virginia,  where 54 of 55 counties have benefited from the Land and Water  Conservation Fund investment; and for Ohio, where the Cuyahoga Valley  puts parkland in the backyards of millions of people. The list goes on  and on.   Public lands hold a unique place in the life of every State in  America--from their natural beauty, to their use for recreation, to  their pivotal roles in local economies. In the communities just outside  of the gates, public lands drive over $40 billion in economic activity  every year, and they play a big part in the entire outdoor recreation  industry that creates hundreds of billions of dollars in national  prosperity every year   Once again, I am grateful to our colleagues who have stewarded the  Great American Outdoors Act thus far; to Senator Gardner and Senator  Daines for their leadership; and to Senators Alexander, Portman,  Manchin, and Warner for their efforts as well to steer this strong,  bipartisan product toward the finish line. I look forward to continuing  to advance this legislation today and passing it this week.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move to table amendment No. 1628.    Mr. President, I move to table amendment No. 1626.
