 Mr. President, I want to talk a few minutes about  Medicare.   If I am on Medicare and I go to my physician for an earache and my  physician treats me, hopefully successfully, my physician then does not  turn around and send a bill to Medicare that says: For services  rendered for an earache. What my physician does is fill out a form that  has a bunch of codes on it, and my physician fills out the form with  the code for an earache.   Now, what does that mean? That means that when that form with a code  for an earache goes to Washington, the administrators at Medicare look  up the code for an earache, and they know then how much they are going  to pay my physician for treating an earache.   As you can imagine, there are thousands of codes--literally thousands  of codes--because there are thousands of diagnoses for which our  citizens on Medicare seek treatment every year.   So, every year, Medicare puts out a fee schedule, and in its  essential form this is just a schedule listing all of the codes for all  the different illnesses that doctors who treat Medicare patients bill  for. And these codes, this fee schedule, are used to reimburse doctors  and hospitals. Well, of course, it is not as simple as that, and the  way that the codes are put together and the fee schedule is put  together are not exactly a model of clarity. And we need to do better,  and, hopefully, someday we will do better. But, at the moment, we have  to deal with reality as it is.   Now, in setting a code--or how much Medicare is going to pay my  doctor for treating my earache under Medicare--and in putting together  the fee schedule, which is put together by the Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services, which I will just refer to it as ``Medicare''-- Medicare takes all kinds of factors into consideration in deciding how  much to pay my doctor for an earache. Medicare looks at things like the  diagnosis, of course. Medicare will pay less for an earache than for  heart surgery. Medicare looks at the procedure that the doctor had to  use.   Medicare looks at the location. If I go to my doctor in Baton Rouge,  where my primary care physician is located, the cost of living in Baton  Rouge is lower than the cost of living in New York. So the fee for an  earache paid by Medicare to my Baton Rouge physician is going to be  lower than that paid to a physician in New York.   The fee schedule looks at time and expenses of the doctor. The fee  schedule that Medicare puts together looks at things like the cost of  maintaining a practice: rent, supplies, support personnel. The fee  schedule tries to take into consideration the cost of medical  malpractice.   So the point is that a doctor treating me in Baton Rouge for an  earache will not receive the same fee that a doctor, for example, in  New York will receive for treating a patient there under Medicare for  an earache.   But every year Medicare gets together and they send out a new fee  schedule, and it is a very complicated process. And that process is  complicated by the fact of what we call budget neutrality. Under  current law, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services--or  Medicare, as I have been calling it--is required to make budget  neutrality adjustments to the payment schedule. And the technical  definition is--I will read it to you, and then I will explain it:  Medicare is required to make Medicare physician payment schedule  adjustments whenever changes in relative value units generate a payment  increase or decrease of $200 million.   I told you it was complicated.   Now, what does that mean? That means that Medicare is statutorily  required--required by Congress--to maintain budget neutrality, and this  means that, as certain codes increase in value, in order to maintain  budget neutrality, Medicare has to reduce payment for other codes.  Budget neutrality is also  [[Page S7112]]  much more complicated than I just explained it, but those are the basic  rules.   Now, here is the problem. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services--CMS, or Medicare, as I have been referring to it--has just  released their 2023 physician fee schedule. The new fee schedule has  come out, and because of the formula and because of the budget  neutrality requirement, CMS is proposing--or Medicare--a 4.5-percent  across-the-board reduction in Medicare payments. So every payment is  going to be cut 4.5 percent across the board.   Well, it gets even more difficult. Due to the $1.9 trillion deficit  increase caused by the American Rescue Plan and under our budget rules,  pay-go sequestration is going to be triggered by the American Rescue  Plan, and that is going to require an additional 4-percent reduction  across the board in payments to physicians and hospitals.   So unless we do something, every physician who treats a patient who  is on Medicare--it doesn't matter what for--is going to be paid 8.5  percent less--in the middle of raging inflation, in the middle of not  only doctor shortages but staff shortages as well.   Now, this is not the first time we have had this problem. We had it  last year, and we had it the year before. We solved it then, but we  need to solve it today. And you do not have to be a senior at Cal Tech  to figure out that if you cut physicians' fees for every different  diagnosis for which Americans seek treatment from a Medicare physician  by 8.5 percent, physicians are going to have to either make it up  somewhere or stop seeing Medicare patients. So all of a sudden your  doctor under Medicare is not taking any more Medicare patients. We  don't want that.   Not only that, but the Medicare fee schedule is looked to by private  insurance companies when they determine how much to pay physicians  under their insurance plans. That is the problem.   Here is what my bill would do to solve it. My bill would freeze the  current fee schedule in this sense--not per se but indirectly. My bill  would keep physician reimbursement at existing levels. So the amount  that doctors are paid today for that earache would be the same next  year.    My bill would pause the pay-go cuts until 2024. So, in effect, my  bill would prevent, next year, an 8.5-percent reduction across the  board to physician fees.   Now, I know what you are thinking, Mr. President. You are thinking:  Well, I have heard speeches by Kennedy before about controlling the  cost of spending in government and the rate of growth. So here he is  suggesting that we spend more.   And it is true that this bill would replace the fee schedule cuts by  adding money to the Medicare budget. The pay-go cuts would just be  postponed. But I have a pay-for. I am not asking this Congress just to  add spending and go borrow the money and put us further in debt. I have  a way to pay for it.   As you know, we sent--``we,'' meaning the U.S. Congress, sent--a lot  of money to our healthcare delivery system during COVID to help  patients, or, rather, to help physicians and hospitals deal with our  healthcare crisis. We sent a lot of that money through what is called  the Provider Relief Fund. These are dollars that were sent out to the  hospitals and the doctors to help them get through the COVID pandemic.   Our doctors and hospitals didn't use all that money. They have  returned some of it, believe it or not. As of February of this year, a  few months ago, they had returned $9.8 billion. And I suspect, by now,  they have returned, as best as we can tell from CBO, about $15 billion.  So we have $15 billion in our healthcare budget that is not accounted  for in terms of how it would be spent.   My bill would cost $2.25 billion. I would propose, Mr. President,  that we pay for that $2.25 billion and take it out of what I believe is  the $15 billion pot of money that was returned to the Provider Relief  Fund. So I have a problem, I have a solution, and I have a way to pay  for it without us having to spend money we don't have and thereby  borrow it.   So, Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous  consent that the Committee on Finance be discharged from further  consideration of S. 5194.   Let me stop just for a moment, Mr. President. We have to solve this  problem. We are going to solve this problem. We solved it last year,  and we solved it the year before. Nobody in this body wants to throw  people off Medicare.   Now, we are having trouble putting together a budget. I don't know  how that movie is going to end. It may end with an omnibus. It may end  with a continuing resolution, where we will wait for a new Congress.  But we need to solve this problem now and not make it contingent on an  omnibus and not make it contingent upon a continuing resolution. We  need to solve it now for the American people who depend on Medicare,  and that is what my bill does.   We can continue to fight over the budget. We can continue to fight  over the CR. But we are going to solve this problem today with a pay- for, with my bill.   So I repeat, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Committee on Finance be discharged from further consideration  of S. 5194 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, and I  further ask that the bill be considered read a third time and passed  and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Mr. President, I appreciate my good friend Senator  Wyden's comments. And I hope he gets some sleep off that red-eye  flight.   I am just going to repeat quickly what I said before.   I hope we can put together--we can't solve this problem without  passing a bill. I don't know if we are going to be able to pass a bill,  any kind of bill. Hopefully, before we go home for Christmas and before  this Congress ends, we will be able to do the National Defense  Authorization Act, which I think we are going to do this week. There  will be some people objecting to the NDAA. I know that. And it will  slow it down. But after they object and they get to be dramatic for a  little while, we will come back and pass the bill. And then we will  decide whether to do an omnibus or whether we are going to do a  continuing resolution and wait for the new Congress.   But in order to solve this problem, we have got to do something now.  And there are millions of Americans out there that are looking at an  8\1/2\ percent cut to Medicare when we have an 8-percent inflation.  That is a 16-point swing. And those millions of people are not just  physicians or nurses. They are patients who depend on Medicare for life  and death.   So I hope that the chairman of Finance, who is whip smart, will  consider my proposal. It would postpone the pay-go cuts of 4 percent,  and it would freeze the current fee schedule. If we don't, if the new  fee schedule goes into effect, we are going to have another 4\1/2\  percent cut--that is where I get the 8\1/2\ percent--and it would pay  for it.   It wouldn't increase debt at all. We pay for it, very simply, as I  explained. We pay for it out of the $15 billion in the Provider Relief  Fund.   And if our Finance Committee doesn't like that as a pay-for, I have  another one. You can pay for it out of the Medicare Improvement Fund.  It has 7.3 billion in it. Now, that is $24 billion we have got to solve  the $2.5 billion problem so the elderly in our country can sleep  tonight. So I hope my esteemed colleague will take this into  consideration. And I know that he will.    Mr. President, I am going to talk for a minute about  another subject: flood insurance. It doesn't do any good to offer flood  insurance when people can't afford it. And that is what FEMA is doing  right now.   We all know--or most people know--that you can't buy flood insurance  really in the private market. I mean, you can, but for the most part,  you can't. And if your house floods and you have homeowners insurance,  don't make the mistake of thinking your homeowners insurance covers it  because it doesn't. You have got to go buy special flood insurance.   And we have had this problem for a while, and the Federal Government  addressed it by creating the National Flood Insurance Program. We call  it, as you know, NFIP. About 5 million people who wouldn't be insured  for flood otherwise are members of the National Flood Insurance  Program. They don't get it for free. They pay for the flood insurance,  and they pay dearly.   My State, Louisiana, has 5,000 people out of 5 million who depend on  the National Flood Insurance Program. We in Louisiana have the highest  participation rate in the country, bar none. And despite what some  people may think, my people who are buying flood insurance, they are  not multimillionaires; they are working people. They are people who get  up every day and go to work, and they obey the law and pay their taxes.  They try to do the right thing by their children. They live paycheck to  paycheck. These aren't multimillionaires paying for this flood  insurance. And they are not paying for the flood insurance on mansions  on the beach. We don't have those in Louisiana. These are working  people.   Now, for my people and for most Americans who carry flood insurance,  their home is their biggest investment. It is the biggest investment  they will ever make. It is the most money they will ever spend at one  time. And so they want to protect their investment. And they need flood  insurance to do that. And we in the Federal Government solved the  problem when we created the National Flood Insurance Program.    Now, last year, FEMA, which is under the executive branch, of  course--we all know what FEMA is--FEMA rolled out the most significant  change in history in the way the National Flood Insurance Program  calculates the cost of flood insurance--the most important change in  history--and they didn't ask Congress for our input. They just did it.   They went out and hired a consultant who created a new algorithm. And  this algorithm, supposedly, says FEMA, can see the future. It can look  out 35 years and tell whether your home is going to flood and when it  is going to flood. And they cannot only look at a particular area, they  say this algorithm is so good that it can look at your specific  property and tell whether it is going to flood and assess the risk.  Man, I want a dozen of those.   FEMA calls this Risk Rating 2.0. There is just one problem: FEMA  won't tell any of us in the U.S. Congress, much less the American  people, how this algorithm works. I asked them to give me the  algorithm, and I would pay, at my expense--at my expense--to have  somebody evaluate it. FEMA said, if I showed it to you, Kennedy, I  would have to kill you. They won't show it to us.   But yet when I asked them about it--I have asked them in committees-- FEMA says, Risk Rating 2.0--that is what they call it--they say it is  fairer, and they say it is based on the value of your home and the  unique flood risk for that property. Once again, man, FEMA is  clairvoyant. This algorithm is awesome. They can look out 35 years;  they just won't tell us how they do it.   There is no transparency on this grading 2.0. People have absolutely  no idea, Members of the U.S. Congress have no idea, how this algorithm  works and how they come up with the specific price for every home in  America. But I will tell you what we do know: All the prices have gone  up.   Let me give you an example. In Louisiana, we have a lot of levees. A  lot of those levees are helped paid for with Americans' taxpayer money.  And we are grateful to our neighbors and America for helping us out.  But a lot of those levees are paid for by Louisiana citizens. We have  asked: How does this algorithm, in raising these prices, take into  account the levees? Are we getting credit for our levees? And they say:  Sure. And I say: Can you show me? And they say: If I showed you, I  would have to kill you; this is a secret algorithm.   No transparency. None.   Now, in the past, FEMA has already recognized levees and their  importance. And they say they are doing it now under Risk Rating 2.0.  But they won't show us how. And our levees work. Our levees work.   Last year, we had a number of storms. We had one that came through  New Orleans. We have a levee system around New Orleans. It held. Thank  you, American taxpayers. But we don't know how FEMA takes that into  account. They say they do. They say: Trust us.   You know, every now and then, I play poker with friends. And they are  all good friends. I trust them. But you know what, every time I play  poker, every hand, I cut the cards. It is not a matter of friendship or  trust. That is just the way it is supposed to be: transparency.   Now, this isn't just my opinion. There was an interview in the Times- Picayune, Mr. Dwayne Bourgeois. Mr. Bourgeois knows what he is talking  about. He is the executive director of the North Lafourche  Conservation, Levee, and Drainage District in Louisiana. He is an  expert on floodwater drainage and levees. This is what he said about  the Risk Rating 2.0:         I [just] can't figure out why some people get this minimum       result and these other people get the maximum result. I can't       tell you what the secret sauce is to get to that rate.    And the reason he can't is because FEMA will not tell us what the  secret sauce is. What is the effect of this secret sauce? FEMA says it  is going to make everything fairer. I know this much: It is going to  make everything more expensive.   According to FEMA's estimates, 80 percent of the people who have  flood  [[Page S7114]]  insurance and have to have flood insurance in Louisiana--in part  because the mortgage company requires it--are going to see their rates  go up.   The likely average full-risk premium for a home in Louisiana under  this new secret sauce is $1,700. Under the old system, it was $766.  That is a 122-percent increase because of this algorithm, this secret  sauce, which FEMA will not let us see.   My people can't afford this. And the reality is, people are already  dropping flood insurance. They are saying: We just can't pay for it.  Something has to give. We have inflation at 8 percent or my rent has  gone up. Food has gone up. Gas has gone up. We just can't afford it.   The number of flood insurance policies in eight of my parishes--we  call our counties parishes--in eight of my parishes or counties, the  number of policies has dropped from 290,000 in October 2021 to 267,000  in November of 2022, and it has fallen.   So that is 22,000 people--almost 23,000--out of only 8 parishes or  counties who have had to give up their flood insurance.   Now, it is not just Louisiana, Mr. President. You may be having the  problem in California.   The Associated Press estimates that 1 million fewer Americans will be  able to afford to buy flood insurance by the end of the decade because  of Risk Rating 2.0, their algorithm, their secret sauce. And E&E News  has identified 425,000 policyholders across the country who have  already discontinued coverage.   What does that mean for each State? Well, for example, cancellations  of flood insurance because they can't afford it. Eleven percent of the  people of California who were buying flood insurance can't afford it  anymore, they have dropped it; 11 percent of the policyholders in  Texas; 9.6 percent in Florida; in Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia,  and South Carolina, 8 percent.   Now, this is a disaster waiting to happen. And I am all for a fair  system, but I will tell you what I am not for. I am not for having a  Federal Agency, without consulting the U.S. Congress, without talking  to you, Mr. President, about your policyholders in California or me in  Louisiana, without explaining to us how they are doing it, just  unilaterally raising prices with an algorithm or their secret sauce, as  I call it.   Now, Senators Cassidy and Gillibrand and I have introduced a bill. It  is called the Flood Insurance Pricing Transparency Act. It is a  bipartisan bill. All we are asking that FEMA do is talk to us and tell  us how they are coming up with these rate increases.   The American people pay the salary of the people at FEMA, and my  people and your people, Mr. President, deserve to know how their  policies are being priced.   And, Mr. President--Mr. President Biden, if you are listening--I hope  you will pick up the phone and you will call your FEMA Director, for  whom I have great respect--I don't hate anybody--but I hope the  President will call the FEMA Director here and ask him what planet he  just parachuted in from and what is he thinking, raising these kinds of  prices without telling the American people why.
