 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of this  energy package. I repeat, in support of this package. This crucial  piece of legislation would increase domestic energy production, reform  the permitting process, and reverse the Biden administration's anti- energy policies that are crushing our Nation's small oil and gas  producers.   As the chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I hear from our  small producers about the damage that has been done to their industry  over the last few years. The Biden administration's hostile approach  toward this entire industry is harming small businesses. They are  simultaneously trying to deal with high inflation created by the Biden  administration, supply chain issues created by the Biden  administration, and an inability to access capital.   Tomorrow, my committee will examine the critical role small business  plays in domestic energy production and highlight how this legislation  is a step in the right direction. We should be the supplier of, not the  buyer of. Let the people decide.   I applaud the Speaker and the chairman and all of my Republican  colleagues that put together H.R. 1 to deliver reliable and affordable  energy for the American people.  [[Page H1502]]    I have something to say to my friends on the other side. Profits--I  repeat, profits--are good. In God we trust.
