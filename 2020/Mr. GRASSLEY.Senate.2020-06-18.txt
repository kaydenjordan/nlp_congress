 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate for 1 minute in morning business.    Madam President, once again, I am proud to come to tell  you something about the history of Iowa, and I do this during a hectic  time of the COVID-19 crisis. That crisis has had, for American  educational systems, quite an impact. So, at this time, it is important  to highlight some successes.   The 2018-2019 school year saw the highest 4-year graduation rate in  Iowa's history, and that percentage was at 91.6 percent. In 2017, Iowa  had the highest graduation rate in the entire country, and with this  achievement, we appear ready to do it again.   During my time representing Iowa in the U.S. Senate, I had been in  many of our State's classrooms and have seen firsthand the dedication  of Iowa's educators. I congratulate all of those involved with Iowa  schools on their fantastic work and congratulate them for doing it at  all times, even over the past few months, in particular, because of all  the situations they have run into because of the virus pandemic.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional  material be printed in the Record after my remarks    In recent months, a lot of attention has focused on the  Nation's inspectors general. It seems like a good idea to take a few  minutes now to remember what inspectors general are, why Congress  created them in the first place, and how we got here.   Congress first established offices of inspectors general in 1978 ``to  create independent and objective units'' in the Federal Government to  do three things: conduct audits and investigations; No. 2, promote  efficiency and determine fraud and abuse; and No. 3, keep agency heads  and Congress ``fully informed'' about the problems that IGs find.   In short, Congress designed inspectors general to shine a bright  light on waste, fraud, and abuse throughout the Federal bureaucracy  with the hope that the executive and legislative branches could work  together to do something about those problems.   IGs, then, are the original swamp drainers, and--an equally important  point for those who weren't around at the time it was created--the  support for creating these offices was breathtakingly bipartisan. The  vote in the House of Representatives where I was then a Member was 388  to 6. Now, more than 40 years later, we have 75 offices of inspectors  general working to stop fraud and abuse.   Their actions also save the taxpayers billions of dollars. In 2020 so  far, IGs have identified more than $20 billion of potential savings  through their audits, reports, and recommendations--$20 billion--and  this year is not even half over. On oversight.gov, you can find the  latest figures on these watchdogs' contributions, as well as  investigative and audit reports on every kind of topic you can think  of. IGs have found everything from blatant government employee  misconduct to procurement fraud and, of course, much more. It is all  there in black and white in the public domain for all to see. These  inspectors general are helping Congress watch over the people's  business and ensure the fidelity of agency action.   We in Congress cannot perform our constitutional mandates of  oversight without IGs. The IGs' work makes government more transparent  and more accountable, and that strengthens the public trust in our  democracy. That is a good thing for Congress and a good thing for the  Presidency. In this way, these watchdogs serve an indispensable  function in our system of checks and balances.   What makes a good inspector general? If I learned anything about  oversight, it is that this type of work is not for the faint-hearted or  the thin-skinned or the thick-headed. You need a strong code of  professionalism to withstand pressures to go along to get along. You  need a real backbone to wring wrongdoing from the bowels of  bureaucracy, and you need a quick wit to look on smiling faces and  discern truths from half-truths and bald-faced lies.   The law says IGs are supposed to be objective and independent. They  have to be fierce watchdogs, not lap dogs. They can't bow to personal  agenda or political machinations, and they shouldn't be subject to  inappropriate political pressure from any corner whatsoever.   When IGs are working hard, staying independent, and shining the light  on waste, fraud, and abuse, they should stay. But when they don't put  in the work, when they pull the punches, when they became political  hacks, or when they compromise their vital independence, then IGs must  go.   For many years, I have investigated and held accountable IGs from  both Democratic and Republican administrations for these very failures.  In 2003, I pushed the Health and Human Services IG to resign over  whistleblower complaints about poor staff management. I also  investigated allegations of poor work product, coercive management  decisions, and questionable hiring practices by the watchdog at the  Federal Housing Finance Agency. Just last year, I began pushing hard to  get to the bottom of whistleblower complaints about another apparently  ineffective Commerce IG, although the media at that time didn't seem to  care about that despite bipartisan concerns and briefings from my  staff.    Alternatively, when IGs come under fire for doing good work, this  Senator  [[Page S3089]]  has their backs. In 2009, I shined a light on a sudden departure of the  Amtrak IG, who signed a gag order in exchange for significant payout.   When the Obama administration blocked a broad swath of the IG  community from assessing records needed for oversight, I worked across  the aisle to introduce and finally pass the Inspector General  Empowerment Act in 2016.   In short, I have gone to the mat my whole career to ensure inspectors  general do and are able to accomplish their work with support,  independence, and integrity. And because this work is so critical to  Congress and our oversight role and to the public trust, I have worked  hard to ensure that any effort to remove an IG is for a darn good  reason. That is what Congress required in the IG Reform Act of 2008, a  law that then-Senator Obama not only voted for, but he cosponsored.   That law recognizes two things. First, it is the President's  constitutional prerogative to manage the executive branch personnel.  The President can fire an IG. Second, it is Congress's intent in that  law to support IG independence and maintain public trust. IGs should  not be removed for blatant political reasons. This requires that  Presidents tell Congress and the people their reasons for removal of an  IG.   The IG Reform Act codified those principles by requiring the  President to submit to Congress a notice of intent to remove an IG 30  days in advance and to explain why. The executive branch, under two  successive Presidencies of both political parties, has sought to ignore  the law and keep Congress in the dark. Both Presidents provided  Congress then with paltry excuses of ``lost confidence.''   In July 2009, less than a year after Congress passed the IG Reform  Act, then-President Obama removed the inspector general for the  Corporation for National and Community Service, Gerald Walpin, from his  post and placed him on administrative leave. Obama's White House  informed Congress merely that President Obama had lost confidence in  Mr. Walpin.   My colleagues and I made it very clear that a vague reference to  ``loss of confidence'' was insufficient and did not satisfy the  requirements of the very law that President Obama voted for and  cosponsored when he was a Senator. This began a bout of negotiations  that resulted in the hold of Presidential nominees and, eventually, a  bicameral congressional investigation.   In that case, I pushed for compliance with the statute, held up  nominees to obtain information, and disagreed with the stated reasons  for Mr. Walpin's removal. Mr. Walpin was never reinstated. In Mr.  Walpin's case, a Federal court found later that despite a clear  congressional record to the contrary, the law doesn't require more than  what President Obama gave us in any other greater detail beyond its  ``minimal statutory mandate'' to justify the removal of Mr. Walpin.   Fast forward to the last several months when the current President  followed the court's incorrect ruling and the Obama precedent by  removing two Senate-confirmed IGs, placing them on administrative leave  and telling Congress only, as Obama once did before, that he had lost  confidence in them.   In response, I did exactly what I had done before in the Obama  administration. I, and several colleagues, wrote asking for a better  explanation. When we finally got a response from the White House  Counsel, we were left without substantive reasons for the IG's removal.   So, as before, I notified the majority leader of my intent to object  to the two administrative nominees until the White House coughed up  some form of rationale for the removal. I finally got those reasons  this week. I don't agree with all of them, and I am working to better  understand others, but because the President has finally fulfilled the  law, both Congress and the public can look to see for themselves what  happened.   This, of course, was the intent of the law all along.   We took the long road to get here, and we could have avoided all this  hullabaloo if both Presidents Obama and Trump had just followed the  statutory notice requirements in the first place, but we are here.   These episodes have convinced me that the executive branch,  regardless of what party is in charge, just doesn't get it. From one  administration to the next, Democrat or Republican, it makes no  difference to me. This isn't about politics. This is about the  separation of powers, checks and balances, public trust. It is clear  that Congress can't rely on any White House to get it right.   We need to change the law. We need to be clearer, and we need to  better safeguard the independence of these IGs. That is why I have been  developing bipartisan reforms to sharpen the independent authority and  recruitment of those hired and confirmed to serve as inspectors  general.   We are not going to enact a clearly unconstitutional law that  infringes on the President's authority to manage personnel and that  would surely result in lengthy court battles. But we are going to  clarify once and for all that the law's notice requirement means that  Presidents have to give clear, substantive reasons for removing an IG  and that they can't put an IG on administrative leave without a good  reason.   To fully safeguard statutorily required IG independence, we are also  going to make sure that the President cannot place political appointees  with clear conflicts of interest into acting IG roles. We can't have  individuals with political day jobs simultaneously in charge of  confidential, independent IG matters, including substantive and  sensitive audits, investigative work, and whistleblower information.   Today, I have introduced that legislation with my colleagues Senators  Peters, Collins, Feinstein, Lankford, Carper, Romney, Tester, Portman,  and Hassan. I want to thank Ranking Member Peters for working with me  on this. His input has been insightful in crafting this bipartisan  legislation, and his staff has been diligent in furthering these  efforts.   Whether you have been following the important work of inspectors  general for many years or you just tuned in for the last few, we  welcome your support. I hope that support continues well past the  current administration. If we don't update the law, we can only expect  future administrations to continue to do what has been done lately, not  giving Congress good reasons   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                 The White House,                                          Washington, June 12, 2020.      Hon. Charles E. Grassley,      Chairman, Committee on Finance,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grassley: I write to follow up on our recent       conversation regarding the removal of the Inspectors General       of the Department of State and of the Intelligence Community.       As a further accommodation, we are providing the additional       information you requested.        With respect to the State Department Inspector General,       please see the attached letter sent to you today from the       Department's Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs. The       letter includes materials that identify the concerns of the       Secretary of State and the Under Secretary for Management       with the Inspector General's performance. As to the removal       of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, the       President lost confidence in him and has spoken publicly       about this loss of confidence, including on the day after the       President notified Congress of his decision.        As you have stated, the President has the constitutional       authority to remove inspectors general. As a matter of       accommodation and presidential prerogative, the President       complied fully with the statutory notification provision of       the Inspector General Act.        As I said in my previous letter, the President appreciates       and respects your longstanding support for the role that       inspectors general play. We look forward to the Senate's       swift confirmation of all of the President's outstanding       inspector general nominees.            Sincerely,                                                  Pat A. Cipollone,      Counsel to the President.                                   ____         The following excerpt from an official White House       transcript entitled ``Remarks by President Trump, Vice       President Pence, and members of the Coronavirus Task Force in       Press Briefing.'' The briefing was held on April 4, 2020 in       the James S. Brady Press Room of the White House at 4:15 p.m.       EDT.        The full transcript can be found at: https:// www.grassley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2020-0906- 12%20White%20House%20Counsel%      20 to%20Grassley%20-%20 IC%20IG%20and%      20 State%20IG.pdf         THE PRESIDENT: Think of it: We're paying people not to go       to work. How about that? How does that play?        Q: I understand that.        THE PRESIDENT: And they want to go to work, by the way.       They don't even want--they don't want money. This country is  [[Page S3090]]       great. But we're paying people. We have to get back to work.       That's what I'm saying.        Go ahead, please.        Q: Mr. President, this is off topic. It's about the       announcement from last night. It's a yes or no question, but       not that we expect the answer to be yes or no.        But wasn't Michael Atkinson doing the job of the Inspector       General of the intelligence community, the job he was       supposed to do, when he simply took the whistleblower       complaint to Congress that hadn't been taken previously?       Wasn't he doing the job that he was supposed to do, that       American taxpayers were paying him to do? And why did you       decide to terminate--        THE PRESIDENT: I thought he did a terrible job. Absolutely       terrible. He took a whistleblower report, which turned out to       be a fake report--it was fake. It was totally wrong. It was       about my conversation with the President of Ukraine. He took       a fake report and he brought it to Congress, with an       emergency. Okay? Not a big Trump fan--that, I can tell you.        Instead of saying--and we offered this to him: ``No, no, we       will take the conversation''--where, fortunately, we had that       transcript. If we didn't have a transcript with the kind of       deception and dishonesty that were practiced by the       Democrats, I might not be standing here right now. Okay?       Fortunately, we had a transcript and it was a perfect       transcript, because even the lieutenant colonel admitted it       was correct. Okay?        Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You asked a question.        So he took this whistleblower--and I keep saying, ``Where's       the whistleblower?'' Right? ``And why was the whistleblower       allowed to do this?'' Why was he allowed to be--you call it       fraudulent or incorrect transcript.        So we offered this IG--I don't know him; I don't think I       ever met him. I don't think I--he never even came in to see       me. How can you do that without seeing the person? Never came       in to see me. Never requested to see me. He took this       terrible, inaccurate whistleblower report--right?--and he       brought it to Congress.        We offered to have him see my exact conversation. It was       all about the conversation, by the way. That was the whole       thing, was about the conversation. Right? And then after he       saw it, he must've said, ``Wow,'' because as I've said it       many times and it drives you people crazy, it was a perfect       conversation.        So instead of going and saying, ``Gee, this is a terrible       thing he said about the President's conversation''--well, it       was a fraud. I didn't say that. And, by the way, you have the       whistleblower. Where's the informer? Right?        And here's another question: Remember before I did the--      before I gave the transcript--in other words, before I       revealed the real conversation--where's the second       whistleblower? Remember the second whistle--        Wait, wait, wait, wait. There was going to be a second       whistleblower. But after I gave the conversation, he just       went away. He miraculously went away.        Where's the informer? Because there was going to be this       informer. Maybe Schiff was the informer. You ever think of       that? He's a corrupt guy. He's a corrupt politician.        So, listen, I say this: Where's the informer? Remember, the       informer was coming forward. But I gave--because, see, I did       one thing that surprised everybody. This gentleman right here       said, ``Boy, that was a shocker.'' I revealed the       conversation. I got approval from Ukraine because I didn't       want to do it without their approval. And they said,       ``Absolutely. You did nothing wrong.''        By the way, President of Ukraine, Foreign Minister said,       ``He did nothing wrong.'' And over that, with 196 to nothing       vote by the Republicans--not one dissenting Republican vote--      dishonest Democrats impeached a President of the United       States. That man is a disgrace to IGs.        All right, let's go. Next. Please. He's a total disgrace.        Q: Mr. President, did you run by your decision to dismiss       the Inspector General by Senator McConnell?        THE PRESIDENT: Okay, we'll get off this because people want       to talk about what we're talking about. But let me just tell       you something: That's my decision. I have the absolute right.       Even the fake news last night said, ``He has the absolute       right to do it.''        But ask him, ``Why didn't you go and see the actual       conversation?'' There was no rush. He said, ``Oh we'd have to       rush it.'' He even said it was politically biased. He       actually said that. The report could have been--you know who       the whistleblower is, and so do you and so does everybody in       this room, and so do I. Everybody knows. But they give this       whistleblower a status that he doesn't deserve. He's a fake       whistleblower. And, frankly, somebody ought to sue his ass       off.        Q: I just want to follow up, sir.        THE PRESIDENT: All right, it's enough with the       whistleblower.        Go ahead, please.        Q: Mr. President, the governor of New York today said that       he is still desperate for ventilators and that he has       accepted 1,000 of them from the Chinese government. Are you       concerned that states--        THE PRESIDENT: Well, what he didn't say is--okay, let me       tell you what he didn't say.        Two very good friends of mine brought him those       whistleblower--brought him those ventilators, right? Two very       good friends of mine--they brought them. If you'd like their       name, I'll give you their name.        Q: But should states and cities have to rely on--        THE PRESIDENT: No, but he--the governor didn't--        Q: --China and Russia for supplies?        THE PRESIDENT: --mention that. It came through the       Chinese--the country of China. But they were given by two       friends of mine, but he didn't tell you that.        Now, the governor also--        Q Who are your friends?        THE PRESIDENT: You'll see when you read the letter.        The governor also asked for 40,000--40,000. He wanted       40,000 ventilators.        Now, the governor, as you know, had a chance to get 16,000       a few years ago. He decided not to get that. The State of New       York has asked for help. I've given him four hospitals, four       medical centers. Then I gave him an additional hospital. Then       I gave him military people to operate the hospital. They were       not supposed to be COVID hospitals. The boat--the ship is       not--an interesting thing happened with the ship. People       aren't in accidents because there's nobody driving. There's       nobody taking motorcycle rides down the West Side Highway at       100 miles an hour. People are away. So people aren't being       injured.        Now they're asking whether or not we could open up the ship       for COVID. We have given the governor of New York more than       anybody has ever been given in a long time. I'll just say--I       was going to say ``in history,'' but in a long time. And I       think he's happy.        But I think that--because I watched what he said today, and       it was fine. I wouldn't say gracious. It wasn't gracious. It       was okay. I must tell you, Gavin Newsom has been gracious--      Los Angeles, California, the job we've done, and all of       California.        Q: But why does that matter if they're gracious or not       gracious if they need the supplies?        THE PRESIDENT: It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. But I       think when we've given as much as we've given to New York,       somebody should say--        Nice--I'll tell you who's been very nice: Mayor de Blasio       has been very nice. He understands what we've given him. We       brought him some more ventilators, too, yesterday.        But nobody has been given like New York. And I think--I       know he appreciates it. He just can't quite get the words       out, but that's okay.        Q: So when he says--but when he says that he needs 40,000--        Q: Mr. President--        THE PRESIDENT: Please, go ahead.    Mr. President, in 3 weeks, America will celebrate  Independence Day. For 244 years, Americans have fought, marched, voted,  petitioned, legislated, published, protested, and died to defend and  build our blessings of freedom. The American experiment has plenty of  battle scars and growing pains handed down from one generation to the  next.   The first half of 2020 shows us there are plenty of historical wounds  to heal and challenges to overcome.   In the interest of public health, stay-at-home orders limited  individual freedoms that many Americans take for granted, including the  right to earn a living or to worship with fellow believers.   Just as the economy began to reopen, the shadows of racial injustice  darkened America's doorstep. All people are created equal, but not all  people are treated equally.   The unconscionable suffocation of George Floyd at the knee of a  police officer in Minneapolis struck a chord of unity to end racism in  America. Hundreds of thousands of people have gathered to exercise  their First Amendment rights. They march to protect racial injustice  and police brutality.   Unfortunately, some exploited the peaceful protests to riot, loot,  vandalize, and burn. These criminal acts were not protected by the  Constitution. It is obvious they weren't protected. They were  antithetical to the laws of the land protecting life, liberty, and  domestic tranquility.   All of this led one of my colleagues, the junior Senator from  Arkansas, to submit an essay to the New York Times. In his opinion  piece, he advocated why he thought the President ought to use his  authority to deploy Active-Duty military forces to uphold the law and  public order, as had been done by Presidents in past instances of civil  unrest.   The Times op-ed pages accepted his column and published it online  under the headline: ``Bring in the Troops.''   Within hours, the newsroom was in a frenzy. The leftwing rallied  their troops to stop the press. The New York Times, as we know, prides  itself as the ``paper of record.''   Since 1851, it has served as an influential platform to gather and  report the news and to hold government accountable. Policemen keep the  public peace. Journalists are the policemen of  [[Page S3091]]  our political system to keep the political system honest and open and  transparent.   The New York Times opinion pages ostensibly provide a space for the  free exchange of ideas and thought-filled conversation on issues of the  day. I have long counted journalists as the constables of the fourth  estate. They serve a very vital role in bolstering our system of checks  and balances. They have a responsibility to set the tone for open  dialogue.   Last week, the New York Times flunked this standard. The Gray Lady  ghosted Senator Cotton's opinion piece after a meltdown in its ivory  tower and when the ivory tower workforce hyperventilated.   It is certainly reasonable to disagree on the merits and to debate if  recent events rise to the level of past riots that justified invoking  the Insurrection Act.   I certainly think we should be hesitant to deploy our military forces  domestically, even in difficult situations.   But the overheated reaction by alleged journalists even to have this  debate raises the question, Do they consider themselves neutral  reporters or activists for a certain world view?   Even a casual reader is able to read between the lines and know that  the New York Times ascribes to a left-leaning ideology, but the mutiny  in their newsroom seems to cross the line from journalism with a  leftwing bias to political activism and ideological conformity.   Sadly, last week the New York Times lowered the bar of journalistic  integrity. It snubbed a voice of dissent and rebuked the free exchange  of ideas.   The First Amendment protects five fundamental freedoms that sets  America apart as the leader of the free world: freedom of religion,  speech, press, assembly, and the right to petition the government.   The Constitution does so because the expression of diverse opinions  is necessary to preserve liberty.   Within 4 days of publishing Senator Cotton's commentary, the New York  Times caved to an ideological revolt in the newsroom.   Under mob rule, the casualty among its ranks was none other than the  editorial page editor. He was forced out of his job for having the  audacity to publish an opinion of a U.S. Senator.   At first, the publisher made a feeble effort to stand on principle,  defending, in his words, ``openness and a range of opinions.'' Within a  few days, the publisher threw James Bennet under the bus.   It is a sad day for journalism, a sad day for the free press. These  actions damage the wall dividing the newsroom and the opinion desk.  They solidified their silo of leftwing thought. Canceling dissenting  views is a very slippery slope. Sooner or later, it mutes the exchange  of ideas in a free society.   As a student of history, I know that freedom has often been  threatened by those who are convinced their views were on the right  side of history.   I offer a bit of wisdom without malice to the New York Times: Don't  back down from the First Amendment. Swapping your free press for party- line propaganda and punishing dissent is not a good look. Ask the  people of North Korea, China, and Iran.   On Independence Day 2020, I encourage members of the media and all  Americans to step out of your comfort zones and seek to understand  other viewpoints.   Before we can expand America's promise, end racism, and beat the  virus, we must come together as Americans. No matter one's race,  politic, creed, wealth, celebrity, remember, we are bound together by  self-evident truths ``that all men are created equal, that they are  endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among  these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.''   I want even a leftwing newspaper to be a responsible policeman for  our political system.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I previously notified the Chamber of my  objection to the nominations of Marshall Billingslea, of Virginia, to  be Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security  and Christopher C. Miller, of Virginia, to be Director of the National  Counterterrorism Center, Office of the Director of National  Intelligence. On June 12, 2020, I received two letters: one from the  Department of State, which contained a copy of recent correspondence  between the administration to the Council of the Inspectors General on  Integrity and Efficiency, CIGIE, requesting that CIGIE investigate  specific allegations into the conduct of the State Department Inspector  General, State IG, Steve Linick, and another separate letter from the  White House Counsel concerning the removal of Intelligence Community  Inspector General, IC IG, Michael Atkinson. Without making comment  regarding the veracity of the allegations made against Mr. Linick, I  believe that these letters fulfill the President's requirement to  provide Congress reasons for the removal of the IC IG and the State IG,  as required by the Inspector General Reform Act. It is for this reason  that I withdraw my objection to both Mr. Billingslea and Mr. Miller.   The letter from the White House Counsel regarding the removal of the  IC IG repeats a previous letter from the White House which stated that  the President had lost confidence in the IC IG. However, the White  House Counsel enclosed with that letter a transcript of President Trump  providing his reasons for removing Mr. Atkinson to the press and has  informed me that those reasons represent the President's official  explanation of Mr. Atkinson's removal to Congress. I believe that this  transcript and its transmittal to Congress has fulfilled the statutory  notice requirement of the Inspector General Reform Act. It is for this  reason that I withdraw my objection to Mr. Miller.   Here follow my comments to the President, including my actions and  rationale: although the Constitution gives the President the authority  to manage executive branch personnel, Congress has made it clear by law  that should the President fire an inspector general, there ought to be  a good reason for it. No such reason was provided when the President  informed Congress of the removal of Mr. Atkinson on April 3, 2020.  Thus, in a bipartisan letter on April 8, 2020, my colleagues and I  reminded the President of his requirement under the statute to provide  reasons for removing an IG. On May 15, 2020, the President notified  Congress of his intent to remove Mr. Linick. This notification also  lacked reasons for the removal spurring my solo letter on May 18, 2020,  again reminding the President of his requirement to provide reasons.   After a delay, and a personal call with the White House Counsel, I  was promised a response to my letters that would fulfill the statutory  notice requirement. On May 26, 2020, I received a response from the  White House Counsel explaining the President's Constitutional removal  authority, which I never questioned. However, the letter still  contained no reason for the removals as required by law. This failure  to comply with the statute prompted my objection to both Mr. Miller and  Mr. Billingslea on June 4, 2020.   On June 6, 2020, I asked the White House to provide written reasons  for the removals. We discussed several issues. I took this opportunity  to talk to the White House and I told them that I needed reasons for  the firing of IGs to be submitted in writing.   On June 12, 2020, I received the enclosed letter from the State  Department which finally fulfills the executive branch's legal  requirement to provide Congress reasons for an IG's removal with regard  to Mr. Linick.   Here is my view on the firing of Mr. Linick. The State Department's  correspondence with CIGIE provided four reasons for Mr. Linick's  removal, all involving the investigation of the leak of information to  a news reporter pertaining to an IG report, which the reporter claims  to be based on information garnered from ``two government sources  involved in carrying out the investigation. The letter to CIGIE  requests that they begin an investigation into Mr. Linick's alleged  transgressions, including his: 1) ``failure to formally refer to CIGIE  . . . the investigation of [the] leak''; 2) ``hand selection'' of the  Department of Defense OIG to conduct the leak investigation; 3) ``non- compliance with State Department Office of Inspector General (OIG)  email policies''; and 4) refusal to supply Department of State  leadership with a copy or summary of the leak investigation report  despite ``repeated requests'' from State Department leadership. These  claims are as of yet unverified but the President has offered an  additional briefing on the matter from State Department officials. I am  in the process of scheduling  [[Page S3098]]  such a briefing and reviewing the additional relevant information.   After reviewing the provided rationale, I have several concerns.  Chief among them is that CIGIE does not traditionally conduct  investigations into agency or OIG leaks. It reviews allegations against  individuals but not IG offices and generally lacks the funds and  resources to conduct work outside of their narrow scope. As a matter of  course however, IGs do traditionally check each other's work, and CIGIE  often suggests that allegations against IGs or their offices be  referred to peer IGs. This is done when crucial IG independence must be  maintained but the appearance of conflicts of interest may arise. It  would also not be uncharacteristic for an IG to safeguard the office's  statutorily required independence by potentially refusing to provide  internal information to its parent agency. In short, although it would  make little sense for CIGIE to conduct the leak investigation in the  manner desired by the State Department, it would not be outside the  bounds of precedent for one office of inspector general to conduct an  investigation into another.   Although I have not yet had the opportunity to verify the allegations  regarding Mr. Linick, as I noted earlier, the President retains the  constitutional authority to manage executive branch personnel. My  objection to these nominees was designed to prompt compliance with the  IG Reform Act, which the President has now done with regards to Mr.  Linick. Therefore, I am withdrawing my objection to Mr. Billingslea.   On June 12, 2020, I received the enclosed letter from the White House  Counsel which finally fulfills the executive branch's legal requirement  to provide Congress reasons for an IG's removal with regard to Mr.  Atkinson.   As it pertains to Mr. Atkinson: Even though the President satisfied  the requirements of the law, I do not agree that the provided reasons  merited Mr. Atkinson's removal. In the provided transcript the  President states, ``I thought [ Atkinson] did a terrible job.  Absolutely terrible . . . But ask him, `Why didn't you go and see the  [transcript of my phone call with the Ukrainian president]?' There was  no rush. [Atkinson] said, `Oh we'd have to rush it.' '' I infer from  this statement that the reason(s) that the President removed Mr.  Atkinson was because of the speed with which he sought to bring the  whistleblower information to Congress and/or his role generally in the  impeachment process.   With respect to this objection concerning Mr. Atkinson's supposed  haste, it is necessary to review the IC IG's responsibility under the  Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010. The act provides  the IC IG only 14 days to determine if an ``urgent concern'' ``appears  credible'' and transmit that information to the Office of the Director  of National Intelligence, ODNI. Notably, the law also does not require  that a full investigation of a whistle blower's allegations be  completed before the information is provided to Congress. Reading such  a requirement into the law could result in critical and relevant  information not reaching the ODNI or Congress in a timely manner, and  could pose a chilling effect on whistleblowers' willingness to report  urgent concerns and other issues of waste, fraud, and abuse in the  intelligence community. That being said, I understand and appreciate  the President's irritation with this IG's action being a factor in the  House of Representative's impeachment.   In those remarks, the President also said that ``they give this  whistleblower a status that he doesn't deserve . . . . And, frankly,  somebody ought to sue [him].'' To the extent that the President is  referring to Mr. Atkinson's determination that the whistleblower  allegation at issue amounted to an urgent concern under the law, there  remains a significant difference of legal opinion on this matter. The  President's position is supported by the Department of Justice Office  of Legal Counsel, and Presidents routinely follow the legal  determinations of that office. However, whether or not the  whistleblower's allegation meets the legal definition of an ``urgent  concern'' under the law, I obviously do not agree that person should be  sued or otherwise retaliated against.   My objection to these nominees was designed to prompt compliance with  the IG Reform Act, which the President has now done with regards to Mr.  Atkinson. Therefore, I am withdrawing my objection to Mr. Miller.   Although some may want to believe that this is a new issue unique to  this administration, it certainly is not. In July of 2009, then  President Obama removed the Corporation for National and Community  Service--CNCS--Inspector General, Gerald Walpin, from his post in a  very similar manner and also did not provide reasons for removal. This  began a bout of negotiations that resulted in not only the hold of  several Presidential nominees but also a bicameral congressional  investigation into the matter. In that case, I similarly pushed for  compliance with the statute, held up a nominee to obtain information,  and disagreed with the stated reasons for Mr. Walpin's removal. In the  end, Mr. Walpin was never reinstated.   Given the misinterpretation of the statute by successive  administrations from both political parties, it is apparent that  Congress must clarify the statute to ensure inspectors general are able  to continue operating without undue interference. So I am introducing a  bipartisan bill today to accomplish just that.   (At the request of Mr. Durbin, the following statement was ordered to  be printed in the Record.)
