 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as we approach the 1-year  anniversary of the heroism of Benjamin Steidinger, of Germansville,  Pennsylvania.   When Benjamin saw smoke coming from a house across his street, he  didn't just call 911. He climbed up a ladder to the second story,  knocked out a window, and crawled across the floor, where he rescued  two women, a baby, and a dog from the smoke and flames.   Benjamin thought he might not make it out of that house alive, but he  put his life at risk in sacrifice for others. He is among the best of  us.   Today, I commend Benjamin for representing and living out the values  of our community: grit, determination, and courage in the face of  immense challenges.   On behalf of Pennsylvania's Seventh District, we thank Benjamin for  his courage.                            ____________________
