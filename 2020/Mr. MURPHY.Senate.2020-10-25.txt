 Madam President, first, let me thank the Presiding  Officer, the staff on the floor, and the staff in both caucus rooms,  for putting up with a very, very late night to take the floor just past  3:30 in the morning. I thank my friend Senator Schatz for picking up  about an hour and a half, from 2 until 3:30, and I know that Senator  Kaine will be joining the floor shortly.   This is an exceptional night because we are living in exceptional  times. We are likely to see tomorrow a record number of COVID cases  diagnosed in this country. I know that it now feels like the new normal  7, 8 months into this pandemic, but this is unthinkable that our  country has been ravaged by a virus that less than a year ago no one  had ever heard of.   Sometime in November or December of last year, COVID-19 started  popping onto the international public health radar screen in China, and  a few months later, it was here in the United States. Most countries  were able to come up with a plan to control, contain, or essentially  eliminate the threat of COVID-19 in a matter of months. The United  States was not, because of an abysmal failure by this administration.   We are now living with a third wave of COVID. As we speak on the  floor tonight, we are looking down the barrel of 300,000 Americans dead  by the end of this year. No one is safe. There are millions of kids who  can't go back to school, businesses that have gone under, and 10  percent of our workforce that is out of work.   This is an exceptional night because we are living in an exceptional  moment, and I will talk over the course of my remarks about the  President's failure to meet the moment and to be able to rescue this  country from this pandemic--in fact, his daily actions now to actively  spread the disease. There is no one who is doing more to spread COVID- 19 across the country today than the President of the United States,  who is holding daily superspreader events, who is shaming individuals  who wear masks, and who is deliberately trying to reduce the number of  tests that are done in this country.   I also want to acknowledge that the vote that we have pending, ready  for action tomorrow, is directly connected to the question as to  whether this country is going to be able to turn the corner on COVID,  because the first case Amy Coney Barrett will likely hear after she is  confirmed by this body, as it looks like will happen tomorrow, will be  a case on the Affordable Care Act--a case that asks the Supreme Court  to invalidate the entirety of the ACA.   It draws issue with one specific provision in the ACA, but the remedy  it seeks--the remedy the President of the United States is asking for-- is the complete invalidation of the Affordable Care Act. That is 23  million people losing healthcare. That is 130 million people all across  this country who have preexisting conditions potentially losing  protections that, under the ACA, prohibit insurance companies from  charging them more.   I have heard my Republican colleagues come down to this floor and go  on television and give press conferences in which they suggest that  those of us who say the Affordable Care Act is about to be struck down  due to the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett are engaging in hyperbole,  that we are exaggerating. Well, I have been in the Congress for the  last 10 years, the House and the Senate. My eyes haven't been closed. I  have watched an unrelenting campaign from the Republicans to try to  repeal the Affordable Care Act.   When I was in the House of Representatives, the call from the  Republicans was to repeal and replace. The Presiding Officer will  remember this because I think we served together during that period of  time. The idea was, of course, that the Republicans didn't like the  Affordable Care Act, but they acknowledged that they couldn't get rid  of it with nothing else to replace it. Now, that in and of itself was  an acknowledgment of the merits of the Affordable Care Act. The  Republicans may not have liked the details, but given the fact that  they were not supporting repealing it but supporting repealing it and  replacing it with something else, they knew the American public would  not allow for the Affordable Care Act to disappear and have nothing  else to stand in its place.   We waited month after month and year after year for a replacement  plan to be offered by the Republicans. We waited month after month and  year after year. That replacement plan never arrived. The closest we  came to seeing a replacement plan was in the summer of 2017. As we were  debating its repeal here in the Senate shortly after the election of  Donald Trump, Speaker Ryan, then still in charge of the House of  Representatives, presented a replacement.   The problem is the replacement was worse than simple repeal. The  Affordable Care Act covers around 23 million individuals, and the  Congressional Budget Office said that Speaker Ryan's replacement plan  would have resulted in 24 million people losing healthcare, going  backward from the status quo ante.   Seventy different times Republicans, either in the House or the  Senate, tried to repeal all or part of the Affordable Care Act. You may  say: Well, that sounds unfair. It is not fair to create an equivalency  between efforts to repeal all of the Affordable Care Act and efforts to  repeal just some of the Affordable Care Act.   OK, on 31 different occasions, Republicans tried to repeal the  entirety of the Affordable Care Act--31 times, which is a lot--with no  replacement that would have covered everyone that receives coverage  under the Affordable Care Act, with no meaningful effort to protect  those who have preexisting conditions.   My eyes were open to that. My constituents were watching all of that.  We saw how Republicans, 31 times, tried to repeal the Affordable Care  Act.   I have listened to Republicans out on the campaign trail. I have  watched what Republicans have said to the press and to their  constituents. We are not blind. We know that Republicans, for 10 years,  have been trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. We know that for 10  years Republicans have not had a replacement that would insure anywhere  close to the number of people insured by the Affordable Care Act or  [[Page S6522]]  provide protections to people with preexisting conditions.   So don't tell us that we are overhyping this desire by Republicans to  take steps in this body that would lead to the repeal of the Affordable  Care Act because that is the lion's share of what Republicans have been  doing for the last 10 years.   In the summer of 2017, Republicans mounted their last stand to get  rid of the Affordable Care Act. They had control of the House, the  Senate, and the Presidency. This was the moment to do it.   In fact, most of us expected that it was a foregone conclusion,  having told the American public in the runup to 2016 that, If you elect  us, we will repeal the Affordable Care Act, and having won the House  and the Senate and the Presidency, despite, by the way, getting less  votes than Democratic candidates for the Senate and the House and their  President having gotten less votes than the Democratic candidate for  President, by virtue of the way in which we select representatives  through gerrymandered districts, through the way in which States with  smaller populations have greater representation in the Senate and  through the mechanism of the electoral college. Despite getting less  votes than Democrats all across the country in 2016, Republicans did  take control of the House, the Senate, and the Presidency. And those  are the rules. Those are the rules. Republicans played by the rules in  running for office in 2016. I am not begrudging the fact that they did  in fact win control of all three lawmaking chambers of U.S. democracy-- the Presidency, the House, and the Senate. It was to be expected that  Republicans would repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017.   But, curiously, they could not, and the reason they could not is  pretty simple. Democracy took hold. The people of this country didn't  allow this Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They rose up in  record numbers. Thousands of people turned out to townhalls all across  the country. The phone lines here were lit up. There were protests that  spring and summer outside this building on a near daily basis. It was  100 percent clear that if Republicans voted to repeal the Affordable  Care Act and replaced it with nothing or made our healthcare system  worse, as Speaker Ryan's plan would have done, there was going to be  hell to pay from the American electorate.   Now, it turned out that there was, anyway, because Americans watched  the attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and were just slightly  less infuriated than they would have been if repeal had actually gone  forward.   But repeal failed. On this floor, late one night in the summer of  2017, the bill went down, and Republicans at that point had figured it  out. Having tried 31 times--70 times, whatever your number is--to  repeal all or part of the Affordable Care Act, Republicans figured out  that they weren't going to be able to get it done through Congress,  that the American people weren't going to let them.   So they decided to try another way. Later that year, the Republican  tax bill passed the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives and  was signed into law by the President of the United States, and inside  that tax bill was a curious provision, a provision that eliminated the  tax penalty for individuals who don't have insurance. That was a really  important part of the Affordable Care Act, not a super popular part of  the Affordable Care Act. Nobody likes putting a financial penalty on  individuals who don't have insurance, but it was really critical to  protecting people with preexisting conditions.   I won't go into the details of it, but I actually sat in the  Presiding Officer's chair during Senator Cruz's filibuster overnight,  on a late night like this one. I was probably presiding as a freshman  Member of the Senate at about this hour, and in that filibuster--I  wouldn't recommend going back and looking at it on tape, but you  could--you would listen to Senator Cruz explain that, in fact, the  individual mandate and the tax penalty are critical to protecting  people with preexisting conditions. Because if you don't require people  to get insurance but you also require insurance companies to rate folks  who are really sick the same as they rate healthy patients, the whole  insurance system falls apart. Because if you aren't required to get  insurance but you are not penalized if you wait to get insurance until  you are really sick, then that is exactly what you will do. You won't  get insurance until you are really sick. You won't have to pay any more  once you have that expensive cancer diagnosis, for instance. Then,  without any healthy people buying into the system and with only sick  people part of our insurance pools, the insurance system collapses.   So Republicans went into this 2017 tax bill, and they removed the  provision that would provide a financial penalty. But it really wasn't  actually that curious. It wasn't that difficult to figure out why they  were doing that.   Republicans were doing that because, a few years before, the Supreme  Court had ruled that the Affordable Care Act was constitutional because  of the existence of that tax penalty. It was an interesting decision,  one that I disagree with, but Justice Roberts ruled for five of nine  members that the Affordable Care Act could stand as constitutional  because of the existence of that tax provision.   So you didn't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out why  Republicans had inserted this provision into the tax bill--because they  believed that they had a new route, a new pathway, to invalidate the  entirety of the Affordable Care Act.   Now, having failed to be able to get the elected branch of government  to undo the Affordable Care Act, they could essentially plant a  constitutional landmine in the Affordable Care Act and attempt to get  it invalidated through the courts.   Now, again, let me tell you, I don't agree with the Supreme Court  decision--I think it was in 2012--that suggested the Affordable Care  Act would be invalid if you removed this tax penalty. But that decision  stands, the NFIB decision, and Republicans figured out that they could  sabotage the Affordable Care Act and run a case through the court  system that would end up getting done what they had been trying to do  for 10 years--take insurance from 23 million people and the preexisting  conditions protection.   And that is exactly what they did. That is exactly what Republicans  did. Twenty Republican attorneys general, joined by a whole host of  conservative political organizations, launched a court case claiming  that because of the change made in the 2017 tax bill, the Affordable  Care Act was now, all of a sudden, unconstitutional. It had to be  struck down.    The case went before the district court, and a Republican-appointed  judge ruled in favor of the Republican attorneys general. The case then  went to the circuit court, and in a 2-to-1 decision, with a Trump- appointed, Senate-confirmed judge making the difference, they ruled in  favor of the plaintiffs, and now that case sits before the Supreme  Court, and it is to be heard by the Supreme Court in 2 weeks--in 2  weeks.   So now you might be starting to figure out why we are here. Why are  we rushing through Amy Coney Barrett's nomination in record time? You  never had a Supreme Court Justice confirmed this close to the election.  In my political lifetime, I have never seen a Supreme Court Justice  rushed through in this amount of time.   We have been here all weekend. It is 3:30 in the morning. We took a  vote on Saturday. It is now becoming apparent why we are rushing this  through.   It is probably partially because Republicans are worried they are  going to lose their Senate majority in this election and the President  is going to lose, and it will be much harder to push through a nominee  in a lameduck session. It is probably because there are potentially  cases to come before the Supreme Court regarding this election, and  this President wants to make sure he has as many of his nominees  stocked on the bench as possible if there are any questions that arise  before the Court regarding the validity of the election.   But I think mostly the reason that we are here, rushing through Amy  Coney Barrett's nomination, in the dead of night, in record time, 1  week before an election, is because the Affordable Care Act case is up  before the Supreme Court in 2 weeks, and it is likely--in fact, almost  certain--that without Amy Coney Barrett on the  [[Page S6523]]  Court, that case brought by Donald Trump and Republicans across the  country will not succeed, and that only by rushing through Amy Coney  Barrett's nomination 2 weeks before this case is to be heard by the  Supreme Court can Republicans finally get done what they have been  trying to do for 10 years--repeal the Affordable Care Act and end  insurance for 23 million Americans and strip away protections for  everybody who has a preexisting condition.   Now, I know my Republican friends get really angry when they hear us  suggest that their goal is to end insurance for 23 million Americans or  to strip protections away from people with preexisting conditions, and  they will stand up here and say: No, of course, that is not what we  want to do. We are going to protect people with preexisting conditions.  We will find a way to insure all those people.   And I truly do believe that my Republican colleagues do, in a perfect  world, want people with preexisting conditions to be covered. The  problem is they have worked themselves into a trap that they can't get  out of and that they know they can't get out of.   They say they want to cover people with preexisting conditions, but  they have never been able to put on the table a plan that would do  that. They have made this promise that they will repeal the Affordable  Care Act, and they have put themselves on this path that they can't get  off of to repeal the Affordable Care Act through legislation or through  the court system, such that, even though they say they want to protect  people with preexisting conditions, they are acting in a way that does  the opposite.   So you have to forgive us when we say that you want to strip  protections for people with preexisting conditions. Because despite the  fact that you say you don't want to do it, everything you are doing  ends up in that result. So at some point, we have to watch what you do,  not what you say.   Your President had the chance to go to court. Well, first of all,  your President didn't have to go to court at all on behalf of the  plaintiffs. In fact, 99 percent of the time, a President will defend  the statute that is being attacked, even if that President doesn't  agree with the statute. That is generally seen as the responsibility of  the executive branch, to defend the statutes of the United States,  whether or not you agree with them. That doesn't happen in every case,  but that is generally how it works.   In this case, not surprisingly, the President went to court and said:  I am going to join with the plaintiffs. I am going to ask for the court  to invalidate the Affordable Care Act.   But President Trump could have asked for only part of the act to be  invalidated. He could have asked for the part of the act that protects  people with preexisting conditions to remain, but he didn't, and,  frankly, Republicans in this Chamber didn't pressure him to do so.   Republicans here could have begged the President, privately or  publicly, to go to the court and ask for the portions of the act that  protect people with preexisting conditions to remain, but the President  didn't do that. He sent his lawyers to court. His lawyers will be in  Court in 2 weeks arguing that the entire Affordable Care Act be struck  down--the whole thing.   So let me say it again. Don't blame us for watching what you do,  rather than what you say. Republicans say they want to protect people  with preexisting conditions, but then everything they do and everything  this President does seeks to destroy those protections.   That is why we are here. We are here because Republicans have gotten  themselves on this train that they cannot stop--this effort that has  been underway for a decade to strip away the Affordable Care Act  protections. Two weeks from now, the Republicans will get a little bit  closer to what they have been asking for, for 10 years, when this case  comes before the Supreme Court and Amy Coney Barrett sits on it as the  deciding fifth vote to invalidate the Affordable Care Act.   And why this matters more now and why I led my remarks referencing  the COVID epidemic is because it is unthinkable in ordinary times for  23 million people to lose health insurance or for folks that have a  history of heart disease to all of a sudden not be able to buy  insurance.   In my State, that is about 260,000 people who get their insurance  through the Affordable Care Act who would lose it. We are a small  State, about 3.5 million. A quarter million people losing healthcare  insurance in our State--that is a humanitarian catastrophe at any time,  but in the middle of a pandemic, that is a nightmarish, cataclysmic  dystopian future to wish for. In the middle of a pandemic, to take  health insurance away from 23 million people, to go back to the days in  which insurance companies could discriminate against you because you  had a preexisting condition?   COVID is going to be a preexisting condition. Let me just level with  you. There are 8 million people in this country who know that they have  had COVID. But, eventually, if people start taking antibody tests,  there will be five times that many who have a medical history that  includes COVID. All those people will have a preexisting condition, and  insurance companies, if the Affordable Care Act disappears, can either  decide to not insure those individuals or can jack up their rates. That  is on top of the 130 million people who have other preexisting  conditions.   So think about both of those things happening. Think about, in the  middle of a pandemic, when there are over 1,000 people dying every day  in this country, where we are seeing reports of hospitals literally  being filled to total capacity in parts of our country, for over 20  million Americans to all of a sudden not have the ability to pay for  healthcare.   We are in the middle of a pandemic, but we are also in the middle of  a giant depression; right? I mean, 10 percent of America is out of  work. Guess how those individuals get health insurance when they are  out of work--through the Affordable Care Act. People that lose their  job, many of them get insurance through the Affordable Care Act. They  qualify for the Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care Act, or they  end up buying insurance through these exchanges.    I have story after story from my constituents in Connecticut of  people who lost their jobs in the middle of a pandemic and were able to  get health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act.   It is not just that you have all these sick people who are going to  lose insurance when the Affordable Care Act is repealed but also all  these folks who are out of work and have no other way to get insurance  at an affordable rate other than the Affordable Care Act. Stripping it  away in the middle of a pandemic is just inhumane. On top of that are  all of the people who will have COVID as a preexisting condition.   Wayne lives in Rocky Hill, CT. Rocky Hill is a small town south of  Hartford. I wish his story were exceptional, but you have all heard  these stories, my Republican and Democratic friends:         Thank you for your continued support of the Affordable Care       Act. Our family has extensive medical needs, and we rely on       the preexisting conditions and no lifetime cap coverage       provisions that the ACA provides. Both of our sons have       serious health issues. Harrison is developmentally impaired.       Has a rare genetic disorder, cerebral palsy, hearing loss,       and a rare form of intractable Epilepsy, characterized by       multiple, uncontrolled daily seizures.    Imagine having a son like that.         Jacob, who just turned 15, has Hemophilia A with an       Inhibitor. If you are unfamiliar with this disease, it means       his body not only lacks the protein needed to clot his blood       in case of an injury, but it also rejects the typical       medicine used to treat his bleeding disorder. This means his       only alternative for treating his often spontaneous internal       bleeds is a very expensive synthetic clotting factor, which       costs around $9,000 a dose. When he has been injured in the       past, he has to receive doses every 2 hours for the course of       several days. This happened on over six occasions since he       was first diagnosed in 2011.    Think about how lucky you are if you have healthy kids. I am lucky. I  have two young boys who are healthy. Harrison has cerebral palsy,  hearing loss, epilepsy, daily seizures. Jacob has hemophilia--medicine  that costs $9,000 a dose.   Wayne writes:         We have had to maintain double insurance coverage through       both my wife's and my employers as well as Medicaid in       Harrison's case. We would have easily been dropped by any       number of insurance companies for exceeding both boys       lifetime expense caps--   [[Page S6524]]     Well over 1 million each--       and might not have been able to obtain insurance in the first       place due to their preexisting conditions. If these       provisions were not made law by the ACA, there would be no       way we would have obtained or ever afforded health insurance.       We would not have been able to keep our home and would likely       have had to file for bankruptcy by now. Both boys together       have been hospitalized on over 36 separate occasions, with       Harrison having spent almost his entire first 6 months of       life in the NICU . . . at a cost of over $1,000 a day.    Remember, the ACA says insurance companies can't deny you coverage  because you have a preexisting condition. They can't deny your family  coverage because your child has a preexisting condition, but the  Affordable Care Act also says insurance companies can't cap your  insurance. They can't say: Hey, if you have an expensive disease, we  are going to insure you for up to this amount of money, and then we are  going to stop paying for healthcare.   They can't do that on an annual basis either. The Affordable Care Act  says they can't, as an insurance company, give a dollar amount of  coverage over the course of the year and then cut you off, because that  is not really insurance, right? The whole idea of insurance is that you  pay in whether you are healthy or you are unhealthy, but you are  banking money and you are using other people's banked money in case you  get really sick, in case your family member gets really sick.   If your insurance plan doesn't cover you in the case that you have  kids like Harrison and Jacob, then it is not really insurance in the  traditional form of insurance. That is why the Affordable Care Act  said: No, listen, health insurance is going to have to cover you if you  are really sick or your children are really sick, and they can't pull  that coverage after a certain dollar amount on an annual basis or a  lifetime basis.   That is why Wayne talks about the importance of the Affordable Care  Act for his family. He says: We would have had to sell our home. We  likely would be bankrupt if not for the Affordable Care Act.   He says:         If these key provisions are removed--    Which seems entirely likely--       millions of individuals and families with loved ones having       serious illnesses will be adversely affected.    That is a kind way of explaining what would happen to Wayne's family.  They would be adversely affected. Wayne would lose everything if  insurance companies were able to go back to discriminating against  people with preexisting conditions and placing back on insurance plans  these annual caps and these lifetime caps.   Again, the President of the United States had the choice to go to  court and ask for the entire act to be invalidated or for specific  provisions to be invalidated. He asked for the entire act to be  invalidated, which means these provisions which protect Wayne and his  family will be gone if Amy Coney Barrett and four other Justices decide  to rule for President Trump on his request to invalidate the entire  Affordable Care Act.   Don't tell us that we are overhyping this threat, that we are making  up this idea that Republicans want the Affordable Care Act to  disappear. It is much of what Republicans have been doing for the last  10 years. There has been no viable replacement plan that protects Wayne  in the way that he needs and Wayne's children in the way that he needs   While no one can be guaranteed as to what the Supreme Court is going  to do, Donald Trump himself told you that he is only going to put  people on the Supreme Court who will invalidate the Affordable Care  Act. He criticized John Roberts over and over again as a Republican  appointee for upholding the Affordable Care Act. He signaled to you  that he was not going to appoint someone to the Supreme Court like John  Roberts--someone who would find a way to uphold the Affordable Care  Act. He told you that was John Roberts' primary sin and that he  wouldn't make that mistake again.   He, in fact, told you once again just a few days ago that he hoped  the Supreme Court would strike down the Affordable Care Act. If that is  his hope, then I don't know that we can rely on the idea that he would  have then coincidentally been picking Justices to serve on the Supreme  Court who would follow through on that request.   Julie is from Sandy Hook. Julie says:         On March 25, 1994, I received a lifesaving kidney       transplant at Hartford Hospital. At the time I was working at       a job that was not fulfilling, and I was trying to complete       my Master's degree in Education to get my job in teaching. I       finished my degree, got married, had two children, and got a       dog. Later, I finally landed a full time teaching position at       Newtown, CT. I know if the law were overturned today, I would       not have been able to transfer to my husband's health       insurance plan and ultimately would not have been able to       achieve my dream of becoming a teacher.    Now, that is a different story than Wayne's, right? It is not equally  important, but it is important. What Julie is telling you is that she  had a dream to become a teacher, and she needed to take the time out of  the workforce in order to pursue that dream, and she needed health  insurance during that time.   What the Affordable Care Act has allowed for--and this was back in  1990s that Julie is telling the story. Why she is telling it is because  the Affordable Care Act gives you the opportunity to maintain health  insurance while you are out of work or while you are transitioning from  one job to another. It provides a nimbleness, a flexibility in the  workforce that didn't exist without the Affordable Care Act  protections.   Julie goes on to write:         In August of this year, I was diagnosed with B-cell Non-      Hodgkin's Lymphoma. I am currently receiving chemotherapy       treatments. . . . I am scared to death [she writes] to       imagine what would happen if I am not able to return to work       and I lose my benefits. While my husband does have the       opportunity to get health insurance benefits through his       employer, if the ACA were overturned I might not be eligible       for benefits because of my multiple pre-existing conditions.       This could mean financial ruin for my family since I need       continued follow up care even after I finish my chemotherapy       treatments.    Julie is now in this sort of classic situation in which she has a  preexisting condition. She is currently receiving treatment, and she is  living in fear about what will happen to her and her family if all of a  sudden the days of discrimination against people with preexisting  conditions come back. She is also telling the story about what happened  to her earlier in life when she went out and got herself reeducated to  become a teacher but had fear about what was going to happen to her  insurance benefits because of that. That fear doesn't exist for  Americans any longer because they have access to these private  healthcare exchanges when they lose their coverage, perhaps even  voluntarily because they want to go get another job. Now she is in this  classic situation in which she has a serious, serious illness. She  talks about the fear that she has about what will happen if the  Affordable Care Act is struck down.   I think that is important to recognize, as well, because there is a  generation of young adults who, frankly, don't even remember the days  in which you could be discriminated against by insurance companies  because of a preexisting condition, who don't know what it is like to  obsess and obsess and obsess over that question. There are folks who  are 30 years old today who during their entire adult lives lived under  the ACA, who are having kids now--kids who may have complicated medical  conditions--and don't have to worry about that child living a life in  which they are constantly chasing insurance. It just doesn't happen any  longer.   Now that prospect has returned because of this case before the  Supreme Court. Now those parents are starting to worry. What will  happen if Amy Coney Barrett provides the fifth vote to invalidate the  Affordable Care Act as President Trump is asking the Supreme Court to  do? What will happen?   Well, what likely will happen is those protections for people with  preexisting conditions will be struck down, and once again, parents of  children with complicated illnesses will spend their lives worrying  about how this illness will define their child's future. Now, if you  have a serious illness, it is going to define your future no matter  what, but on top of the daily search for treatment and the daily search  for wellness, there is the worry of whether you are going to be able to  pay for that. It is a nightmare that we don't have to choose to endure  as a nation because right now we have a law that protects against it.  [[Page S6525]]    I always remember this very simple story from a few years after the  Affordable Care Act was passed. I was at a community pool in Cheshire,  CT, with my son, who was then 4 or 5 years old. This young guy--maybe a  few years younger than I--sheepishly approached me in the pool as I was  playing with my son. He said: Thank you.   I asked: For what?   He said: I want to say thank you for the Affordable Care Act. I am  here with my son. My son has a rare heart condition. I used to stay up  nights worrying about what his life was going to be like. I still have  lots of worries, but now I have one less because of the Affordable Care  Act. Now I know we are not going to go bankrupt paying for him. Now,  more than anything else, I know his future is not going to be dependent  on whether or not he can find a job that provides him healthcare  benefits. He can pursue his dream without the constant worry of how he  is going to pay for health insurance.    That sounds like a simple thing, but it is not. For any parent here,  the idea that your child can be whomever they want to be or at least  their life won't be dictated by whether they can afford healthcare for  their expensive disease that they have through no fault of their own,  through no choice of their own--that is a big deal as a parent. The  Affordable Care Act relieves much of that worry. That is why people are  so concerned about what Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the Court  will result in.   Malaine from Branford says:         In 2015, my husband co-founded a Biotechnology company,       which is located at the UCONN Incubator in Farmington.    That is exciting. That was an incubator that I helped conceive as a  State legislator and then as a Congressman.   She writes:         He did this because the ACA made it possible for our family       and the company employees to have healthcare. The company now       has 10 employees, all high-paying, Connecticut based jobs.       This entrepreneurship would absolutely, positively not have       been possible without the ACA. In 2018, the company       transitioned to employer healthcare. Now through the Trump       administration's incompetence in the handling of the       coronavirus pandemic, sales of the company's product--    They sell to other companies that are still closed because of  coronavirus--       have plummeted and so our company, like so many, is       struggling. If we lose our livelihood, we also lose the       company health insurance, which means we co-founders . . .       would need to depend on the ACA's health insurance, if it       still exists.    Once again, this is another story about how the ACA allows for  financial innovation, allows for economic innovation. This is a company  that was started in Connecticut, a biotechnology company. Because the  ACA allowed in the early days for those entrepreneurs to insure  themselves, their families, and their early employees through the  Affordable Care Act before they had enough money in the company, they  were able to provide employer-based insurance. All of that goes away.  That cushion for entrepreneurs will disappear if this act is  invalidated.   These stories go on and on and on, individuals who will have their  lives ruined and changed if the Affordable Care Act disappears. Again,  we might be months away from that occurring--months away from that  occurring--in the middle of a pandemic, people losing their insurance  right at the moment when they need it the most because of the costs of  confronting COVID, because of the fact that they lost their insurance  because of the recession or are at risk of losing insurance, like  Malaine's family is. What a nightmare.   That is not my only worry, though, when I think about Amy Coney  Barrett's confirmation. Frankly, I nor my constituents have had enough  time to really understand the consequences of Amy Coney Barrett's  nomination because of how rushed this process has been. In the middle  of a pandemic, when it is abnormally difficult to be able to  communicate with your constituents, we rushed this nomination through,  which has made it almost impossible for people to figure out who she  is, what she believes, and communicate that in time to their Members of  Congress. I have a feeling there is a reason for that as well.   The rush job is because Republicans need to get her on the Court in  time for the ACA case, because Republicans want to get her on the Court  in time to hear election disputes, because Republicans want to get her  on the Court before a lameduck session makes it harder if the election  goes against Republicans. But I have a feeling it is because they also  don't want people to figure out what she stands for.   One of the other areas of law in which Amy Coney Barrett is likely  pretty radical--certainly is radical--is on the question of America's  gun laws. Obviously I care about this deeply. I have borne witness to  one of the country's worst gun homicides in Newtown, CT. Right now, on  the streets of Hartford, CT, as in many other cities, gun violence is  spiking.   It is not shocking. Gun violence tends to attract poverty when people  are desperate economically. Whether we like it or not, they often  resort to violence, and we are in a moment of economic desperation. You  should see the food lines at food pantries and food banks in  Connecticut. It is not coincidental to that economic desperation that  we are seeing an increase in gun violence.   Yet gun violence is made a lot easier in the Nation because of the  ease of access to weapons. Our Nation is just flooded with weapons and  many of them illegal weapons, many of them in the hands of felons-- dangerous people who shouldn't have them.   We are attempting to pass a universal background checks bill here in  Congress that would make it harder for felons--dangerous individuals-- and people with serious mental illness to get their hands on guns. It  is probably the most popular policy intervention in the country. I  don't know that there is any other major piece of legislation that we  have proposed that is more popular than universal background checks. It  gets about 90 to 95 percent of support in most polls. The majority of  non-gun owners, gun owners, NRA members, non-NRA members--everybody-- wants universal background checks.   It makes a difference. The States that have universal background  checks have lower rates of gun homicides, suicides, and domestic  violence crimes on average. It is maddening to me that we haven't been  able to pass universal background checks here, but that is a political  problem. That is a problem of political power. The gun lobby has had  much more political power. Despite the fact that 90 percent of  Americans want universal background checks, it is just a question of  one side having more political power than the other. That is changing.  Witness the House of Representatives' passage of universal background  checks last year. I think that we will be able to pass that in the  Senate if the elections go a certain way.   Yet Amy Coney Barrett has a different idea as to what the barrier  should be to universal background checks. Amy Coney Barrett believes  there is a constitutional prohibition against preventing all felons  from owning guns. Amy Coney Barrett wants to take away the choice from  Congress of who can own a gun and who can't own a gun. Now, that is not  hyperbole. She will tell you that this is her belief. She wrote it down  in an opinion. She didn't serve on the appellate court for very long,  but while she was there, a case on a State gun law came before her, and  she wrote a dissenting opinion which is a major outlier in Second  Amendment jurisprudence, and it contains in it some pretty dangerous  ideas that, frankly, people haven't had the time to consider because of  how rushed this nomination has been.   In this case, the Kanter case, Amy Coney Barrett says that this  felon--I think, in this case, it was a nonviolent felon--should be able  to own a weapon. This is notwithstanding the State law that says all  felons can't own weapons. Amy Coney Barrett comes to the personal  opinion, in this case, that this individual is not dangerous. What she  says is that it is not for the legislature to decide who is dangerous  and who isn't. It is for the courts to decide who is dangerous and who  isn't, and if the legislature can't prove to me, Amy Coney Barrett,  that this person is dangerous, then I will declare that the  Constitution doesn't allow for that person to own a weapon. The court  now becomes the trier of fact.   This isn't unfamiliar because this has been a sort of interesting  strain of jurisprudence among this new Federalist Society-vetted,  conservative judicial crowd.  [[Page S6526]]    That is sort of the issue in Shelby County as well. This voting  rights case comes before the Court, and the Supreme Court essentially  says: We are going to be the trier of fact with respect to whether  there is discrimination in this country. We are going to determine  whether discrimination against people of color exists such that they  need these voting protections. That traditionally would be a function  of the legislature to decide whether discrimination exists so that it  is necessary to require these protections, but in Shelby County, the  Supreme Court says: No, we will make the decision as to whether  discrimination is a problem, and if it is not, we will constitutionally  invalidate these provisions of the Voting Rights Act.   Well, in Kanter, what Coney Barrett says is that courts now will  decide who is dangerous and who isn't because I believe the Second  Amendment to only allow for guns to be prohibited to individuals who  are dangerous.   The second thing she says in that case is equally as dangerous. She  says she also would require a State or the Federal Government to prove  that the law is efficacious in promoting public safety. Now, that might  not sound to you unreasonable, but that is not what the Second  Amendment says. The Second Amendment doesn't say anything in there  about gun laws only being constitutional if they can be proven to be  efficacious, and there is always going to be a study funded by the NRA  that will tell you that, if you take guns away from people, you make a  community more dangerous. The NRA is really good at telling you that  the only way to solve crime is with more guns.   So, conveniently, under Amy Coney Barrett's conception of the Second  Amendment, so long as she or others on the Court can find a plausible  argument that a gun law is not effective in promoting public safety, it  can thus be ruled unconstitutional.   There are a hundred other courts out there with Republican judges who  have not found the Second Amendment to say what Amy Coney Barrett says  the Second Amendment says, and for courts to, all of a sudden,  micromanage decisions about who is dangerous and who is not dangerous  and what laws are effective and what laws are not effective sounds to  me like the kind of judicial activism that many of my conservative  friends have been warning against. I think the natural consequence of  that would be to invalidate a whole host of background checks laws,  perhaps to make it impossible--indeed, likely, to make it impossible  for us to be able to expand background checks in a universal fashion as  90 percent of Americans want us to do.   So, while we are certainly spending most of our time talking about  the threat to Americans' healthcare--because we are in the middle of a  healthcare epidemic and because the consequences are so serious--it is  important to note that it is not only on the question of healthcare  that Amy Coney Barrett is going to, potentially, fundamentally change  this country. Whether it be her likely vote to overturn Roe v. Wade or  the same-sex marriage decision or her radical, out-of-the-box  conception of American gun laws and the constitutionality of them, her  views are not in the American mainstream.   Of course, that makes sense because, increasingly, the Republicans  aren't using the legislature to try to mold this country into their  world view, into their political view, because their conception of how  this country should be is deeply unpopular. It is unpopular to repeal  the Affordable Care Act. It is unpopular to make it harder for the  legislature to put into place universal background checks. It is  unpopular to allow States to criminalize abortion. It is unpopular to  allow for more dark money to be spent in elections. It is unpopular to  provide less regulation on the pollution--oil and gas--industry.    So, increasingly, the Republicans don't really try to push that  agenda through Congress because they have this other way now--because  the Supreme Court will get all of that done. The Supreme Court will  eviscerate the civil jury to make it easier for corporations to prevail  in their cases against consumers. The Supreme Court will declare that a  woman's right to a safe and legal abortion is not protected by the  Constitution. The Supreme Court will invalidate the Affordable Care  Act. The Supreme Court will stop legislatures from passing universal  background checks.   As the Republicans' political agenda has become less aligned with  that of the broad American public's, it makes sense that the Senate has  stopped legislating. It makes sense that the Senate has just become  this confirmation simple machine.   I have been here for the last 2 years. We haven't debated any  legislation of substance here. All we have done is just confirm judges.  I checked, and we have done 20 pieces of legislation. That is half as  many as a normal Senate would do. Most of the bills we have passed have  been--or not most of them, but, as I checked, one-third of the bills  that we have passed have been of post office renamings or commemorative  coins, and we have passed half as many bills overall as we would in a  normal legislative session. Legislation is just kind of grinding to a  halt here.   Yes, some of that is because the House is of a different party, and  it is difficult to pass a law when you have different parties in charge  of the House and the Senate, but there aren't a lot of conference  committees happening, and there aren't a lot of attempts to reconcile  our differences. In part, this is because the Senate is just confirming  judges--a record numbers of judges because, in part, there were record  numbers of vacancies because Mitch McConnell and the Senate Republicans  refused to confirm almost anybody over the last 2 years of Obama's term  in office.   They essentially nullified that portion of his Presidency--his right  under the Constitution to nominate and have considered judges to the  Federal bench. So, when Trump won and the Republicans maintained  control of the Senate, all of a sudden, they had more vacancies than  ever before. They have spent the last 2 years populating the bench,  filling those vacancies. That is their right to do so, I guess, but it  is also part of the strategy to push a conservative political agenda  through the courts rather than through the legislature. Because that  agenda is so unpopular, if it were pushed through the legislature, it  would jeopardize the Republicans' chances of reelection. This has been  an unusually activist Court, but it is likely to get more so with Amy  Coney Barrett on the Court.   I want to do two more things before I yield the floor, and I know  Senator Kaine will be here shortly. I want to spend a few more minutes  on why this pandemic is so intimately intertwined into this  conversation about this nomination and then finally say a word on  process.   There are 220,000 Americans who have died, and millions of others  have had their lives changed forever by this pandemic. The number of  people who have been laid off is just sort of unfathomable to think  about. The President tried a feckless travel ban in February and March.  It didn't work. It was not going to work. He, effectively, gave up  after that. He just put the States in charge and then refused to  resource the States in a way that would allow them to adequately and  effectively confront the virus. One example is the President's refusal  to stand up a national supply chain so that we have been in constant  crisis--first, with respect to masks and face shields and hand  sanitizer and then, throughout the crisis, with respect to tests and  testing equipment and cartridges.   I was visiting testing sites in Connecticut just last week. I mean,  we are in--what?--month 8 of the pandemic, and still these testing  sites in Connecticut have no idea, from day to day, how many tests they  are going to have.   I was visiting a hospital that is right in the middle of a historic  hot zone in Connecticut. I did a roundtable, and there were a bunch of  people there. On my way out, one of the participants in the roundtable  kind of followed me out. It happens often, as my colleagues know, and  she wanted to have a private word with me. She was the purchasing agent  for that hospital who wanted to tell me before I left exactly how  nightmarish her life was for not knowing, from day to day, how many  tests they were going to be able to do and how she had to scramble  every single day to figure out how to get the components for the tests  and how there was no way to plan, how there was no way to say, ``OK,  this week, I am going to go to  [[Page S6527]]  this site and this site to do tests,'' because I don't know where I am  getting them from.   That is just one of the ways in which this President has just  fundamentally let us down, but now it is something different. Now, the  President isn't trying to stop the virus. He is actively trying to  spread the virus. The President is holding these political rallies at  which nobody is wearing masks and where people are standing shoulder to  shoulder. He knows what he is doing. He knows that the effect of those  rallies is going to be to spread the virus. He is shaming people who  wear masks and is chiding the Vice President for always wearing one.   He is now actively engaged in an effort to test people less because  he thinks that makes the country look bad. He is at war with his own  scientists and regularly undermines his own officials at the CDC and  the NIH. There is nobody who is doing more today to help this virus  spread than Donald Trump. Then, on top of that, to rush through a  nominee who may end up invalidating the Affordable Care Act and leaving  people with no insurance in the middle of a pandemic that you are  responsible for as President, that is cruelty built on top of cruelty.   Some of my other colleagues have done this as well, and I want to do  it just so that some of these people's names end up as part of history,  as part of some record other than of lonely obituaries. I am just going  to read into the Record the names of a handful of the people who have  died due to COVID-19 during this epidemic. I know it sounds like a  futile exercise, given the fact that I will read 20 names and that  220,000 have died, but I don't really know what else to do at this  point to try to convince this President to stop spreading the virus--to  act in a responsible way, like an adult--other than to at least put  some names to the numbers: Avigdor and Rachel Farin, Adam Russo,  Maurice Berger, Robert Herman, Mary Margaret Smith, Ingrid Kisliuk,  Johnny G. Gonzales, Anne Martinez, Amelia Michels, Giomar Fuentes,  Carmen Carlo. By the way, those last four were related--a mother, an  aunt, another aunt, and a grandmother in law. Dr. John Marvin Brown,  Sr.; Sylvia Livings; Howard Kramer; Robert Patrick Perry, Jr.; Hing S.  Yee; Frank Small III; Steven D. Silverman, MD; Alexander Malcolm  MacMillan, Jr.; Dean Pryor Perkins; Mary Castro; Alfonso Ye, Jr.;  Michelle Lee Carter; Jerome Mark Spector; John Robert Hicken; Frederick  Harris; Bill Huening; Jim Sheehan; Barry Downes; Mark Blum; Florence  Warshawsky Harris; Kenneth Glover; Terrence Neil Thompson, Jr.; Gordon  Pickering; Robert M. Flanders; Carlos Llamas; Juan Gilbert ``Tito''  Dominguez; Sarah Ann Staffa Scholin; Anne Morreale; Roberta M.  Pepitone; Barbara Ross; Jacqueline Hoover; Kerman Hain; Mario Mendoza;  John Pizzetti; and William Charles Edward Prince.   These are just two pages of names of individuals who have died due to  the coronavirus.   The numbers are, obviously, absolutely overwhelming, and it is, of  course, not just those who have died. It is those who have lost their  jobs. It is all those people who have had the illness. Eight million  people have been diagnosed with COVID. Who knows what the overall  number is--individuals who had it who didn't know it, thought it was  something else, or people who were asymptomatic. But is that number 100  million? Is that number 50 million? It is big, and all those  individuals now have a preexisting condition. All those individuals now  could be discriminated against by an insurance company if the  Affordable Care Act was to be invalidated, and that is the ask of the  Supreme Court--a Supreme Court on which Amy Coney Barrett will be  sitting if this nomination is pushed through.   That is why these two questions--of the Supreme Court nomination  which is before us today and the question of how we adequately confront  the coronavirus pandemic--are connected and why we talk about them  together.   Finally, let me say a word about process. This is not the most  compelling argument to the American people. I don't think they really  care too much about the processes by which we choose to conduct  business here in the Senate, but we do. We should. We chose to serve in  this body.   I have thought a lot over the course of the last few weeks about the  idea of restraint--the idea of restraint, the idea of temperance. It  has been a sort of seminal idea that humans have been considering for  millennia--the idea of deciding not to do something that you have the  ability to do, the decision to restrain one's self, to not use the  minimum powers available to you because of the downstream consequences  of your decision to operate at maximum power, your decision to use all  of the facilities available to you. It is an idea that humans have  considered, as I said, for thousands of years.   It is generally applied to this body. It is generally a very  important facet of democracy because the Constitution says very little  about how the Senate will conduct business. It doesn't micromanage our  proceedings.   Certainly, if you read our constitutional history, there was a belief  that the Senate was supposed to be different than the House of  Representatives. Obviously, we are chosen very differently. At the  outset, we were given different term lengths. The idea was that the  Senate was supposed to be able to look out for the long-term health of  the country in a way that was different from the House of  Representatives, given their requirement to answer to the people every  2 years.   So, over time, there was this understanding that the Senate would  have, at its foundation, some concept of fairness, some ability for the  minority to participate. So, over time, there have been different rules  about how many votes are required for cloture or different practices of  how cloture was used, how often it was used. But always there was an  idea that this place would be a shared experience; minority and  majority would work together.   Senator McConnell has his version of history. I think Democrats have  a different version of it. But I don't think anybody can disagree that  the changes to the way in which the Senate operates have come faster  and more furious during the years in which Mitch McConnell has been  majority leader than at any time before.   I mean, just while I have been here, we have seen the eradication of  the filibuster for Supreme Court Justices. We have seen the time that  we have to debate Justices dramatically shrunken. I think it is now  down to 2 hours. We have seen the elimination of the blue slip--the  ability for Senators from a particular State to have a say in the  judges that are selected to serve in their State's appellate courts.   But we also saw this exceptional thing happen in 2016, in which Mitch  McConnell, as majority leader, decided that he would not even consider  Barack Obama's choice for a vacancy in the Supreme Court, despite the  fact that the vacancy came about 11 months before the next President  was to be sworn in.   In retrospect, Democrats didn't make a big enough deal out of it, I  think, because we thought that Hillary Clinton was going to win, and,  thus, ultimately, while it would be a dangerous precedent to live with,  it might not have a practical effect on the country. We just couldn't  imagine in the winter and spring of 2016 that Donald Trump was going to  be the President of the United States.   In retrospect we should have made a bigger deal out of what was  happening in 2016, because this idea that Republicans weren't going to  even consider--even do a courtesy meeting, have a hearing on--Merrick  Garland was and still is truly exceptional, and it fits into this  pattern we have seen under Senator McConnell during the past few years,  this pattern of forsaking restraint and using every conceivable power.  Or let me back that up: using more powers available to the majority  than ever before in order to effectuate a political agenda.   What Republicans did in 2016 was unprecedented--to just say: Forget  it, President Obama. We are not considering your choice for the Supreme  Court because you are a Democrat and we are Republicans.   Now, at the time, as we remember, Republicans said that it wasn't  political. It was because there was an important rule they were  enforcing--this rule that you couldn't consider a Presidential nominee  to the Supreme Court in the last year of his or her term.  [[Page S6528]]    Now, I didn't hear my colleagues say at the time that the rule was  only applied when the President and the Senate were of different  parties. In fact, I heard many of my Republican colleagues, including  the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, say that the rule was simply  that, in the last year of a President's term, you don't consider a  Supreme Court Justice. Famously, Senator Graham said: Write down my  words. Hold them against me.   And, at the time, we all knew that Republicans probably weren't  telling the truth. We knew that it was probably just because it was  President Obama and they did not want Justice Scalia, a conservative  Justice, to be replaced by someone who was more liberal in their views.  We suspected that this idea that they were enforcing a rule was just a  ruse to paper over what was simply a political decision not to give  President Obama a seat on the Supreme Court.   Well, now we know it was a ruse because, all of a sudden, when  presented with the exact same circumstance--well, in fact, a different  circumstance in that this vacancy occurred weeks before the election  rather than 9 months before the election--Republicans have now changed  their tune because it is just about politics. Right? It is just about  politics. It is just about getting your guys on the Supreme Court and  stopping the other guy's folks from getting on the Supreme Court.   And what Mitch McConnell has said is that we are going to use any  power at our disposal in order to effectuate our agenda, especially  when it concerns the Supreme Court.    Restraint, which is a predicate for the effective operation of  democracy, is disappearing. And, again, I know that it sounds  ridiculous to make this suggestion, but there is really no logical end  to how you can maximize your powers as a majority body in the U.S.  Senate. There is no constitutional prohibition on the Senate majority  saying that Members of the majority are going to get twice as much  staff as Members of the minority. There is nothing stopping the  majority from eliminating our speaking rights in committees, on the  floor of the Senate.   There are a lot of things that the majority can do to make it  increasingly impossible for the minority to have any role here--to be  able to protest, to be able to carry out our agenda. And I know that  there is a lot of speculation--much of it driven by the Republican  majority--about what Democrats will do if Democrats are given control  of the Senate. Will Democrats go to new extraordinary lengths to  maximize their power, given the extraordinary lengths Republicans have  gone to maximize their power?   That is not a conversation that is sort of ripe enough yet, but what  do Republicans expect? I mean, what you did in 2016 is really wild. You  basically invalidated the last year of a President's term, at least  with respect to that core function of appointing Justices. And what is  wild was that you didn't have to go to the lengths that you did.  Republicans could have voted Merrick Garland down and, at least, have  recognized the legitimacy of the nomination--voted Merrick Garland down  and perhaps forcing a conversation about another nominee that might be  more amenable to the Republican majority. That wouldn't be the first  time that that has occurred.   One of the statues here in the U.S. Congress is of Oliver Ellsworth  from Connecticut, who was elevated to the Supreme Court because George  Washington believed his first pick couldn't be confirmed by the Senate.  So, instead, he chose one of Connecticut's two U.S. Senators, who was  beloved in this body when it operated not far away. And Oliver  Ellsworth went to the Court because of a quiet negotiation with the  Senate.   Republicans, under Mitch McConnell, didn't even engage in a process  with Merrick Garland. They just declared that the President's choice  was illegitimate. And I can't argue that they didn't--well, I can argue  they didn't have the power, but certainly there was a colorable  argument that Republicans in the Senate could just refuse to consider  Merrick Garland's nomination.   But now having practiced that exercise of maximum power, using the  majority to delegitimize a President in that way, you put Democrats, if  they win control of the Senate, in a really unenviable position. Do we  just unilaterally stand down and not choose to use the same tools that  Republicans did in the majority? Would we expect, if we did that, that  if Republicans regain the majority, they would follow our lead? Or  would that be wildly naive?   No, in fact, I think there are now new rules in the Senate, and I  think Republicans have set them. I get it that you can claim Harry  Reid's rule change as the original sin that legitimizes everything that  you have done since then, but the changes Republicans have made have  come at a dizzying pace--far more changes made, far more precedents  shattered than anything that happened when Democrats were in control.   And, of course, as to Senator Reid, many of us would argue that the  reason that that change was made was because Senator McConnell doubled  the number of cloture motions that were required in order to move  legislation to a final vote. The change in the use of the filibuster by  Republicans during their time in the minority was what forced that  change.   But setting that aside, there is no question that changes have come  much faster and much more furious, and it just doesn't bode well for  the future of our democracy when everyone uses the maximum power  available to them, with no concern for the minority party, in order to  get what they want.   And it is not just the Republican majority that has done this. So has  the executive branch. I listened to the Presiding Officer give his  maiden speech on this floor about the overuse of Executive power, and  there were legitimate complaints about ways in which the Obama  administration had used maximum Executive power when the legislature  would not act.   But, again, it doesn't compare with the ways in which this President  has used maximum Executive power in the absence of authorization from  Congress. Both in the executive branch and in the legislative branch,  under Republicans, restraint as a practice inside democracy is  disappearing. Maximum power becomes the ethos, and that is a danger to  democracy--maybe not today, but soon enough.   I don't know how this body gets back into a conversation about  comity. I don't know how we get back into a conversation about how we  govern together.   I have, frankly, voted for more of this President's nominees to the  executive branch, to political offices, and to the bench than almost  all of my colleagues, maybe, on this side of the aisle, maybe with the  exception of a few, because I generally have believed that if the  nominee is in the conservative mainstream and if the nominee is  generally qualified, they should get their post, especially for  executive appointments, for nominations to Secretary positions and  Undersecretary positions. I do that, in part, because I think that it  is important to not use maximum power and maximum leverage, for me not  to vote against every single nominee that the President puts forward  just because I disagree with that nominee.   That conversation about how we restore some comity and some restraint  is an important one, but it is likely to be impossible in the next  Congress because of how fundamentally broken this body will be after  what happened to Merrick Garland and then, on top of it, what is  happening right now.   We are 8 days before an election. We are 8 days before an election.  We are jamming through Amy Coney Barrett's nomination in record time,  not because it is good for the country, just because you can--just  because Republicans can--and, likely, because it is really important to  effectuate your deeply unpopular agenda through the Supreme Court.   We don't legislate here anymore because Republicans have found out a  way to get their agenda done through the court system. Amy Coney  Barrett will likely be the fifth vote to invalidate the Affordable Care  Act, a political project for the Republicans for the last decade,  unfulfilled through the legislative branch, now achievable in the next  several months through the judicial branch, but only if Amy Coney  Barrett's nomination is rammed through right now.   The rewriting of the Second Amendment is not available to Republicans  [[Page S6529]]  any longer in the legislative branch. The NRA's priority list couldn't  even get a vote in the Senate with Republican control--now available  through the judicial branch if Amy Coney Barrett is nominated. The  consequences for the country are serious if the source of power in this  town, the source of policymaking and rule setting, moves from this body  across the street to the Supreme Court.   And not equally as dangerous to the Nation, but still perilous, is  what will happen to this body, if all that matters political power,  when restraint vanishes and whoever is in the majority uses every lever  available to them to try to get what they want, to try to stop the  other side from getting what they want.   It is 1 week before an election. We are here all night, ramming  through a Supreme Court nominee in record time simply because you can.  That is not a good enough reason.   I yield the floor.
