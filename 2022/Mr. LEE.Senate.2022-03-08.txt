 Madam President, the U.S. Postal Service is in dire trouble.  The Government Accountability Office has listed its financial viability  as high risk, and it has been in that status since 2009.   From 2007 until 2020, the Postal Service had losses of $86 billion  and over $188 billion in unfunded liabilities and debt. From October to  December of last year alone--just a few months--it lost $1.3 billion.   I think it is a mistake to rush postal reform now, when Congress  should instead debate and consider the country's response to and role  in the Ukraine-Russia situation. We could be responding to skyrocketing  energy prices. Nevertheless, I do very much support dealing with the  post office and reforming the post office. We have to do this.   Unfortunately, this bill falls far short in much more than just its  timing. It does nearly nothing to make the Postal Service solvent.   I have offered 12 amendments. Sadly, my efforts, along with those of  my Republican colleagues, have been blocked. But I can't just step  aside without trying to make the bill better.   Today, I would like to briefly speak about just 2 of the 12  amendments I have filed, just two of them in particular, and ask that  they be called up and voted on.   The first strikes a provision in the bill that would require the  Postal Service to ``maintain an integrated network for the delivery''  of postal products and would require the disclosure of the rates that  the USPS charges private companies for the last mile delivery of  packages.   The term ``integrated network'' isn't defined in the bill, and it  could be easily used to bundle or combine expenses, which would in turn  allow the USPS to further disguise serious costs and make a proper  accounting of certain products difficult or even impossible.   The simple idea of an ``integrated delivery network'' may seem  benign--and the term itself sounds friendly enough--but words do  matter. Words in context and their meaning, these are things that  matter.   This particular legislative text with no clear definition is ripe for  abuse. Because the Postal Service is required to deliver to every  American, even on unprofitable routes, the Postal Service may be  charging lower than market rates in its service contracts with private  companies. This may not only shortchange the Postal Service, making  further taxpayer bailouts likely, but it could also distort competition  in the package delivery market.   The American public deserves a proper accounting of Postal Service  rates, and my amendment will ensure this disclosure is provided in a  fully transparent manner.   My second amendment prohibits the Postal Service from shipping any  ``abortion inducing drug.'' Chemical  [[Page S1033]]  abortions have four times the complication rate of surgical abortions  and are far more likely to send women to the emergency room.  Unfortunately, in December of 2021--just a few months ago--the Food and  Drug Administration permanently rescinded a longstanding regulation  that required healthcare professionals to dispense chemical abortion  pills to patients in person, allowing them to be sent through the mail  without even basic precautions to protect the life and health of the  mother.   Not only does this policy change threaten the lives and the health of  women, but it raises the disturbing possibility that perpetrators of  sexual abuse may be further enabled to hide their crimes from legal  authorities and health professionals through mail-order abortion.   Furthermore, because taxpayer dollars--particularly, over the last  few years--have funded the Postal Service's operations, American  taxpayer resources are funding abortion and putting women at risk.  Congress must put an end to this and exercise its authority to ensure  that the U.S. Government does not encourage or facilitate the use of  these dangerous and lethal abortion drugs.   I also support the efforts of my many colleagues. Senator Scott's  amendment would alleviate some of the financial burdens that this bill  would impose on taxpayers and the Medicare Program by forcing the  Postal Service to reimburse Medicare for all of the additional costs  that would be created by requiring future postal retirees to enroll in  Medicare.   Congress and the Postal Service have historically made bad policy and  business decisions, and now, instead of fixing those or otherwise  meaningfully addressing them, it is simply shifting millions of workers  from coverage historically provided by an independent Federal Agency  onto taxpayers more broadly.   The Postal Service and the American people deserve a thoughtful bill,  one that reforms its key challenges, setting the Agency up for long- term success.   But without any amendments to change the trajectory, this bill only  kicks the can down the road without making the serious changes that are  needed today.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending  amendment and call up my amendment No. 4936. Further, I ask that the  amendment be reported by number, that there be 2 minutes of debate  equally divided on the amendment, and that the Senate then vote on  adoption of the amendment with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, it is unfortunate that we are not able to  vote on this. It is a simple measure, and contrary to the  characterization by my friend and distinguished colleague, the Senator  from Michigan, this is a simple transparency measure.   Look, the fact that there are people within the Postal Service  reviewing the contracts doesn't solve the underlying problem. What we  want is transparency. What we want to know is that the Postal Service  isn't setting up contracts that are sweetheart deals to some companies,  allowing them to be enriched on the backs of the American taxpayer and  the consumer who uses the Postal Service. It is not too much to ask.   So it is unfortunate that we can't. All I want is a vote on that. We  ought to be able to vote on it. It makes me wonder: What are they  afraid of? What is the Postal Service so afraid of? What is the harm  that can come from the American people knowing how these things  operate? What is the harm that can come from striking a provision that  is vague and ripe with opportunities for abuse--strike that and replace  it with transparency provisions? We would all be better off. So that is  unfortunate.   I do think we ought to consider that and also another amendment.                Unanimous Consent Request--Amendment No. 4937    Madam President, to that end, I ask unanimous consent to set aside  the pending amendment and call up amendment No. 4937; further, that the  amendment be reported by number, that there be 2 minutes of debate  equally divided on the amendment, and that the Senate then vote on  adoption of the amendment with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, here again is an amendment. The Senate has  to get back to the practice of amending bills. I understand not  everybody is inclined to agree on it. I understand the abortion issue  is tough for a  [[Page S1034]]  lot of people. They don't want to talk about it. But, look, until a few  months ago, these weren't available through the mail system anyway.  They still shouldn't be. I believe those who made that decision to  allow that over the last few months were overlooking the health and  safety concerns that had previously prohibited those things from  happening.   Regardless, it really is unfortunate we can't even vote on this. I  understand not everybody agrees on the substance of the amendment, but  what previously made the Senate the world's greatest deliberative  legislative body was the ability of any one Member to bring up an  amendment and have it voted on. I think that is unfortunate.
