 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House  Resolution 1092, I call up the bill (H.R.  [[Page H4271]]  8015) to maintain prompt and reliable postal services during the COVID- 19 health emergency, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise  and extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 8015.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5  minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Delivering for America  Act. I also rise in strong support of the brave postal workers across  this Nation who are continuing to deliver the mail for the American  people in the middle of a global pandemic.   The Postal Service is a critical component of America's  infrastructure. It provides a lifeline of medication, supplies, and  mail for all Americans, everywhere they live, especially in this time  of need.   Earlier this year, the Postal Service asked Congress to help. They  asked us for $25 billion in critical assistance to help navigate  through this crisis, just like all these other industries did,  businesses and entities that received Federal funds from Congress.   This was not a Democratic request. It came from the Postal Service,  and it was supported unanimously by the Board of Governors, all of whom  were appointed by President Trump.   In response to this urgent request, the House acted. The House said  yes. We acted swiftly to help the Postal Service. We voted to include  $25 billion in the HEROES Act, and we passed it on May 15.   Unfortunately, the President would not agree, and the request has  languished for more than 3 months. And now we know why, because the  President told us why. He admitted on national television that he was  blocking the $25 billion in order to hobble mail-in voting. That is  what he said, and I would like to read it to you.   ``They want $25 billion for the post office. Now they need that money  in order to make the post office work, so it can take all of these  millions and millions of ballots.''   Regrettably, it does not end there. Now the new Postmaster General is  using this lack of funding to justify sweeping and damaging changes to  Postal Service operations, and we have seen the results: national  headlines about delays of days and weeks in mail, veterans desperately  waiting for their medications, sorting machines being ripped out and  put in dumpsters.   Yesterday, some of my Republican colleagues argued at the Rules  Committee that there are ``no delays.'' That is right, no delays  happening anywhere. They claimed repeatedly that there is no data that  proves these delays are real.   But we have eyes, and we have heard accounts from across this Nation,  from our districts and every district in this Nation, and we have the  Postmaster General himself who admitted yesterday that there are, in  fact, delays, that he feels bad about them, and that he is working  feverishly to address them.   In addition, this afternoon, we have something else. We have new  information. We have received new internal Postal Service documents  showing nationwide performance data from July and August, official post  office data. These new documents show that the delays we have all heard  about are actually far worse than previously expected and told us. And  they are across the board. They are across this Nation.  [[Page H4272]]    This afternoon, I am making these new documents available to all  Members of the House, and I urge you to review them carefully. They  will be available on the floor during this debate.   The bill we are considering today is simple. It does two things.  First, it provides the $25 billion the Postal Service requested on a  bipartisan basis to help during the coronavirus crisis. Second, it  returns delivery standards to the way they were before the Postmaster  General recently caused all those delays, which has an impact on the  delivery and the ability of Americans to vote by mail.   This is not a partisan issue. It makes absolutely no sense to  implement these dramatic changes in the middle of a pandemic less than  3 months before the November elections.   The American people do not want anyone messing with the post office.  They certainly do not want it to be politicized. They just want their  mail, they want their medicines, and they want their mail-in ballots  delivered in a timely way. And that is exactly what our bill does.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, first, in response,  this is not a Democratic conspiracy theory. Republican officials from  across this country, elected and appointed, have expressed their own  concerns about postal delays and the President's comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the District  of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes  to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), the distinguished  chairman of the Subcommittee on Government Operations.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch), the chair of the  Subcommittee on National Security for the Committee on Oversight and  Reform.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, in the  Rules Committee, the other side kept claiming that there was no data  about the slowdown in the mail, absolutely none.   Well, this new report, this data, shows a 10 percent decline in  service since July 1 after the new Postmaster General came into office  and implemented a slowdown of the mail.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Illinois (Mrs. Bustos).    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   The other side of the aisle has a double standard. Congress provided  hundreds of billions of dollars to all sorts of industries, businesses,  large and small entities across the country to help them cope with the  coronavirus crisis. We did not require them to come forward with  detailed plans of how they are going to spend their money. But they  want it for the Postal Service.   Now, the Postal Service made a public request, and they requested it  and presented it to the Board of Governors, who are appointed by  President Trump, and the Board approved it unanimously. That is far  more than all these other entities that we have given billions of  dollars to did. And we should support the Postal Service now.   On top of it, the CBO came out with an estimate that this money would  be spent in the next fiscal year, and that they needed it. The CBO  record can be found online.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Mfume).    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries), the distinguished chair of  the Democratic Caucus.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), another member  of the Committee on Oversight and Reform.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), the distinguished chair of  the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I would like to  correct for the Record that the Committee on Oversight and Reform had a  briefing on postal on April 9, 2020--right after the COVID crisis  struck us--with the Postmaster General.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Kelly), who is another great member of the committee.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett), who is  another outstanding member of the committee.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I would like to  respond to the gentleman's statement that the money is not needed. The  Postal Service sought the $25 billion from Congress to provide this  critical relief, and that request was supported unanimously by a vote  by the Board of Governors who were all appointed by President Trump.   Yesterday we received the report from the nonpartisan Congressional  Budget Office, and that report estimates that the vast majority of this  funding would, in fact, be needed within fiscal year 2021 to provide  services to the American people.   This should be a nonpartisan issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Waters). My good friend is the distinguished chairwoman of the  Committee on Financial Services.    MALONEY of New York. Why are we here?   We are here because the President of the United States went on  national television on Thursday night and said he was going to defund  the post office. That is why we are here.   Further, he said he didn't support mail-in voting when we know that  millions of Americans will want to vote, for health reasons, by mail.  That is why we are here.   We are here because we wrote numerous letters to the Postmaster  General, which he ignored. That is why we are here.   I applaud the Democratic leadership for calling us in for this  emergency meeting to make sure that the post office is funded. It was  funded before we even had a Constitution. It is one of the pillars of  our democracy. It is enshrined in our Constitution, and it provides  vital services to Americans who need medication, the ability to conduct  business, and to stay in touch. It binds us together as a nation. Most  of us do not like the fact that the President of our country would even  mention defunding the post office. That is why we are here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs.  Lawrence), a very distinguished member of the committee who brings  valuable experience to us as a former member of the Postal Service.                                time  1445     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), the distinguished  chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from California (Mr. Gomez), the vice chair and an  outstanding member of the Committee on Oversight and Reform.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority  leader.    MALONEY of New York. Yes, I have.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes  to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the distinguished  majority whip.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, just as a point  of clarification, there is no cause of action in this bill, and it does  not in any way hinder any efficiency that would speed up the mail. It  merely stops any action that slows down the mail until the end of this  pandemic.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley), an extremely valuable member of the  committee.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes  to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib), another great member of  the committee.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\  minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), an outstanding  member of the committee.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\  minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms.  Clark), who is the vice chair of our caucus.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute  to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo), who is the  distinguished chair of the Subcommittee on Health on the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\  minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Krishnamoorthi), who is the chair of the Subcommittee on Economic and  Consumer Policy on the Oversight and Reform Committee.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute  to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating), a distinguished  Member of Congress.    MALONEY of New York.

Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute  to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu), the distinguished  chair of the Asian Pacific American Caucus.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 30  seconds to the distinguished gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute  to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams).    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute  to the distinguished gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Neguse).    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute  to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green).    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute  to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the chair of the  Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies of  the Committee on Appropriations.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds  to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, delivering the mail  and medications and ballots, this is a part of our Constitution. It is  important to our democracy.   And numbers don't lie. This internal report from the Postal Service  shows that services are down 10 percent since this Postmaster General  took charge.    I want to publicly thank the Speaker of this great body for her  leadership and for calling this emergency meeting and emergency vote.  And there was no change in service until she called the meeting and  vote.   I thank you for standing up to the American people and fighting for  their services and their democracy and their vote.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the United States Congress, the  first woman in history, as we celebrate the 100th anniversary of women  gaining the right to vote.   We are so proud of you and your leadership.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the  balance of my time.
