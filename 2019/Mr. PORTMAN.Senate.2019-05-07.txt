 Madam President, today I wish to acknowledge the  inaugural COSI Science Festival that took place in Columbus during the  first 4 days of May. COSI is a statewide science center that has been  engaging, inspiring, and transforming Ohio's young citizens since 1964  and directly impacts over 1 million people annually. This festival  event serves as a conduit to involve students, educators, policymakers,  and families in STEM. COSI hosted the culminating event, the Big  Science Celebration, where thousands of individuals gathered to  experience hands-on learning around critical industry sectors for Ohio,  such as agriculture, aerospace, and advanced manufacturing.   COSI's Science Festival partnered with NASA, DOT, and several state  agencies to provide hands-on learning opportunities. Local mayors from  10 partner-cities were also featured to demonstrate the value of STEM  in our communities. Pioneers in STEM of all ages from central Ohio were  appointed as STEM Stars to serve as liaisons between community and  industry.   Visitors to the science festival experienced hands-on scientific  demonstrations, interactive exhibits, workshops, and much more. Ohioans  had the opportunity to take part in an event that will undoubtedly  leave a lasting impact in the STEM field.   I am honored to recognize the COSI Science Festival on this important  event highlighting the impact of STEM throughout our nation.   Congratulations to all who were involved in making it a  success.                            ____________________
