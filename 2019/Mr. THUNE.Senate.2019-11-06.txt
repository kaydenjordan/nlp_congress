 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last Friday was an exciting day. I was home  in Sioux Falls, SD, to mark a huge milestone for the city and for South  Dakota--the unveiling of Sioux Falls' first 5G small cells. By the end  of this month, Sioux Falls will have a working, albeit limited, 5G  network--one of the first cities in the entire country to have one.   Most people take internet access for granted these days. We assume  that anywhere we go, we will be able to access our GPS, check Facebook,  or send a text message. But the truth is that there are still areas in  the United States where it can be difficult to get reliable internet  access. Some of those areas are in South Dakota. That is why expanding  access to broadband internet in rural communities has been a priority  of mine since I came to the Senate. While it can be nice to turn off  our phones and take a break, in this day and age, Americans need  reliable internet access.   More and more of the business of daily life is being conducted over  the internet, from scheduling appointments to figuring out the shortest  way from point A to point B. The internet has already become an  integral part of commerce. Small businesses and farms in areas without  dependable access miss out on a lot of opportunities that most  businesses take for granted.   Both as chairman and as a member of the Senate Commerce, Science, and  Transportation Committee, I have had the chance to draw attention to  the state of broadband access in rural communities. I have conducted  numerous hearings with testimony from rural broadband providers,  farmers, Tribal representatives, and Federal officials both in  Washington and in my home State of South Dakota.   Over the past several years, we have seen the number of Americans  lacking access to broadband decrease significantly, but there is more  work that needs to be done. With the advent of 5G technology, we now  have to expand our efforts to make deploying 5G technology to rural  communities a priority.   Most of us think today's internet is pretty fast. We get traffic  updates that are basically in real time. We receive emails seconds  after they have been sent. We stream our favorite shows at home or on  the go. But 5G will make 4G look like dialup. It will deliver  lightning-fast speeds up to 100 times faster than what today's  technology delivers. That is hard to imagine. After all, as I said,  today's technology seems pretty fast, but 5G will enable near-instant  responsiveness from our phones and other devices.   However, 5G is about a lot more than streaming more shows on more  devices or receiving emails instantly. In addition to being up to 100  times faster than current speeds, 5G will be vastly more responsive  than 4G technology, and we will be able to connect 100 times the number  of devices that can be connected with 4G. Because of this, 5G will  enable massive breakthroughs in healthcare, transportation,  agriculture, and other key industries.   5G will bring new opportunities and benefits to rural communities in  particular. 5G will pave the way for the widespread adoption of  precision agriculture, which uses tools like robotics and remote  monitoring to help farmers manage their fields and boost their crop  yields. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that precision  agriculture will reduce farmers' operational costs by up to $25 per  acre and increase farmers' yields by up to 70 percent by the year 2050.  5G will also make it easier for residents of rural communities to  access business and educational opportunities and long-distance  healthcare.   The technology for 5G is already here, and it is actually being  implemented, as Friday's event in Sioux Falls demonstrates.   There is more work to be done before 5G is a reality across the  United States. In order to deploy 5G, wireless providers need access to  sufficient spectrum, and they need to be able to deploy the  infrastructure needed to support the technology in a reasonable and  timely manner.   Last year, the President signed into law my bipartisan MOBILE NOW  Act. It was legislation that I introduced to help secure adequate  spectrum for 5G technology. Earlier this year, Senator Schatz and I  reintroduced the STREAMLINE Small Cell Deployment Act to address the  other part of the 5G equation, and that is infrastructure. 5G  technology will require not just traditional cell phone towers but  small antennas called small cells that can often be attached to  existing infrastructure, like utility poles or buildings.   While the Federal Communications Commission, under Chairman Pai, has  modernized its regulations on small cell siting, there is more work to  be done, and that is where my bill, the STREAMLINE Act, comes in. The  STREAMLINE Act will expedite the deployment of small cells while  respecting the role of State and local governments in making deployment  decisions.   Importantly, it will make it more affordable to bring 5G to rural  areas by addressing the costs of small cell deployment. 5G has  tremendous promise for rural areas, but it will only deliver on that  promise if we ensure that 5G cells are actually deployed in these  areas. I am proud that we have made a good start in South Dakota. Sioux  Falls' mayor, Paul TenHaken, has worked aggressively to remove barriers  to telecommunications investment in Sioux Falls.   Nationally, we urgently need to take action to remove the final  barriers to large-scale 5G deployment. While we have made good progress  in securing low- and high-band spectrum, China and South Korea are far  ahead of us in opening up midband spectrum to 5G. If we don't want  China or South Korea to win the race to 5G and seize the economic  benefits that 5G will bring, we need to substantially increase the  amount of midband spectrum available to U.S. companies, and we need to  do it quickly.   We also need to take action on legislation such as my STREAMLINE Act  to pave the way for the widespread deployment of 5G infrastructure.  America can lead the world in the 5G revolution. The technology is  here. We just need to take the final steps to bring 5G into our  communities.   I look forward to continuing to work to support the nationwide  deployment of 5G with all of the benefits it can bring to the American  people.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from North Carolina (Mr. Burr) and the Senator from Georgia (Mr.  Isakson).
