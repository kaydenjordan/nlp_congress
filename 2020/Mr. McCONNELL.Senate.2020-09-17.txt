 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, our Democratic colleagues have sought  to spend this week discussing election security. Well, they really have  sought to discuss absolutely anything besides pandemic relief since  their leaders are still blocking bipartisan negotiations that could  actually get a result.   So our friends across the aisle have tried to change the subject to  election security or immigration from Venezuela or anything besides the  hundreds of billions of dollars in relief they have been filibustering.   But the integrity of our democracy is a crucial issue. We are fewer  than 50 days from November 3. Every voter deserves to know their State  and local authorities are as well equipped as possible to oversee fair,  safe, and secure elections.   So let's discuss the progress made since back in 2016, the threats  still before us, and how it is when this nonpartisan issue gets  hijacked--literally hijacked--for partisan point-scoring.   Here is how the Democratic vice chair of the Intelligence Committee  described our vulnerability to foreign influence in 2016 during the  Obama-Biden administration. This is the Democratic vice chairman of the  Intelligence Committee about 2016. He said: ``We were caught flat- footed.'' ``We were caught flat-footed.''   That administration's relationships with State governments were  dysfunctional; information sharing was weak; cross-sector partnerships  hardly existed; and 8 years of weak foreign policy had emboldened Putin  to push the envelope.  [[Page S5683]]    Now, for the last 4 years, thanks to the actions of this Senate and  the leadership of the current administration, a huge number of  dedicated experts have worked hard to improve our defenses and regain  America's trust.   In 2016, the Department of Homeland Security was on an island, but  under this administration, DHS officials have built partnerships with  State and local officials who run our elections and stood up massive  intelligence-sharing efforts that connect them with Federal  authorities, the intelligence community, as well as the private sector.   In 2016, the outgoing administration hid their limited grasp of the  threat from Congress and the American people. The Trump administration  and intelligence experts have been far, far more transparent.   In 2016, only 14 State or local authorities had high-tech sensors to  detect cyberattacks. Now all 50 States--all of them--have them. The  Trump administration has imposed real pain on Russia: closing  consulates, expelling spies, sanctioning oligarchs and agents of  influence, and equipping neighbors that are threatened by Moscow to  deter further aggression.   Here in the Senate, multiple committees have become major players in  this effort. Our colleagues on the Intelligence Committee spent,  literally, years producing their 5-part, 1,300-plus-page report on what  happened back in 2016. Some of their bipartisan recommendations are  already taking effect.   And then there is funding. The Senate has led the efforts to set  aside more than $1 billion in extra election assistance, from foreign  interference to COVID-19. Through the end of the primaries, more than  70 percent of the huge sum we provided in the CARES Act is still  unspent. As recently as a few months ago, more than 60 percent of the  first tranche we provided all the way back in fiscal 2018 was still  unspent. So we have made sure money is not an obstacle.   So these threats are still with us, and they have evolved. Not only  Russia but also China, Iran, and other adversaries are looking  constantly for ways to interfere in our politics, divide Americans, and  erode confidence in our institutions. That is a fact.   The work goes on, but we certainly aren't flat-footed any longer.  This progress should be cause for bipartisan celebration, but one side  of the aisle seems to prefer pretending--pretending--there hasn't been  any progress at all.   Frankly, while nonpartisan experts worked around the clock to fight  our adversaries' destabilizing efforts, too many Democrats have been  undermining America's confidence in our democracy to the degree that  those adversaries could only dream of: baseless accusations that the  last election was stolen; casual assertions that this one, too, must be  illegitimate if they don't win.   On a monthly basis, we have heard new, hysterical pronouncements that  our democracy was on death's door. Even sensitive intelligence became  grist for the partisan mill.   This has not been universal. There has been good bipartisan work in  some committees, but the Democratic leadership appeared to make a  conscious choice: Instead of treating election security like the  unifying, bipartisan issue it ought to be, they would use it as a  partisan cudgel to hit the other side, playing right into our  adversaries' hands.   This week, the Democratic leader attacked Republicans and basically  questioned our patriotism because we did not rush to meet his latest  demands for empty theatrics. He proposes to crowd out 4 years of  bipartisan work from actual committees by inventing a brandnew Senate  committee and pull experts off the frontlines during the home stretch  for theatrical hearings here on Capitol Hill.   He says we must allocate more money. Never mind that the millions and  millions of dollars we have already set aside remain unspent. He  proposes that the administration pull experts off the frontlines to  continue briefing him. Never mind that ODNI alone has supported 53  election security briefings to Congress since 2018--53 election  security briefings to Congress since 2018. I am sure 54 will be the  magic number that finally makes our colleague a reasonable voice on  this issue.   The truth is, briefings are ongoing; the Intelligence and Armed  Services Committees will be briefed this week; and all Senators will  have access to written intelligence analysis by career professionals if  new developments arise since last month's all-Senate briefings.   The Democratic leader's demands aren't solutions. These aren't what  the experts say we need; they are just empty gestures concocted so the  Democratic leader can complain that Republicans hate democracy and  apple pie when we don't go along with them.   So remember, fear and division, reduced confidence in our democracy,  Americans divided against ourselves: that is exactly what Russia  wants--exactly. That is what China wants too. That is just what our  adversaries want to achieve, and it is exactly what the Democratic  leader helps them achieve when he turns a bipartisan national issue  that should unite us into one more pretext for partisan finger- pointing.   Our colleague from New York said recently that ``Republicans are the  enemy of the good.'' No, Republicans and Democrats are not enemies. No  fellow Americans are enemies.   Our people, our democracy, have real enemies in some corners of the  world. I expect they are absolutely thrilled to hear our own  politicians talking that way.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 603.
