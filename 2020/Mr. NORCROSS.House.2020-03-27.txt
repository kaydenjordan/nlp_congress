 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of this bill, but  also to say thank you to my brothers and sisters who are on the front  line, yes, those who work in the supermarkets, who are delivering the  mail, who keep the lights on, who keep the water running. We are  thanking them because they are making a sacrifice today.   We have always been tough. Americans are special, and we will rise to  this occasion. Fate calls us. We will answer.   We say thank you to everyone here and to all those serving America.
