 Mr. President, as Mother's Day approaches, I rise to join  my Democratic colleagues in sharing our constituents' stories about the  importance of protecting women's access to healthcare.   No matter where they live and no matter their economic status, women  in our country deserve access to comprehensive preventive care and  family planning services that will enable them to stay healthy and to  thrive. We know centers like Planned Parenthood have made a huge  difference in the lives of the women they serve. My office recently  heard from a woman named Ashley from Hooksett, who said:         I am safe, healthy, and educated thanks to Planned       Parenthood.    She continues speaking about Planned Parenthood:         When I was fifteen, they were there to help me understand       the changes that my body was going through and provide me       with the information I needed to keep myself healthy and       protected.        Throughout the rest of my teenage years, I have trusted       Planned Parenthood to provide me with all of my routine       healthcare procedures.    Ashley continues:         In more desperate times, they were there to explain my       options and support my decisions with anonymity and       compassion.    Ashley goes on to say:         I am deeply concerned about the Title 10 gag rule and the       implications it may have on my getting the care I need.        I'm thankful for elected officials who are fighting back       and speaking out for me and the thousands of people like me       who deserve access to quality, affordable care, no matter       their income or zip code.    Ashley's story is one of thousands that speak to the importance of  title X-supported health centers, including Planned Parenthood, which  are a major source of preventive care and reproductive health services,  including cancer screenings, birth control, HIV and STI tests, and  counseling services.   In New Hampshire, title X-funded centers deliver care to nearly  18,000 Granite Staters annually, and title X-supported Planned  Parenthood centers serve 60 percent of those 18,000 Granite Staters.  This is why the Trump administration's actions to discriminate against  providers and to cut investments in family planning clinics are so  dangerous, and it is why we have to keep fighting for women like  Ashley, who are rightfully concerned about this constant barrage of  attacks on healthcare.   I am going to continue standing with my Democratic colleagues on  behalf of women's constitutionally protected rights and against the  Trump administration's partisan attacks on women's access to  healthcare.
