 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition  to the absurdly titled Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.   This bill is yet another attempt by the majority to intimidate women  and providers of abortion care by imposing restrictions that are  redundant, at best, and life-threatening, at worse. Time and again,  Republicans have charged that politicians, not women and their doctors,  know what is best for women's bodies. Enough is enough.   Today is a reminder that women's reproductive rights are constantly  under attack, and I will never waver in fighting back. This bill is  completely unnecessary. It has always been illegal to kill newborn  infants, and to suggest this legislation is anything more than  redundant obstruction for women accessing healthcare is outrageous.   Instead of spending time on unnecessary legislation, my Republican  colleagues should work with Democrats to fund the government and  protect 800,000 young people, our DREAMers, from deportation to  countries they have never known.   Mr. Speaker, Americans face actual real problems every single day. So  let's get back to work.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this continuing  resolution, which is, yet again, a complete abdication of our  responsibilities.   Instead of adopting fully funded appropriations bills or an omnibus  with an actual chance of passing this Congress, we are mired in this  unbreakable habit of passing continuing resolutions.   The Republicans' most recent proposal does nothing to renew funding  for the more than 1,400 community health centers across the country or  the 25 million Americans they serve after they let funding run out in  September.   According to the National Association of Community Health Centers, if  Congress does not act soon, 28,000 sites could close, 50,000 staff  could be laid off, and 9 million Americans could lose access to care.   When did this program, which has always had bipartisan support in  this body, become a partisan issue?   These abdications are simply immoral. Our Republican colleagues say:  We don't have the money to fund these programs, but somehow they were  silent on that issue when they gave a handout to giant corporations  that add more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit.   While their donors rested peacefully over the holidays knowing that  their tax cuts were safe, Republicans continued to torment 800,000  hardworking young people by refusing to pass the Dream Act. 122  DREAMers lose their protected status every day, and Republicans have  not been brave enough to do what is right.   These courageous individuals are teaching in our schools, working in  our communities, and serving in our military.   I have had the privilege of meeting DREAMers in south Florida and in  the Halls of this Capitol. Their hopes and hard work signify what is  best about America, and by any reasonable definition, they are  Americans. This is their home.  [[Page H531]]    It is past time for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  work on a bipartisan spending package that promotes the middle class,  protects DREAMers, and finally assures the American people that their  government is working.   I simply will not support any spending bill that fails to do so. Make  no mistake, Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White  House. A government shutdown will land squarely in their lap.
