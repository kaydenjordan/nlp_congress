 Madam President, today I wish to recognize a  friend and fellow public servant of the great State of West Virginia,  John Manchester, as Friday marks his retirement from 16 years of  service as the mayor of Lewisburg, WV. Under John's leadership, the  city of Lewisburg has endured tough times, yet still flourishes as one  of the cultural epicenters for our State, nestled deep in the rolling  hills of Appalachia and the mighty Greenbrier River.   Although Mayor Manchester is not a native West Virginian, the love  for this State has rooted itself deep within him. After graduating from  Brown University, he packed his bags for Morgantown, WV, and became a  Mountaineer as he accepted a research assistantship with West Virginia  University. However, it wasn't until 1982 that these country roads  called John and his wife Connie home to the Greenbrier River Valley,  when they settled in the small town of Renick, WV.   John and his family began to grow into the fabric of the small town  with only 200 residents. First, they started their own sawmill and  entered the timber business. The harsh West Virginia winter forced John  to reconsider his line of work, and he took a job as an editor with a  newspaper, the Mountaineer Messenger. From there, John's desire to give  back to the community that had given so much to him and his family took  over, and he accepted the vacated mayor position in Renick. It would be  this experience with local government that would inspire John to run  for mayor of Lewisburg when his family moved in 2003.   Sixteen years later, Mayor Manchester still calls Lewisburg the best  small town in West Virginia. I truly believe in John's vision and  dedication for Lewisburg and can personally attest to how special of a  place that this town is. One can sense a deep communal bond in this  locale, which is a direct result of the strong character of its people  and the examples set by its leadership.   Leadership begins and ends with service. Mayor Manchester is someone  who exemplifies service, not only by his words, but by how he lives his  life every day. Three years ago, Greenbrier County experienced an  historic flood, and while Lewisburg experienced its share of high  water, it was spared the widespread devastation that hit the nearby  towns of White Sulphur Springs and Rainelle. Once Lewisburg was safe  and sound, the residents, under the leadership of John Manchester,  pulled together and took care of their neighbors throughout the  Greenbrier Valley. I appreciate and commend the leadership Mayor  Manchester showed during that difficult time and throughout his tenure  as mayor.   Mayor Manchester has many accomplishments over the past 16 years of  service as the mayor of Lewisburg. On a personal note, I would like to  thank John for his kindness to my staff and me during our many  interactions over the years. The people of Lewisburg are very fortunate  John Manchester chose to live in West Virginia and serve its residents  through his constant devotion, truly making this State and his city a  better place to live. I wish him well in his retirement. It is truly an  honor to call you friend and fellow West Virginian.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I wish to honor my friend  and the first woman mayor of the town of Rainelle, WV, Andrea ``Andy''  Pendleton. Mayor Andy, as her friends call her, has served the town of  Rainelle and Greenbrier County for the past 8 years, standing tall in  the face of adversity and some of the toughest times that the  Greenbrier River Valley has ever experienced. As the first woman  elected to the Senate from West Virginia, I greatly admire Andy's  initiative and her desire to give back to her community through public  service.   Growing up in West Virginia teaches you to be tough, it teaches you  to be respectful, and it teaches you take care of those around you. I  know by Mayor Andy's character and her desire to help others that she  holds those same West Virginia values close to her heart. To this day,  Andy credits many of the positive qualities she possesses to the time  she spent growing up in her family's discount food store, working 7  days a week. Little did she know that these fundamental lessons were  building her into the leader that the town of Rainelle desperately  needed.   The historic floods that ripped through West Virginia in June of 2016  devastated Rainelle, with almost 90 percent of homes and businesses  ravaged by the flood water. Out of the 23 West Virginians we lost on  that day, five of them were members of the Rainelle community. Mayor  Andy was on the scene immediately and worked tirelessly in the days and  months following the flood. From moving logs and rocks, alerting first  responders, and keeping the community together, she dove directly into  the flood relief process and led by example. She was tireless.   The impact that Mayor Andy has had on her community will be felt for  far longer than her tenure as mayor. She was the driving force in  securing funds to construct a new water system that efficiently  supplies clean drinking water to the people of her town. In addition,  she has also worked to replace  [[Page S4502]]  aging sidewalks, as well as other beautification and community  development projects including the Meadow River Trail. Even now, in her  final days in office, Mayor Andy continues her tireless work for  Rainelle and its recovery.   Mayor Andy and the people of Rainelle inspire me. I am incredibly  appreciative of the selfless leadership that Mayor Andy exhibits with  her actions, and I hope that it further inspires young women in her  community and across our State to rise up and be leaders and  influential voices in their community. The town of Rainelle's motto has  never been so fitting and true, largely in part to Mayor Andy: ``A Town  Built to Carry On.'' On behalf of the people of the great State of West  Virginia, I thank Mayor Andy Pendleton for her service to Rainelle. It  is truly an honor to call her a colleague and a friend.                            ____________________     Madam President, I wish to recognize a dedicated  public servant and proud West Virginian, John Schmidt, on the occasion  of his retirement from the West Virginia Ecological Services Field  Office, WVFO, of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, located in Elkins.  I would especially like to recognize his leadership and contributions  to fish and wildlife conservation. Innumerable West Virginians have  benefited from his tireless efforts to improve wildlife conditions in  our great State. John has been a vocal champion for creating a  conservation legacy through collaboration and strong working  partnerships with local stakeholders.   John has been working as a biologist for 32 years. For 25 of those,  he has served the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, working with  landowners and State and Federal agencies. Currently, he helps  nongovernmental organizations as a project leader to help restore,  enhance, and protect fish and wildlife throughout our state.   Due to his leadership, contributions, and dedication to his  community, John is being awarded the Superior Service Award by the U.S.  Department of Interior. John has highlighted the need for providing  restoring wildlife and recreational safety for West Virginians.   Beyond the critical assistance that the WVFO provides to the wildlife  in West Virginia, it also has a positive effect on the economy. John  and his staff volunteered numerous hours on a project to remove three  legacy dams, leading to savings of nearly $60,000 per year for the  municipal water system and its ratepayers. This work helped connect  over 47 miles of formerly segmented river and drastically improved the  water quality in the West Fork River.   Outside of his work for the WVFO, John has played an active role in  giving back to his community. Some of his volunteer work has included  time spent helping community leadership and conservation organizations  such as the Tygart Valley Lions Club, Ducks Unlimited, Trout Unlimited,  and the Virginia Tech Monogram Club. He has also served as a swim coach  and official for 30 years at all primary school levels. John has shown  that he is dedicated to help all West Virginians in numerous efforts.   I would like to thank John for all his insight and advice over the  years. My office has relied upon him countless times for guidance and  input. On a personal level, he was kind and helpful not only to me, but  to my staff as well. They often spoke highly of how attentive, patient,  and kind he was to everyone with whom he worked. I wish John the very  best during his well-deserved retirement, and I hope he can enjoy more  time with loved ones. West Virginia owes John our gratitude, and I  thank him for all his excellent work over his decades-long  career.                            ____________________
