 Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the  extraordinary life of Congressman Elijah Cummings. He was a trailblazer  for civil rights, a fierce advocate for equal justice, a defender of  good government, and a friend and mentor to countless people,  especially to members of the Congressional Black Caucus.   Congressman Cummings was born the son of sharecroppers and rose to  incredible heights, but he never forgot his roots. Elijah Cummings  never stopped striving to ensure every American could reach his or her  potential the way he did. He understood that we are all in this  together, that as a Nation we rise and fall as one.   I will never forget those values which he taught and lived through  his own example each and every day. We will always treasure the time we  spent together and the lessons he taught all of us. When Congressman  Cummings spoke, we listened. He helped so many of us. But Congressman  Cummings' work is far from done. It is up to us to keep marching on his  behalf and carry on the iconic legacy he has entrusted in us to carry  us forward.                            ____________________
