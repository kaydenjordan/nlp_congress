 Madam President, we have a longstanding adult literacy  crisis that affects the quality of life for individuals and families  and holds our economy back. It is time for a major expansion of adult  education. Today, I am proud to introduce bipartisan legislation--the  Adult Education Workforce Opportunity and Reskilling for Knowledge and  Success Act, or the Adult Education WORKS Act--with my colleague  Senator Young.   Adult education provides numeracy, literacy, digital literacy,  English language skills, work readiness, soft skills, high school  equivalency, and numerous wraparound services to millions of adult  learners nationwide. These essential skills can make the difference  between earning a family-sustaining wage and struggling to make ends  meet. A study commissioned by the Barbara Bush Foundation estimated  that getting all U.S. adults to the equivalent of a sixth-grade reading  level would generate an additional $2.2 trillion in annual income for  the country. Without the opportunities provided through adult education  programs, many adults will be left on the sidelines.   Estimates from the Program for the International Assessment of Adult  Competencies, PIACC, indicate that 43 million adults are low-skilled in  literacy and 63 million are low-skilled in numeracy. Building a  sustainable economy that truly works for everyone is going to require  helping these individuals acquire the basic skills they need to  succeed. Unfortunately, we are reaching only a fraction of these  individuals today. PIACC data show that 23 to 30 percent of working-age  adults with low literacy or numeracy skills wanted to participate in  adult education but were unable to do so. The Department of Education  calculates that this means there are up to 16 million adults seeking  education opportunities from programs that currently serve fewer than 1  million individuals.   In my home State of Rhode Island, there are over 61,000 adults who  could benefit from English language instruction and over 64,000  working-age adults without a high school credential. Yet, under current  funding levels, the adult education program serves just over 4,500  individuals.   The Adult Education WORKS Act provides a roadmap for addressing this  crisis. It calls for increased resources, doubling funding for adult  education by 2029. At the same time, it makes significant improvements  to the adult education system. It calls for a new emphasis on digital  and information literacy, which are essential for success in the  workplace and in navigating everyday life. It enhances the role of  adult education providers, with a special focus on public libraries and  community-based organizations throughout the workforce development  system, ensuring coordination and efficient use of resources. It  invests in the professionalization of the adult education field,  strengthening State certification policies, encouraging full-time  staffing models, and expanding professional development opportunities  and career pathways for adult educators. It provides support for  college and career navigators in public libraries and community-based  organizations to support adult learners where they live. Finally, it  invests in innovation and accountability through pilot projects that  test new approaches for measuring program performance and learner  outcomes.   In developing this legislation, Senator Young and I worked closely  with key stakeholders, working on the frontlines in the adult education  community. I am pleased to count the American Library Association, the  Center for Law and Social Policy, the Coalition on Adult Basic  Education, the National Coalition for Literacy, National Skills  Coalition, ProLiteracy, and TESOL among the supporters of this  legislation.   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and work with us  to ensure it is part of any legislation to reauthorize the Workforce  Innovation and Opportunity Act.                            ____________________     Madam President, we have a longstanding adult literacy  crisis that affects the quality of life for individuals and families  and holds our economy back.
