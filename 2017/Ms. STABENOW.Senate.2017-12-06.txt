 Mr. President, first, I want to express strong support  for Senator King's motion and for the argument that he is making about  the debt. I couldn't agree more.   I also rise to speak on my motion to instruct, which I will be  offering in just a few moments, to direct the conference committee for  this bill to add a provision that would return the corporate tax rate  to its current levels if wages do not increase by at least $4,000. That  is the promise that has been made over and over to working men and  women--that these cuts that are being made and changes that are being  made will result in at least $4,000 in increased wages, in people's  pockets. I think they have the right to know that the majority means  that when they say it and to make sure that that is written into the  final bill.   The reason for this motion is very clear. As I indicated, Republicans  have promised American families an increase in incomes of $4,000,  $7,000, even $9,000. I think that is great, and I would strongly  support that. There is no evidence that this approach will do that,  and, so far, there has not been a willingness to put language in to  guarantee that that is what will happen for middle-class working men  and women.   President Trump has called this bill, in his words, a ``great, big,  beautiful Christmas present'' for the American people. I would argue  that, in reality, at this point, it is a great, big, beautiful  Christmas present for the wealthiest 1 percent. As for middle-class  families, not so much--it is more like a lump of coal.   It keeps a loophole that let's corporations write off their expenses  when they ship jobs overseas, but if you move from one end of the  country to Michigan for a great new job, you cannot write off your  moving expenses. Big businesses can keep deducting their State and  local taxes, but, sorry, middle-class families: You can only deduct a  small portion of your State and local taxes. When they talk about  making it simpler and closing loopholes, none of that is in this bill.  In fact, oil companies will enjoy a brand new $4 billion offshore tax  loophole. Meanwhile, 87 million American households that earn less than  $200,000 a year will get a tax increase. I will say that again: 87  million American households that earn less than $200,000 will get a tax  increase. Health insurance premiums would go up 10 percent and keep  going up, while 13 million fewer people will have health insurance  coverage. If that is what is considered a great big beautiful Christmas  present, I would imagine Michigan families would say: No, I will keep  the gift receipt and take it back to the store.    Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said: ``On the personal side,  middle-income families are getting cuts and rich people are getting  very little cuts.''   Unfortunately, when added all up, he was very tricky. He said on the  personal tax side, but when adding it all up together, all of these  proposals together mean that folks like Secretary Mnuchin and others in  the Cabinet in their income brackets will be the real winners.   White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney is making promises too. He  said: ``The White House, the President, is not going to sign a bill  that raises taxes on the middle class, period.''   I assume, then, that means he will not sign this bill.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute more.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.    Thank you.   The White House also promised the average American family would get a  $4,000 raise in the tax plan. That is why I am here. What I am saying  to the folks in Michigan is, the proof is in your paycheck.   That is what this motion is all about. If my Republican colleagues  are serious about putting more money in the pockets of the middle  class, which I want to do, I urge them to support this motion. We need  to make sure that if folks are going to be promised at least $4,000  more in their wages, they get it.   This motion would say, these new tax cuts only go forward if people  get their $4,000. The proof is in their paycheck. That is what this  motion is about, and if my colleagues really believe what they are  saying and what the President has said, they will support this motion  to make sure that guarantee is there for middle-class families.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The question is on agreeing to  the compound motion.    Mr. President, I have a motion at the desk.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.   The bill clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Michigan [Ms. STABENOW] moves that the       managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the       disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the bill H.R. 1 be       instructed to insist that the final conference report       includes a provision causing the corporate tax rate to revert       to 35 percent in the event that real average household wages       do not increase by at least $4,000 by 2020 as a result of the       enactment of the bill.     Mr. President, I am making a motion to instruct the  conferees with language at the desk to put in place a guarantee that  middle-class families will receive the raises my Republican colleagues  are promising them. In other words, for people watching all of this,  the proof is in your paycheck.   This motion would direct the conference committee for this bill to  add a provision that would return the corporate tax rate to its current  rate if wages do not increase by at least $4,000. The President has  said they will. Our Republican colleagues--we saw posters all last week  saying at least $4,000; in fact, we have heard as much as $9,000.   This is important for families because corporate profits are already  at record highs and wages are at record lows. If people are really  going to get $4,000 more in their pocket in wage increases, colleagues  across the aisle should be willing to vote for this guarantee. The  proof is in their paycheck.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.   The Senator from Texas.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am coming to the floor again to focus  on the fact that the clock is ticking for families in Michigan and  across the country--men and women, children, older people, younger  people who use the community health centers, as well as those who have  their children covered under the Children's Health Insurance Program.  The Federal funding for those programs stopped September 30--67 days  ago. We have had votes. We have had bills. We have had nominations come  before us. There have been divisiveness and controversy. It would be  wonderful if we could stop for 1 day and do something that has  bipartisan support.   The fact is that CHIP covers 9 million children, and 100,000 of those  are in Michigan. We passed a bill out of the Finance Committee in  September. I want to laud our chairman, Senator Hatch, and our ranking  member, Senator Wyden. It was a bipartisan bill. There was only one  ``no'' vote. We reported it out. I assumed we would want to get this  done before September 30, when the funding ran out.   Instead, here we wait, 67 days later. There are 9 million children at  risk because of this inaction--100,000 children in Michigan.   The truth is that today, thanks to CHIP and thanks to a variety of  healthcare efforts across the country, 97 percent of the children in  our country have access to a doctor. In Michigan, it is actually  higher; it is 97 percent of our children. So if a child has juvenile  diabetes, if they have a cancer or asthma or just fall out of a tree  and break their arm or have bronchitis or the flu, whatever it is that  is happening to children, parents have the peace of mind under the  MIChild Program to know that they can take their child to a doctor whom  they have a relationship with and who knows their children, instead of  going to the emergency room.   We also know that emergency rooms are the most expensive way to  provide care. They are necessary. They are important for emergencies  but not for the daily routines of life, when someone could be seeing a  doctor. It costs more; uncompensated care costs more, and when someone  uses the emergency room when they could be seeing a doctor, then  everyone else pays for that with their insurance rates going up.   So MIChild in Michigan and the Children's Health Insurance Program  across the country work. They save money. They save lives. In fact, as  soon as January, in Michigan, families are going to start to get  notices that the funding will go away, that the medical care will go  away. It is not a great way to start the new year: Merry Christmas.  Happy New Year. Your child is not going to be able to go see their  doctor anymore. We don't have to have that happen because we have  strong bipartisan support for this.   It is the same thing with community health centers. Twenty-five  million people are able to see a doctor or a nurse and get the care  they need through a community health center in their community. There  are 300,000 veterans who are able to see a doctor through a community  health center, and there are 7.5 million children as well.   In Michigan, our health centers are all over the State. We have some  260 different clinics around Michigan that serve 681,000 people and,  again, almost 13,000 veterans. Starting in January, they are going to  begin to lose funding at different times--some in February, some in  March, some in April--because of local funding streams. But starting in  January, in Michigan, health centers are not going to have the funding  they need. The majority of their funding--70 percent of their funding-- comes through the program that expired September 30, and we know that  this also doesn't have to happen.   My friend Senator Roy Blunt and I have put in legislation. We have a  letter signed by 70 Members--not 7--70 Members of this body, over two- thirds of this body signing a letter supporting the continuation of  community health centers. Yet we can't get that brought up either.   We thought the original plan was to bring up CHIP, the Children's  Health Insurance Program, and include community health centers with it,  and get that done before September 30. The clock is ticking every  single day, and it has not been done. Folks may be trying to hold it  hostage politically for some reason or trying to work on some deal at  the end of the year. In the meantime, families are worrying, men and  women are worrying, and veterans are worrying about what is going to  happen, whether or not they are going to continue to get their  healthcare.   Let me go back to where I started. Today is 67 days, and tomorrow it  will be 68 days since the funding for two healthcare programs that have  had broad bipartisan support over the years and broad bipartisan  support today--67 days since that funding has stopped.   I would like to close with a story from a gentleman named Darin,  whose life was changed by one of Michigan's community health centers.  He shared his story with me.   Darin was an unemployed truckdriver when he moved to Jackson, MI, 4  years ago. He hadn't seen a doctor for a decade, and, in his words, he  was ``a complete mess.'' He had diabetes, congestive heart failure, and  he had no energy. He needed an oxygen tank to walk. He started seeing  Dr. Roy at the Center for Family Health, which is a great health clinic  in Jackson. He told her he didn't want to just be stable; he wanted to  get better. So they went to work so that he could get back on his feet  and get back to work.   Darin got his diabetes under control. He improved his lung function,  got rid of the oxygen tank, and quit his pain pills. Darin said:   [[Page S7882]]              I went from being . . . hardly able to move to where I feel       like I can do almost anything. Dr. Roy saw me at my lowest,       and she has seen me improve so much that she celebrates with       me. Dr. Roy kicked me in the seat of the pants, and I will       always thank her for it.    Darin got his kick in the seat of the pants, and, Mr. President, with  all due respect, I believe Members of this body could use one too.   There are 25 million people who count on community health centers for  their care--their children's care, the care of their moms and dads.  There are 9 million children who are covered under the Children's  Health Insurance Program. They have been waiting and worrying for long  enough; 67 days is long enough. I am hopeful that there will be a sense  of urgency from colleagues to get this done.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Moran). The Senator from Utah.                            ____________________
