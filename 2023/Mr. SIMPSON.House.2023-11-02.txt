 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 4821, and that I may include  tabular material on the same.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I am pleased to begin consideration of the H.R. 4821, the  fiscal year 2024 Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies  Appropriations Act.   Before I get into the bill, I commend Chairwoman Granger for her  steadfast leadership of the Appropriations Committee and her ongoing  support. I thank the ranking member of the full committee, Ms. DeLauro,  for her work on this important legislation and other things. I thank  Ranking Member Pingree for her partnership and the subcommittee members  for their work on this bill, although Ms. Pingree and I may have some  differences of opinion on this bill.   H.R. 4821 provides $25.4 billion in new nondefense discretionary  spending, which is $13.4 billion, or 35 percent, below the fiscal year  2023 level. The bill also rescinds $9.4 billion in unnecessary funding  provided to the EPA, the Presidio Trust, and the Council on  Environmental Quality through the Inflation Reduction Act.   Cutting funding is never easy or pretty, but with the national debt  in excess of $33 trillion and inflation at an unacceptable level, we  had to make tough choices to rein in Federal spending.   Last Congress alone, $3 trillion was spent outside the normal  appropriations process. That is $3 trillion that went into the national  debt.   Simply holding funding flat is not enough. We must work to curb our  out-of-control spending and get our budget back on track. This bill  does that. This legislation prioritizes critical needs within our  reduced allocation and addresses specific interests and concerns  brought to our attention through more than 8,000 Member requests.   H.R. 4821 fully funds the payments in lieu of taxes program for  fiscal year 2024, which is estimated to be $515 million. It also makes  critical investments in Indian Country by providing funding for the  Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education, and Indian Health  Service at fiscal year 2023 levels or above.   To combat catastrophic wildfires and protect communities across the  country, the bill includes a $1.6 billion discretionary increase to  fund wildfire activities without budget gimmicks. It also provides a  $2.65 billion cap adjustment for wildfire suppression activities, as  authorized.   To address these priorities while rightsizing the agencies under our  jurisdiction, the bill reduces funding for nearly every other  appropriation in the bill, and many agencies received double-digit  percentage reductions. The EPA is reduced by $4 billion, or 39 percent,  below the fiscal year 2023 level.   In terms of policy, the bill makes important steps to reduce  regulatory burdens imposed by the EPA, expand access to critical  minerals and natural resources, and promote domestic energy production.  Such efforts include halting the EPA's job-killing regulations, such as  repealing the recent waters of the United States regulations and rules  that target reliable energy sources and domestic manufacturing;  limiting abuse of the Endangered Species Act regarding species such as  the sage grouse, gray wolf, bison, and lesser prairie chicken;  expanding access to critical minerals and promoting proper management  of our Nation's forests; and requiring oil and gas lease sales. These  policies will help boost our national security, reduce energy costs,  and create American jobs.   Mr. Chairman, this bill will help manage our public lands wisely,  meet our commitment to our brothers and sisters in Indian Country, and  restore the fiscal responsibility necessary to get our economy back on  track.   Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I would just note that neither the chairwoman or the  ranking member of the full committee or the ranking member of the  subcommittee in their comments never mentioned the $33 trillion debt,  and over the last Congress, there was $3 trillion that was spent  outside of the regular appropriation process. That is what is causing  this. That is what is causing the problems in this country.    This is what reducing spending looks like. Every time you try to  reduce spending, Mr. Chairman, you would think it is nothing but death  and destruction. If I believed what was just said, I wouldn't vote for  this bill, but I think she is wrong on so many counts.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Meuser).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Carl).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Alabama.    Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman  for drawing the House's attention to the Department of the Interior and  Bureau of Land Management's responsibilities under the Mineral Leasing  Act. I would be pleased to continue to work with him on how the  agencies in this bill handle royalties on Federal lands as we move  through the FY 2024 spending process.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Yakym).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to close.   The challenge here, as I stated earlier, my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle never saw a problem that they didn't think a  government program could solve. Anybody that thought that we were not  going to have to reduce spending I think was living in a different  world. When you are facing $33 trillion and getting on to $34 trillion  in debt, the reality is you are going to have to cut spending.    Now, this is not a criticism of them. I think they honestly believe  that all the profligate spending that went on the last couple of years  was absolutely necessary. I think the American people expect us to  start addressing the debt that our children, grandchildren, and great- grandchildren are going to face, and this is what cutting spending  looks like.   It is easy to write a bill. Anybody can write a bill if you have  unlimited funds, and that is pretty much what they have had last year  and the year before. In spite of almost having unlimited funds to write  the Interior bill, they actually took $1.6 billion in wildfire fighting  costs and made it emergency spending. We had to bring it back into the  bill, where it should be, instead of using budget gimmicks. That put us  $1.6 billion behind.   We said we are not going to hurt Indian Country with this bill, even  with the cuts that we had to make. We were going to fully fund PILT  payments. We were going to make sure that we took care of those things  that were necessary, like wildfire fighting, because those costs are  going to go up. That meant the rest of the bill was going to take some  cuts. We used rescissions by pulling back some of the money that was  spent over the last several years to make sure that the cuts in this  bill were not as dramatic as they would otherwise have been. This is  still a 10 percent reduction in the overall bill.   I disagree with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Death  and destruction will not follow if we pass this bill. I encourage my  colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 838, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, this bipartisan en bloc amendment was  developed in coordination with the minority. It contains  noncontroversial amendments addressing important issues at the agencies  funded in this bill that have been agreed to by both sides.   It provides support for the Department of the Interior's efforts to  identify critical minerals in the United States. It highlights the  importance of the rural water technical assistance grants, as well as  the clean water and drinking water State revolving funds. It emphasizes  support for the Federal wildland firefighters and Bureau of Indian  Affairs road construction. Finally, it includes additional support for  research into harmful algal blooms and provides assistance to the  territories.   Mr. Chair, I support the adoption of this en bloc, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have no further speakers on this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment to  decrease funding for the Bureau of Land Management's Wild Horse and  Burro Program.   I understand the gentleman's frustration. Many of us have been  addressing this for a number of years, trying to find the right  solution. We haven't found it yet. They used to take these horses to  slaughter. You can't do that anymore. The public won't accept it, and  frankly, neither will I.   In the West, continuing the Wild Horse and Burro Program at sustained  levels is vital to controlling the population. Even with the funding  provided, BLM will not be able to manage and curb the exponentially  increasing number in the herds.   Failing to manage wild herds in the West would have devastating  effects on rangelands and all the animals that depend on them.  Therefore, I must oppose the gentleman's amendment.   Living in the West, I have seen this problem and what it does to  rangelands. If there is a better solution rather than just cutting  funding, let's hear what that better solution is because, believe me,  this committee has been working hard to try to find what to do about it  because we don't want to see these populations grow either, but it is a  reality that we have to deal with. That is why it has increased funding  in this bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, drastically reducing funding for the Wild  Horse and Burro Program would have a devastating effect on our Western  lands and the work we have done to manage the herd. For these reasons,  I must oppose this amendment.    I thank the gentleman for bringing up the issue. It is an issue, but  cutting funding is not the way to solve the problem. If people have  better ways of managing this or additional ways of managing this, I  encourage them to come forward because we are willing to listen to all  alternatives on what we can do.   As I said, we used to slaughter them. We used to send them to Mexico  for slaughter and stuff. We can't do that anymore because of the optics  of it and everything else.    Mr. Chair, we are looking at sterilization of some of  those and the success or not success rate of what we are doing, but I  guess the expert on this whole issue was the former Congressman from  Utah (Mr. Stewart). He worked on this continuously, trying to address  it, and he has since retired. That was a great loss to all of us, but  this is a perplexing problem.   Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for bringing the amendment up and  discussing it, but I must oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I understand the frustration that the  gentlewoman expresses in her statement, but I must rise in opposition  to this amendment.   The Bureau of Land Management's funding level is already $255.4  million, or 18 percent below the FY23 enacted level. A drastic 50  percent cut to already decreased levels leaves me concerned that this  would put the agency in a position where they cannot carry out critical  activities to address their most pressing issues in Western States,  particularly in Wyoming, Idaho, and other States.   The growing backlog for grazing, energy, and mineral activity  permits; population problems with wild horses and burros that were just  debated on the last amendment; and the increasing demand for increased  recreational access to our public lands cause me deep concern when you  want to cut the BLM by an additional 50 percent.   Mr. Chair, I must oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. Pingree).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1200     Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would suggest that if the gentlewoman  has a problem with the Rock Springs area, that the gentlewoman address  that specifically, but this cuts 50 percent of the BLM across the  board. That  [[Page H5274]]  means it is going to substantially impact Idaho, and guess what? We get  along pretty well with the BLM in Idaho.   If you cut this 50 percent, you are going to have tough times getting  grazing permits. We have minerals in what is called the phosphate patch  in Idaho that the BLM has to deal with.   Our general problem is when the decisions that are made in Idaho,  both by the BLM or the Forest Service or their other agencies, and  those decisions come to Washington, then you have a problem. That is  where the problem exists.   This would cut 50 percent of, actually, the BLM across the country.  That is the problem I have with this, especially when we have already  made an 18 percent reduction in their budget in this bill.   I understand where the gentlewoman is coming from. Wyoming might have  a special problem, and an amendment should be addressed to deal with  that instead of the BLM in general.   I would oppose this amendment, and I hope my colleagues would vote  ``no'' on it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   While I understand the concerns from my colleagues about the CEQ's  actions under this administration related to the environmental review  process and other issues, I believe that the CEQ has a valuable role to  play in leading the efforts to strike a balance in ensuring our  environment is protected while also promoting economic development and  job growth.   It is important to have an agency lead coordinated efforts across the  administration on issues such as conservation and preservation of our  natural resources. I would say this, though: Republicans like what CEQ  did under the previous administration. They actually liked what they  were doing. The way to change policies of an agency is by voting in a  different administration, and next year, we will have that opportunity  to see how the American people feel.   I would point out that we rescinded those funds that were given to  CEQ in this bill also, so they don't have all those funds that are left  there, and we have actually reduced the funding. I rise in opposition  to the amendment, while I understand the gentleman's concern under this  administration.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment to  strike the provision in the bill prohibiting the use of the social  costs of carbon.   The social cost of carbon attempts to monetize the impacts of  greenhouse gas emissions. What it really means is that it is an easy  way to increase the cost of a project or of anything that will produce  emissions, like driving a car, to justify regulations or halt the  activity because the costs outweigh the benefits.   This is even more problematic because this monetary value has  fluctuated wildly in past decades from $1 to $190 per metric ton. This  fluctuation tells me that the methodology and metrics are fuzzy at best  and seriously flawed at worst and have lacked transparency.   All of this is especially concerning given the social cost of carbon  is used to issue job-killing regulations and halt energy and  infrastructure projects in the United States while the world's largest  polluters are not being held accountable.   Mr. Chairman, for these reasons, I oppose this amendment, and I urge  my colleagues to do the same.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management manages  the development of energy and mineral resources of the Outer  Continental Shelf along our Nation's coastlines. I understand the  intent of the gentleman's amendment is to eliminate the Office of  Renewable Energy Programs of BOEM.   I will first note the base bill already cuts funding for the  renewable energy account by nearly $15 million, or almost 35 percent,  so about a third of it is gone in our base bill.   I am also concerned that completely eliminating funding runs counter  to an all-of-the-above energy approach that is necessary to ensure a  mix of affordable and reliable energy sources for our constituents and  businesses, and to reduce our dependence on foreign countries, some  adversaries, for our energy.   Additionally, I have heard from some in our Conference about their  support for offshore renewable activities, which would not move forward  without this BOEM office.   Mr. Chair, I must, therefore, oppose this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms.  Pingree).    Mr. Chair, as I said, I oppose this amendment. It is  contrary to what we on this side of the aisle have been preaching for a  number of years, and that is the all-of-the-above energy program. It is  going to take nuclear. It is going to take coal. It is going to take  oil. It is going to take, yes, wind and solar. That is going to be a  part of the mix. That is just the reality.   We don't mean that every mile of offshore area ought to be available  for wind towers in the ocean, but there are some places that are. I  would oppose cutting the BOEM renewable energy office completely, and I  would urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment which seeks to  eliminate funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. While I  support the gentleman's spending, this bill already significantly  reduces funding including the NEA. The bill also requires--and this is  what is important to me, frankly--that the NEA allocate at least 40  percent of its grant funding to State and local communities.   Now, the gentleman mentioned the $24 billion that was given privately  to the arts throughout the country. The problem is none of that $24  billion goes to support an arts organization in Jerome, Idaho; or in  Shelley, Idaho; or in Sandpoint, Idaho.   What I emphasize every time I talk to the director of the National  Endowment for the Arts is that I am concerned about the arts in rural  communities. I have gone out to communities throughout my district and  met with these arts councils about what they do. Their funding is  completely reliant--maybe completely is too broad a word--but  substantially reliant on the grants that they get from the National  Endowment for the Arts.   Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment.                                time  1315     Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment, which  seeks to eliminate all funding for the National Endowment for the  Humanities.   While I understand the gentleman's intent to reduce spending-- something that I agree with--the reality is that is exactly what we  have been doing in these bills.   I have seen firsthand the impact that the NEH dollars have had in my  district. In fact, I contribute annually to the Idaho Endowment for the  Humanities. NEA grants allow rural communities, including veterans and  students, to have access to historical, cultural, and educational  resources that wouldn't otherwise be available to them.   What I have seen that works--and, again, I have been around to a lot  of the different grants that are received--they are preserving our  history. That is exactly what they are doing. I support their efforts,  and, therefore, I object to this amendment and hope my colleagues will  oppose it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would just say that I am very disappointed  that the gentleman doesn't agree with us that we ought to reduce  spending because that is what these bills have been doing. Anybody who  suggests we are going to stop the debt clock overnight is living in a  fantasy world, but we are actually reducing spending.   The Appropriations Committee is the only committee in this Congress  that is actually reducing spending. They are tough choices, but we have  been making those tough choices. I wish the rest of Congress would  also.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. Pingree).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, first, let me say that I am not totally  opposed to what the gentleman is trying to do. I think these air tours  are important, but I think it is wrong to say they can't place any  limitations on them.   The gentleman raises the point that they have been trying to address  this for a number of years, and so far, they haven't been able to do  it. I think that they need to be able to do that, and the Park Service  ought to be able to look at the number of air tours.   I am not opposed to air tours. I think they are a great thing. I have  taken a few of them. The reality is that completely eliminating the  Park Service's ability to make reasonable limitations on these, I  think, is the wrong way to go. It goes too far, but I understand what  the gentleman is trying to say and what he is trying to do. I just  don't think we can go this far.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment, but I rise mainly  to explain what the special hiring authority is.   The so-called title 42 special hiring authority was provided to the  Department of Health and Human Services to allow the agency to pay  individuals above the GSA pay scale. The authority was created to allow  the agency to compete with private-sector salaries for the Nation's  best healthcare experts and scientists, given the critical importance  of human health and the Federal role in public health.   Congress then provided the EPA with this authority for the first time  in 2006. It was authorized by Congress in 2006, arguing that the EPA  also conducts human health work, such as research and assessment of  chemicals. Most recently, the authority of the EPA was renewed in the  fiscal year 2022 spending year, which capped the total number of people  who could be hired using this special authority to 100 people.   The current authority expires at the end of fiscal year 2025. This  amendment allows current individuals to continue to be paid using the  special authority but blocks any additional staff from being hired  under this authority.   Remember, this expires at the end of 2025, and I would hope that the  authorizing committees would take it up and decide what they want to do  in the future, but not do this through an amendment.   I understand the gentleman's very longstanding concerns with this  authority at EPA, and I agree that appropriate oversight needs to be  provided so that this authority is not abused, but I do oppose this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Bucshon) having assumed the chair, Mr. Fallon, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4821)  making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment,  and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Flood) having assumed the chair, Mr. Bergman, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4821)  making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment,  and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I guess it is time I got off my rear-end here  and talked a little bit.   I want to let people know why I have opposed all the Holman rule  amendments that have come before us. I think I screwed up on one and  voted the wrong way, but I have opposed all of them for a number of  reasons.   The Holman rule was originally put in place and then it was kind of  repealed over the last couple of Congresses and then put in place. If  you look back at the history of it, through the whole appropriations  process, I can only remember one or two times when the Holman rule was  actually used. It was used because the individual had committed  criminal activity. That is why they cut the salary. Obviously, it  didn't pass, but that was the intent behind it.   The second reason is that I question the constitutionality of the  Holman rule altogether. We don't have the authority to fire someone in  the administration. We don't have the authority to fire them. This is a  way to get around that by reducing someone's salary to a dollar. You  have essentially fired them unless they can live on a dollar for a  year. I don't know many people who can do that. This is a way to get  around what our constitutional responsibility is, I believe.   Believe me, I don't always agree. In fact, I seldom agree with the  Bureau of Land Management's decisions on a lot of things. Elections  have consequences. If you disagree with them because of a policy, why  do you think they were hired? They were hired to carry out the policies  of this administration. Maybe you don't like those policies. I don't  like some of those policies. That is a good reason to get off our rear- ends and make sure that we eliminate this administration about 12  months from now.   It is not a reason to reduce someone's salary because they are  implementing a policy for the administration that hired them. That is  why I haven't supported any of the Holman rules because nobody stood up  here and said they believe they have engaged in criminal activity. I  haven't heard it. Until I do, I will continue to oppose these  amendments.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, all I know is if you reduce my salary to a  dollar, you effectively fired me.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I have listened very carefully so far. So far  I  [[Page H5341]]  haven't heard anything that is not a policy difference. Again, I will  repeat: Elections have consequences. Again, I will tell you I don't  think this is constitutional. I don't believe it has ever been  litigated, but it is a way of getting around the fact that we don't  have the ability to fire somebody within the administrative branch of  government.   Now, if this had been someone like the EM director who was caught  stealing suitcases at airports and that kind of stuff, I have got no  problem with that. He needs to be fired, and he was fired.   Nevertheless, so far I haven't heard anything that would indicate  that the Secretary is doing any more than carrying out the policies for  which she was hired.   Again, elections have consequences.   Instead of doing these types of amendments, why don't we get busy and  try to elect a new administration in about 14 months?   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2140     Mr. Chair, so far, I have heard accusations, but I  haven't heard anything. Has she been convicted of any of this kind of  stuff? I don't know. I haven't heard of any of that. Believe me, I  disagree with the Secretary on a lot of issues. So far all I have heard  is policy.   Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. Pingree).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Rose) having assumed the chair, Mr. Moran, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4821)  making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment,  and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 12 o'clock and 3 minutes  a.m.), the House adjourned until today, Friday, November 3, 2023, at 9  a.m.                            ____________________
