 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about  the threat that is posed by communist China.   China's economy has grown sevenfold in just the last two decades.  China already has a million members in terms of active-duty soldiers.  China also has the largest navy in the world. That is right--it is now  larger than ours, and the Chinese military is not stopping. China plans  to build more than 100 new ships in the next 8 years, and in those same  8 years, China is also building about 300 missile silos and plans to  have 1,000 nuclear missiles. Several times this year, China has tested  hypersonic weapons capable of use around the world. At the same time,  the world has witnessed increasing Chinese aggression. China's goal is  unmistakable: It truly wants to become the world's one dominant power.   Since day 1, the Biden administration has been caught flatfooted as  President Joe Biden has been soft on China. This is no surprise given  the fact that Joe Biden has been soft on China for 50 years. When he  was Vice President, he said:         A rising China is a positive . . . development, not only       for China but for America and the world writ large.    During his run for President, Candidate Joe Biden said China was not  a threat to the United States. During his announcement speech when he  was announcing he was going to be a candidate for President, he said:         They're not bad folks. They're not competition for us.    Joe Biden should tell that to the working families in factory towns  who have been put out of business by communist China. He should tell  that to the families who lost loved ones to fentanyl and other opioids  made in China. He should tell that to the Uighurs and ethnic minorities  persecuted and used as slave labor by the Communist Party.   I have to tell you, leaders on both sides of the aisle here have been  shocked by those comments by then-candidate for President Joe Biden.  Many Democrats recognize the danger posed by communist China.  Regrettably, our President, Joe Biden, is not one of them.   On issue after issue, the Biden administration's policies are only  making China stronger, and at the same time, that makes America weaker.  I want to just mention a few.   President Biden's first budget proposed to basically supersize the  Government of the United States--huge budget increases in every  government Agency you can think of except for two. The two were Defense  and Homeland Security.   His political appointees at the Pentagon seem more focused on climate  change and ``dissident ideologies'' and vaccine mandates than on  security threats to our Nation.   While China's military is growing, ours is going broke and ours is  going woke. That is the difference fundamentally today.   Joe Biden has stopped America's policy of helping developing  countries use fossil fuels to eliminate poverty and grow their  economies. Who are these other countries turning to for help now? Well,  they are turning to communist China.   Joe Biden seems to be doing everything he can to shut down coal  production here in America. Wyoming is proud to be America's leading  coal producer, and we have been for 35 years straight. Coal is the most  affordable and reliable energy source known to man. Yet Joe Biden is  determined to drive down coal production and drive energy jobs  overseas.   China is not making this same mistake. China is acting in its own  self-interest. China is producing and using more coal than ever before.  China is also funding the construction of coal-fired powerplants as  part of their Belt and Road Initiative.   The Biden administration and the Democrats have also put a big  Christmas present to China in their reckless tax-and-spending spree  because the bill includes trillions of dollars in new taxes on American  businesses. As a result, some of our tax rates are going to be higher  than those in China. It is going to make it cheaper to do business  overseas, and that is exactly what many companies will do.   According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, the taxes in this bill  that the Senate is trying to push on the Democrats' side of the aisle  and Republicans are trying to stop--the taxes in the bill will  eliminate 125,000 American jobs.   Democratic giveaways for electric vehicles will also send additional  money directly to China. Electric vehicles use lithium batteries. A  critical mineral necessary for those batteries relies on child labor in  cobalt mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and slave labor in  China. At the same time, Democrats' spending bill would virtually end  mining on Federal lands here at home. Instead of getting the minerals  we need at home in Wyoming, we are going to get them from China.   More than a million Muslims in the western part of China have been  put into slave labor camps. In many cases, those people are forced to  make solar panels.   Last week, Senator Rubio offered an amendment to the Defense bill to  ban imports from Chinese companies using slave labor. This is the same  legislation that this Senate passed unanimously in July.   Yet now Democrats are kowtowing to an administration weak on China,  and are blocking Senator Rubio's proposal.   Why have the House Democrats failed to move forward on this critical  issue?   According to the Washington Post, it is because the Biden  administration asked them to.   The Washington Post reports: ``While the administration supports the  legislation in public, they are asking Democrats to essentially water  it down in private''--that from the Washington Post.   On issue after issue, Democrat policies are only making America  weaker and making China stronger. It is no wonder only a quarter of  Americans approve of how President Biden is handling China.   On Monday, the President announced the United States will boycott  next year's Olympics in Beijing. This is a good first step, but it is  not enough. Symbolism is not enough. It is time for Democrats to wake  up from this threat from communist China before it is way too late.   I yield the floor.
