 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, our national debt  eclipsed $33.8 trillion. This means that we have now crossed a  dangerous new threshold of over $100,000 of debt for every man, woman,  and child in the United States.   This rampant and wasteful spending has only been made worse by  President Biden's reckless budgets that have led to soaring inflation  and more pain for Pennsylvanians.   From canceling student loans to handing out cash reimbursements for  electric vehicles, Joe Biden has shown that he is more worried about  appeasing his far-left base than our financial well-being.   In the past year, the average family was forced to pay an additional  $11,000 to cover the cost of just everyday goods.   It is time to cut spending and stop borrowing from China to pay for  reckless liberal policies.   The trillions of dollars that we pay in interest on this debt does  nothing to keep our Nation safe. It does nothing to fund Medicare. It  does nothing to secure our open southern border.   It is time to pass a Federal budget that addresses our debt and puts  an end to the mismanagement of our finances brought on by President  Biden's Green New Deal initiatives.             Biden Administration Imposes Burdensome Regulations     Mr. Speaker, far too often, we have seen  the Biden administration impose onto American energy producers  burdensome regulations that only serve to drive up costs and limit  production.   Instead of turning to power sources like natural gas, oil, or  propane, President Biden has focused his attention on using taxpayer  dollars to subsidize inadequate and unreliable projects like windmills  and solar farms.   In places without gas pipelines, which have been difficult to build  due to the President's own actions, power alternatives like propane can  be a vital tool in order to keep refrigerators cold and our homes warm.   We have heard from experts who have testified to the dangers of  potential rolling blackouts this winter as our grid struggles to meet  demand without the aid of coal-fired plants that have been a  cornerstone of our energy production literally for decades. As we look  to confront these potential blackouts, it is critical that we utilize  energy resources that are so abundant in Pennsylvania.    We cannot afford to waste any more time investing in Green New Deal  initiatives. It is time to return to our baseload power and ensure that  our families are protected from energy blackouts.                            ____________________
