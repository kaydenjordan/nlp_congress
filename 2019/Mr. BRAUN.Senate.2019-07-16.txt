 Madam President, it is true. I am a mainstream  entrepreneur, and I have been involved with business my entire life,  including the farm markets. I started a turkey farm back in 1979 from  scratch, and I was involved in it for 32 years. I sold my share of it  to my partner's kids and grandkids. My wife has had a business in  downtown Jasper, my hometown, for years.   I have been an entrepreneur. I have dealt with how hard the  marketplace is even when things are going well.   I stand to make the point on behalf of Hoosier farmers and businesses  and to express my strong opinion that we need to get the USMCA across  the finish line.   This agreement is vital to secure our hard-fought market access for  American agriculture. At a time when agriculture could never have more  challenges, from chronically low prices to the increasing concentration  among farmer-suppliers with big corporations, this is one piece of  uncertainty we need to eliminate.   In stressing the importance of the USMCA, I would state that despite  the fact NAFTA had its faults, it was quite successful in securing  markets for farmers. The USMCA is better. It provides stronger access  to Canadian markets for U.S. milk, wheat, poultry, and egg products. It  ensures that Hoosier wine and spirit makers are treated fairly on  Canadian shelves. And it secures the Mexican market for Indiana pork,  cheese, and grain.   The USMCA improves on NAFTA in other areas of the economy as well. It  adds modern rules for digital trade and stronger protections for  American intellectual property. We know how important that is with  regard to dealing with the Chinese.   It contains new rules of origin that ensure more manufacturing is  conducted in North America and has brand-new rules to bring more of  that production back to the United States.   When President Trump ran for office, he ran on a few simple things,  and negotiating a NAFTA improvement was one of his core promises to the  American public. At the time, Congress had two requests: Follow the  guidelines from the trade promotion authority and move quickly--move  quickly--to minimize uncertainty. President Trump upheld his end of the  bargain. He has delivered an agreement that is better than the original  NAFTA in nearly every respect.   This week Congress is ready to vote, and yet we can't. Why? Because  House Democrats will not bring it to the floor. Don't believe me? Look  at this letter, dated July 8, from several House Democrats.   They say in plain English: Do not send this agreement to the  Congress. Do not send this agreement to the Congress.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record a letter dated July 8, 2019, to Robert Lighthizer.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                      Congress of the United States,                                        House of Representatives,                                       Washington, DC, July 8, 2019.      Hon. Robert Lighthizer,      Office of the U.S. Trade Representative,      Washington, DC.        Dear Ambassador Lighthizer: We appreciate all the work you       have done with the New Democrat Coalition and the rest of the       Democratic caucus to resolve the outstanding issues that must       be addressed for a successful, bipartisan passage of the       updated North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).        These conversations have been frank, productive and engaged       in in good faith by all parties, and we are therefore       optimistic that these limited concerns can be addressed in a       timely manner. While we appreciate your willingness to       listen, we have not seen any meaningful progress or tangible       proposals from you to address these concerns. It has been       clear from the outset that such proposals are necessary for a       successful resolution.        The New Democrat Coalition was integral in the development       and passage of the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities       and Accountability Act of 2015 (TPA). It is our belief, as       legislators intimately involved with the law under which the       new NAFTA was negotiated, that moving forward with       implementing legislation absent the agreement of Democratic       leadership would almost certainly be taken as a failure to       fulfill the consultation requirements of TPA. We were       troubled that you sent up the draft Statement of       Administrative Action on May 30  [[Page S4841]]       without sufficient consultation, and strongly urge you not to       make the same mistake twice.        We look forward to continuing to work with you to develop       these proposals to help ensure a strong, bipartisan vote on       the updated NAFTA later this year.            Sincerely,      Derek Kilmer,        Chair, New Democrat Coalition.      Rick Larsen,        Co-Chair, NDC Trade Task Force.      Suzan DelBene,        Vice-Chair for Policy, New Democrat Coalition.      Gregory Meeks,        Co-Chair, NDC Trade Task Force.      Ron Kind,        Co-Chair, NDC Trade Task Force.      Lizzie Fletcher,        Co-Chair, NDC Trade Task Force.    Madam President, this is an outrage. We are ready to pass  the USMCA. Today you will hear from Senators who support this deal. In  the Senate we have more than enough votes to pass the USMCA. There is  no reason to wait.   The Democrats have known the contents of this deal for over 2 years.  They knew the provisions offered by the United States and saw the text  as it developed. Once the final text was released, the Democrats were  stunned. They couldn't figure out how to oppose the USMCA.   First, they argued that Mexico needed to pass its labor reforms.  Mexico did so in April. Then, they moved the goalpost, arguing that  labor and environmental provisions in the deal were not strong enough,  even though the provisions in USMCA are substantially stronger than  those in the NAFTA, an agreement that some of them supported.   They still want to move the goalpost. In fact, the USMCA is the  first-ever trade agreement to contain provisions requiring a minimum  wage for Mexican auto workers. The Democrats still aren't happy. This  time they are asking for enforcement. In response, the Mexican  President issued assurances that Mexico would enforce the new labor law  Democrats had demanded. But Nancy Pelosi is keeping those goalposts  moving. The fact of the matter is that the Democrats are blocking USMCA  because they do not want to give President Trump a win--the worst of  all reasons and what makes this place so objectionable to so many  people.   In the meantime, NAFTA remains the law of the land. While they play  their political games American workers are still competing under the  old NAFTA rules. It is time for Nancy Pelosi to end these political  games. We need to pass the USMCA.   In closing, I simply would remind my colleagues that this trade  debate is unlike any other this Chamber has ever made. The USMCA is the  first-ever renegotiation of a major trade agreement. We are not talking  about whether we should have an agreement with our Mexican and Canadian  partners, because we already do. Instead this debate is about the  future of that relationship. Do the American people want the rules in  the original NAFTA or do they want the modern protections included in  the USMCA?   The USMCA is a substantially better agreement than NAFTA, and the  American economy--Hoosiers--need these new rules so that we can move  forward into the 21st century with a stronger American economy in the  North American region. It is time to pass the USMCA now.   I yield my time.
