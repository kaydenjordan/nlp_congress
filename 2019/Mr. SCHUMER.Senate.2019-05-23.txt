 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, there is a lot of partisan squabbling  that goes on around here. We all know that. Some of it is to be  expected. After all, our parties have real disagreements about policy  and the direction in which we think the country should go.   But there are a few issues that are too important to get caught up in  the typical partisan back-and-forth--a few fundamental responsibilities  that we must fulfill as a governing body.   One of those responsibilities where there has always been bipartisan  agreement has been disaster relief. Hurricanes, fires, and floods don't  hit only Republicans or only Democrats. They hit Americans of all  stripes. We must come together to provide relief for everybody.   After holding up disaster relief on behalf of the President, who  demanded we shortchange Puerto Rico, Republicans finally came around a  few weeks ago and agreed with a disaster relief bill that would provide  relief to everyone.   Let me repeat. We have an agreement right now on where and how to  provide relief for Americans in the Midwest, in the South, in the West,  and in the Territories. Chairman Shelby and Vice Chairman Leahy have  worked in good faith to reach that compromise. The House will accept  it. Chairman Lowey and Ranking Member Granger also have agreed to this  disaster relief package. So there is a package of disaster relief that  is ready to go.   Unfortunately, that agreement has become entangled with extraneous  issues. However important these other issues may be, we have an  obligation to get this disaster relief package over the finish line  before the congressional Memorial Day work period.   Ranking Member Leahy and I would like to make it clear to my friend  the  [[Page S3067]]  Republican leader that Senate Democrats are ready to pass the  bipartisan disaster relief package that has already been agreed to and  written.   We should leave out extraneous issues. There are many. Everyone wants  to put in their own thing. Leave them for another day.   Democrats are willing to work hard to expedite consideration of that  agreement. We are ready to work with our Republican colleagues to pass  it as quickly as possible.   I understand that there is some discussion going on in the House, but  if we can't come to an agreement this morning on the extraneous issues  that the House is discussing, we should set those issues to the side.  We should pass the disaster agreement as is and return to those  unrelated issues at a later date. The people of the Midwest, of the  South, of the West, and of the Territories have waited long enough.  They have waited long enough.   There are millions of Americans still recovering from having their  homes destroyed, their crops devastated, their property burnt. They  have waited for relief for too long already. They are clamoring for it.  They have said to Congress: Put aside your differences and get  something done. The plan that I outlined will do just that--put aside  the differences and get something done.   Whether it is the President or Members of the House or Senate-- Democrat or Republican--who want to add extraneous issues, step aside  at least for this time. Let's get it done. Let's not delay any longer.                            ____________________     Madam President, on infrastructure, yesterday, as  everyone knows, Speaker Pelosi and I met with the President and a group  of other Senators and Congress Members to discuss the prospects for a  bipartisan infrastructure bill.   We went to the meeting with high hopes. The President, 3 weeks  earlier, had said he would be willing to do a $2 trillion  infrastructure bill and tell us how we would pay for it. Unfortunately,  it was a very short meeting. The President walked out after a few  minutes with the paltry excuse that he would not work to get things  done for Americans unless Congress abdicated its constitutional duty to  provide oversight of the executive branch.   His motives were transparent. He knows darn well that these  investigations should and will go forward. He had nothing to say on  infrastructure. It was typical of the President. He boasts that he  wants to do something and then has no followthrough. This  administration has become an erratic, helter-skelter, get-nothing-done  administration. Even on infrastructure, where there is usually  bipartisan agreement, he couldn't even come to the table and talk. He  had to throw a temper tantrum and walk out.   Presidents throughout our history have worked with the other party  while being investigated. They know--every President knows--it is a  fact that Congress will do oversight. Some of it will not be pleasant  for any President. President Obama didn't like oversight; President  Bush didn't like oversight; President Clinton didn't like oversight;  President H.W. Bush didn't like oversight; President Reagan didn't like  oversight. But none of them, Democrat or Republican, said: I am going  to stop the government from functioning. I am going to refuse to help  hundreds of millions of Americans who need help in one way or another  because I don't like Congress fulfilling its constitutional  responsibility.   The bottom line is simple. The President was merely looking for any  excuse, however inelegant, however transparent, to wriggle out of  working with Democrats on a much needed infrastructure bill.   Nothing about yesterday's meeting at the White House changes the fact  that we have serious infrastructure demands in our country. Nothing  about yesterday's meeting changes the fact that a substantial  investment in infrastructure can boost our economy, put millions of  Americans to work, create green jobs and green energy sources, and meet  the ever-growing demands of the new 21st century.   We came to the meeting with the President with serious intentions to  work with him on a large bipartisan bill. He had asked the night before  in his letter where we wanted to put the money. I brought to him a 35- page proposal with ideas on how to craft one. We talked about what  needs to be done: repairing and rebuilding our old roads and bridges,  water and sewer, building a power grid so that we can bring clean  energy from the parts of the country blessed with wind and sun to other  parts of the country in need of energy, dealing with infrastructure in  a way that creates broadband for all of the rural and inner city homes  that don't have it, creating green jobs, encouraging electric and other  kinds of vehicles that will reduce the output of carbon into the air,  and creating much more energy-efficient homes and schools.   There are many demands. It was a comprehensive proposal. The  President might not agree with all of it, but we were there, prepared  to roll up our sleeves, work, and come up with a plan.   Unfortunately, the President had no plan. Despite his promise 3 weeks  earlier that he would have a plan, he had none. Two nights before, he  had said: Well, let's not discuss infrastructure until we discuss USMCA  and NAFTA. Then, that morning, he didn't even take a seat. He stood up,  obviously agitated, and said that the investigations were wrong and  stalked out.   We left the meeting disappointed in both the President's decision and  demeanor. But America can be assured that Democrats will try to find  ways to move the ball forward on this important issue of roads,  bridges, broadband, and power--with or without the President.   Democrats believe in infrastructure, plain and simple. We believe  that our infrastructure is an urgent priority of the country and this  Congress. We believe we need to rebuild existing infrastructure--the  roads, bridges, ports, and sewers. We need to build the infrastructure  of tomorrow, such as wind, solar, a new power grid, and broadband for  rural and inner city America.   We believe our next investment in infrastructure must be substantial.  We believe we can pay for it without asking the middle class to  shoulder the burden.   We believe a new 21st century infrastructure program is one of the  very best ways to create millions of long-term, good-paying jobs, to  boost our economy, and to help combat climate change.   So I say to my Republican colleagues in the Senate: Despite the  President's unwillingness to work on anything that benefits the  American people, according to him, let's move forward on an  infrastructure bill. Let's put together a large, strong, well-funded,  and clean infrastructure bill.   Members of both sides should want the opportunity to work on  something that will benefit every constituency in every State in  America. Members should want to tell the American people that they are  working to bring jobs to their States, broadband to rural and  underserved urban communities, to work together to improve the economy  and the environment with a clean, green infrastructure bill. There is  no reason why the Senate should not pursue a bipartisan infrastructure  bill.   Congress has taken the lead before. Congress can take the lead again,  no matter what the President does. Just because President Trump doesn't  want to lead doesn't mean that our work on infrastructure is over--not  by a long shot.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin)  is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin)  is necessarily absent.
