 Madam Speaker, behind me is a sign that has decorated  the office doors of my Republican colleagues for the past few months. I  agree with the sentiment and I thank the Capitol Police Officers for  their heroic defense on January 6, and every day that they protect the  seat of this Nation's government.   My problem is that 175 of my Republican colleagues, many who still  have this sign on their doors, voted against an independent bipartisan  commission to investigate the causes of the January 6 insurrection.   Capitol Police Officers suffered debilitating physical and mental  trauma, and two lost their lives because of the events of that day.  Unless we understand how this act of terror was accomplished and hold  those who are responsible accountable for their actions, it could  happen again.   So why did so many Republicans vote against the commission?   Because they are afraid of what could be found. They are afraid that  it could affect their future elections.   This is hypocrisy at its ugliest. While Republicans in Congress pay  lip service to the Capitol Police and their heroism, they are too  cowardly to back a commission that would shed light on the terrorist  attack that put the brave women's and men's lives in danger on that  terrible day.                            ____________________
