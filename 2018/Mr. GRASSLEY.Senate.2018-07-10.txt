 Mr. President, last evening I joined many of my Senate  colleagues at the White House as the President introduced Judge Brett  Kavanaugh to serve as an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.  Judge Kavanaugh is one of the most widely respected judges in the  country. I heard the President last night refer to him as a judge's  judge. He is an outstanding choice to serve as a Justice of the Supreme  Court.   Judge Kavanaugh is a former law clerk of the Justice he has been  nominated to replace, and that is Justice Kennedy. I talked about  Justice Kennedy's service on the Supreme Court and to the people of  this country in my speech yesterday. Judge Kavanaugh earned both his  undergraduate and law degrees from Yale University. He then clerked for  judges on the Third and Ninth Circuit before joining the chambers of  Justice Kennedy as a law clerk. He served in the Office of the  Solicitor General and also the Office of the Independent Counsel.   After several years in private practice, Judge Kavanaugh returned to  public service, working in the White House Counsel's office and as  staff secretary for President George W. Bush. In 2006, he was confirmed  to the DC Circuit, where he has served since. He is also a well- regarded law professor at Harvard, Yale, and Georgetown.   Judge Kavanaugh is a leader not only in the law but throughout his  community. As examples, he volunteers at Catholic Charities on a  regular basis and coaches both daughters' youth basketball teams.   The committee has received a letter from former law clerks of Judge  Kavanaugh, people who represent views across the political and  ideological spectrum. Many judges describe their former law clerks as  adopted family members. In other words, law clerks know their judges  best.   So I turn to what some of those said through letters they sent to our  committee. Judge Kavanaugh's former law clerks write that he is a  person with immense ``strength of character, generosity of spirit,  intellectual capacity, and unwavering care for his family, friends,  colleagues, and us, his law clerks.''   I want to read a longer quote from that letter.         He is unfailingly warm and gracious with his colleagues no       matter how strongly they disagree about a case, and he is       well-liked and respected by judges and lawyers across the       ideological spectrum as a result. . . . He always makes time       for us, his law clerks. He makes it to every wedding, answers       every career question, and gives unflinchingly honest advice.       That advice often boils down to the same habits we saw him       practice in chambers every day: Shoot straight, be careful       and brave, work as hard as you possibly can, and then work a       little harder.    His judicial record is extraordinary. The Supreme Court has adopted  his view of the law in a dozen cases. Judge Kavanaugh's opinions  demonstrate profound respect for the Constitution's separation of  powers. He understands that it is Congress' job to pass laws, and where  he sits, in judicial chambers, it is the role of those people--and he  figures it is his role--to faithfully apply those laws as Congress  intended. That is why his opinions emphasize that judges must focus on  the text and apply laws as written by those of us elected to the  Congress, not by unelected and, in turn, largely unaccountable, Federal  judges. It is meant that they aren't to be accountable except to the  Constitution and the laws of this country. Courts may not rewrite laws  to suit their policy preferences.   Judge Kavanaugh has a record of judicial independence. He has shown a  willingness to rein in executive branch agencies when they abuse or  exceed their authority. You don't have to be in Congress very long to  understand that it is a daily habit of people in the executive branch  of government to go way beyond--or to feel their way, way beyond--what  the law allows that person or that program to do. As Judge Kavanaugh  has explained in numerous opinions, executive branch agencies may not  assume more power than Congress has specifically granted them, and he  has emphasized that judges may not surrender their duty to interpret  laws to executive branch agencies. Now, that is pretty common sense for  anybody who has had eighth grade civics, high school government, or  political science classes in college, but it isn't something that all  judges agree with.   The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing for Judge  Kavanaugh's nomination in the coming weeks.   As I noted in my remarks to this body yesterday, liberal outside  groups and Democratic leaders decided weeks ago to block whomever the  President nominates. They are already pushing feeble arguments to cause  needless delays. For example, some Democratic leaders and Democratic  Members of the Senate who aren't leaders say that we shouldn't confirm  a nominee nominated during a midterm election year. Where did they get  that idea? The Senate has never operated the way they would suggest.  Sitting Justices Breyer and Kagan--prominent examples that I can freely  give to you but also numerous of their predecessors--were nominated and  confirmed in midterm election years. Where do my colleagues get that  idea, that just because this is a midterm election year, you can't take  up these nominations? It happens that Kagan was approved in August  2010, as an example.   The American people see this argument for what it is--obstruction,  pure  [[Page S4867]]  and simple. After all, Democratic leaders announced that they will  oppose anyone nominated by President Trump--anyone. In fact, some  Democratic Senators announced their opposition to Judge Kavanaugh mere  minutes after the President nominated him. It is clear that a number of  my Democratic colleagues have chosen the path of obstruction and  resistance, not, as the Constitution offers, every Senator giving  advice and consent.   We have a highly qualified nominee who has authored numerous  influential judicial opinions. I stated how they have been respected  even when those same cases got to the Supreme Court. Leading liberal  law professor Akhil Reed Amar endorsed Judge Kavanaugh in the pages of  the New York Times. But some of my colleagues can't even bring  themselves to at least consider Judge Kavanaugh's nomination.   As I mentioned yesterday, liberal outside groups and their allies are  trying to convince Senators to ask Judge Kavanaugh his views on  specific cases and Supreme Court precedent. I want to emphasize that  these questions are inappropriate. In greater detail, I said that  yesterday.   Justice Ginsburg announced--a famous statement of hers--during her  own confirmation hearing that a nominee should offer ``no hints, no  forecasts, no previews'' of cases that can potentially come before the  Court.   Maybe some of my colleagues think, well, if some are going to come in  a couple of months after you are on the Court, why can't you give us  your views on that? But they might be asking questions about something  10 years down the road, so how legitimate are the views? Are you going  to overturn this President, or are you going to rule this particular  way in a particular case?   We also have Justice Kagan declining to state her views on Roe v.  Wade, saying: ``The application of Roe in future cases, and even its  continued validity, are issues likely to come before the Court in the  future.''   So you expect a Justice to look at the facts of a case, look at the  law, or look at the Constitution, and leave their own personal views  out of it, but you expect them to do it independent of anything they  said in their hearing before the Judiciary Committee because nothing  should be said there that is going to influence something 10 years down  the road.   I expect that Judge Kavanaugh will likewise decline to comment on his  views of particular cases decided by the Supreme Court.   I congratulate Judge Kavanaugh on this nomination. I had the  opportunity to meet with Judge Kavanaugh earlier today. I know he looks  forward to answering questions from my colleagues in the coming weeks.  I look forward to hearing from him again when he appears before our  Senate Judiciary Committee.   I yield the floor.
