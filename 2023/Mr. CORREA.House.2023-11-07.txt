 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life of my good  friend Bishop Emeritus Tod Brown, who recently passed away at the age  of 86.   Bishop Brown led our diocese for 14 years in a community that is now  50 percent Roman Catholic. Under his leadership, the diocese more than  doubled in its membership, and by the year 2012, there were more than  1.2 million Roman Catholics in Orange County, California.   In recognizing the diversity of our church, Bishop Brown ordained the  Nation's first Vietnamese Roman Catholic bishop in 2003 and one of the  first Hispanic bishops in the United States in the year 2000.   On a personal note, Bishop Brown administered first communion to my  children in the good old days.   Bishop Brown will be remembered. God bless him. We thank my good  friend for all the good work he did.                       Honoring Jerry Mumford Patterson     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the extraordinary  career of Jerry Patterson, a lawyer, educator, and former U.S.  Congressman who dedicated his life to public service.   As a UCLA alumnus just like myself, Mr. Patterson served Santa Ana as  a city councilmember and as Santa Ana mayor.   He fought to double the size of city-owned parks and created the  first nationally recognized golden circle bikeway. After serving in  Congress, Mr. Patterson came home and represented our community as an  educator until 1999.   Jerry Patterson always put the needs of his communities first. Today,  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring his service to our great  Nation.                                time  1030           Honoring Orange County High School's Marine Corps JROTC     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Orange High School's  Marine Corps Junior ROTC program.   The JROTC program at Orange High School began in 1995 under the  leadership of Master Gunnery Sergeant James Fearns, but not without a  fight. After having his request denied over and over again, Master  Gunnery Sergeant Fearns flew to Washington, D.C., himself to demand a  meeting with the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and he got it done.   Today, Orange High School has one of the largest Marine Corps ROTC  units in the Western United States, and it teaches over 160 cadets the  values of citizenship, service, discipline, and responsibility. I must  say these cadets are the leaders of tomorrow.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate them, and I wish the Marine Corps a happy  birthday. They are 248 years old this year.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of Mr. Massie's  amendment, which prohibits the Department of Transportation from  expediting funds to conduct competitive analyses of mergers.   In 1989, Congress transferred authority to review airline mergers to  the Department of Justice. Mr. Chair, 35 years of DOT policy is clear.  DOJ has the lead role in reviewing proposed airline mergers, given its  statutory authority to enforce the antitrust laws. This is consistent  with Congress' determination that the deregulated airline industry  should generally be subject to the same application of antitrust laws  as other unregulated industries.   I must say that as ranking member of the Administrative State,  Regulatory Reform, and Antitrust Subcommittee, I am committed to  protecting consumers, competition, and innovation. Before the DOT moves  ahead with this new, unprecedented approach, we must take time to  evaluate the merits of this policy. This amendment will grant us time  to do just that.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
