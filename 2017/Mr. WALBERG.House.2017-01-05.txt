But this article shall not apply to any person holding the  office of President when this article was proposed by Congress, and  shall not prevent any person who may be holding the office of  President, or acting as President, during the term within which this  article becomes operative from holding the office of President or  acting as President during the remainder of such term.''   Section 2:   ``This article shall be inoperative unless it shall have been  ratified as an amendment to the Constitution by the legislatures of  three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of  its submission to the States by the Congress.''
