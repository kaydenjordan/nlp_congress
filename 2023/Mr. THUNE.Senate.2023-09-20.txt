 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on Monday, the Democrat leader came down to  the floor to discuss the continuing resolution the House proposed, and  he criticized it for, among other things, making ``no attempt to  reauthorize the FAA.''         Making ``no attempt to reauthorize the FAA.''    Well, apparently it slipped the Democrat leader's mind that the  Senate is currently making no attempt to reauthorize the FAA either.  That is right. It has been 97 days since the Democrat chair of the  Commerce Committee halted consideration of the Federal Aviation  Administration reauthorization at the beginning of the scheduled markup  because the Democrat leader objected to a bipartisan amendment that  Senator Sinema and I planned to offer--an amendment to improve aviation  safety by implementing a structured, rigorous training program for  prospective airline pilots.   Current training requirements for airline pilots require 1,500 hours  of flight time, primarily in the cockpit, although military pilots and  those with a bachelor's or associate's degree in aviation can receive  credit for some of those hours.   I recognize the value of cockpit experience and see time in real  aircraft as an essential part of training airline pilots, but those  1,500 hours alone are not always the ideal preparation for flying  commercial jets or training truly well-rounded pilots.   For starters, the majority of the 1,500 hours are generally completed  in small, single-engine aircraft, which have very little relevance to  regional or large jetliners in terms of flight characteristics and  instrumentation. Little to none of the currently required flight hours,  which aspiring airline pilots must seek out and complete on their own,  are accumulated in the type of aircraft these pilots will be flying  should they get a job with an airline. In fact, current rules would  theoretically allow some of those hours to be completed in a hot air  balloon--not exactly preparation for flying a 787 across the ocean.   To address these deficiencies and to better prepare pilots for  airline jobs, 7 years ago, the Air Carrier Training Aviation Rulemaking  Committee--a body of industry, labor, and safety representatives who  meet regularly under the auspices of the FAA's Office of Aviation  Safety--developed and recommended the implementation of an Enhanced  Qualification Program that would create a structured pathway for pilots  to obtain intensive training.   That is exactly--exactly--the type of program our amendment would  create. Following the recommendations of the Air Carrier Training  Aviation Rulemaking Committee, our amendment would implement a 2-month  Enhanced Qualification Program, designed and audited by the FAA and  administered by air carriers, that would give aspiring airline pilots  intensive training both in the classroom and in simulators with  experienced air carrier pilots and other experts. Individuals who  successfully completed the program would be given a 250-hour credit  toward their restricted airline transport pilot license, similar to the  credits currently given for undergraduate work in aviation.   The Enhanced Qualification Program in our amendment would  significantly improve pilot training and passenger safety. As I said,  intensive training in the kind of air carrier environment where  prospective airline pilots will be flying is something that is largely  missing from current training. Getting the chance to work closely with  seasoned pilots would help turn out highly qualified pilots who are  better prepared for flying commercial jets.   In addition, our program's use of simulator training, whose proven  value has resulted in its extensive use by our military, would give  prospective airline pilots exposure to the cockpits of the jets they  would be flying and, crucially, allow them to experience what it is  like to handle challenging and dangerous situations in those cockpits.   For obvious reasons, standard flight training hours don't involve  deliberately flying into perilous weather conditions or dealing with  things like fires or engine failure, but simulator training offers  prospective airline pilots a chance to deal with all those situations  and more and deal with them again and again until their response to  these situations is fine-tuned.   You don't have to take my word for it. A bipartisan group of former  FAA Administrators and former presidents of the Air Line Pilots  Association recently sent a letter to the chairs and vice chairs of the  relevant House and Senate committees wholeheartedly endorsing the kind  of simulator training our amendment would provide. Let me just read a  little bit from that letter, and I am quoting here:         [F]acilitating the adoption of new technologies that       enhance safety should be a bedrock principle for government       and industry alike. . . . Since the tragic crash of Colgan       Air Flight 3407 almost 15 years ago, there have been       significant advances in technology that are incorporated into       a pilot's training upon an airline hiring them, but these       technologies have not improved the 1,500-hour path to       becoming an airline pilot. Modern, state-of-the-art airline       flight simulators accurately recreate the experience of       flight operations in a fully immersive experience, forcing       pilots to encounter aircraft malfunctions, including rare       events like rapid decompressions, emergency descents, high-      speed rejected takeoffs, dual engine failures, severe icing       conditions, flight control malfunctions and full stalls, all       without placing any lives in danger.    He goes on:         Simulators also present the opportunity to incorporate       actual accident and incident scenarios into training. . . .       Like training for an athletic endeavor, a high volume of       repetitions of high-quality exercises improves performance       and ``muscle memory.'' Requiring the repeated practice of the       prevention of and recovery from myriad real-world accident       scenarios in full-motion flight simulators will make better       pilots.    Again, that comes from former FAA Administrators and presidents of  the American Air Line Pilots Association.   So, as I said, that is the message that was sent to the relevant  chairs and vice chairs by a bipartisan group of former FAA  Administrators and Air Line Pilots Association presidents, a letter  that clearly demonstrates the value of the kind of program that Senator  Sinema's and my amendment would establish for improving pilot training  and passenger safety--precisely what we are talking about here with  respect to our amendment.   I suspect that if put to a vote in the Commerce Committee or on the  Senate  [[Page S4615]]  floor, for that matter, there is a good chance our amendment would  pass, which is presumably why the Democrat leader is blocking any  chance for a vote. It is less clear why the leader is opposed to the  substance of our legislation. Does he really think that we can't  improve upon the 1,500 hours of training largely undertaken in a  single-engine prop plane? That is the way it is today. As I said  before, that is not exactly the ideal preparation for flying a  commercial jet.   A program that better prepares prospective airline pilots for the  planes they will be flying seems really to me like a no-brainer. But  regardless--regardless--the Democrat leader has every right to oppose  our amendment. What is inappropriate is not his opposition but the fact  that he is using his position as majority leader to block committee  debate on this amendment, which has had the practical effect of  blocking the entire bill.   The Commerce Committee and the Senate as a whole are set up for  debate and amendment. That is what we do here, and we take votes here.  If you don't want to take hard votes, don't run for the U.S. Senate.  This place is not set up with the intention of having a single  individual determine legislative outcomes.   When I was chair of the Senate Commerce Committee--and I chaired that  committee for 4 years--bipartisan debate and amendment were the order  of the day. That is how we did things, and it helped produce a lot of  strong pieces of legislation, including, I might add, the longest  reauthorization of the FAA since 1982.   The last time we did an FAA reauthorization, I chaired the committee,  and we brought a bill to the floor that enjoyed broad bipartisan  support, which is what we ought to be doing with the legislation this  time around. And if the Democrat leader would loosen his hold and stop  trying to engineer the legislative outcome that he wants, we would get  another bipartisan FAA reauthorization bill out of the committee and  onto the Senate floor.   As the leader correctly indicated, the FAA reauthorization is--is--an  important piece of legislation. So I encourage him to allow it to  proceed through the committee and come to the floor of the U.S. Senate  for a vote.   I yield the floor.
