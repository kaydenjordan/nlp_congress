 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a call to action to  bring down prescription drug prices.   Some say a drug company should be able to charge any price because  that is just how the market works. But the market for many prescription  drugs is broken.   As a diabetic, I know how the price of insulin has skyrocketed for no  good reason. Medicare spent 3\1/2\ times more on insulin per patient in  2016 than in 2007.   Many Americans depend on other drugs to survive: EpiPens for life- threatening allergies, emergency inhalers for asthma, chemotherapy  drugs for cancer. Patients relying on life-sustaining drugs can't  simply vote with their wallet to fight back against price gougers.   That is why I introduced H.R. 5039, to give Medicare the tools it  needs to bring down the price of life-sustaining drugs, similar to  other developed countries.   American families deserve better than the Big Pharma status quo.  Let's pass H.R. 5039 and give that to them.                            ____________________
