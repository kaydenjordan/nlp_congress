 Madam Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the issue  of human trafficking, which is still alive and well today.   The United States has been ranked among the top three nations of  origin for victims of human trafficking in 2018, according to a recent  report by the State Department, and is the number one consumer of sex  trafficking worldwide.   This is absolutely unacceptable, and as a Member of Congress, we must  use all means necessary to rid our Nation of human trafficking and keep  people safe from this kind of abuse.   That is why, this week, I will be introducing two bills to help  combat this. They are the Prevent Trafficking in Our Schools Act, and  the COMBAT Act of 2019.   The Prevent Trafficking in Our School Act instructs the Secretary of  Homeland Security and Secretary of Education to develop a pilot program  to train school officials and teachers to identify signs of trafficking  in our schools and educate these same officials on the prevalence in  our community.   The COMBAT Act addresses the fact that the U.S. does not have an  official count for domestic human trafficking by requiring a report to  Congress on the prevalence of human trafficking happening within the  United States.   I ask for support on these bills.                            ____________________
