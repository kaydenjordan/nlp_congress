 Madam Chair, I thank my good friend from Idaho and my good  colleagues from the other side of the aisle for allowing this amendment  to receive consideration.   Hydropower is one of the Nation's most affordable and reliable  renewable electricity resources. With over 100 gigawatts of installed  capacity, hydro makes up nearly 7 percent, on average, of all U.S.  annual electricity generation. As a matter of fact, hydro is the single  largest source of renewable electricity, representing over one-half of  all renewable energy generation in 2018.    This is due to the significant advantage hydropower generation, as a  baseload source of energy, has over intermittent sources, like wind and  solar. It provides predictable, continuous generation 24-7-365 without  the need to hold backup generation in standby to power the lights when  the Sun goes down or the wind stops. Because of this important  distinction, additional hydropower generation results in increased  generation rather than just capacity.   If we want to be serious about increasing renewable energy, we need  to focus on what works best. More can and must be done to significantly  expand this vital energy resource. Only 3 percent of the 80,000 dams in  the U.S. currently generate electricity, leaving substantial potential  for additional generation from unpowered dams. As a matter of fact, in  my home State of Pennsylvania, there is an estimated 678 megawatts of  untapped hydropower.   The recent trend of closures among baseload power generation  facilities threatens our Nation's ability to meet our energy needs.  Unleashing the full potential of hydropower provides a remedy that is  proven, reliable, and renewable.   Critical to realizing this potential is DOE's Water Power  Technologies Office. This amendment increases funding for the office by  $2 million to continue their important mission.   Madam Chair, I ask the support of my colleagues for this amendment.
