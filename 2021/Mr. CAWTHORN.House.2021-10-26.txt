 Madam Speaker, Dr. Fauci has forsaken his Hippocratic  oath and exchanged it for the mantle of unchecked power. His policies  shuttered the U.S. economy, drove our country into financial upheaval,  and violated the rights of millions of Americans.   In July, he willfully lied to the U.S. Senate about his role in  funding gain-of-function research in Wuhan, China.   This week, the world was shocked to discover that through an  experiment under his watch, sweet beagle puppies had their heads  stuffed into crates so that sand flies could slowly strip away the skin  from their bones. These defenseless animals were damned to agonize in  silence because their vocal cords had been surgically ripped from their  throats so that their tormentors could discharge their evil actions  without having to hear incessant yapping.   Madam Speaker, today I am calling for the creation of a formal  commission to investigate the true origin of COVID-19, the role Fauci  played in its creation, the false statements he made to Members of  Congress under oath, and why the hell Americans are funding the torture  of puppies in Africa.   Americans deserve the truth, and this demon doctor must never be  allowed to escape justice.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to  me.   I will say that I am proud to be a cosponsor on his bill. I think it  is far past time that Congress start taking the mental health  requirements, necessities, and needs of our veterans' community more  seriously. Not only does this mean just sending more money to it, it  means thinking outside of the box; and I think that is exactly what the  gentleman's bill does.   I will tell you, Madam Speaker, when we start thinking about the debt  that our Nation owes to this Nation's veterans, we realize that the  debt can never truly be repaid. But certainly we can make sure that not  23 servicemembers--veterans--are committing suicide every single day.  Certainly we can make sure that the telehealth program within the VA is  expanded so that people can have easy mental checkups that won't deem  them as someone who is mentally unfit.                                time  1630    Certainly, this means that we can take a proactive manner in making  sure that our veterans feel safe and feel as if they can come forward  and speak about the mental health issues that they are facing.   So many servicemembers are dying. I believe the gentleman from New  York remarked earlier that one of our members of this committee said  that they actually knew more people who had committed suicide since  returning home from the battlefield than had actually died on the  battlefield, and that is truly heartbreaking.   When they come home to America, they should be greeted as our  Nation's heroes because that is exactly what they are.   It is my honor to cosponsor this bill. It is my honor to support the  mental health needs of our veteran community. And it is my honor to  fight for them every single day.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership.
