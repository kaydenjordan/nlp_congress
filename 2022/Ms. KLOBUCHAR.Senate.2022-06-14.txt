 Thank you, Senator Cornyn, for the work you are doing  and working with Senator Murphy and so many other Senators. You and I  have done so many bills together, including the historic Save Our  Stages bill, which made such a difference. And I am very pleased that  we are finally advancing gun safety legislation. And a lot of these  provisions are things that we have been working across the aisle on for  many years, the boyfriend loophole--something that I introduced in  2013, 10 years ago--to close the boyfriend loophole. That is a part of  this negotiation, part of the framework. We have so many women killed,  1 every 14 hours, from domestic partners--1 every 14 hours from  domestic partners--with guns in this country. And, sadly, half of those  involve dating partners, people who aren't married to someone, but they  are in a romantic relationship with them in some way. And the way the  law works in all but 19 States where it is fully closed, in many of  these States, you get convicted of domestic abuse, and you can still go  out and buy a gun the next day.   So I am really pleased that we are moving forward on this provision.  This isn't the first time we have heard the call to action from America  when it comes to guns. We heard it after 23 people were killed at a  Walmart in El Paso; after 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman  Douglas High School in Parkland; after 59 people were killed at a  country music festival, just out there on a beautiful evening enjoying  the music; after 59 people dead in Las Vegas; and after 49 people were  killed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando.   Today, we hear calls for action because of more tragedies: a White  supremacist murdering 10 people who are simply shopping for groceries;  one guy out buying a cake for his little boy, a birthday cake for his  son, who never returned; 10 people killed.   The American people are demanding that we do something after the  senseless murder of 19 children and 2 teachers who died putting their  very lives up to protect those children in Uvalde, TX. We have seen the  pictures of those kids in their confirmation-communion dresses, in  their sports uniforms, the Converse green sneakers, the glasses, the  smiles. In some photos, they were actually holding awards they had won  just that morning.   But today, after too many of these tragedies to name, I rise with  renewed hope that we are finally working together to help keep  Americans safe from gun violence. While there is so much more work to  be done, reforms outlined in the bipartisan framework, like encouraging  States to enact risk protection orders, which are also known as red  flag laws, expanding access to mental health services, and supporting  school violence prevention--Senator Grassley and I led that bill after  Parkland that we passed with significant funding for schools. Clearly,  more must be done.   As I noted, I am particularly pleased to see that the framework will  include my bill to finally close the boyfriend loophole. Every year,  more than 600 American women are shot to death by intimate partners. We  understandably focus on the horror of these mass shootings, but think  of those numbers: 600 women shot every year by intimate partners.   We know that preventing convicted domestic abusers from getting guns  saves lives. We know that because we have seen the numbers in the  States that have the laws in place.   Currently, Federal law only prohibits domestic abusers from buying a  gun if they are currently or formerly married--think about that:  currently or formerly married--or if they have ever lived together or  if they have a child. That is despite the fact, as I noted, that half  of these homicides--half of the women killed are killed by dating  partners. That is why in 2013 I introduced this bill to close this  dangerous loophole, and now, I am so pleased that there is growing  bipartisan support for the bill.   By the way, we have shown that support in the past. It was part of  the Violence Against Women Act that passed in the House, and it had 29  Republicans vote for it. That included an even more broad version of  the bill, which also included stalking and was broader than what we are  going to see in this bill.   Obviously, I support my original bill, but the fact that we are  making progress to close the loophole in the States that so far have  not gotten to where the other 19 are is incredibly positive. It did not  pass last time when we passed the Violence Against Women Act in the  Senate. Sadly, it didn't make it in there. But, again, it got 29  Republican votes in the House, and that just shows the kind of growing  momentum we have for this.   I come from a State with a proud tradition of hunting and fishing,  like yours. I always think about my Uncle  [[Page S2926]]  Dick and his deer stand, and I always ask, when I look at these  proposals--from closing the boyfriend loophole to putting in better  background checks, to doing something about better checking the records  of 18- to 21 year olds--I think, does that hurt my Uncle Dick and his  deer stand? Of course, the answer is, it does not.    This is our moment to act. It is not just one killing, and we all  know that. It has happened in every single community. Every single  Senator in this Chamber knows of a moment where they thought ``How  could this happen in my community?'' when they meet with a family.   What I remember the most, actually, is a case involving a police  officer out of Lake City, MN. He was a good cop doing his job. He was  called to a domestic violence incident.   What people don't often know is that for police officers, these  domestic violence calls can be some of the most dangerous because you  have someone who is very angry, and you don't know what you are walking  into. It is in the moment.   He gets there to the door. He has his bulletproof vest on, but the  perpetrator--clearly mentally ill--who had been beating up his young,  young, young girlfriend, meets him with a gun, shoots him in his head,  and he dies.   I was there for that funeral. There was an outpouring of support from  the community. The funeral was held in the very same church where the  officer and his wife and their three little kids had gathered for the  nativity play just a few weeks before for Christmas, those two little  boys and a little girl. The father had sat in the front row to watch  his boys in that nativity play only a few weeks before, and the next  time the family is in that church, it is the widow, the two little  boys, and this little tiny girl in a dress with blue stars on it  walking down the aisle of that church at his funeral. That is a moment  I won't forget.   I just shows you how domestic abuse and those kinds of cases--yes,  there is one immediate victim--most likely the woman--but it is a whole  family who is the victim. Kids who witness domestic abuse through their  lives are so much more likely to get into crime themselves. Statistics  have shown it. But it is even more than the family, it is the whole  community, as that family who lost their dad and lost their husband  would tell you if they were standing in here right now.   So I am so pleased we are finally moving on this. I thank Senator  Murphy. I thank Senator Cornyn and all those involved. I am also so  grateful that my 10 years of work leading this bill with Representative  Debbie Dingell in the House has not gone for naught. We kept it moving.  It is probably a sign for anyone that perseverance matters in this  place. I am very pleased that it is part of the final negotiations, and  it will make such a difference for saving lives.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
