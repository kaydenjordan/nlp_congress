 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Evelyn Cortez-Diaz  as a Valley Luchadora, Valley Fighter.   Evelyn is a civil engineer with more than 25 years of experience in  the water industry, water conservation, water quality, pipeline design  and construction, environmental compliance, recycled water, water  rights, groundwater remediation and groundwater planning.   She is the highest-ranking Latina at the Los Angeles Department of  Water and Power, which is the largest municipal water and power utility  in the United States.   She is also the first Latina and second woman to be appointed  Director of Water Engineering and Technical Services.   In her role, Evelyn leads a team of over 400 engineers and technical  professionals to safely retreat, store, and transport water for the 4  million people of the City of Los Angeles and the thousands of  businesses that they serve.                                time  1745    At LADWP, Evelyn helped launch the Society of Women Engineers and the  Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers chapter to support its  employees and inspire the next generation of engineers and STEM  professionals.   She immigrated to the U.S. from El Salvador when she was 12 years old  and was placed in remedial English classes to become fluent in English.   At a young age, she knew she wanted to help make the world a better  place. She aspired to protect the environment and decided to focus her  studies on water resources and environmental engineering.   After she graduated high school as 10th in her class with a 4.3 GPA,  she earned a bachelor of science degree in civil engineering at the  University of California, Los Angeles.   In 2015, she published her book, which chronicles her family's  immigration story and journey to U.S. citizenship.   Evelyn Cortez-Davis, thank you for sharing your story and for your  commitment to conservation and our environment and to all the people of  Los Angeles. It is my honor to recognize you as a distinguished  community leader and luchadora this Hispanic Heritage Month.                       Honoring Margaret ``Mar'' Diego     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Margaret ``Mar''  Diego as a Valley Luchadora.   Mar is the co-owner and operator of Dough Girl, a small business  pizzeria located in Sylmar. She grew up in San Fernando Gardens, a low- income housing project in my district.   Her business, Dough Girl, is much more than a local valley pizzeria.  Mar is a proud employer of formerly homeless and incarcerated  individuals, two demographics of people who traditionally struggle to  find stable employment and who are often ignored and tossed aside.   A formerly incarcerated person herself, Mar understands the obstacles  people face as they work to rebuild their lives after serving their  time in the system. Through her restaurant, she continues to pay it  forward and makes a positive impact in her community.   Mar can often be found on the street, finding and hiring employees on  the spot. She gives people a second chance and a job, training to help  them succeed and be productive members of the community.   Most importantly, she gives them the opportunity to rebuild their  lives. She has made her restaurant a positive rehabilitation-oriented  space.   Upon her own release from prison, Mar attended the prestigious Cordon  Bleu culinary arts school and continued to blossom from there. She has  a one-of-a-kind inspirational story and has traveled the world,  visiting 16 countries on her culinary journey.   She received notable praise and appeared on television with well- known celebrity chefs such as Wolfgang Puck and Roy Choi.   Her restaurant, Dough Girl, has given her the chance to elevate and  formally showcase her culinary skills and positively benefit her  community.   Mar is an inspirational chef and philanthropist who envisions her  restaurant as a home for amazing food and a place where people develop  vital life skills. She continues her work and is developing a  curriculum centered around the teaching of essential life, culinary,  and entrepreneurial skills.   Thank you, Mar, for your commitment to paving the way forward, making  a positive impact in our community, and uplifting others to give them a  second chance.   Thank you for being a caring and loving person. It is my honor to  recognize you as a distinguished community leader and luchadora during  this Hispanic Heritage Month.                       Honoring Veronica Padilla-Campos     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Veronica Padilla- Campos as a Valley Luchadora.   Veronica continues to serve the community she grew up in and has been  fighting for environmental justice in the San Fernando Valley for the  past 25 years.   She grew up in Sun Valley and is a daughter of hardworking parents.  Her dad was a gardener, and her mom worked at a local factory.   A graduate of UCLA, she has experience in the private, public, and  not-for-profit sectors, including environmental consulting, GIS  mapping, and work for the Los Angeles Housing Department.   Throughout the last decade, Veronica has played a crucial role at  Pacoima Beautiful, a grassroots environmental justice organization in  my district that provides education, impacts local policy, and supports  local arts and culture to promote a healthy and sustainable San  Fernando Valley.   She joined Pacoima Beautiful as deputy director in 2010 and has  served as executive director since 2013. During her leadership, she has  spearheaded environmental cleanup and safety campaigns in some of the  poorest and hardest-impacted areas of Los Angeles County.   Previously, she helped lead ICON CDC, a community-based, not-for- profit organization that serves small business owners and  entrepreneurs, and serves on the North Valley Area Planning Commission  for the city of Los Angeles.   In 2020, Veronica joined the South Coast Air Quality Management  District as a board member, after being appointed by the speaker of the  California State Assembly.   In her role as board member, she continues her commitment to building  people power and improving the lives and voices of her community. She  creates equitable, healthy, and safe neighborhoods every single day by  her commitment to the community and the wonderful work that she does.   Thank you, Veronica, for your countless years of public service. It  is my honor to recognize you as a distinguished community leader and  luchadora during Hispanic Heritage Month.                           Honoring Corinne Sanchez     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Valley Luchadora  Corinne Sanchez for her decades of service in our community.   Corinne is the daughter of a World War II veteran of the Pacific  front in Burma and a mother who worked at the Santa Fe Railroad.    Corinne attended Long Beach State University, where she became a  student leader and was involved in the creation of the Chicano/Chicana  studies program and social justice organizations. There were only three  Chicanas that started the United Mexican American Students, UMAS, in  1967 at Long Beach State University, and Corinne was one of them.   Corinne is a lifelong trailblazer. Upon her graduation, she worked  for the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and then went on to travel  throughout the Midwestern and Southwestern U.S. to promote the creation  of Chicano studies departments in universities and colleges.   She then began her work for El Proyecto del Barrio, a not-for-profit,  community-based organization that provides health and human services to  communities with underserved populations. As president and CEO, Corinne  oversees expanded services in comprehensive primary healthcare,  employment, childcare, and perinatal social services.   After realizing her dream of becoming an attorney, she, alongside  eight  [[Page H8298]]  other women, founded and served as president of the Latina Lawyers Bar  Association to help advocate and educate for the advancement of Latinas  in law.   Corinne has always been a strong leader in the community. She has  held numerous roles in various commissions and associations for many  years.   In more than three decades of service, Corinne has never forgotten  her roots. She has worked to make the community a better place for  thousands of underserved families and individuals.   Her advancements are a testament to how hard work, inspiration, and  perseverance can make a difference in helping people realize the power  of their dreams.   Thank you, Corinne. It is my honor to recognize you as a  distinguished leader and luchadora this Hispanic Heritage Month.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 29, 2022, from page H8297, in the third column, to  page H8298, in the first column, the following appeared: HONORING  CORRINE SANCHEZ Corrine attended Long Beach State . . .

Since the beginning of the 117th Congress, since January of last  year, Democrats have taken action on legislation that puts people over  politics. We are lowering costs, creating better-paying jobs, and  making a real positive difference in the lives of every hardworking  American.   In the northeast San Fernando Valley alone, we have created 30,000  new good-paying jobs and countless workforce training opportunities for  our community.   We know that additional jobs will come to our neighborhoods with the  recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science  Act.   Soon, we will begin to see more of our family, friends, and neighbors  become plumbers, pipefitters, electrical workers, steelworkers,  laborers, electricians, and engineers, and so much more.   These investments will help us fight the climate crisis, rebuild our  roads and sidewalks and grow our clean energy economy.   But that is not all. In just one year, we have helped 13,000  entrepreneurs, many of them women and people of color, in the northeast  San Fernando Valley build their small businesses from the ground up.  That means 13,000 new, local mom-and-pop shops serving our community,  employing our neighbors, and helping grow our economy.   This is all thanks to our partnership with President Biden. Since he  took office, we have created 10 million jobs across the country,  dropping the unemployment rate to 3.7 percent, the lowest rate in 50  years. We are seeing the best economy for American workers in decades,  with people getting higher wages, better benefits, and better jobs  across the country.   While we are seeing progress in the fight against inflation, we know  that there is much more work to do. The good news is we are finally  starting to see gas prices drop after Putin's price hike.   Families across the country will soon start to get some additional  relief with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which lowers  the cost of prescription drugs, makes health insurance more affordable,  provides credits for electric vehicles, and more.   From day one of the 117th Congress, we have successfully worked day  in and day out to fulfill our promise to the American people. I am so  proud of our work, and I look forward to continuing to help families in  the northeast San Fernando Valley prosper now and into the future.                     Inflation Reduction Act Climate Wins     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the profound,  positive impact that the Inflation Reduction Act will have on all  communities  [[Page H8299]]  across the Nation, including my district, the northeast San Fernando  Valley.   Anyone can see that the climate crisis has already taken a huge toll  on communities like mine. From poor air quality, droughts, and extreme  heat to the constant threat of wildfires, my district has known the  realities of climate change all too well and for far too long.   But our experiences are not isolated. Over the past 5 years alone,  the United States has experienced over 90 climate disasters. As we  witness the destruction caused by Hurricane Fiona and Hurricane Ian, it  is clear now more than ever that aggressive action to fight climate  change is necessary.   Last month, we delivered the single biggest climate investment in  U.S. history by passing the Inflation Reduction Act. That is a big  deal, especially for communities like mine.   Growing up, I remember not being able to play outside because the air  quality was so, so bad back then. For many of us, it was normal to have  someone in our family or a friend have serious respiratory problems  like asthma. The fact is that our children deserve to live in a  community that is safe and free of toxic pollutants.   Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act, we are going to be on track to  reduce emissions by roughly 40 percent by 2030, a necessary step to  clean our air and prevent the worst effects of climate change.   One of the ways we are going to be able to do this is by electrifying  our heavy-duty vehicles and school buses, an investment that I am so  proud to have led with our United States Senator from California, Alex  Padilla.   We are also lowering costs for hardworking American families by  making rebates and tax credits available to electrify home appliances,  install rooftop solar, electrify air-conditioning and heaters, and make  electric vehicles more affordable.   We are putting environmental justice communities first and investing  $60 billion to reduce pollution to make clean energy more accessible  and to provide a better quality of life in lower income neighborhoods  across the United States of America.   The best part is we are making polluters pay so that communities like  ours don't have to continue to bear the brunt of climate change.   The Inflation Reduction Act is a transformative law and will do so  much good for families in the San Fernando Valley. It ensures that all  people, regardless of ZIP Code, can access cost-saving solutions that  will help us fight the climate crisis together. It means that our  friends, family, and neighbors will be able to breathe clean air and  drink clean water.   This is just the beginning of the work that we are going to continue  to do. We will continue to fight to make sure we keep climate action  front and center in the job that we do for all the people of this great  country.                           My Life Has Been Blessed     Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment of personal  privilege to say thank you to the community that I was born and raised  in and for which I have the honor to be a United States Congressman.   I would like to also recognize that I am so, so blessed to have been  raised by my two parents, Andres and Maria Cardenas, who came here as  immigrants from Mexico. They never dreamed that any one of their 11  children could have such an honor.    They taught me and my brothers and sisters simple values that have  served all of us well and that serve me well to have the honor of being  a United States Congressman and serve the northeast San Fernando  Valley.   I also want to thank my constituents for having the confidence in me  to represent them here in Washington, and I pray every day that I do  the job that they have sent me to do, to make their lives better and to  help them live a good and clean life.   I also want to take a moment of personal privilege to say how blessed  I feel to have such a beautiful, amazing family. My wife Norma, who has  been so supportive; our four children, Vanessa, Cristian, Andres, and  Alina; my son-in-law, Brian; and our amazing, beautiful grandchildren,  Joaquin and Jimena. These are blessings that I have been so, so honored  to have in my life.   I am so, so fortunate and blessed. To be able to speak on this floor,  to be a Member of Congress is so humbling. I thank you, Mr. Speaker,  for giving me the opportunity to express how much I care about the  leaders of my community and how grateful we are for them and for the  honor to be a Member of this prestigious and amazing body, the House of  Representatives of the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
