 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the findings of  a recent report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and  Medicine entitled: ``The Value of Social, Behavioral, and Economic  Sciences to National Priorities.'' This report was requested by the  National Science Foundation to examine whether the Federal Government  should continue funding research in these disciplines. The resounding  answer is: yes.   The report found that SBE funding furthers the mission of NSF and  helps other agencies achieve their missions, and this funding provides  tools and methods that have helped business and industry grow the U.S.  economy and create jobs.   The report also highlights that virtually every major challenge the  country faces today requires understanding the causes and consequences  of people's behavior. The way we do this is by funding research in the  social, behavioral, and economic sciences.   Mr. Speaker, investments in SBE are critical for our Nation's future,  and we must continue this robust investment.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I want to start off by thanking the chair  and ranking member for supporting these two amendments, one in this  bloc, one in the next bloc.   The first amendment will authorize the Hacking for Defense, or H4D,  Program. This is an innovative program developed in Silicon Valley with  the help of battlefield-experienced Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, and  it finds unique solutions to national security problems.   First taught at Stanford, H4D uses lean business startup methods to  engage America's best and brightest in solving real security challenges  faced by the DOD.   Rapid, low-cost technological innovation is what makes Silicon Valley  revolutionary, but the DOD hasn't historically had the mechanisms in  place to harness this American advantage.   Hacking for Defense creates ways for talented scientists and  engineers to work alongside with veterans, military leaders, and  business mentors to innovate solutions that make America safer. For  example, a July 7 New York Times article details how an H4D graduate,  Capella Space, is helping track North Korean nuclear capabilities,  helping to try to make our world safer.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record this article, along with these  letters of support from universities and tech communities---                  [From the New York Times, July 7, 2017]              Tiny Satellites Will Track North Korea Missiles    (By David E. Sanger and William J. Broad; Eric Schmitt contributed                                 reporting)         For years before North Korea fired its first       intercontinental ballistic missile this week,  [[Page H5741]]       the Pentagon and intelligence experts had sounded a warning:       Not only was the North making progress quickly, spy satellite       coverage was so spotty that the United States might not see a       missile being prepared for launch.        That set off an urgent but quiet search for ways to improve       America's early-warning ability--and the capability to strike       missiles while they are on the launchpad. The most intriguing       solutions have come from Silicon Valley, where the Obama       administration began investing in tiny, inexpensive civilian       satellites developed to count cars in Target parking lots and       monitor the growth of crops.        Some in the Pentagon accustomed to relying on highly       classified, multibillion-dollar satellites, which take years       to develop, resisted the move. But as North Korea's missile       program progressed, American officials laid out an ambitious       schedule for the first of the small satellites to go up at       the end of this year, or the beginning of next.        Launched in clusters, some staying in orbit just a year or       two, the satellites would provide coverage necessary to       execute a new military contingency plan called ``Kill       Chain.'' It is the first step in a new strategy to use       satellite imagery to identify North Korean launch sites,       nuclear facilities and manufacturing capability and destroy       them pre-emptively if a conflict seems imminent.        Even a few extra minutes of warning might save the lives of       tens of thousands of Americans--and millions of South Koreans       and Japanese who already live within range of the North's       missiles.        ``Kim Jong-un is racing--literally racing--to deploy a       missile capability,'' Robert Cardillo, the director of the       National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which coordinates       satellite-based mapping for the government, said in an       interview days before North Korea's latest launch. ``His       acceleration has caused us to accelerate.''        The timeline for getting the satellites in orbit, which       defense officials have never discussed publicly, reflects the       urgency of the problem. The missile launch by North Korea on       Tuesday was initiated from a new site, a mobile launcher at       the Pang Hyon Aircraft Factory. Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon       spokesman, said the missile ``is not one we have seen       before.''        That mobility is the problem that the new satellites, with       wide coverage using radar sensors that work at night and       during storms, are designed to address. Less than one-third       of North Korea is under spy satellite coverage at a given       moment.        American intelligence analysts detected indications of an       impending launch in the days before the missile firing,       according to a spokesman for the Defense Intelligence Agency,       Cmdr. William Marks. But even after the launch, the Pentagon       misjudged what it was looking at. Minutes after its 37-minute       flight ended, the United States Pacific Command described the       missile as an intermediate-range model, often seen.        Hours later, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson issued a       very different conclusion: that the North had tested its       first intercontinental ballistic missile, able to reach       Alaska.        The commercial radar push is one of several new ways the       administration is seeking to counter the North Korean threat.       President Trump inherited a secret effort to sabotage the       North's missile launches. But its success has been spotty at       best, especially of late.        And joint American-South Korean missile tests, conducted       hours after the ICBM test, appeared to be part of the new       strategy that includes Kill Chain--the missiles were designed       to reach Pyongyang, where the country's leadership lives.        Kill Chain was also mentioned in a joint statement issued       last week by the United States and South Korea, a notable       shift for the South's new president, Moon Jae-in. He has       rejected public discussion of pre-emptive military action,       arguing it plays into the North Korean paranoia that the       United States and its allies are plotting to end the Kim       government.        Mr. Moon has spoken of reviving direct talks--a so-called       sunshine policy, which he advocated as chief of staff to an       earlier South Korean president.        But Mr. Trump has tried to build pressure, using warships,       sanctions and missile defenses. He was recently presented       with new options, including military ones, for responding to       a sixth nuclear detonation by the North or a test of a       missile that could reach the United States.        ``The threat is much more immediate,'' H.R. McMaster, Mr.       Trump's national security adviser, told a conference last       week at the Center for a New American Security in Washington.       ``So it's clear that we can't repeat the same approach--      failed approach--of the past.''        The new satellite initiative builds on technology created       more for Wall Street than the Pentagon. From an office in an       old Defense Department building within view of the Google       campus in California, Raj Shah, the director of the Defense       Innovation Unit Experimental, or DIUx, is already investing       in companies that exploit tiny civilian radar satellites,       able to pierce darkness or storms, in hopes that the Pentagon       can use them by the end of the year, or early in 2018.        ``It's a very challenging target,'' said Mr. Shah, a former       F-16 pilot in Iraq whose extensive experience in Silicon       Valley appealed to Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, who       set up the unit during Mr. Obama's second term and recruited       Mr. Shah.        ``The key is using technologies that are already available,       and making the modifications we need for a specific military       purpose,'' Mr. Shah said.        His unit made an investment to jump-start the development       efforts of Capella Space, a Silicon Valley start-up named       after a bright star. It plans to loft its first radar       satellite late this year. The company says its radar fleet,       if successfully deployed, will be able to monitor important       targets hourly.        ``The entire spacecraft is the size of a backpack,'' said       Payam Banazadeh, a founder of the company. Born in Iran, he       learned satellite design at the University of Texas and       NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, specializing in       miniaturization.        Once in orbit, the payload, he added, would unfurl its       antenna and solar panels.        ``Everything is getting smaller,'' Mr. Banazadeh said of       the craft's parts. ``Even the next version of the satellite       is getting smaller.''        Seeing the early fruits of the Pentagon experiment, the       National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency is opening its doors       to companies that can supply it with satellite radar data in       addition to traditional images. Its outpost, set up this       year, is in San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley.        Federal officials rarely, if ever, acknowledge the poor       reconnaissance coverage of the North from traditional       military satellites. But William J. Perry, the former       secretary of defense, recently said in Washington that if the       North rolled out a missile to hit the United States or its       allies, ``there's a good chance we'd never see it.''        The threat grew worse last year as North Korea began using       solid fuels after decades of relying on liquid propellants to       power its big rockets and missiles. While liquid-fueled       missiles can take hours or even days of preparation, solid-      fueled missiles can be fired with little or no warning.        Mr. Kim has made the effort a personal project, posing next       to a large solid-fueled motor after a successful ground test       last year. The North followed that firing with four       successful flight tests, twice last year and twice this year.        The advances, said Young-Keun Chang, director of the Global       Surveillance Research Center at the Korea Aerospace       University in Seoul, moved the North significantly closer to       a mobile intercontinental missile that could eventually pose       ``a serious potential threat to the United States.''        The key to detecting launch preparations is the near-      constant presence of satellites that can see through clouds,       rain, snow, foliage and camouflage and can detect the       movement of military gear, including missiles. That requires       space-based radars, which over the years have been highly       expensive, with their big antennas and tendency to use large       amounts of power. Like any radar, they fire radio waves at       targets and gather faint echoes.        Space-based radars can also detect changes in ground       elevation that signal hidden tunnels, bunkers and even       radioactive cavities left by nuclear blasts, experts say,       because such hollows cause the surface above them to subside       ever so slightly.        But building the radars has historically been expensive for       the government.        In 2007, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that a       constellation of 21 radar satellites would cost the nation up       to $94 billion--or more than $4 billion each. The report,       published shortly after the North's first nuclear detonation,       zeroed in on whether the satellites could track Korean       missiles on mobile launchers. It called the goal ``highly       challenging,'' and said 35 to 50 spacecraft would be needed       to make such detections rapidly.        The new generation of tiny, cheap satellites has made that       outcome more achievable. Capella plans to loft its first       radar satellite late this year and build up to 36 orbital       radars, within the range the congressional report       recommended.        In addition to Capella, private companies rushing to make       and exploit new generations of small radar satellites include       Ursa Space Systems in Ithaca, N.Y.; UrtheCast in Vancouver,       Canada; and Iceye in Espoo, Finland. Like many new companies       seeking to make small satellites, most have strong ties to       Silicon Valley.        The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's initiative,       known as the Commercial Geoint Activity, builds on programs       in which the agency bought radar-satellite data from Canada,       Italy and Germany as part of its evaluation of the new       civilian technologies.        Mr. Cardillo said the new partnerships could help the       United States close the gaps in tracking Mr. Kim's rapidly       expanding arsenal of threatening missiles.        ``If any of these companies, new or old, can help fill       those gaps,'' he said, ``then I'm interested.''                                   ____           LeLand Standford, Junior University,                                                     July 11, 2017.      Hon. Daniel W. Lipinski,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Lipinski: I am writing to express my       personal support for your proposed amendment 352 to H.R.       2810, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year       2018. This amendment would provide statutory authorization       for the Hacking for Defense program, something developed here       at Stanford University that is effectively changing the way       students think about national security.  [[Page H5742]]         Hacking for Defense is a class first taught at Stanford and       now at growing number of other universities around the       country in which students learn to apply lean startup methods       to national security challenges. Instructors gather projects       or problems from branches of the military and intelligence       agencies for the students to address. A core component of the       course is gaining an in-depth understanding of the problem       the students are trying to solve, which the students do by       conducting 100 interviews with potential ''customers'' or       beneficiaries of a solution. By the end of the course,       although students aren't required to come up with a new       product or service, many of them do such as the ''tiny       satellites'' project recently in the news regarding North       Korea's missiles.        Hacking for Defense is valuable because it combines a       student's knowledge and entrepreneurial energy with the       experience of their business and military mentors to       innovatively solve national security challenges. In addition,       it exposes rising generation of technology stars to the       potential value and benefit of careers in national service.        Authorization and federal support of this program will       enable its expansion to many more universities throughout the       country, helping solve high priority problems and train a new       generation of civic-minded entrepreneurs and technologists. I       strongly support inclusion of this program in the National       Defense Authorization Act.            Respectfully,                                         Thomas H.

Dear Representative Lipinski: As strong supporters of       establishing a national security innovation workforce, we       commend your support for the Hacking for Defense Program,       operated under MD5, the National Security Technology       Accelerator within the Office of the Under Secretary of       Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. We       support your effort to authorize the program and create the       option for the Secretary of Defense to expend up to $15       million to expand and strengthen existing programs designed       to boost Veterans innovation education.        A public-private partnership between the National Defense       University and a network of national research universities,       MD5 was recognized in the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense       Authorization Act as "an important pilot program making vital       contributions in the field of technology innovation." The       program emphasizes the incentives, outreach, professional       military education, and skills-based training necessary to       build a National Security Innovation Corps.        By leveraging programs like Hacking for Defense (H4D), MD5       is growing a cadre of entrepreneurs that are adept at       critical thinking, creative problem solving, and the       formation of successful ventures that deliver economic,       national security, and social value. H4D classes educate       Veterans and other students in technology innovation and       entrepreneurship, and provide a unique pathway for Veterans       to leverage their expertise while learning cutting-edge       business innovation methodology, increasing post-military       opportunities and applying their knowledge to new national       security problems.        Additional funds will help MD5 build on its early success       by expanding H4D training to universities nationwide, as well       as government personnel and other organizations responsible       for innovation efforts. Funds will be used to expand the       development of resources, to include Veteran recruitment       materials, model curriculum, training materials, and best       practices to support university entrepreneurial education       programs.        We support your amendment 352 to H.R. 2810, the National       Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, to continue       to grow the national security innovation workforce.

Hon. Daniel W. Lipinski,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Lipinski: For over 80 years, Alion has       been called upon to solve the nation's most important and       challenging problems. Our original charter in 1936, as Armour       Research Foundation (later the Illinois Institute of       Technology Research Institute, or ``IITRI''), identified our       purpose: ``to experiment upon, test, promote, and develop the       public, scientific, and commercial value of inventions,       discoveries, and processes.'' Our focus has remained       constant, while we continue to evolve to apply the latest       innovations in science, technology and engineering to address       the needs of this great nation. One innovation still in use       today is our development of the ``Armour alloy,'' a titanium       alloy that saved the Air Force's gas turbine engine program,       and is still used in military fighting vehicles and advanced       prosthetics. Beginning during the interwar period, continuing       through America's superpower status in the wake of our       successful contributions to World War II, and enduring       through the rapidly evolving and complex global security       environment of the present day, Alion is an important part of       the American fabric of innovation.        Today, Alion stands strong on this solid foundation,       supporting customers in defense, civilian government, and       commercial industries. Our 21 labs and 2,300-person staff       provide Alion the physical and intellectual resources to       tackle any problem. Our history as an academic research       center informs our approach of bringing together the       brightest minds and best technologies from wherever they       reside: government labs, large industry, universities, or       small businesses. For example, when in 2015 the Secretary of       Defense established a new initiative to expand access to       global commercial technology innovations, Alion was the first       partner to close a deal with a commercial company focused on       big data analytics; as we have done many times, Alion       brokered an effective translation between military need and       commercial capabilities, bringing the two together into a       successful solution.        As strong supporters of establishing a national security       innovation workforce, we commend your support for the Hacking       for Defense Program, operated under MD5, the National       Security Technology Accelerator within the Office of the       Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and       Logistics. We support your effort to authorize the program       and create the option for the Secretary of Defense to expend       up to $15 million to expand and strengthen existing programs       designed to boost veterans' innovation education.

Hon. Daniel W. Lipinski,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Lipinski: The University of Colorado,       and its College of Engineering and Applied Science, is an       avid supporter of establishing a strong national security       innovation workforce, and we commend your support for MD5,       the National Security Technology Accelerator within the       Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,       Technology, and Logistics. We support your effort to       authorize the program and create the option for the Secretary       of Defense to expend up to $15 million to expand and       strengthen existing programs designed to boost veteran's       innovation education.        In our position as the flagship research university in one       of the nation's top Aerospace & Defense economies, we       recognize the need to maintain a decisive advantage in       technology innovation. Our research partners--including Ball       Aerospace, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Sierra Nevada       Corporation, and Raytheon--routinely emphasize an increasing       need for highly trained, technically competent, agile, and       innovative engineers and scientists to address the most       pressing technology challenges in National Security.        As the newest member of MD5, we believe programs like       Hacking for Defense (H4D) are critical to developing a strong       corps of future entrepreneurs that are adept at critical       thinking, creative problem solving, and the formation of       successful ventures that deliver economic, national security,       and social value. The H4D curriculum educates veterans and       other students in technology innovation and entrepreneurship,       and provides a unique pathway to leverage their expertise       while learning cutting-edge business innovation methodology       and applying their knowledge to new national security       problems.        Additional funding will help MD5 build on its early success       by expanding H4D training to universities and other       innovation organizations nationwide. Funds will be used to       expand the development of resources, to include veteran       recruitment materials, model curriculum, training materials,       and best practices that will further enhance our university       entrepreneurial education programs.        We support your amendment 352 to H.R. 2810, the National       Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, to continue       to grow the national security innovation workforce.            Sincerely,                                                   Robert D. Braun,      Dean, College of Engineering and Applied Science.                                   ____                                                        OGSYSTEMS,                                                      July 12, 2017.      Hon. Daniel W. Lipinski,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Lipinski: As strong supporters of       establishing a national security innovation workforce, we       commend your support for the Hacking for Defense Program,       operated under MD5, the National Security Technology       Accelerator within the Office of the Under Secretary of       Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. We       support your effort to authorize the program and create the       option for the Secretary of Defense to expend up to $15       million to expand and strengthen existing programs designed       to boost veteran innovation education.        A public-private partnership between the National Defense       University and a network of national research universities,       MD5 was recognized in the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense       Authorization Act as ``an important pilot program making       vital contributions in the field of technology innovation.''       The program emphasizes the incentives, outreach, professional       military education, and skills-based training necessary to       build a National Security Innovation Corps.        By leveraging programs like Hacking for Defense (H4D), MD5       is growing a cadre of entrepreneurs that are adept at       critical thinking, creative problem solving, and the       formation of the workforce innovative government contractors       like OGSystems need to deliver economic, national security,       and social value. H4D classes educate veterans and other       students in technology innovation and entrepreneurship, and       provide a unique pathway for veterans to leverage their       expertise while learning cutting-edge business innovation       methodology, increasing post-military opportunities and       applying their knowledge to new national security problems.        I have personally seen the positive impact to the       Government agencies we support in both the H4D definition of       problems and in the engagement of innovative sources of ideas       to solve them. An example of one of the teams I helped to       mentor was Capella Space at Stanford University, who is now       VC funded and working on national defense problems in radar       that even the Multi-Billion defense contractors weren't       interested in investing IR&D funding. This is a win-win       situation in the activation of non-traditional sources of       innovation for DoD and the driving of solutions that impact       national security.        Additional funds will help MDS build on its early success       by expanding H4D training to universities nationwide, as well       as government personnel and other organizations responsible       for innovation efforts. Funds will be used to expand the       development of resources, to include veteran recruitment       materials, model curriculum, training materials, and best       practices to support university entrepreneurial education       programs.        We support amendment 352 to H.R. 2810, the National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, to continue to grow       the national security innovation workforce.            Sincerely,                                                     Garrett Pagon,                                                         President.     Mr. Chair, the second amendment deals with  cybersecurity standards.   At the end of 2016, the DOD issued important updated cybersecurity  standards for defense contractors. Companies must implement these new  standards by January 1, 2018. However, I have heard from a number of  small manufacturers in my district that it is very difficult getting  the information and expertise necessary to institute these standards.  They fear this may mean the end of their companies.   America cannot afford to lose these small businesses, so my amendment  encourages the Secretary of Defense to establish a cooperative program  between the DOD and MIST to educate and assist small- and medium-sized  manufacturing firms in achieving compliance with the updated  cybersecurity standards.   This would help improve cybersecurity access across the defense  supply chain while also preserving competition for DOD contracts. It  has received broad support from the business and technology community.   Mr. Chair, I thank the chair and ranking member for supporting these  two amendments in this bloc and the next.   I ask my colleagues to support these amendments.
