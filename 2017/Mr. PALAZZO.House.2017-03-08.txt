 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Frelinghuysen for the  time.   I rise today in strong support of the fiscal year 2017 Defense  Appropriations bill. I have long said that the number one  constitutional responsibility of this body is the common defense of  this Nation, and today, the Appropriations Committee, under the  leadership of Chairman Frelinghuysen, has once again shown the  importance that we place on this most sacred duty.   After years of weak budget requests from our prior administration,  this bill contains over $5.2 billion over the 2016 level and $1.5  billion more than the Obama administration's request.   Included in this appropriations bill is the funding of 10 new ships  for our Navy, including an LPD, essential to our Marine Corps mission,  as well as 3 destroyers, 2 Virginia class submarines, 3 LCSs, and an  LHA, all ships desperately needed by our Navy and Marine Corps.   Funding these ships steadily is not only a key to keeping our  military strong, but also keeps our industrial base healthy and keeps  these ships affordable in the long run.   Finally, this appropriations bill takes the first steps toward  rebuilding our military, showing our allies that they can trust us, and  showing our enemies they should fear us.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his work and his staff's work  on this fine bill, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support this  important legislation.
