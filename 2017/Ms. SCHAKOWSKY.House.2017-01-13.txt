 Mr. Chair, I want to say right now I believe--and it  will be true, you will see--that Republicans will regret the repeal of  ObamaCare.   Hospitals in rural and underserved areas are panicking right now  because they are finally getting paid through ObamaCare to serve low- income people. Jobs will be lost. Those hospitals could close. Thirty  million people will lose their benefits.   I want to tell you, on the Energy and Commerce Committee, I have been  hearing for years ever since ObamaCare passed, all these horror stories  that my Republican colleagues embrace as evidence that this thing isn't  working. Never once have they been willing to sit down with us.   We don't claim that the bill is perfect, but we know that there are  millions and millions of people with preexisting conditions or who run  out of insurance when they hit their lifetime caps. We know it has  helped, and yet never has a Republican been willing to sit down with us  and craft amendments that would make this legislation better.   Repeal means that the Republicans will make Americans sick again.
