 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of S. 2245  and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, it is an honor to be involved in the  passage of this important legislation. The Knowledgeable Innovators and  Worthy Investors Act, or KIWI Act, is a bipartisan bill that  legislatively extends E-1 and E-2 visas to citizens of New Zealand. It  does not increase the number of available visas.   Granting access to these visas to New Zealand would increase both  investment and trade into the United States and strengthen our  relationship with New Zealand.   New Zealand is, of course, a country that is critical to our  relationships. We have a critical strategic military and economic  partner in the Asia-Pacific region with New Zealand, and this  legislation will further strengthen America's presence in the Asia- Pacific region.   E-1 and E-2 visas allow qualified foreign nationals to engage in  substantial trade or to develop and direct the operations of an  enterprise in which the individual is heavily invested.   The United States will benefit from increased investment in trade  with New Zealand. New Zealand's citizens and businesses currently make  substantial investments in the United States. These businesses have  created more than 10,000 jobs. In 2017, $10.5 billion in trade passed  between the United States and New Zealand.   Allowing New Zealanders to apply for E-1 and E-2 visas will affirm  reciprocity and strengthen the United States' relationship with New  Zealand. Again, this is a country that is a critical ally and a partner  in the Asia-Pacific region, and it will also increase the United  States' presence in that region.   New Zealand is the only Five-Eyes country whose citizens are  currently ineligible to apply for these visas, while American citizens  are currently eligible for reciprocal visas in New Zealand. So I am  grateful and honored to be involved in moving this legislation.  [[Page S4701]]  I am grateful to my colleagues for consenting to this. I am grateful to  have worked on this with my distinguished colleague, the Senator from  Hawaii, who worked hard with me to put together this bipartisan piece  of legislation that we have been fortunate enough to pass through the  Senate today.   Thank you.   I see that my colleague from Hawaii is here.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, most people in America are probably familiar  with the advertising slogans: ``Pork, the other white meat'' and  ``Beef, it's what's for dinner,'' but what they might not know, what  they might not be as aware of is the cronyist underbelly of slogans  like these.   The U.S. Department of Agriculture checkoff programs behind these  very slogans and others like them tend to collect compulsory fees from  producers of milk, eggs, beef, and other agricultural products. These  funds are then used to promote and do research on those particular  commodities.   Unfortunately, these programs have been rife with opportunities for  abuse. Many of these programs have crept far beyond the scope of their  statutory mandate by engaging in illegal lobbying and anticompetitive  activities. Take, for example, the case of a small California company  called JUST, Inc., formerly known as Hampton Creek, which a few years  ago was attacked for selling its vegan mayonnaise known as Just Mayo in  stores nationwide. It turns out that a Federal entity called the  American Egg Board conspired with USDA employees and top executives  from the egg industry to threaten and coerce retailers into not  carrying the Just Mayo brand.   The original intent of these programs was to research and promote  certain commodities, not to disparage other ones, and they certainly  were not intended to prevent any new products from having a fair chance  in the marketplace.   Let me just stop, by the way, while we are talking about Just Mayo  and that incident, to take note of the fact that it ought to be very  concerning to us that the Federal Government became involved in a  campaign to pressure someone about whether they could set up a brand of  vegan mayonnaise and call it that.   So what were supposed to be promotional boards have instead become  protectionist boards. What is more, checkoff programs force farmers to  pay into a system that sometimes actively works against their interests  and, on top of that, the boards for these programs have come under fire  for a lack of transparency and for misuse of their funds. Some have  gone so far as failing to submit congressionally mandated spending  reports, refusing and delaying requests under FOIA, and even engaging  in protracted legal battles to prevent public audits from being  disclosed.   In short, these programs--the so-called checkoff programs--are in  significant need of reform. This is why I have worked hard with my  colleagues--Senator Booker, Senator Hassan, Senator Paul, and Senator  Warren--to introduce amendment No. 3074. This amendment would address  some of the most grievous abuses of these commodity checkoff programs.   First, the amendment would prohibit them--these checkoff programs-- from contracting with any organization that lobbies on agricultural  policy with an exemption for research at institutions of higher  education. It would also prohibit employees and agents of the checkoff  boards from engaging in activities that may pose a conflict of  interest. Furthermore, the amendment would establish uniform standards  for checkoff programs that prohibit anticompetitive activity and any  unfair or deceptive practices.   While this amendment would not abolish checkoff programs, it would  implement much needed transparency measures so farmers can see what  their checkoff dollars are actually being spent to do. These  commonsense reforms will not be convenient perhaps to the giants of the  agricultural industry--at least not the ones using checkoff dollars to  rig the system in their favor. These commonsense reforms will help  farmers--and particularly the little guys--from the small farms and the  startup companies to see exactly where the fees they pay are going and  ensure that their hard-earned money is not being used unfairly against  them.   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment to bring  about much needed reform with checkoff programs.   I yield the floor.
