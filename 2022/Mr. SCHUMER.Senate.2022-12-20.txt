 Mr. President, I have good news. With days left before  Christmas, Democrats and Republicans have reached an omnibus agreement,  completed at 1:15 a.m. early this morning.   In the very early hours of the morning, Chairman Leahy and Ranking  Member Shelby released a long-sought, bipartisan, bicameral Omnibus  appropriations bill for fiscal year 2023.   The omnibus is the last thing we have to do to close out a very  successful 117th Congress, and we have taken another step--a major  step--towards reaching the goal line.   After a lot of hard work, this package represents an aggressive  investment in American families, American workers, and America's  national defense. It will give our troops a raise, make healthcare more  affordable for millions, and it fulfills the promise Democrats made to  defend democracy at home and abroad through the ECA.   It was no easy feat to piece this bill together, and if our amazing  appropriator staff needs a quick power nap at their desks this morning,  no one is going to blame them.   I want to thank Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Shelby for working  on this omnibus for months without cease. I can't think of a more  fitting sendoff for our two esteemed appropriators than this. If this  omnibus goes down as Senators Leahy and Shelby's final legislative  contribution as Senators, then I say bravo, thank you, and well done.   I also want to thank my colleagues in the House--above all, Speaker  Pelosi and Chair DeLauro for their relentless work.   The clock is now ticking until government funding runs out this  Friday. Between now and the end of the week, the watchwords for the  Senate will be ``speed'' and ``cooperation.''   For the information of Senators, we are going to get going on this  process today. Members should be ready to vote to lay the omnibus  before the Senate as soon as this afternoon. We must finish passing  this omnibus before the deadline on Friday, when government funding  runs out, but we hope to do it much sooner than that because we are  mindful that a nor'easter is barreling down the east coast on Thursday  and Friday.   Let me say this again. The sooner we pass the omnibus, the better. We  have until Friday before funding runs out, but we ought to get it done  well before then.  [[Page S7788]]    I hope no Senator will stand in the way of our finishing our work. We  cannot afford a shutdown. More importantly, the American people need us  to act quickly. As I said, the American people need us to act quickly  to avert the looming danger of a government shutdown. Nobody wants a  shutdown. Nobody benefits from a shutdown. So I hope nobody here will  stand in the way of funding the government ASAP.   Now let's turn to the omnibus itself. This funding bill is  overflowing with very good news for our troops, for the Ukrainian brave  fighters, for American jobs, for our families, and for American  democracy.   After a lot of hard work, Democrats will fulfill our promise to pass  reforms to the Electoral Count Act into law. Two years after January 6,  the attack on our Capitol remains an indelible stain on our democracy,  and updating the Electoral Count Act is one of the ways we can prevent  another January 6 in the future. It is so important to do.   I want to thank Senators Manchin and Collins and the group they put  together to put the ECA together and Senators Klobuchar and Blunt on  the Rules Committee for their help in making this happen.   I said months ago we would do everything possible to pass ECA reform,  and now we are following through. Many thanks, of course, go to all my  colleagues who made this possible.   The omnibus is also going to fulfill our promise to stand with our  friends in Ukraine with billions more in emergency economic and  military aid. The bitterness of winter has descended on Eastern Europe,  and if our friends in Ukraine hope to triumph over Russia, America must  stand firmly on the side of our democratic friends abroad. They are not  asking for, nor do they want American troops, but they do need the  weaponry to defend themselves against a brutal Putin.   On the homefront, the omnibus will make healthcare more affordable  and more expansive for millions upon millions of Americans. For the  first time ever, every child in America who qualifies for Medicaid or  CHIP will now be guaranteed at least one year of continuous health  coverage. This is a major change that will make a big difference in  improving healthcare for millions of kids.   We will permanently extend a policy from the American Rescue Plan  that let States give a full year of postpartum coverage for mothers on  Medicaid and CHIP. This is something huge, something I have so strongly  believed in and fought for. It is a major step to address America's  crisis in maternal health and mortality.   Many elements of the Momnibus are in this bill, good elements of the  Momnibus, particularly for women of color, who have long been  discriminated against when it comes to birth and postpartum coverage.   The omnibus also represents a new offensive in the battle against  America's mental health crisis. We all know that crisis is at record  levels. We all know we have to do something about it. This omnibus  does. Overdoses and substance abuse are at record levels. I fought hard  to make sure this package will allow seniors to get Medicare coverage  for counseling, funding to train new psychiatrists, create new mental  health mobile crisis units, and instruct Medicare to cover intensive  outpatient mental health care.   We are also going to attack the opioid crisis head-on by expanding  options for medication-assisted treatment while also making never- before-seen investments in suicide prevention, maternal mental health,  pediatric mental health, and so much more.   We will also keep making healthcare more accessible than it was in  years past. We will ensure Medicare beneficiaries can keep using  telehealth through 2024. That is huge, particularly in rural areas.   We will invest new resources to hire and train more doctors, nurses,  and other healthcare workers, who have been in high demand over the  past couple of years.   We are also increasing support for rural and low-income hospitals  that very often have to get by with precious little help.   So on the healthcare front, the omnibus is an aggressive, generous,  and far-reaching package, and I salute all those, including Chairman  Murray and Chairman Leahy, for their work on this.   On the manufacturing and science front, the omnibus secures the first  major downpayment in building the tech hubs across the country that we  have authorized through the CHIPS and Science Act. This means real  dollars to create the silicon valleys, the silicon forests, the silicon  heartlands and prairies of tomorrow. Again, I want to thank Chair  Cantwell for her steadfast leadership on this issue, as well as my  colleague on the other side of the aisle, Todd Young.   Under the omnibus, we will also secure the largest increase for the  National Science Foundation of all time, including a surge in funds for  the new Technology Directorate and for STEM workforce training that  will spur chip growth across the country and give training to millions  who have been left out of the increase in jobs in tech.   Also included are billions to support universities, national labs,  manufacturers, entrepreneurs, and workers with the support necessary  for the United States to beat back China and remain technologically  competitive on the world stage.   That is not all. There is much more to celebrate in this package. We  will keep our promise to our veterans by fully funding provisions of  the PACT Act so veterans suffering from burn pit exposure can get the  care they deserve. We will help veterans with their mental health  needs, reform VA long-term care services, and support veterans who  struggle with homelessness.   We say to our veterans: You have been there when we needed you; this  omnibus is there when you need us.   For students, we have secured the largest increase in Pell grants in  over a decade--an increase of $500; the maximum Pell Grant will now be  $7,395, providing ladders-up for millions of kids who come from poor  and working families. That is a great thing.   For the first time in history, we will also bring Indian Health  Services into parity with all other healthcare providers. This historic  provision helps fulfill the Federal Government's trust responsibility  to our tribes. We will provide more resources, healthcare coverage, and  the dignity they deserve.   We have secured billions for more childcare access, billions for  homeless assistance grants, billions for Rural Housing Services, over a  billion for HOME Investment Partnership Programs, and over a billion  for the Housing for the Elderly and Housing for Persons with  Disabilities Program. So from start to finish and from top to bottom,  this omnibus is bold, generous, far-reaching, and ambitious.   It is not everything we would have wanted, of course. When you are  dealing in a bipartisan, bicameral way, you have to sit down and get it  done and that means each side has to concede some things; but it is  something that we can be very proud of--all of us.   Now we must get this done before Friday--well before that, if  possible.   I want to thank every single colleague and staff Member who worked  relentlessly to put this piece together; not only Senators Leahy and  Shelby but their subcommittee chairs and ranking members. It was a  herculean feat for our dedicated appropriators. The process may have  been difficult, but I am confident we are now in a position to pass  this bill quickly. And I am even more confident that once we finish our  work on this package, America will be a healthier, more prosperous, and  more secure country thanks to the work we have done here and now.   Thanks to my colleagues. Let's finish the bill very soon.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Well, it is never easy to bid farewell to a retiring  colleague, but, boy, this one is hard. It is even harder to bid  farewell to a friend; and everyone is Pat's friend. But today, we say  thank you not to just a colleague and not just a dear friend, but to an  institution all his own.   Pat, we are here to say we honor you. We are here to say we will miss  you. Most of all, we are here to say we are happy for you on your well- earned retirement.   We all just heard Pat speaking so eloquently, so beautifully from the  heart, from his good soul. And it took a lot of strength for all of us  to keep this together. I saw lots of misty eyes in different parts of  his speech--lots of misty eyes.   It is the conclusion of an era here in the Senate. We will call this  the Leahy era for all you have done. It is an era that began in the  aftermath of Watergate and now concludes nearly 50 years and 8 terms  later, a legacy that includes so much--Appropriations chair, Judiciary  chair, President pro tempore. And to be sure, he is finishing his  tenure precisely the way we all expect him to, by being up at 1:30 a.m.  this morning--it kept getting later--to file the omnibus.   If you looked up the word ``Senator'' in the dictionary, you wouldn't  be crazy to expect a picture of Pat included alongside that word. His  name is synonymous with everything good, dignified, and admirable in  the upper Chamber. Pat learned so much in the years he has been here,  and Pat was everything.   One accomplishment that he mentioned that just shows the mettle of  the man was the work he did on land mines, anti-personnel land minds.  He did an amazing job. There are thousands and thousands of people  across the world--children, old people, and everyone in between--who  are not maimed, who are alive because of his persistence, his  dedication. It took all of his skills, his knowledge of policy, his  bipartisan chops, eloquence on the floor, his stubborn relentlessness,  and most of all, his sense of duty to the people of world. He so aptly  concluded with the picture we have all seen in his office over his  desk.   Of course, Pat will be the first to shun these accomplishments as his  alone. After all, he is just one half of the equation. The other half,  of course, is Marcelle, an amazing, amazing person. And we love you,  Marcelle. We love you.   (Applause.)   So, folks, it is the end of an era. Pat has done an amazing job in so  many different ways. He could have sat here all day and all night if he  were to delineate everything he has done for us and the American  people.   Folks, in closing, let me return to a serious thought on duty from a  source I suspect is near and dear to Pat's heart, the great poet Robert  Frost. For those unfamiliar, the title of Pat's new memoir, ``The Road  Taken,'' which everyone should read, is a play on Frost's famous poem  ``The Road Not Taken.'' Like Pat, Frost lived in Vermont, at least for  much of his life. He was a great lover of nature, a bold voice for a  generation confounded by war, depression, and disruptions of modernity.   But there is another Frost poem I want to cite today, ``Stopping by  Woods on a Snowy Evening.'' It is about a man torn between his sense of  duty to get home to his family and stopping to bask in the beauty of  the countryside:         Whose woods these are I think I know.        His house is in the village though;        He will not see me stopping here        To watch his woods fill up with snow.        The woods are lovely, dark and deep,        But I have promises to keep,        And miles to go before I sleep,        And miles to go before I sleep.    Pat, you have walked the miles; you kept your promises; and when you  get home to your beautiful tree farm up in northern Vermont, you have  earned more than a few extra hours of sleep. But I have no doubt when  you get up each morning, you will be going, striving, keeping on  finding new ways to make Vermont a better place, just as you made the  Senate a better place for all of us.   Thank you, dear friend. We love you. We love you. We are going to  miss you and Marcelle so very, very much.   (Applause.)    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senate has  received a message from the House of Representatives to accompany H.R.  2617.    I ask that the Chair lay before the Senate the message  to accompany H.R. 2617, and I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment  to the Senate amendment No. 4 to H.R. 2617, with an amendment.    I ask consent that further reading of the amendment be  dispensed with.

I ask consent that further reading of the motion be  dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I have an amendment to the instructions  at the desk.    I ask consent that further reading of the amendment be  dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I have a second-degree amendment at the  desk.    I ask consent that further reading of the amendment be  dispensed with.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination:  Calendar No. 1235, Gene Rodrigues, of California, to be Assistant  Secretary of Energy; that the Senate vote on the nomination without  intervening action or debate; that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table; that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate resume  legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to  be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the  Republican leader, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider:  Calendar No. 780, Agnes Schaefer, of Pennsylvania, to be an Assistant  Secretary of the Army; that there be 10 minutes for debate equally  divided in the usual form on the nomination; that upon the use or  yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the nomination without  intervening action or debate; that, if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the  Senate resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to  be determined by the majority leader in consultation with the  Republican leader, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider:  Calendar No. 781, Franklin R. Parker, of the District of Columbia, to  be an Assistant Secretary of the Navy; that there be 10 minutes for  debate equally divided in the usual form on the nomination; that upon  use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the nomination without  intervening action or debate; that, if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the  Senate resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. on  Wednesday, December 21; that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider  Calendar No. 1271, Lynne Tracy, to be Ambassador to the Russian  Federation; further, that at 11:30 a.m., the Senate vote on  confirmation of the Tracy nomination.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 12:11 a.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, December 21, 2022, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
