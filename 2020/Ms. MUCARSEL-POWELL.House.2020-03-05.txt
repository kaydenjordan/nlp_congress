 Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of Ms.  Schrier, and I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment will ensure that  the TSA Administrator works in coordination with the Directors of the  Centers for Disease Control and the National Institute of Allergy and  Infectious Diseases to ensure that TSA employees are provided the  proper guidance regarding prevention and protections against  coronavirus, including appropriate resources.   TSA employees are on the front lines of strengthening the safety of  our transportation systems while ensuring the freedom of movement for  people and commerce, which is why this underlying legislation is so  important.   As part of their mission, TSA employees constantly come in close  contact with countless people every day from across the country and  from around the world. This means that their potential risk and  exposure to the virus is heightened.   Our TSA employees work every day to protect us as we travel. In turn,  we must do all we can to protect them while they are on the job.   Mr. Chairman, I urge support of this amendment and underlying bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am in agreement. I urge the  support of this agreement, and I yield back the balance of my time.
