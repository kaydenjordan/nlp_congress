 Mr. Chair, I rise today to speak about my amendment  included in en bloc No. 11.   Mr. Chair, my amendment would bestow the privilege of lying in honor  in the rotunda of the United States Capitol to the last surviving Medal  of Honor recipient of the Second World War.   From the beaches of Normandy, across the seas of Japan, and into the  deserts of Africa, the Greatest Generation fought selflessly to protect  freedom around the world. It is our duty to honor the sacrifices they  made to safeguard hope and liberty for all.   The walls of this historic building have seen the most courageous  members of our society. Americans from coast to coast come here to pay  their respects to the heroes of our history, an ability that would not  be possible without the responsibilities that fell on to our brave  parents and grandparents.   We must ensure our children and grandchildren remember those who  worked to secure our Nation and freed the world from tyranny.   When I started working on this, there were four. Now, there are only  three  [[Page H5649]]  living recipients of the Medal of Honor who went above and beyond the  call of duty during World War II, one of whom is a dear friend and West  Virginia native, Hershel ``Woody'' Williams, who fought valiantly  during the Battle of Iwo Jima.   In this time of deep political divide, honoring our Nation's greatest  heroes is something we can all come together and agree upon. I ask all  Members to support my amendment to honor our Greatest Generation and  preserve their legacy as defenders of freedom.
