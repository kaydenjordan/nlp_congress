 Madam Speaker, I rise today to deliver my final remarks  on the floor of the people's House.   I am humbled to have spent the last 2 years in this Chamber, where I  proudly served New Mexico, alongside my colleagues past and present in  the New Mexico delegation. I am thankful to Senators Martin Heinrich  and Ben Ray Lujan, in particular, for helping to build support for my  confirmation, and to former Senator Tom Udall for his years of  friendship and mentorship.   I love New Mexico. Not only is it my home, where I raised my child,  went to  [[Page H1368]]  college, started a small business, and started organizing, it is my  ancestral homeland.   As a 35th-generation New Mexican, and not unlike the other families  with roots in our State, I have a deep connection to the land, air, and  water that sustains our communities. My ancestors settled there because  they were drawn to the once-mighty Rio Grande and the sacred places  that dot the sandstone mesas and granite mountains.   That is why I made the most of my time in Congress. I spent every  opportunity meeting with families, listening to small business owners,  learning about our tech industry, connecting with brave servicemembers  and veterans, and working to deliver for the people.    When I was a little girl, none of this crossed my mind as a  possibility for me. I wasn't one of the students picked out to apply to  college. In fact, I didn't apply to college until I was 28. I was  constantly struggling to make ends meet, and I raised my child as a  single mom.   Growing up, Native women rarely held Federal leadership positions,  and now little girls everywhere will know that they can run for  Congress and win and that this country holds promise for everyone.   In fact, it is the unique experiences and struggles that make good  leaders and why I became an organizer in the first place. I believe  that it is the fact that I relied on food stamps to feed my family that  makes me qualified to advocate for families like mine. It is the fact  that I overcame addiction that makes me qualified to help people who  are in their own struggles. It is the fact that I know what it is like  to be indigenous that makes me qualified to advocate for our country to  meet its trust responsibility.   The beauty of this Chamber is that each Member of Congress brings  their unique experiences to the table and advocates for the causes we  know best. With Speaker Nancy Pelosi's brilliant leadership, House  Natural Resources Committee Chair Raul Grijalva's wisdom, and House  Armed Services Committee Chair Adam Smith's guidance, and all the  leadership here in the House, I had the opportunity to make a real  difference for communities everywhere by addressing climate change;  protecting voting rights; fighting for racial, environmental, and  economic justice; and providing urgent COVID relief for millions of  people.   I am also thankful for the collaboration and mentorship of my  colleagues across the aisle, including Representative Tom Cole and the  dean of the House, Don Young, and my colleagues on the House Armed  Services and Natural Resources Committees.   We worked in a bipartisan way to address issues, including missing  and murdered indigenous women and ensuring that our servicemen and - women and military families have the resources that they need.   To my colleagues in the Tri-Caucus, thank you for embracing the  issues facing Native Americans and working to address longstanding  disparities in our communities.   I am proud that, with the support of my colleagues, several of my  bills became law: the Not Invisible Act; Rent the Camo, a pilot program  for pregnant servicemembers in the 2021 NDAA; the PROGRESS for Indian  Tribes Act; provisions from my Military Housing Oversight and  Servicemember Protection Act in the 2020 NDAA; the Native American  Business Incubators Act; and the Veterans Affairs Tribal Advisory  Committee Act.   I thought I would have more time here, but we are called to service  in different ways.   Though I am excited to become the first Native American Cabinet  Secretary in history, I am also sad to leave this Chamber. As a twice- elected Member of Congress, it has been both a pleasure and privilege  to serve alongside you in our quest to improve the lives of the  American people.   I want each of you to know that I am grateful for the knowledge you  shared with me, the friendship, and the work we accomplished together,  and I will miss all of you dearly.   I wouldn't be here today without my extraordinary staff in  Albuquerque and here at the Capitol, the Natural Resources Committee  staff, and the House Armed Services Committee staff. They all put in  very long hours on behalf of our State and our country. My legislative  accomplishments are also their accomplishments.   Additionally, thanks to all of the staff who work right here on the  floor, whose dedication and experience keep our Congress running. I am  so grateful to all of you.   To New Mexico, thank you. Thank you to the activists, supporters,  families, and communities that make our State an incredible place to  call home.                            ____________________
