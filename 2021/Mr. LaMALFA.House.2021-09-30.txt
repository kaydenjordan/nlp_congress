 Madam Speaker, this debt ceiling increase being  contemplated isn't just about paying off things we have already  committed for. It is actually a blank check for unlimited spending  until December of 2022.   Our collective national debt is somewhere around $28 trillion now, or  about $85,000 per person. Every American.   Now, in 2013 the lie of the year was named, ``If you like your health  plan, you can keep it.'' In the Biden campaign, it was, ``Nobody making  under $400,000 would have their taxes raised, period.'' That is setting  up to be the next lie of the year.   The effects we see of this legislation will be 5 percent of taxpayers  earning between $40,000 and $50,000 and 59 percent of those earning  between $200,000 and $500,000 would be affected greatly by increased  taxes.   Let that sink in. The President's plan will raise taxes on people  making as low as $40,000, not the $400,000 he promised.   We should be talking about hard caps on spending and getting our  fiscal house in order instead of spending on the Green New Deal that is  coming up.                            ____________________
