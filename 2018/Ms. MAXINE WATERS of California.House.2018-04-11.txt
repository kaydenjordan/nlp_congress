 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose H.R. 4293, the Stress Test Improvement  Act, which is designed to line Wall Street's pockets by weakening a  critical tool to prevent a future financial crisis.   Bank stress tests are a forward-looking tool where a hypothetical  scenario or two are tested, such as, how would a megabank fare if a  major recession occurred next year with unemployment and foreclosures  going way up? These tests, incredibly, are very helpful to see if banks  might need to maintain more capital to help buffer against such a  scenario.                                time  1430    These are similar to crash tests for cars where a manufacturer runs  their cars through crash test simulations to see if passengers will  remain safe in various kinds of crashes. Such testing provides valuable  insights regarding what design adjustments might be needed to ensure  the car is as safe as possible.   So let us take a look at how this safeguard developed. When President  Obama took office, his administration inherited an economy in free fall  with about 800,000 jobs lost that very month. Many wondered how many  more financial firms might fail. So Treasury Secretary Geithner worked  with the Federal Reserve, and together they designed the Supervisory  Capital Assessment Program.   These stress tests checked how resilient the largest banks were if,  in fact, the economy continued to deteriorate. Results were published,  and we learned that 10 of the 19 participating firms were collectively  about $75 billion short of the required capital ratios. These tests  provided criminal transparency to the market, thereby enabling the  banks to begin recapitalizing themselves with new funds from investors  who themselves had renewed confidence in the banking industry.   Following this success, Congress decided to mandate these stress  tests to be regularly required of the Nation's largest banks in Dodd- Frank. This would ensure banks and their regulators remained vigilant,  especially when times were good, so that they could spot problems much  earlier and take corrective action.   The Federal Reserve implemented these Dodd-Frank stress tests  alongside their Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, known as  CCAR, which added a capital planning component to the tests.   According to credit rating agencies and financial analysts, these  stress tests, along with Dodd-Frank's other enhanced prudential  requirements of the largest banks, have made our financial system much  safer.   Now, let me give you some numbers. Since 2009, the 34 largest banks  have increased their capital by $750 billion, bringing the industry's  total capital buffer to nearly $2 trillion today. That is $750 billion  in more high-quality funding that banks can safely lend and invest,  which helps explain why business lending has also increased almost 80  percent the last 8 years.   But H.R. 4293, this bill, would undermine all of that and proposes  three changes that megabanks like Wells Fargo would love to see. First,  the bill would eliminate the adverse scenario from Fed-run stress  tests. But like in car crash tests today, multiple scenarios can help  ensure an institution can survive a wider range of unforeseen events.   Second, the bill would bar the Fed from making qualitative objections  to a bank's capital plan. Even the Federal Reserve led by President  Trump's appointees issued a lengthy proposal yesterday altering some of  the stress testing rules, and their proposal maintains their ability to  make qualitative objections. So there is no basis for Congress to  unilaterally make it harder for regulators to ensure megabanks are well  run and capitalized.   Third, the bill would allow Wall Street megabanks to conduct fewer  company-run stress tests--annually instead of semiannually. But given  how quickly tides can shift, routine, semiannual testing can better  identify problems before they grow into larger problems.   As a former Federal Reserve official wrote last year: ``Had stress  tests as conducted now been in place before the crisis, they could have  made firms more resilient to unexpected losses, and at a minimum could  have given supervisors the ability to question banks' continued  dividend and share buybacks in the quarters leading to the height of  the crisis.''   Accordingly, I strongly urge Members to reject this rollback for Wall  Street megabanks.   Let me just add by saying: Why would we do this?   Why would we, knowing what we went through in 2008 where we had this  subprime meltdown, we went into a recession--almost a depression--and  we discovered that the banks were undercapitalized and they could not  deal with this kind of change in the economy, they could not deal with  the fact that something had gone wrong and be prepared to deal with it  rather than us having to bail them out in the way that we did?   I don't know why we would do this now. So I would simply ask Members  to ask the question: Why is it we would take away something that would  make the banks safer, that would make them more stable, and that would  make them able to be able to sustain despite the fact there was a  crisis developing in the economy?   Why would we want to take away this safety that we have built with  stress testing?   So, with that, Mr. Speaker, I would ask the Members to reject this  rollback for Wall Street megabanks, and I reserve the balance of my  time.  [[Page H3114]]         Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, I raise the question of why are we considering a  bill that would reduce the amount of scrutiny that we have with this  stress testing from the biggest banks in America, when, in fact, we  know that this stress testing was created because of the problems that  we were faced with in 2008?   We learned an awful lot about what we should not do and what we  should change in order never to be in the position again where we have  to bail out all of these big banks.                                time  1445    We are simply saying: Banks, you have to be tested. You have to have  a stress test to see if you can withstand the difficulty that will be  presented if, in fact, the economy gets in trouble. It is as simple as  that.   Do you have enough capital? Are you organized in such a way that you  won't go under, that you won't create a problem in our economy because  of the size of your bank if you get in trouble?  [[Page H3115]]    So I would simply ask our Members to reject this bill because this  bill is not needed. It is simply a way by which to comply with the  megabanks' request to not have to do the work that is necessary to  prove that they are safe. And I don't know why we would do that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to share with Members a Communications  Workers of America letter to us on H.R. 4293.   And they state: H.R. 4293 would undermine the effectiveness of the  Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review--that is,  CCAR--stress test. Specifically, the bill would prohibit the Federal  Reserve from objecting to a capital plan on the basis of qualitative  reasons; such as, the reasonableness of the assumptions and analysis  underlying the plan. The bill would also cut the frequency of CCAR  tests in half, taking away tools and reducing the amount of information  available to the Federal Reserve about bank health and is a  fundamentally bad idea.   Really, it is basically what we have been saying. We have been saying  that this would reduce the stress tests from semiannually to an annual  test.   Why would you want to have less scrutiny of these banks? Why would  you want to reduce the amount of time that they would have relative to  being able to prove that they are safe?   Also, I think it is very important what is being said here about the  Fed and the Fed's ability to basically review, on the basis of  qualitative reasons, such as reasonableness and of assumptions and  analyses underlying the plan.   So they are looking to see if these banks are well capitalized, if  these banks can withstand, again, problems in our economy that would  arise that could create unemployment and all kinds of other adverse  conditions.   So I would ask the Members to oppose this bill. This is just another  deregulation bill for the biggest banks in America. We should not be  doing that because these are the banks that, if they are  undercapitalized, if they don't have what is needed to withstand  problems in our society that could arise in the economy, it could cause  us to go into another recession, even a depression perhaps.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I don't know what this overkill argument is all about.  This is about deregulation. The banks, these megabanks, don't need any  more deregulation or help from Congress. In 2016, the industry made  record-breaking profits, more than $170 billion in profits. The  Republicans gave the eight largest Wall Street banks a $15 billion  windfall from their tax scam bill. And CEOs are making more money on  Wall  [[Page H3116]]  Street, as much as they made in 2006, before they drove our economy  into a massive ditch.   Megabanks need reasonable but strong stress tests to keep our economy  safe. And I want to tell you, after Dodd-Frank reforms were put in  place--and the stress test was one of the things that had to be done-- the banks resisted it, but finally they came into compliance. And it  took them several years, and then they did it the way that Dodd-Frank  would have them do it. So there are no problems.   These stress tests now are stress tests that reveal exactly what is  going on in the bank. And so why are we trying to undo this? Why do you  want to see them once a year instead of twice a year? Twice a year has  proven that we can keep them straight, that we can make sure that they  are well capitalized, that we can make sure they have a good financial  plan.   So I would simply say, let's not get involved in more deregulation  and take us back to where we were when we got in trouble in 2008. I  would ask the Members to vote ``no'' on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to share with Members the opinions of  former Chair Janet Yellen, who has stated that stress testing improves  public understanding of risk at large banking firms, provides a  forward-looking examination of firms' potential losses, and has  contributed to significant improvement in risk management.   Former Chair Ben Bernanke has praised stress testing for playing a  crucial role in the recovery of the economy and creating a more  resilient postcrisis U.S. banking system.   The deceptively named Stress Test Improvement Act--that is, this  bill--severely weakens this key element of bank oversight and must be  rejected. We cannot ignore the analyses that are being given by these  former Fed Chairs. I mean, they are saying do not be tricked, do not be  fooled, that this is a deceptive bill, and that stress testing must  continue in order to ensure the stability of our banks in the event the  economy goes awry.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time  I have left.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to  focus on pushing through giveaways to Wall Street and megabanks like  Wells Fargo that could be harmful to consumers, investors, and our  Nation's economy. Week after week, Republicans advance legislation that  is basically reckless and misguided. H.R. 4293 is yet another bad bill  from the Republicans that weakens critical protections put in place by  Democrats to prevent another financial crisis.   As we have discussed, the bill undermines the stress test framework  for our Nation's largest banks. Stress tests are an important  regulatory tool that have much improved the safety of our financial  system.   Mr. Speaker, when we crafted Dodd-Frank, we mandated these stress  tests and put in place other enhanced prudential guardrails for large  banks to not only prevent damage to our economy, but also help grow our  economy, and they are working. H.R. 4293 weakens the rigor and  frequency of these stress tests, a move that simply makes no sense.   Rather than harmful measures such as this one, Congress should be  working to strengthen consumer protections, reform our broken system of  credit reporting, provide tailored, responsible relief for community  banks, and ensure that recidivist megabanks are held accountable for  breaking the law.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill, and I urge Members again to simply  ask the question: Why, at this point in time, would we want to  basically reduce the ability for us to know exactly what is going on in  those banks, whether or not they are fully capitalized, whether or not  they could withstand a serious problem in our economy?   I don't think that the opposite side of the aisle, my friends, could  really answer that question because this is simply a deregulatory bill  for the biggest banks in America, for the megabanks, not needed, and  certainly we need the information. We never want to go through a period  of time like we did in 2008 where we discovered that our banks were not  well capitalized and could not withstand the problems that we  encountered.   I simply ask all Members to oppose this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to  recommit at the desk.    In its current form, I am.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final  amendment to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to  committee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final  passage, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, we have talked at length about how H.R. 4293 is a bill  for Wall Street megabanks to line their pockets while reducing  safeguards that better protect the Main Street economy from another  financial crisis. While I deeply disagree with the bill's approach, I  offer this motion to recommit, not in a manner that sends the bill to  the committee and kills the bill, but rather to attempt to improve the  bill before the House votes on final passage of the measure.   We all know megabanks have been given a free ride in Washington for  far too long when it comes to repeated, egregious offenses. They just  get a fine--the equivalent of a slap on the wrist--for harming  consumers.   Since 2010, megabanks have racked up over $160 billion worth of  fines, yet they keep breaking the law.   We have talked about Wells Fargo's growing list of illegal actions  that have harmed millions of consumers. Sure they have been fined, but  these fines, even $1 billion in fines, are just the cost of doing  business for a company that made over $22 billion in profit in 2017.  This soft enforcement approach is just increasing their operational  risk and losses, which, at the end of the day, will impact not only all  of their consumers, but the broader economy as well.   I hope Republicans and Democrats can all agree that any megabank that  engages in a pattern or practice of unsafe or unsound banking practices  and other egregious violations that has resulted in profound consumer  harm in the last 10 years is not entitled to any benefit of regulatory  relief provided under this bill, especially regulatory relief that  would eliminate the type of oversight that makes sure our economy stays  safe. So my amendment would exclude a megabank like Wells Fargo that  has fraudulently opened millions of accounts without their customers'  consent, enrolled consumers in life insurance policies without their  consent, and forced nearly 1 million Americans to purchase auto  insurance they didn't need.   Since 2016, I have been calling for Wells Fargo to face real  penalties. I introduced H.R. 3937, the Megabank Accountability and  Consequences Act, to compel the Federal bank regulators to fully  utilize existing authorities to stop megabanks from repeatedly flouting  the law and harming millions of consumers. So I was glad to see Janet  Yellen, on her last day at the Fed, take bold action to cap the bank's  size until it cleans up its act.   We must do more to send a strong message to all megabanks that there  will be real consequences for their bad actions that mislead, abuse, or  deceive its customers. H.R. 4293, in its current form, would send the  opposite message to recidivist megabanks and undermine the hard work we  have done since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to adopt this motion to recommit so  that we do not reward a recidivist megabank like Wells Fargo for  repeated operational failures that ripped  [[Page H3119]]  off millions of consumers, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4061, the so-called  Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act.   The bill would recklessly complicate the process used by the  Financial Stability Oversight Council, also referred to as FSOC, to  designate nonbank firms for heightened oversight and protect the  economy.   The bill would also give companies more avenues to delay by at least  4 years or block these designations even when the designations are  warranted.   According to former Treasury Secretary Lew, who previously chaired  FSOC and strongly opposed this bill last Congress: ``An extensively  long 4-year process to designate large, complex firms that pose  significant risk to the financial system is not an improvement;  instead, it would effectively render meaningless one of the most  important tools we in future councils should have to address threats to  financial stability.''   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office confirmed this view,  finding that H.R. 4061 would increase the risk that undesignated  systemic nonbank firms will fail.   Let me be very clear: This bill is a thinly veiled attempt to hinder  and needlessly delay FSOC's existing ability to designate firms for  heightened oversight.   Americans for Financial Reform has also underscored that this bill  would: ``Provide giant, global financial firms numerous opportunities  to use insider lobbying and the courts to delay or prevent actions that  banking regulators are attempting to take to safeguard economic  stability.''   One of the reasons Congress created FSOC was to make sure that large,  interconnected firms like Bear Stearns, AIG, or Lehman Brothers would  never again devastate the stability of our financial system and  jeopardize our country's strong economy with their risky practices and  relentless demand for profits over safe and sound operations.   So I simply cannot support this bill, which would add hurdles to  prevent FSOC from fulfilling its vital role of identifying  interconnected, huge companies that warrant enhanced safeguards.   I also reject the myths Republicans continue to spread about the  Dodd-Frank Act in their effort to roll back so many of its critical  reforms. The majority has claimed that Dodd-Frank has caused tremendous  burden on the financial industry and resulted in lenders denying  affordable access to credit to consumers and families, but the numbers  tell the real story of the success of Dodd-Frank and the need to  maintain its regulatory regime, including the FSOC. Why? Because bank  profits and share prices have skyrocketed and are now far above pre- recession heights.   In addition, business lending has increased 80 percent and community  banks are doing well.   What is more, pay for bank executives is through the roof. CEO pay on  Wall Street is back up to levels we last saw in 2006. Even Wells  Fargo's CEO, yes, the recidivist megabank that has violated numerous  laws and harmed millions of consumers, was paid $17.5 million last  year. In fact, the CEO was paid 291 times the median salary for Wells  Fargo employees.   While Wall Street has fully recovered, Main Street has not. As Neel  Kashkari, a Republican former Treasury official who now serves as the  president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis argued in a  Washington Post op-ed on March 8, 2018: ``The Great Recession pushed  millions of Americans out of the labor force, some of whom still  haven't returned. Although the headline unemployment rate has fallen  from a peak of 10 percent during the recession to 4.1 percent this past  January, that statistic ignores people who have given up looking for  work. A different measure of people in their prime working years  suggests that more than 1 million Americans are still on the  sidelines.''   Keep in mind, these are warnings from a Republican official. In fact,  he goes on to say: ``Big banks still threaten our economy.''   So I will continue to oppose measures like H.R. 4061 that would  return our regulatory regime back to a system that encouraged  interconnected, huge firms to grow at all costs and that cheered as  these firms devised new and so-called innovative products, many of  which are only innovative in terms of how risky and unsound they were.   As so many have noted, if we undermine the ability of FSOC to stand  guard, as this bill would do, then we risk opening the door once again  to the wolves of Wall Street to wreak havoc with our economy again.   This bill, in effect, recreates the moral hazard in Wall Street's  corporate culture that promotes profits before consumers. This bill  would put the interests of corporate America before protections of  consumers, the interests of the public, and the stability of the U.S.  economy.   So, we must all remain vigilant against bills like this or we risk  another financial crisis. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to learn  from the mistakes of the past and oppose H.R. 4061.   Mr. Speaker, I am absolutely weary of coming to this floor with bills  that deregulate megabanks. I am absolutely tired of coming to this  floor having to remind my colleagues over and over again about the  crisis that we had to be presented with and had to work through in  2008.   I don't know why it is our Members find so much time to protect the  biggest banks in America, the richest banks in America, the CEOs who  are making millions of dollars, while, in fact, the consumers come  second or third in the work that they are doing.   This is simply about deregulation. This is about giving the banks  more power. This is about disregarding the fact that we have had to  fine them over and over again and they still find ways to defraud and  to cheat the consumers of America.   As the chairman just mentioned about the fines of Wells Fargo, well,  they are up for another fine of about a billion dollars because they  cheated their clients, they cheated their customers, they created  accounts in their names that they didn't know anything about, they  forced insurance on them that they didn't need, many of them already  had insurance, and it goes on and on and on.   I hope that we could convince our Members that we need to spend more  time on some of the issues that are really confronting America.   I am on this committee as the ranking member. We don't have any bills  or any sessions about homelessness. We are not talking about the people  who are on the street all over America. We are not talking about the  housing crisis where the average family even that is employed working  every day can't afford to buy a home, now can't even afford to lease a  place to live. It is off the scale.   I could go on and recount all of the things we should be addressing  just in our committee, not to talk about the other things and issues in  this Congress of the United States that we should be looking at, we  should be paying attention to.   We have had all of the gun issues, we have all the issues that are  going on now about Syria, and on and on and on, and yet we find the  time to come to this floor day in and day out, time and time again, to  talk about how we can make the biggest banks in America richer and more  profitable.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I would like to just walk through some of what happens with FSOC with  these nonbank designations and the process, because I have always  wanted to be sure that the process would give these nonbanks an  opportunity to basically convince FSOC that they were safe and they  were sound and they didn't present any risk, and all of that.   Of course, a lot of this was triggered by AIG. If you remember AIG  and what happened with this nonbank who was involved in credit default  swaps without the collateral to back them up, this certainly was  informative, and it helped to develop this process.   Stage 1, the metrics: minimum quantitative metrics for a nonbank  financial company to be eligible for designation.   Stage 2, preliminary review, 6 months: staff analyzes preliminary  data and meets with the company, consults with existing regulators.   Stage 3, in-depth review, 14 months: staff analyzes extensive data,  meets with company, consults with existing regulators, FSOC deputies  meet with company.   Proposed designation and hearing on the final designation, 4 months.  FSOC provides written basis of proposed designation, oral hearings,  provides lengthy written basis of final designation.   Total time from outset of analysis to final designation, 2 years.   Judicial and annual reviews: any designated company may challenge  FSOC's determination in court; every designated company is re-reviewed  by FSOC every year to consider de-designation.   I want you to know what is being proposed in this bill is quite  different and, instead of the 2 years that I have just walked through,  it would take approximately 4.3 years. At such time, you could have one  of these nonbanks in trouble, presenting great risk, and you would not  be able to do very much about it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to share with Members a statement from the  former Secretary of the Treasury who had the responsibility to head  FSOC, and that is Jacob J. Lew. He said, and I will read from his  communication to us:         Unfortunately, none of the legislation the committee plans       to consider this week--referring to this bill--would       strengthen the Council's ability to address the very real       risk the largest and most complex financial firms could pose.        Instead, these proposals would be a big step backwards for       regulatory tools to prevent the same kinds of threats. These       bills would severely undermine and impair the Council. One of       the proposals would require the Council to spend 4 years       analyzing a firm before taking action to address any risk the       firms may propose, doubling the time period for designation       review.    I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I do think that it is important that we share as much  information as we can about FSOC because not a lot is known by the  average person about FSOC, and when we talk about it, we oftentimes  fail to talk about who makes up FSOC.   We are talking about 10 voting members, headed by Treasury, the  Treasury Secretary. You have on FSOC all of the experts. You have the  Federal Reserve. You have the FDIC. You have the OCC. You have the  NCUA. You have the CFPB, the FHFA, the SEC, the CFTC, and an  independent insurance expert. So here you have convened on the FSOC all  of these experts, and they are looking at nonbanks that could present  great risk to our economy, like AIG.   I have to keep reminding people about AIG because AIG was this  nonbank that we bailed out to the tune of about $182 billion, $183  billion.                                time  1600    Don't forget, they were involved with credit default swaps that were  not  [[Page H3125]]  collateralized. They were basically putting insurance out there that,  when the time came due for them to have to pay off, they couldn't  because they didn't have the collateral to do that.   So with these experts, with the experiences that we have gone  through, FSOC makes a lot of sense. And when it is said that all they  can do is designate, that is extremely important because that gives the  companies an opportunity to go back and take a look at themselves and  see what they can do to reduce this risk to become more stable, and  this has happened already.   As a matter of fact, I think to designate a nonbank, FSOC must have a  vote of two-thirds of its members, including the Treasury Secretary. So  this is not easily done.   Again, designation gives the companies an opportunity to go back and  take a look. At least one of them has decided to downsize.   Let me just share this with you. First, FSOC is certainly not running  a Hotel California. A designated firm like GE Capital was able to make  the kind of risk-reducing structural reforms that led to their de- designation under the annual review process required by Dodd-Frank. So,  no, designated firms are not stuck with their designation forever.   Don't forget, they get reviewed every year. Don't forget, they can  make changes. Don't forget, they can take the advice. They can come in  and they can continue to work on putting themselves in order so that  they can get de-designated. And I think that is extremely important and  that should not get lost.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, a moment ago, I identified the 10 voting members that  serve on FSOC. I did not add to that the nonvoting members. To show you  the expertise that is involved with FSOC, they also have these  nonvoting members: Estate Insurance Regulator, Estate Bank Regulator,  State Securities Regulator, and the Federal Insurance Office.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   One of the wonderful things about working and living in a democracy  is that people have an opportunity to have opinions and to voice them  and to act out on them. And certainly we don't always agree on  everything. The Republicans don't always agree in their caucuses.  Sometimes they walk lockstep for all kinds of reasons, but they do  disagree sometimes when they feel it is safe to do so.   But Democrats do not always agree, and we disagree perhaps more in  our caucus than Republicans do, and we feel free to do that because we  understand the importance of the democracy and what it permits and  allows you to do.   So in saying that, we take every effort in my committee to make sure  that all of our members have the information that they need. My staff  is available to provide any assistance that we can provide. So we are  very pleased and proud that I, as the ranking member, operate the  committee in a way that respects all of its members.   And even those members who come to the floor who are opposed,  perhaps, to a bill or are supporting a bill that I and others may  oppose, I respect that. That is how democracy works.   So today, we do have Democratic members who are supporting this bill.  For whatever reasons, they believe that FSOC perhaps is too tough on  some of the companies, that somehow they really don't achieve their  mission of reducing risk. Whatever it is they believe, they certainly  have a right to do that. And I respect that.                                time  1615    Having said that, I believe that the lesson that we learn, as a  result of 2008 and the recession that we went through, and AIG, the  nonbank, in particular, that we bailed out when we saw the weakness of  AIG, and the fact that they had basically dealt with these credit  default swaps, and that it had created such a problem in our economy, I  am so pleased that we had the foresight and the wisdom to come up with  a way by which to identify this risk of the nonbanks so that they do  not create the kind of turbulence and problems that we had in 2008.   Having said that, I am very pleased about the wide breadth of  expertise that is on the FSOC. And I certainly believe that having gone  through the steps that they take, that those steps will allow everyone  to understand and see how fair they are, what kind of time it takes;  and it gives every opportunity to be de-designated from being  identified as a SIFI.   So I am very pleased and proud that I am able to say to my  colleagues--no matter how they vote--that I believe that the FSOC is an  important reform in the Dodd-Frank reforms. I would ask them to oppose  this bill, but if they do not support it, I respect that. I think we  should all remember that each and every one of us--elected by the  people who send us here--have a voice and we have a right to represent  our constituents in the best way that we see possible.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   In these debates, oftentimes we find ourselves explaining to people  how our committees work, and that is very good that we take the  opportunity to do that because I think that, in this complicated system  that we work in, people need to understand what we do and how we do it.   I am very appreciative to the chairman for recognizing and giving  time to some of our Members today, and I think he will remember that I  have done that for him also. I can recall on flood insurance, the  National Flood Insurance bill, I was very gracious and I gave Members  on the Republican side of the aisle an opportunity to have a say. And  not only that, Ex-Im Bank was another instance where I gave time to the  Members from the opposite side of the aisle, so I would not like people  who are listening to think that somehow this is unusual.   We do use the influence and power of our positions to determine when  that makes good sense for us, and I would like to say to the chairman  of our committee: There will be other times when I will afford  Republicans an opportunity to speak and have their say when you don't  feel that that is the proper thing for you to do at that time. So let  us all remember how this system works.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, week after week, the majority is continuing to push  through bills to roll back critical reforms that Democrats put in place  to protect consumers, investors, and our economy. Let's recount some of  the bills that the majority has recently pushed through the House:   In recent months, they have passed legislation to allow payday  lenders to evade State interest rate caps, decrease operational risk  capital requirements, and roll back enhanced prudential standards for  the Nation's largest banks; weaken customer protections for mortgages;  undermine efforts to combat discriminatory and predatory lending;  reduce consumer privacy protections; weaken rules that the financial  services industry finds inconvenient; undermine protections for mom- and-pop investors; and allow financial institutions to challenge rules,  financial regulations, in court, if they believe them not to be  uniquely tailored to their business needs.   Every week, the list of harmful legislation put forth by the majority  for House passage grows. H.R. 4061, the so-called Financial Stability  Oversight Council Improvement Act is the latest example of the  majority's misguided and reckless agenda.   H.R. 4061 helps financial institutions to delay or block heightened  oversight and weakens FSOC's ability to protect our economy. Mr.  Speaker, this bill ignores th lessons of the past and invites the  return to the risky financial system that led to the financial crisis.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my Members to oppose the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman  Maloney for helping to make sure that we come to the floor this evening  so that we can speak up for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening, along with my Democratic colleagues  on the Financial Services Committee, to discuss a central component of  the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   Mr. Speaker, I really want to thank my colleague, Mrs. Maloney, for  organizing this event with me tonight. Mrs. Maloney is a valuable  member of the Financial Services Committee and she is also a leader on  the Joint Economic Committee, she serves on the Oversight and  Government Reform Committee.   She is a very, very busy Member of this Congress, and I don't know  exactly how she finds time to do everything that she does, but I am so  grateful for the opportunity to serve with her, because of her  dedication and her commitment, not only to her constituents, but to the  citizens of this country, and particularly focused on consumer  protection.   The Consumer Bureau is vitally important in protecting American  consumers from unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices by financial  institutions all across the country.   Following the financial crisis, Congress created the Consumer Bureau  in order to ensure that Americans have a regulator solely focused on  ensuring that they are not preyed on by bad actors. The need for such  an agency was  [[Page H3143]]  made very clear by the 2008 crisis, which was driven by unchecked,  deceptive, predatory lending that caused millions of American families  to lose their homes.   The Consumer Bureau has been an enormous success, and under the  leadership of Richard Cordray, the agency worked exactly as we intended  it to. The Consumer Bureau has returned nearly $12 billion to over 30  million consumers who have been harmed by financial institutions. The  agency has also addressed more than 1.2 million consumer complaints  about financial institutions.   But now Donald Trump has moved to ``do a big number on Dodd-Frank''  and undermine the Consumer Bureau. Despite the fact that the Dodd-Frank  statute is very clear that the deputy director of the Consumer Bureau  shall serve as acting director in the absence or unavailability of the  director, President Trump illegally appointed his Office of Management  and Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney, to serve as acting director.  Because Mr. Mulvaney serves at the pleasure of the President as OMB  Director, President Trump now has an inappropriate level of influence  over the operations and activities of the Consumer Bureau, which is an  independent agency that is supposed to be outside of the authority of  the executive branch.   Since his illegal appointment, Mr. Mulvaney has indeed been carrying  out President Trump's harmful agenda and working to reverse much of the  important progress that the agency has made. This is not surprising  given that Mulvaney previously stated, ``I don't like the fact that the  CFPB exists,'' and even called the Consumer Bureau a sick, sad joke.   In his short time at the Consumer Bureau, Mr. Mulvaney has stripped  the Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity of its enforcement and  supervisory powers, in a move that badly weakens the agency's ability  to crack down on discriminatory lending. He has also taken zero public  enforcement actions against financial institutions that harm consumers  across the board during his tenure, even though his predecessor,  Richard Cordray, initiated hundreds.   In addition, Mr. Mulvaney has taken a series of actions that benefit  predatory payday lenders, including the decision to halt implementation  of the Consumer Bureau's sensible payday rule, the decision to withdraw  a lawsuit against a group of payday lenders that allegedly misled  consumers about the cost of loans, which had interest rates as high as  950 percent a year, and the decision to cease an investigation into  World Acceptance Corporation, a high-cost installment lender which was  reportedly engaging in abusive practices. And, in fact, the former CEO  of World Acceptance Corporation felt so comfortable with Mr. Mulvaney,  that she had the audacity to send to him a letter requesting that she  be appointed to run the whole agency as the director.   So many of us were shocked at the audacity that she exhibited, and  tried to find out from Mr. Mulvaney today, I did in particular, why did  he halt the lawsuit against her company and why would she send him her  resume to ask to be considered for the role of director of the Consumer  Bureau.   Mr. Mulvaney's many harmful actions send a signal to bad actors that  they can get away with abusing consumers.   What is more, Republicans have relentlessly attacked the Consumer  Bureau since its inception. Despite what my Republican colleagues may  have you believe, the leadership structure of the Consumer Bureau is  not unique. In fact, there are other Federal regulatory agencies with  similar structures, but these facts haven't stopped Republicans and  some in the industry from making legal challenges to its structure.  That is why last year, I led 40 other current and former Members of  Congress to file a brief with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in the  P.H.H. case support of the Consumer Bureau's independent structure and  its clear constitutionality. And earlier this year, the court issued a  decision upholding the constitutionality of the Consumer Bureau's  structure.   Republicans have been clamoring to weaken, impede, and ultimately  destroy the Consumer Bureau since its creation. First, they did  everything they could to block a director from being appointed in the  first place, and since then, they have pushed measures to defund and  dismantle the Consumer Bureau. The chairman has called for the Consumer  Bureau to be ``functionally terminated,'' and advanced legislation,  including H.R. 10, which I call the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act, to do so.   Now, in Mick Mulvaney, Republicans have an ally to destroy the  Consumer Bureau from within, but it is unclear why destroying the  Consumer Bureau is at the top of the Republican agenda.    There are constituents in every State who have been ripped off by  financial institutions. Why aren't Republicans fighting for them and  for their financial security?   Mr. Speaker, Democrats will not allow the Consumer Bureau to be  diverted from its statutorily mandated mission of protecting consumers  and serving as an independent watchdog.   This agency is crucial for hardworking Americans, and its work must  continue.   Mr. Speaker, in my closing, I would like to thank Congresswoman  Maloney for the way that she conducted her questions today with Mr.  Mulvaney in our committee and asked him how many cases had he taken up,  what had he initiated against those companies that are committing  fraud, only to find out that he has done nothing. She forced him to  answer, and he had to admit, zero, that he has not taken any actions  against any companies in this country who are involved in the kind of  actions that the Consumer Bureau is designed to deal with and to force  them to do the right thing.   So, Mr. Speaker, in that, I would like to thank Congresswoman Maloney  for initiating this action this evening that we are taking to make sure  everyone understands the importance of the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau, and I appreciate working with her to get this done.
