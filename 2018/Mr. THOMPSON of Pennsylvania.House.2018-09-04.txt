 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  American worker. Yesterday, our Nation observed Labor Day, which was  established in the late 19th century as a way to honor the workers who  contribute to the wealth and prosperity of this great Nation.   The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was one of the first eight States in  the Union to recognize the holiday in the late 1880s.   In 1894, President Grover Cleveland declared Labor Day a Federal  holiday. While many today consider Labor Day a time to celebrate the  end of summer and beginning of fall, it is more than just a three-day  weekend. Labor Day honors the American worker and the power of work. It  highlights that through hard work, risk, discipline, and opportunity,  we can all achieve the American Dream.   And more Americans will join the workforce thanks to my bill that was  signed into law this summer that increases funding for career and  technical education programs. This law will work to restore rungs on  the ladder of opportunity for every American regardless of age or  background, and that is something we can all celebrate.                            ____________________
