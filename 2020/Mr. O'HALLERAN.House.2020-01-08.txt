 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman, the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle), and Mr. Latta for the  opportunity. I also thank Congresswoman Spanberger for her great work  on this and the introduction of the bill.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Secure 5G and Beyond  Act.   This spring, I joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers to cosponsor  this important legislation to protect next generation  telecommunications systems and mobile infrastructure in the United  States.   According to a 2018 NATO report, Huawei, a Chinese multinational  technology company and supplier of 5G technology, could be exploited by  China to engage in espionage, monitor foreign corporations and  governments, and support Chinese military operations. In fact, earlier  this year, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph  Dunford, called the potential risks of a Chinese-built 5G network a  ``critical national security issue'' for the United States.   To combat these potential threats, our bill requires the  administration to develop an unclassified national strategy to protect  U.S. consumers and assist allies to maximize the security of their 5G  telecommunications systems.   The next generation of telecommunications systems is going to  revolutionize our economy, and it is important that every corner of our  country has access to the latest technology, especially the area I  represent, rural Arizona, and the rest of rural America. With the rapid  expansion of new technology infrastructure, it is critical that these  systems are secure and the privacy of all Americans is protected.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of H.R. 2881.
