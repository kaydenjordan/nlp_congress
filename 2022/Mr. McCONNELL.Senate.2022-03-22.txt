 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last week, the U.S. Congress lost a  one-of-a-kind colleague, and the State of Alaska lost an unbelievably  devoted champion.   Congressman Don Young, the dean of the House, was the longest serving  Republican in the history of that Chamber. He arrived in 1973, and his  fellow Alaskans rehired him to represent them every 2 years since.   Over the decades, Congressman Young's leadership and advocacy had a  literally transformative effect on his home State. He secured resources  for Alaska's infrastructure and its people. I understand his office  contains photographs of Don with no fewer than 10  [[Page S1275]]  different Presidents, each of whom had signed into law a bill that he  had written.   Don Young first moved to Alaska back in 1959, the same year it became  our 49th State. He once explained his rationale like this:         I can't stand the heat and I was working on a ranch and I       used to dream of some place cold and no snakes and no poison       oak.    Well, Alaska sure delivered for Don. And starting with a mayoral  election in 1964, he spent practically his entire adult life delivering  for Alaska in return.   Our late colleague across the Rotunda wasn't just a legendary  legislator and committee chairman; he was also a wildly unique  character. Even after decades in public service, he remained every bit  the former fisher, trapper, construction worker, gold miner, and  tugboat captain.   The Senate sends our prayers to Don's family, his staff, and his  colleagues, who miss him already.                               Border Security    Mr. President, on a completely different matter, in 2021, the Biden  administration's border crisis set a record. We saw the most arrests  that Customs and Border Protection ever reported in a single year on  the southern border. As the Washington Post put it at the time, illegal  border crossings ``skyrocketed in the months after President Biden took  office.''   Well, the humanitarian and security crisis has only gotten worse.  Last month was the busiest February for CBP migrant encounters in over  two decades, exceeding February 2021 by 64 percent, and intelligence  officials are reportedly ``bracing'' for an even steeper surge.   The left spent years calling on Washington Democrats to ``abolish  ICE.'' On the campaign trail, President Biden signaled support for  subsidizing healthcare for illegal immigrants.   Once in office, the administration spent months seemingly more  interested in policing government terminology than policing our actual  border. The Vice President, ostensibly tasked with leading the White  House border security efforts, seemed keen to travel anywhere but the  border.   When Democrats' approach left border facilities overwhelmed, the  administration diverted billions of dollars away from pandemic response  funds to cover for their crisis.   To prevent their border crisis from getting even worse, the  administration has leaned heavily on an emergency authority that was  originally invoked by the previous administration due to COVID. CBP has  now used temporary title 42 permission more than 1 million times to  avoid releasing migrants into the interior of the United States. You  might think the Biden administration would have used the time afforded  by this stopgap to actually hash out a strategy to secure the border,  but they have not. No solutions are in sight.   But now, unbelievably, the administration is reportedly on the cusp  of caving to woke pressure and lifting the title 42 authorities  altogether. This move would take our border from its current state of  chaos into a whole new level of utter--utter--meltdown.   Democrats say they are concerned about new COVID variants and may  want more COVID funding. Yet they want to declare the pandemic over and  finished at our southern border? But more broadly, why on Earth are  Democrats accepting the far-left premise that we should only enforce  immigration laws during a once-in-a-century pandemic?   Well, in the near term, it would be wildly reckless for Democrats to  simply stand down and let the flood gates open. Such a policy would be  terrific news for human traffickers and drug cartels. It would be  terrible news for the American people.                                  Inflation    Now, Mr. President, on one final matter, America's working families  continue to face strong headwinds as they try to make ends meet. The  historic inflation kicked off by runaway liberal spending last year is  still taking its toll, one paycheck at a time. For many Americans,  eating out once in a while was already a treat. Now, restaurant menu  prices are capping off the biggest 12-month price surge in more than 40  years, just as lunch counters are beginning to see more traffic from  workers returning to the office.   Meanwhile, just putting food on the table at home has become a  hardship. For one mother in Florida, a trip to the grocery store that  used to cost her about $150 now costs $250 for exactly the same amount  of food. She is reportedly ``cutting back on fresh produce and meat in  exchange for less-nutritious but cheaper items . . . as it becomes  harder to stretch her household's income and ensure that her family has  enough to eat.''   Of course, the price hikes consumers are seeing at the grocery store  are due in part to the soaring cost of fuel. The regular gas working  families use to fill up their cars was already nearly $2 a gallon since  President Biden took office.   But the diesel used in semitrucks and many commercial vehicles costs  $1 more than it did just last month--1 month ago. According to one  recent survey, more than half of small business owners say that the  rising cost of fuel is impacting their operations. ``It's keeping me  awake,'' reported the head of a small transportation fleet that serves  people with disabilities in Pennsylvania. For the manager of a lumber  dealership in Nevada, the free delivery his business took pride in  might have to be put literally on hold.   Unfortunately, Washington Democrats' response to these hardships has  been as misguided as the war on American energy and runaway spending  that helped create them. Several weeks ago, the Biden administration  entertained the idea of suspending the gas tax but only long enough to  give Democrats cover at the polls this coming November.   This week, we learned the White House considered sending out gas  cards through the IRS even as they keep up their war on domestic energy  production.   The Biden administration seems to be willing to try anything-- anything--but walking back their own disastrous economic policies. For  the sake of working families, I hope they snap out of it sometime soon.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
