 Madam Speaker, since St. Augustine, Florida, was  founded as the first permanent settlement in 1565, the Hispanic and  Latino communities have laid the foundations of the prosperous country  we are all proud to call home.   Last Friday, October 11, I had the privilege to honor several south  Florida leaders for their contributions.   Christina Campos is a Mexican-American mother of two who was raised  in Homestead and now serves as Homestead Senior High School's community  liaison.   Dr. Guilarte immigrated to the United States from Cuba when he was  10. He is a respected scientist and educator who became the dean of the  FIU College of Public Health.   The Mexican-American Council's Homestead Mariachi Conservatory was  recognized as Florida's premier mariachi music school for children.   Maria Nardi leads the Nation's third-largest accredited park system  in the country, providing welcoming environments for all families in  Florida.   On this final day of National Hispanic Heritage Month, let's remember  that for many Americans across all parts of our country, Hispanic  heritage is celebrated as something that we live every day.                            ____________________
