 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture  motion with respect to Calendar No. 836 be withdrawn and the Senate  proceed to the consideration of the nomination.   PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The cloture motion was withdrawn.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on the  nomination with no intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be made and laid upon the table; and that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.
