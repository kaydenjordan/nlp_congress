 Mr. Speaker, this censure measure is a sham.   When someone who is an American, a Muslim, a woman, and a Palestinian  dares to speak out for her people, she is told to be quiet. She is told  to stop talking about Palestinian brothers and sisters in the same  breath as Jewish brothers and sisters.   My sister Rashida is a child of the Midwest, representing the best of  Midwestern sensibilities. She also exemplifies a rich tradition of the  Islamic faith in the Midwest. She is a bold leader. She is a fair  leader. She is a compassionate leader. Most importantly, she is an  American.   Standing up for one oppressed people does not negate the oppression  of another.   We should be working together to end this terrible suffering,  eliminate these sham censures, and get back to the work of the people.  That is why they elected us.
