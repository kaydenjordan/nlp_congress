 Madam Speaker, today I rise to praise the House for  unanimously passing the Dignity in Aging Act. This act includes two  bipartisan bills that I led to respond to challenges facing a growing  aging American population: social isolation and younger onset  Alzheimer's.   As I heard from seniors and their families in my district at my  seniors workshop, we need to do more to support caregivers, improve  economic opportunities for older individuals, and ensure Americans can  age with dignity, security, and quality of life. This act does that.   This week Democrats and Republicans worked together in Washington to  pass the Dignity in Aging Act. That is a win for Congress, a win for  seniors, and a win for the American people.  [[Page H8708]]                                ____________________
