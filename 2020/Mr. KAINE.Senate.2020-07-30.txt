 Mr. President, communities of color and those living in  rural and underserved area face significant barriers to healthcare,  including physician shortages. Unfortunately, in many communities of  color and rural areas, there are few pathways to enter the medical  profession. Recent data shows that while medical school enrollment  [[Page S4637]]  is up by 30 percent, the number of students from rural areas entering  medical school declined by 28 percent between 2002 and 2017, with only  4.3 percent of all incoming medical students coming from rural areas in  2017. Similarly, Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Native American students  face several barriers to matriculate and graduate from medical school.  This exacerbates the barriers to care and the disparities in health  outcomes that these communities experience. It is critical that we  expand the diversity of our physician workforce to tackle the rampant  disparities and systemic biases within our healthcare system.   This is why I am introducing the Expanding Medical Education Act,  which aims to tackle the lack of representation of rural students,  underserved students, and students of color in the physician pipeline  by encouraging the recruitment, enrollment, and retention of students  from disadvantaged backgrounds. The bill would provide grants through  the Health Resources and Services Administration, HRSA to colleges and  universities to establish or expand allopathic or osteopathic medical  schools in underserved areas or at minority-serving institutions,  including historically Black colleges and universities, HBCU. These  grants can be used for planning and construction of a medical school in  an area in which no other school is based; hiring diverse faculty and  staff; recruitment, enrollment, and retention of students; and other  purposes to ensure increased representation of rural students,  underserved students, and students of color in our physician workforce.   Our rural communities and communities of color face significant  challenges in access to healthcare. It is time our physician workforce  reflected these communities. We need to diversify our physician  pipeline and change the disparity in representation, and this bill will  help get us there. I hope the Senate passes this legislation quickly to  expand the diversity of the medical profession and to take a step  towards improved access to care for our marginalized communities.                            ____________________
