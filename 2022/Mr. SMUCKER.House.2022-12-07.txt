 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Charles  Smithgall of Lancaster, who passed away in October at the age of 77.   Charlie, as he was known to so many, will be greatly missed. He was a  husband to Debbie, a father to Allison, a grandfather to two boys, and  a friend to all that he met.   Charlie graduated from J.P. McCaskey High School in 1963 and later  the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science, and then he spent the  rest of his life working to improve the lives of those in his hometown  of Lancaster as operator of his family's pharmacy, which continues to  operate on West Lemon Street.   Charlie also worked to improve the health of Lancaster city. He  served as mayor from 1998 to 2006 and worked tirelessly to revitalize  the city. Major developments such as the convention center there and  Clipper Magazine Stadium would not have been possible without his  leadership.   Charlie was also a devoted collector of military equipment, including  cannons. If you have watched historical movies such as ``Gettysburg''  or ``Lincoln,'' chances are that you have seen one of Charlie's cannons  on the big screen.   We will all miss Charlie. While we mourn the loss of our friend, we  offer our prayers of comfort to Debbie, Allison, and his entire family.                            ____________________
