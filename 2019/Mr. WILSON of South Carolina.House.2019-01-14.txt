 Madam Speaker, as co-chair of the  European Union Caucus, I appreciate the EU has imposed sanctions on  Iran for the first time in 3 years. Following the numerous plots  against Iranian opposition leaders in Europe, the EU added two Iranians  and a unit of the Iranian intelligence services to its terror list.   Iran has used its diplomatic facilities to plot attacks against its  critics for decades. France concluded that Iran was behind a planned  bombing attack on the Iranian opposition rally group in Paris last  year. Germany arrested and expelled a high-ranking diplomat suspected  of transporting explosives over the summer. The list of plots is  endless, threatening European families.   The new sanctions are a good start, but more can and must be done.  The EU should work hand-in-hand with America to hold Iran accountable  for its promotion of terrorism throughout the world.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
