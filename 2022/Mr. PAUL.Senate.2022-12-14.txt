 Reserving the right to object, we all agree that racial  discrimination is not only wrong but illegal. The Civil Rights Act of  1964 and other Federal statutes prohibit discrimination on the basis of  race, color, or national origin.   The Supreme Court found in the 1973 case McDonnell Douglas  Corporation v. Green that using a pretextual reason as cover for  discrimination is a violation of Federal civil rights law.  Subsequently, the protections sought by this bill are already provided  for in Federal law. Using hairstyle as a pretext for racial  discrimination is already illegal.   But there is reason to believe that this bill is not ready for  enactment. When the House Judiciary Committee considered this  legislation, some Members questioned whether this legislation would  prevent certain hairstyles and lengths out of concern that they may  hinder workplace safety or the ability to perform certain critical  functions of the job. For example, employers may require certain  hairstyles so that personal protective equipment properly protects the  wearer.   Many questions remain unanswered about whether this bill would  prevent employers from imposing race-neutral standards, such as  maintaining a hairstyle that makes it difficult to become caught in  machinery on a factory floor or the ability to properly wear a helmet  at a construction site.   This bill would make workers less safe, make it more difficult to  start a business and provide jobs, and almost certainly result in  expensive litigation and overburdened courts.   I object.
