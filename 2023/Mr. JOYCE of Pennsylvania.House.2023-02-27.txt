 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address a  crisis that President Biden refuses to acknowledge: the derailment of a  train in East Palestine, Ohio, that has left a community traumatized  and families afraid to drink the water that comes through their  faucets.   Instead of compassion, these families received nothing but a cold  shoulder from President Biden. Instead of certainty, these families  received a rushed process to test the water that they drink and the air  that they breathe.   What we need is a full accounting of events.   As a doctor, I urge the EPA to continue to repeat their tests and to  provide an accurate assessment of the risks posed to our communities'  air and drinking water.   An administration that fails to provide for the safety of its people  is a failed administration. I stand here to urge President Biden to  visit East Palestine and finally support those Americans who are  hurting.   We need transparency, we need accountability, and we need to address  this head-on; not with shrugs and handwringing, that is what we have  seen so far from President Biden.   We need to see compassion, we need to see thoroughness, and we need  to see diligence in addressing this problem.                              Origin of COVID 19     Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago, as a new and  dangerous virus caused by the Chinese Communist Party began to spread,  they shut down internal travel but allowed international flights to  continue.   The Chinese Communist Party was attempting to stop COVID-19 from  spreading within its own borders while allowing it to come to the  shores of America.   This weekend, the Department of Energy finally confirmed what we have  all along suspected: that this leak did not come from a wet market and  that it escaped from a lab in central China.   This virus and the related government policies led to vaccine  mandates, lost jobs, supply chain problems, and the isolation of our  Nation's young people.   It is time today to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable.  What we need now is to predict, prepare, and prevent another such  disaster from occurring.   The American people want and deserve answers, and they deserve  accountability for the hardships that this virus, unleashed by the  Chinese Communist Party, has caused. Now we need to ensure that a  crisis like this can never occur again.                            ____________________
