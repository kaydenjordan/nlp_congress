 Mr. Speaker, I draw attention to the human right to have  water to sustain ourselves.   Benjamin Franklin once said about this precious resource, water, that  ``When the well's dry, we know the worth of water.''   In the San Joaquin Valley, I can tell you we know the worth of water.  It is the lifeblood of our Valley communities and our agricultural  economy. We like to say, Where water flows, food grows.   The Valley is one of the most advanced agricultural regions in the  world. We produce over 250 crops that provide over 50 percent of the  United States' fruits and vegetables on America's dinner table every  night. The bounty of nature of food that we produce is coaxed out of  the ground by some of the hardest working people you will ever meet,  farmers and farmworkers, and it relies on a clean and reliable water  resource.   And America's food supply, make no mistake about it, is a national  security issue. I have spent decades working for commonsense short- and  long-term solutions to address California's broken water system. When I  served in the California legislature, I carried multiple bonds that  were passed that provided over $2 billion for crucial water projects.   While in Congress, I have advanced legislation that have improved  water supplies and funding for projects in many different ways: The  North Valley Regional Recycled Water Program, which helps irrigate over  44,000 acres in western Merced and Stanislaus Counties with local and  recycled water, and the San Luis-Delta Mendota Intertie project, which  brings up to over 35,000 acre-feet of water annually to most of our  rural Valley communities to advance efforts that are so important, that  make a difference.   In addition, that doesn't include the success of the WIIN Act,  bipartisan legislation which I helped lead through 4 years of tough  negotiations. It became law in 2016. The WIIN Act creates more  flexibility to move water based on real-time water realities and  provides authorization for $563 million in Federal funds for water  projects, like expanding Shasta Reservoir, like raising San Luis  Reservoir, and like creating Temperance Flat.   Just this month, legislation I introduced to allow local water  districts to improve the efficiency of dams passed the House. I call on  the Senate to move this bill to the President's desk.   In the Valley, this would allow the Merced Irrigation District to  advance a project to raise the spillway at New Exchequer Dam. This  would increase the supply of water, over 56,000 acre-feet of water-- much needed.   However, it seems like every time we are able increase our drought  resilience, State or Federal regulators decide that they need to take  more water from the Valley. It is wrong and it is unfair.   The most recent attempt to repurpose the Valley water supplies came  earlier this month by the California State Water Board. Staff released  the final draft of a plan that is simply unacceptable. And I must say,  it is pretty easy to reallocate water when it is not your water supply.  That is what the State board did.   The plan, if adopted, will effectively double the amount of water  that must  [[Page H6270]]  remain in the San Joaquin River tributaries. This will force thousands  of acres of farmland out of production, ravaging communities across the  Valley, and weakening America's food security and its supply.   The board staff claims these changes are necessary to prevent total  collapse of the fisheries in the Delta But this plan will not save  fish, sadly. It does not address the other problems that faces the  fisheries; namely, rising water temperatures, lack of food, habitat,  and increased predators, none of which have anything to do with the  water flows.    This plan is in direct conflict with another California law that  mandates we must use our groundwater more sustainably, which must be  done. We must come into balance. However, it is impossible to use  groundwater sustainably when we must pump groundwater to replace the  surplus water that is being taken away. These actions are in conflict.  It doesn't make any sense.   Our agricultural economy is showing tremendous innovation, growing  twice as much food on a fraction of the water that we used to receive.  But we have reached the tipping point--a point where the taking of the  resource outstrips our ability to innovate.   Without water, we cannot feed America or maintain our quality of  life, our sustenance. Our Valley and our Nation need long-term  solutions that provides for reliable sources of safe drinking water,  water for agricultural industries, as well as for our cities.   We, in the Valley, the San Joaquin Valley will continue to fight for  the water we need to grow America's food. Because, in the Valley, we  know the worth of water. We know it when the well runs dry, as Benjamin  Franklin said.   So, in conclusion, we must work together in California to fix our  broken water system for the long-term benefits of America's food  supply.                            ____________________
