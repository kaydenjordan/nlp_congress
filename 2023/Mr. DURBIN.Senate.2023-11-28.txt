 Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Judge Jeffrey Bryan to the U.S. District Court for the District of  Minnesota.   Judge Bryan received his B.A. from the University of Texas at Austin  and his J.D. from Yale Law School. After clerking for Judge Paul A.  Magnuson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota,  Judge Bryan worked in private practice at Robins Kaplan Miller & Ciresi  LLP on a range of complex civil matters and Federal white collar  criminal cases. Judge Bryan then went on to serve as a Federal  prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's  [[Page S5622]]  Office for the District of Minnesota for 6 years, where he handled more  than 1,000 hearings in Federal court. During his time as an assistant  U.S. attorney, he directed the largest cocaine and methamphetamine  investigations ever conducted in the district, recovering more than  9,600 grams of methamphetamine and securing the convictions of more  than 60 defendants. In 2013, Judge Bryan was appointed as a trial court  judge for the Second Judicial District of Minnesota, where he presided  over more than 8,000 cases and nearly 120 trials. In 2016, Judge Bryan  was appointed to the Minnesota Court of Appeals, where he has  participated in more than 500 decisions and has authored over 180  written opinions and orders.   The American Bar Association unanimously rated Judge Bryan ``well  qualified'' to serve on the district court, and he has the strong  support of Senators Klobuchar and Smith. With nearly two decades of  public service, as well as his extensive courtroom experience, Judge  Bryan is well-positioned to handle the demands of the District of  Minnesota from day one.   I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr.  Hickenlooper), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the Senator  from Georgia (Mr. Ossoff), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Warnock)  are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Margaret M. Garnett to the U.S. District Court for the Southern  District of New York.   Born in Brooklyn, NY, Ms. Garnett earned her B.A. from the University  of Notre Dame in 1992, her M.A. and M. Phil. from Yale University in  1995 and 1997, and her J.D. from Columbia Law School in 2000. Ms.  Garnett began her legal career working as an associate at Wachtell,  Lipton, Rosen & Katz from 2000 to 2004, where she focused on bankruptcy  litigation. She then clerked for the Honorable Gerald E. Lynch on the  U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York from 2004 to  2005. Following her clerkship, Ms. Garnett joined the U.S. Attorney's  Office for the Southern District of New York, where she would go on to  rise in the ranks throughout her 15-year tenure with the office.  Although she presently serves as special counsel, Ms. Garnet has also  served the Office as Deputy United States Attorney, Chief of Appeals,  Deputy Chief of Appeals, Chief of the Violent and Organized Crime  Units, Deputy Chief of the Violent Crimes Unit, and assistant United  States attorney. From 2017 to 2018, Ms. Garnett served in the Office of  the New York Attorney General, serving as the executive deputy attorney  general for criminal justice.   In 2018, Ms. Garnett was nominated by the mayor of New York City and  confirmed by the New York City Council to serve as the Commissioner of  the New York City Department of Investigation, an agency charged with  investigating individual and systemic corruption, waste, fraud, and  abuse in city government. A substantial majority of the American Bar  Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rated Ms.  Garnett as ``well qualified,'' and her nomination is strongly supported  by her home State Senators, Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Gillibrand.   With deep ties to the Southern District of New York and significant  experience working on criminal matters, Ms. Garnett will serve on the  bench with distinction. I am proud to support her nomination and urge  my colleagues to do the same.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr.  Hickenlooper), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the Senator  from Georgia (Mr. Ossoff), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Warnock)  are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr.  Hickenlooper), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the Senator  from Georgia (Mr. Ossoff), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Warnock)  are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr.  Hickenlooper), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the Senator  from Georgia (Mr. Ossoff), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Warnock)  are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as in legislation session, I ask unanimous  consent that the Committee on Finance be discharged and the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1250; that the Durbin  amendment, which is at the desk, be considered and agreed to; that the  bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and that  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table  with no intervening action or debate.    I think I would like to----    I thought that they told me the script was for some other  reason.   I ask consent to withdraw the request until--I made a misstatement,  and Senator Grassley and the Senator from Idaho would agree.    Thank you. I am new here. I am sorry I made that mistake.   Mr. President, for years, one of the greatest challenges facing  American families has been the rising cost of prescription drugs. A  recent AARP survey found that the price for the top 25 medications used  by seniors has tripled, on average, since those drugs came to market.  Those drugs include: Xarelto, Trulicity, Januvia, Jardiance, Humira,  and Eliquis.   Now, I imagine most Americans already recognize the names I have  read. They sound familiar because they are among the most heavily  advertised products and medications on television. You may even have  seen one of these ads during the Thanksgiving parade you and your  family watched or while you watched a football game this weekend.   Every year, Big Pharma spends more than $6 billion each year on ads.  That is the size of the entire budget of the Food and Drug  Administration. In fact, we know that most pharma companies spend more  on advertising than on drug research and development of new drugs.   It turns out, the United States is one of only two countries in the  world that allows people to run ads on television for prescription  drugs. Anybody want to guess the name of the other one? New Zealand.  That is the only other country that allows this to occur.   You want to know why pharmaceutical companies spend so much money  promoting their drugs? Because it increases their profits dramatically.  The average American sees an average of nine ads per day, nine. Pharma  thinks if they pummel you with enough ads that you will finally learn  how to pronounce and spell Xarelto. You will insist to your doctor that  this is the one blood thinner you really need. Sometimes it is easier  in a 10-minute meeting for a doctor to just write the prescription than  to take the time to explain why the drug may not be needed or a generic  version might be just as good for a lot less money.   With billions in targeted spending, patients are bombarded with  information but kept in the dark about one fact. Of all the things they  mumble and chatter about at the end of these ads, the one thing they  never want you to know is how much these drugs cost, the price.   This name is probably familiar to you if you watch television at all,  Rinvoq. With billions in targeted spending, patients are bombarded with  information like the name of this drug. Take Rinvoq--which is  manufactured by an Illinois-based company, AbbVie, for eczema and  arthritis--it is now the most advertised drug on TV.   AbbVie spent $315 million last year on TV ads for Rinvoq alone, but  nowhere in the ad did they tell you how much it would cost. Want to  guess what it costs for Rinvoq each and every month? The figure is  $6,100. Think about that for a moment.   Well, Senator Grassley and I think it is time for Big Pharma to end  the secrecy about the real cost of these drugs. If they are advertising  a drug, they should disclose the price upfront. It is a basic  transparency measure for patients.   We have introduced bipartisan legislation to require price disclosure  in direct-to-consumer drug ads. Our plan is very simple. It has  actually passed the Senate once before in 2018. In a minute, we are  going to ask consent to pass it again.   Here is why we think this transparency is so important. Earlier this  year, a study found that more than two-thirds of drugs advertised on TV  were considered ``low value.'' Those pricey wonder drugs with ads  showing people golfing and having fun, they are often no better than  the other, more affordable versions of the drugs. So don't you think it  is worth knowing right away that Rinvoq is going to cost you $6,100 per  month rather than waiting for that moment of truth at the pharmacy  counter?   One in five Americans do not take their medications as prescribed  because they cannot afford it. They cut their pills in half or skip  doses because they can't afford to take the medications as prescribed.  Don't take my word for it. These advertisements often urge you to ``ask  your doctor if it is right for you.'' So we did.   The American Medical Association said:         Direct-to-consumer advertising . . . inflates demand for       new and . . . expensive drugs, even when these drugs may not       be appropriate.    Think about that--inflating demand for new and expensive drugs, even  when they are not the best drug that the person should take.   In 2018, Senator Grassley and I asked the GAO to look at the impact  of these ads on television on Medicare's budget. The GAO found that  between 2016 and 2018, these drugs accounted for 58 percent of Medicare  spending on drugs. The drugs on television are more than half of the  budget of Medicare's spending on drugs. These ads ballooned Medicare  spending to $320 billion over 3 years. Humira topped the list with $500  million in advertising in 2018, which contributed to 2.4 billion in  Medicare costs.   Let me show you this Humira chart so you get an idea of what we are  talking about. I used this chart in 2017 when I first introduced this  legislation and when the monthly cost of Humira was a mere $3,743 a  month. Guess what has happened. The cost of Humira has now risen to  $6,900 per month. Shouldn't AbbVie, the pharmaceutical company that  makes Humira, disclose that real cost of the drug to you so you can use  the information in making treatment decisions?   Our bill is supported by AARP, which speaks for seniors across  America; the American Medical Association, which speaks for doctors  across America; the American Hospital Association and 88 percent of  Americans support the concept of this bill. How can anyone object to  it?   Hold on tight. You will find out.   In fact, President Trump supported it. After our bill passed the  Senate but  [[Page S5625]]  was stopped by a single House Republican, President Trump issued rules  to require these pricetags. Famous for his tweets, here is one that I  want to advertise. Look what he said:         Big announcement today. Drug companies have to come clean       about their prices in TV ads.    This is from former President Trump.         Historic transparency for American patients is here. If       drug companies are ashamed of those prices--lower them.    I didn't always agree with President Trump, but he was sure right on  in that statement. In fact, he supported our bill.   Unsurprisingly, Big Pharma went to the courts to stop this  legislation. They hate the idea of being open, honest, and transparent  with the American people about the price of their drugs because they  are afraid it is going to cut into their profits.   Senator Grassley has been a great partner, and I want to ask him why  he believes it is important to bring a dose of sunshine to these  airways.   Senator Grassley.    I want to thank Senator Grassley. He is a proud  Republican conservative. I am on the other side of the spectrum. I am a  Democrat, proud of my progressive background.   The two of us agree on this because it is common sense. If the drug  companies are going to spend a fortune, billions of dollars--more than  they spend on research for new drugs--advertising these drugs, we have  a right to ask: What does it cost? Is that such a tough question to  answer? Not if you are proud of your product. Not if you are proud of  the price you are charging.   But if you don't want the American public to know, you conceal the  price and you send Senators to the floor to object.   Now, both political parties spend an awful lot of money on political  opinion surveys: What are Americans thinking? Do you know what shows up  as a No. 1 concern year after year after year? The high cost of  prescription drugs. That isn't getting any better.   If you ask insurance companies: Why does the cost of health insurance  keep going up? The No. 1 driver: the high cost of prescription drugs.   If you ask: What are we going to do about Medicare's runaway costs?  You have to do something about the high cost of prescription drugs.   We are addressing that issue directly, but there are only four U.S.  Senators on the floor of this Senate for this occasion, because we are  not going to go to the measure and actually debate and consider it. It  is going to be pushed aside for a procedural reason, and it will go  back to an empty floor and an empty Chamber waiting for the next  rollcall on a nomination.   The American people have lost faith in this institution because we  are afraid to tackle the real issues they  [[Page S5626]]  care about. This is one of those issues. It is a bipartisan matter,  even approved by former President Trump, and I am sitting here talking  about it. It is an indication to me that this an idea whose time has  come.   So, Mr. President, now at the appropriate time, as in legislative  session, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Finance be  discharged and the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S.  1250; that the Durbin amendment, which is at the desk, be considered  and agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third  time and passed; and the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.    The Senator from Idaho is my friend. We have worked  together and served together, and I count him as my friend.   I would just say that arguing that the list price is deceptive  suggests that there is some third party, some Agency--perhaps in  Government--that is creating this list price which we are asking to be  on the ads that the pharmaceutical companies put on television.   Do you know who creates the list price, Mr. President? The  pharmaceutical companies themselves. We go directly to them. Give us  the list price. You saw what happens over the span of a few years: The  list price can double.   Who is creating that doubling in the price? The pharmaceutical  companies themselves. And, now, to argue that the price that they agree  on, that they advertise, is one that is somehow deceptive to consumers  just doesn't square.   Have you ever heard of AARP, the American Association of Retired  Persons? Most of us respect them because we have worked with them over  the years. They speak for seniors. They have endorsed this bill. They  don't think it is confusing or deceiving to tell consumers how much  these drugs actually cost.   Let's get down to reality. Whether it is from healthcare providers or  pharmaceutical companies, many times the starting price is not the end  price. But you never know where that is going to end up. It depends on  the insurance company, for example, as to how much they are going to  reimburse or whether there are any copays involved in it. So the one  price we can stick with is the price created by the pharmaceutical  companies themselves.    Is it so confusing to consumers that you can't state a number? They  get it. They know what the cost is. What they don't get and what they  may not understand is all of that mumbling that goes on at the end of  the ads: Don't take this drug if you are allergic to this drug.  Incidentally, this drug may kill you.   You listen to all that stuff, and you say: How in the world can they  jam in all of that information in just a few seconds?   Listing the price of a drug on TV is very simple, very straight, and  very honest and transparent. Pharmaceutical companies should want to  join in that effort.   I thank Senator Grassley for coming to the floor to join in this  effort today.  [[Page S5627]]    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business  with Senators be permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I have two requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                             committee on finance    The Committee on Finance is authorized to meet during the session of  the Senate on Tuesday, November 28, 2023, at 10 a.m., to conduct a  hearing on a nomination.                          committee on the judiciary    The Committee on the Judiciary is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Tuesday, November 28, 2023, at 10 a.m., to  conduct a hearing.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following Senate  resolutions: S. Res. 476, S. Res. 477, and S. Res. 478.   There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolutions en bloc.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions be agreed  to, the preambles be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until 10 a.m.  on Wednesday, November 29; that following the prayer and pledge, the  Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed  expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Smith nomination; further, that the cloture  motions filed during yesterday's session ripen at 11:30 a.m.; further,  that if cloture is invoked on the Smith nomination, all time be  considered expired at 2:30 p.m. and that if cloture is invoked on the  Semper nomination, all time be considered expired at 5:45 p.m.;  finally, that if any nominations are confirmed during Wednesday's  session, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 5:46 p.m., stands adjourned  until Wednesday, November 29, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
