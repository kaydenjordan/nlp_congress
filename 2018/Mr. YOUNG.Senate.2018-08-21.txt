 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak about Judge  Kavanaugh, President Trump's second nominee to serve on the Supreme  Court of the United States.   Judge Kavanaugh's qualifications are undeniable. He has proven over  the last 12 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit  that he is well qualified for this next step in his career.   I had the opportunity to sit down with Judge Kavanaugh in my office  just last month. He struck me as a man of great character and  integrity. He answered questions directly. He spoke forthrightly. He  demonstrated, at once, a strong intellect and a deep humility. He had a  wide-ranging conversation with me on issues that are important to the  people in my home State of Indiana, including his approach to  faithfully interpreting the Constitution of the United States.   As a D.C. Circuit judge, he has carried out his duties faithfully and  consistently. He has shown by the record that he understands that the  judge's role is to apply the law as it is written; it is not to impose  his own policy preferences. He is what you might call a textualist when  interpreting statutes, meaning he adheres strictly to the law as it is  written. He is an originalist as well, meaning he carefully reviews the  history of our Framers when interpreting the Constitution. This is an  approach he frequently lectures and writes about as a guest lecturer at  Harvard and other top law schools, including Notre Dame Law School back  home in Indiana where he gave a guest lecture on his jurisprudential  approach in February of 2017. It is also worth noting, it was Supreme  Court Justice Elena Kagan who hired Judge Kavanaugh to teach at Harvard  when she was the Harvard Law School dean. Justice Kagan clearly thought  highly of the Judge's reputation and credentials--so highly, in fact,  that she hired him to help shape the minds of Harvard Law School  students.    In his writing, Judge Kavanaugh reminds us that federalism and the  separation of powers ``are not mere matters of etiquette or  architecture, but are essential to protecting individual liberty.''   Judge Kavanaugh has also exhibited a willingness to rein in  administrative agencies when they exceed their authority under the law.  He has consistently held that international laws do not govern national  security matters if Congress has not adopted them as domestic law.   After carefully reviewing Judge Kavanaugh's record, I am confident he  will be faithful to the Constitution and preserve the integrity of the  Supreme Court.   I have to say, Judge Kavanaugh is more than just a highly respected  jurist. He is more than an eminently qualified legal scholar and a mind  that is well suited for the Supreme Court. He is also a father, a  husband, a coach to his two daughters' basketball team, and a man of  impeccable character.   Earlier this month, a group of more than 30 parents sent a letter to  the Senate Judiciary Committee praising Judge Kavanaugh's character.  The judge's two daughters are students at Blessed Sacrament School in  Washington, DC, and the judge is the girls' basketball coach. The  parents wrote: ``Brett Kavanaugh has been a devoted coach and mentor to  our daughters.''   They continued: ``In addition to his long list of professional and  academic accomplishments--we hope that the Committee will also consider  Brett Kavanaugh's contributions as a volunteer youth basketball coach-- and the service, selflessness, dedication, and commitment his coaching  exhibits.''   In 2 weeks, the Senate Judiciary Committee will begin its  confirmation hearing for Judge Kavanaugh. He is one of the most  qualified nominees to ever come before the U.S. Senate, and when all is  said and done, the Judiciary Committee will have reviewed more records  than ever before for a Supreme Court nominee.   The importance of protecting individual liberty cannot be overstated.  I am pleased we are considering the nomination of someone who, by word  and deed, has committed himself to preserving freedom.   I look forward to watching Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing,  and after conducting a thorough and objective review of his nomination,  I am confident Judge Kavanaugh will be an excellent addition to our  Nation's highest Court.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, August 13, 2018, marked the centennial of  women serving in the U.S. Marine Corps. I am proud that Indiana was  home to the first woman to serve in the Marine Corps, Opha May Johnson.   Mrs. Johnson was born in Kokomo, IN, on May 4, 1878. Before becoming  a marine at the age of 39, she graduated from Wood's Commercial  Business College and worked diligently for 14 years in the Interstate  Commerce Department.   Like many Americans during WWI, Mrs. Johnson heeded the Nation's call  and took the oath without hesitation on August 13, 1918. She was the  first of 300 women who worked at the Marine Corps headquarters in  Virginia. After 5 weeks in the service, she was promoted to the rank of  sergeant and remained on Active Duty until February 1919, 3 months  after the end of WWI. Mrs. Johnson remained in civil service until her  retirement in 1943.   Mrs. Johnson was the first of a group of trailblazing women in the  Marine Corps, and it is with overwhelming pride that I recognize her  service to this country. As a marine and Hoosier, I ask that you join  me today in honoring Opha May Johnson and all of the courageous marines  following in her footsteps.                            ____________________
