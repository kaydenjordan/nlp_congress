 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 78, the SEC  Regulatory Accountability Act, which would improve and strengthen the  SEC's rulemaking process by requiring more rigorous economic analysis.   What exactly does that mean?   Well, an economic analysis is quite simple, frankly. It is a systemic  approach to determine the optimum use of scarce resources involving  comparison of two or more alternatives to achieve a specific objective  under the given assumptions and constraints. That is a whole lot of  words and jumbo. But what we need to do is make a comparison, what is  going to be the benefit.   Economic analysis takes into account the opportunity costs of  resources employed and attempts to measure, in monetary terms, the  private and social costs and benefits of a project to a community, an  economy, or to an individual.   In its simplest terms, the SEC would have to determine the costs and  benefits of proposed regulations, as well as potential alternatives to  determine a best direction forward, basically ensuring that the SEC is  thoroughly assessing both the need for the regulation and adequately  evaluating the potential consequences, both intended and unintended,  and is there a benefit.   Mr. Chairman, requiring economic analysis by Federal regulators is  not a partisan issue. In fact, both President Clinton and President  Obama issued executive orders requiring regulators to ensure that their  rules were maximizing and achieving a net benefit.   H.R. 78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act, would ensure  consistent and effective application of the SEC's economic analysis  guidance by building on the bipartisan effort to strengthen economic  analysis requirements, as well as require a retrospective review of  existing regulations for independent agencies like the SEC.   Specifically, the bill would enhance the SEC's existing economic  analysis requirements by requiring the Commission to first clearly  identify the nature of the problem that would be addressed before  issuing a new regulation--too often, we are just shooting at a target  that we don't even know is actually a target--and to prohibit the SEC  from issuing a rule when it cannot make ``a reasoned determination that  the benefits of the intended regulation justify the costs of the  regulation.''   Additionally, H.R. 78 would require the SEC to assess the costs and  the benefits of available regulatory alternatives, including the  alternative of not issuing a regulation, and choose the approach that  would maximize the net benefit. The SEC must also evaluate whether a  proposed regulation is inconsistent or incompatible or duplicative of  other Federal regulations.   In testimony before the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and  Government Sponsored Enterprises last year, former SEC Commissioner Dan  Gallagher noted that the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act would  ``promote and improve economic analysis at the SEC and make the agency  even more accountable to the investing public.'' He further testified  that this bill ``will help ensure the economic analysis conducted by  economists is firmly entrenched in every rulemaking the SEC conducts  under the Federal securities laws.''    Mr. Chair, I commend the gentlewoman from Missouri  (Mrs. Wagner) for introducing this important piece of legislation,  which will equip the SEC with the necessary tools to ensure that all  future SEC regulations will meet these standards with the ultimate goal  of achieving the SEC's statutory mission of protecting investors and  facilitating capital formation.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  important bill.    Mr. Chairman, despite the personal attacks happening on  the floor here, I am glad to see that we are making real progress.  Apparently, we are making an impact here.   With that, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  King).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), the whip of our Financial Services Committee.    I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Chairman, at this time I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), the vice chairman of the  Capital Markets Subcommittee.                                time  1500     Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to what is the balance  of the time remaining on each side?    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Ross).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Royce), the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee.    I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to the balance of the  time remaining?    Mr. Chairman, at this time, I do not intend to yield to  the gentlewoman from New York, even though I struggle to understand how  the Export-Import Bank had anything to do with what we are talking  about here today.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Tipton), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Budd), a new member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I would just like to point out to those watching on TV the earlier  Democrat-sponsored hot air portion of the bill today.   You heard about the Export-Import Bank. You heard about Bernie  Madoff. You heard about the Dodd-Frank Act being the only answer to an  economic crisis that was caused by a housing crisis which, by the way,  the Dodd-Frank Act did nothing about. By the way, on the Bernie Madoff  situation, the SEC ignored a whistleblower for 10 years.   This bill has nothing to do with fraud, and it is not about a trial  of the effectiveness or lack thereof of the SEC today. This is about a  commonsense notion that we ought to actually identify the target that  these rules are trying to hit and then find out if it is the right  target and analyze that.   What you see on the other side of the aisle is the philosophy that  more is better: the more regulation that the SEC has, the more  paperwork, a bigger budget with more employees. We are not sure what  their effectiveness is, and we are not sure what exactly they are  trying to achieve here, but all we can tell you is that more is better.  Damn the costs; it doesn't matter.   That is, obviously, not the intent that we have on this side of the  aisle. We are trying to make sure that the  [[Page H437]]  proper protection of the investors is there. We are trying to make sure  that the three parts of the SEC's mandate, of which one of those is  capital formation and creating a robust atmosphere, are actually  happening.   I urge passage of the bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I feel compelled to point out to my  colleagues that we are not paid by the word that is put into the  Federal Register. I think, once again, you are hearing this example of  more is better. It doesn't matter what the words say, just let's have  more of them.   We already have the SEC Chairman and the Commissioners covered by  both governmentwide ethics laws and regulations as well as SEC  supplemental ethics regulations which apply to all SEC employees. For  example, they cannot participate personally and substantially in any  matter that would have direct or predictable effect on his or her  financial interests or imputed financial interests in the future, as  required under the code.   Also, unless they are specifically authorized by the SEC's ethics  counsel, they should recuse from any matter in which he or she has a  ``covered relationship.'' Well, what is a covered relationship? Well, a  covered relationship includes former employees, clients, and even a  spouse's employer. Further, the SEC employees must report their  financial holdings to the SEC's ethics counsel; and this requirement  goes beyond, frankly, the governmentwide reporting requirement.   Finally, the SEC Chairman or a Commissioner must not engage in any  other business, employment, or vocation while in office; nor may he or  she ever use the power of their office to influence their name to  promote the business interests of others, as required by law.   As such, I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I will wrap up here by simply saying that  the bill before us today is intending to clarify--or have the SEC, I  should say, clarify what the goal and objective is of their proposed  rule. Let's find out what they are trying to do, and then, more  importantly, find out if it is actually effective.   There might be a rule in place already somewhere else. The other side  is trying to strike that provision. They are trying to say: No. No. It  doesn't matter what the other hand of government is saying. We are  going to just add more and more regulation added on.   We need to have a clear understanding of what the objective is, what  the target is, and whether it is an effective rule to get to that  point. I just would encourage my colleagues to oppose the Waters-Green  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time  in opposition to this amendment, though I am not opposed.    Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to accept the amendment and  support its immediate passage. I want to thank the sponsor for working  with us to draft the language that is consistent with the SEC's  tripartite mission to: number one, protect investors; number two,  maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and, number three,  facilitate capital formation.   I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the  amendment and the underlying bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I just find it a bit ironic that the  other side is not interested in doing this cost-benefit analysis which  is in the underlying bill here because it is too burdensome. But what  do they want to do? They want to add more paperwork and more burden in  their amendments.   Despite what you have heard, the SEC is not a systemic risk  regulator; and even the former chairman of the Committee on Financial  Services, Barney Frank, noted at the time when the FSOC was reviewing  asset managers for systemic designations, he recognized that these are  not entities that pose a systemic risk to the financial system. And  while the SEC does not regulate systemic risk, I am afraid that this  amendment could be potentially politically misinterpreted and applied  to a number of capital market participants and activities which they,  frankly, have no business regulating. So it would lead to the same  fire, aim, ready kind of situation rulemaking that we have seen from  the current administration that hinders growth and that capital market  formation that we have just talked about in the last amendment.   The bill before us will ensure that future SEC rulemakings are  prudently proposed and adopted to achieve the maximum net benefit, and  that is what we are really talking about here today. While I support  the underlying bill, I will have to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1545     Will the gentleman yield?    This has nothing to do with Bernie Madoff since the  whistleblower approached the SEC and the SEC, using its dollars, was  not able to stop him.    I appreciate the gentleman yielding. Working together  on the Financial Services Committee, we know that there are actuarial  tables and analyze risk all the time. You are able to analyze fraud.    You are able to analyze that risk.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to the remaining balance  of the time.    At this point I am ready to close and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would just like to point out to all of  my colleagues and to the American people that currently the SEC is  under a court order to clarify how exactly they are doing their  rulemaking. And there is a staff-level rule letter.   With this underlying bill, we are trying to codify that. We are  trying to make sure, not just with a letter, but by law, that they do  what they are being ordered to do. And I will remind all of my  colleagues and those of you out watching us, the Securities and  Exchange Commission has a mission that has three parts.   The first part is to protect investors. Nothing in this bill weakens  there. Nothing in this bill takes anything away from that. We, in fact,  underscore that.   The second mission that it has is to maintain fair, orderly, and  efficient markets. Emphasis again, fair, orderly, and efficient  markets. What we are seeing is inefficiency that is being built into  the marketplace right now, and we are here to clarify that. Let's find  out, as the SEC is preparing a rule, what the goal and objective is and  what is going to be the impact on it. Yes, cost is part of that, and we  are able to look at that.   The third thing the SEC intended to do is to facilitate capital  formation.   Why is that important and what exactly does that mean?   It means making sure that there is enough money around so that  companies, big, medium, and small, are able to go in there and get the  cash and the credit that they need to go and expand and do the job that  they are trying to do, which is, by the way, employ all of us in  America.   We have talked a lot about the underlying bill and not so much about  the particular amendment that we have before us, but I do continue to  oppose the amendment and encourage the passage of the underlying bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, again, I think we are stumbling over the  fact that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle believe that we  are somehow paid by the words put into the Federal Registry here.   The SEC is already covered by both governmentwide ethics laws and  regulations as well as SEC supplemental ethics regulations which apply  to all SEC employees, including the Chair.   Perhaps the sponsor of the amendment is not aware that under existing  Federal law, the SEC Chairman cannot participate personally in any  matter that would have a direct and predictable effect on her financial  interests or imputed financial interest, and I would invite the sponsor  to review the code at this point.   Additionally, SEC supplemental regulations prohibit SEC employees,  including the Chair, from holding any security in a directly regulated  entity, and they must also preclear all purchases and sales of  securities.   Further, the Chairman or Commissioner must not engage in any other  business, employment, or vocation while in office, nor may she ever use  the power of her office or the influence of her name to promote the  business interests of others.   Finally, the amendment does not seem to address what I believe  Congressman DeSaulnier's description is intending to address as it is  the Federal Reserve, not the Securities and Exchange Commission, that  regulates the too-big-to-fail banks or, as the amendment states,  financial institutions.   The SEC does not regulate financial institutions. The code defines  the term ``financial institution,'' and the definition includes ``a  bank, a foreign bank, and a savings association.''   Since the SEC does not regulate any of these entities, the amendment  would require the SEC Chair to divest of exactly zero entities. So  notwithstanding that important discrepancy here, I ask my colleagues to  join me in opposing the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, at this time I am prepared to close, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would just point out again that this  [[Page H442]]  amendment does not hit the target. The SEC does not regulate financial  institutions. 15 U.S.C. 78c defines the term ``financial  institutions,'' and that definition includes a bank, a foreign bank,  and a savings association. The SEC does not regulate any of the  entities that are described in this.   In addition to that, the Securities and Exchange Commission's Chair-- Chairwoman in this instance, who will be resigning soon--is covered  under governmentwide ethics rules and laws. The SEC has additional SEC- specific rules that are in place. This amendment would do absolutely  nothing to support or diminish those because it doesn't actually  address any situation that they have.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I believe the sponsor of the amendment  was in the Chamber when we were discussing this on the last amendment.  Federal law, as well as SEC supplemental regulations, already govern  ethics and conflicts of interest.   It is well-known, especially if you check out my Twitter account, I  think, that most people who support this President don't believe I  support this President enough. A number of people would say that I  haven't supported the SEC Chairman to the level that I should. This,  frankly, is insulting to the current President as well as the Chair.  Implying somehow that this Chair has preyed off of poor people until  they went bankrupt, as was just sort of laid out by the sponsor of  this, is an insult.   To believe this of the SEC Chair, who is typically--and I know in  this particular case is--a very accomplished professional, is amazingly  shortsighted, I believe. Additionally, the Chair is required to receive  personal annual ethics training as well as an initial ethics briefing.  I direct the sponsor to review the statute on this.   Additionally, the Chairman and the Commissioners are required to file  an ethics agreement letter in which she will agree to divest prohibited  assets, and if she has not done so prior to the appointment, she is to  recuse herself from matters in which she has financial conflict or the  impartiality conflict, which can be found also in code.   Finally, the Chairman or a Commissioner is prohibited from engaging  in any other business, employment, or vocation while in office, or she  may never use the power of her office or her name to promote or  influence a business interest.   Once again, I think that what we are trying to do here with the  underlying bill is to make sure that the SEC follows through on what  the courts have mandated in previous rulings in that they use a cost- benefit analysis. This is not about fraud. This is not about whether  Mary Jo White needs ethics training. This is about making sure that the  SEC has an identifiable target and goal with the rules that it is  putting in place and then analyzing whether the costs and the benefits  weigh in favor of protecting the consumer. Ultimately, this amendment  does nothing to forward that. I oppose the amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I understand that the sponsor is a  constitutional law professor.   I direct the gentleman to 5 CFR 2638.305 and 5 CFR 2638.304, which  read:         The Chair of the SEC is required to receive in person       annual ethics training as well as an initial ethics briefing.       Additionally, Chairmen and Commissioners are required to file       ethics agreement letters in which they agree to divest.    The bottom line is that we don't need additional words in the Federal  Register to do what is already being done.   The sponsor of the amendment mentioned that cost-benefit analysis is  not in the U.S. Constitution, but neither is the SEC. However, due  process is in the Constitution, and what we are trying to get at is due  process to make sure that we have--us, as a legislative body--properly  involved and engaged in this and that we understand what the goals and  objectives of the Securities and Exchange Commission are when it is  issuing a rule and whether that rule is going to effect the change  intended.   What are those benefits? Is it going to benefit and protect the  consumer?   Again, I reiterate the three elements of the mission of the  Securities and Exchange Commission: number one, to protect investors;  number two, to maintain fair and orderly and efficient markets; and  number three, to facilitate capital formation. Those are the stated  goals and is the job of the Securities and Exchange Commission.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I maintain my opposition to this  amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Speaker, I have to commend my colleague. This is  close, but this isn't horseshoes. Words have meaning. And I have to  tell you that our underlying bill does actually do what you are talking  about.                                time  1700    I will direct you to page 4.   Page 4: ``evaluate whether, consistent with obtaining regulatory  objectives, the regulation is tailored to impose the least burden on  society, including market participants, individuals, businesses of  different sizes, and other entities, including State and local  government entities, taking into account, to the extent practicable,  the cumulative costs of regulations.''  [[Page H447]]    So, what we have here, Mr. Speaker, is a problem. We have a problem  with U.S. businesses not performing the way that they should. We have  to understand, though, why that is happening.   I have to point out to my colleague that, frankly, we have fewer  publicly traded companies in this country right now. You have to ask  yourself why.   We have virtually no IPOs happening in this country. You have to ask  yourself why.   Well, we know the answer. It is because we have overly burdened  ourselves in this country and are no longer competitive.   In fact, here is what I look forward to on January 21: I look forward  to repealing the Tax Code that we have, and then we don't have to  worry; I am looking forward to repealing ObamaCare, and then we don't  have to worry; I am looking forward to real regulatory reform, and then  we don't have to worry about that as a country.   So, while this may be close on the objective of what our sponsor is  trying to do, I would recommend voting against this motion to recommit  and vote for the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to support my friend Betsy DeVos,  President-elect Trump's nominee to serve as the next Secretary for the  Department of Education.   Betsy is a passionate and dedicated servant with a big heart for  kids. She is a grandmother of five who has made it her life's mission  to ensure that all children in America have access to a quality  education no matter what their ZIP Codes are. Betsy has fought for  children in classrooms to State capitals, and her efforts have given  more kids hope for a brighter future. In our shared home State of  Michigan, Betsy led the effort to pass the State's first charter school  law. According to Stanford University, Michigan's charter school  students now perform at a higher level than do their peers.   I witnessed Betsy's creativity and discipline firsthand when we  served together on the board of the Compass College of Cinematic Arts,  a Grand Rapids, Michigan-based film school and production company. We  implemented rigorous standards that set Compass up for accreditation,  and it now holds them accountable.  [[Page H453]]    I know that Betsy is up to the challenge of ensuring our children are  prepared to compete and thrive in our ever-changing world.                            ____________________
