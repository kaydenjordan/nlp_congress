 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in disbelief that this  Congress has shamefully allowed the Children's Health Insurance  Program, CHIP, to expire earlier this week. CHIP provides healthcare to  8.9 million low-income children in our country and to over 2 million  children in my home State of California.   My Republican colleagues have spent all their time and energy this  year fighting to repeal healthcare for millions of Americans covered by  the Affordable Care Act, and now they have failed to protect healthcare  for our country's children.   If we do not act quickly, it could soon lead to States not enrolling  children and potentially even denying them coverage altogether due to  the lack of funding.   It is critical that we fund the CHIP program without delay and  provide certainty to these families that they will not lose their  health coverage because of this irresponsible and derelict  congressional inaction.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to the fiscal  year 2018 Republican budget resolution, a budget that comes nearly 6  months late and days into the new fiscal year. This Republican budget  betrays millions of hardworking middle class families, while showering  billionaires with irresponsible tax cuts.   By cutting $211 billion over the next 10 years for student loans and  college aid, it makes it harder to send our kids to college. It  abandons our Nation's crumbling infrastructure by cutting $245 billion  over 10 years for transportation. It turns its back on families putting  food on the table with SNAP by cutting $150 billion from the program  over the next 10 years. It neglects our grandparents and our seniors  with a $487 billion cut to Medicare in the next decade, and it assumes  the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, leaving over 20 million  Americans uninsured.   I offered two amendments during the markup of this budget--one to  fully fund programs for our veterans, and another to reject paying for  a border wall--both of which were blocked by my Republican colleagues.   This budget boosts defense spending to $622 billion, $72 billion  above the budget cap for defense and well over even the President's  request, and it underfunds nondefense spending at $5 billion below the  cap.  [[Page H7781]]    At the same time, Republicans have included instructions to fast- track a tax proposal that would add trillions to our Nation's deficit-- trillions. It would end almost all itemized deductions, and according  to the Tax Policy Center, increase taxes for roughly one in four  taxpayers.    The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Chair, this budget completely ignores a balanced  approach to achieving fiscal sustainability and stacks the deck even  higher against middle class families, seniors, and students.   Mr. Chair, I reject today's Republican budget and ask my colleagues  to oppose it.
