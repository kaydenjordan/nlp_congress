 Mr. Speaker, the American people asked, and Democrats  are delivering.   I am proud to join my colleagues in moving this historic effort to  fight climate change, lower prescription drug prices, and reduce the  deficit.   Every district in our country has felt the pain of inaction on the  growing climate crisis, from forest fires in the West to unprecedented  flooding in the Midwest and Northeast.   My district is no exception. Just this week, I visited the Brandywine  River Museum of Art, home of Andrew Wyatt's masterpieces, which, 1 year  ago, experienced devastating damage when extreme weather caused the  nearby river to rise over 18 feet.   Yesterday, I toured the wetlands at John Heinz National Wildlife  Refuge to discuss measures to address the ever-more-frequent flooding  being experienced in the nearby Eastwick neighborhood.   From one end of my district to another, my constituents are seeing  the devastating impact of climate change every single day. Congress  must deliver results for these people: legislation that makes a  difference for hardworking Americans.   When my Republican colleagues were in the majority, they used their  control over this body to pass tax cuts for the wealthy and deny  healthcare to millions of Americans. But Democrats have proven over and  over they take seriously their job to deliver results for all of their  constituents, and that is why we are here today.   Through tax incentives, grants, and loans, the Inflation Reduction  Act will reduce CO2 emissions by 40 percent by 2030. This  legislation will invest in our energy sector to promote innovation and  renewable energy, and it will do this while supporting workers' unions  and creating more than 9 million new jobs over the next decade.   The bill will also ensure that vulnerable communities like Eastwick,  most likely to feel the impact of a climate crisis, will receive the  tools and attention they deserve.   Beyond addressing climate, the bill will radically lower the cost of  expensive prescription drugs, help 13 million Americans keep their  health insurance, and empower the IRS to go after wealthy corporations  and tax cheats. Notably, it will do all this while reducing the budget  deficit.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this legislation, and I urge all  of my colleagues to do the same.                                time  1000
