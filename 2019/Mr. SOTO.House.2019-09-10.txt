 Mr. Speaker, Florida hosted over 100 million tourists last  year. They came from every State in the Union and from around the  world. Many came to our world-class beaches. Florida's beaches are a  national treasure beyond just our district, but across our Nation.   We also have major Air Force exercises throughout the Gulf of Mexico.  For this reason, there is a Federal moratorium on oil drilling in the  Gulf. But in 2022, that moratorium is set to expire.   It is time to end this looming deadline and make the moratorium  permanent. That is why we have come together in a bipartisan fashion to  do just that.   This week, we will have a chance to protect Florida's wildlife and  sea life, to protect our military operations and readiness, and to  protect the national treasure of Florida's beaches for all Members of  Congress' constituents and for the world. I urge all my colleagues to  support this critical legislation.                            ____________________
