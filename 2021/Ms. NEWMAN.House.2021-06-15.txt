 Madam Speaker, today, I rise on behalf of the millions of  Americans with disabilities, the millions of Americans who live in a  major city with a major public transit system but are unable to utilize  it because it is not accessible to them.   If we want to build a world-class public transportation system in  America, it has to start by ensuring every station and every bus and  train across our Nation is equally accessible to everyone.   That is why I introduced the All Stations Accessibility Act, or ASAP  Act, of 2021, which would establish a Federal grant program to support  transit authorities to upgrade stations to meet or exceed ADA  accessibility standards.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to say that we have secured this grant  program in the INVEST in America Act. Now, I urge this body to pass  that legislation so that we can better ensure our public transit  services are for all riders, especially those with a disability.                            ____________________
