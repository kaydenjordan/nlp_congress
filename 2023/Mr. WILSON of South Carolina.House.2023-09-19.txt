 Mr. Speaker, sadly, the world is in a  conflict we did not choose, between dictators with rule of gun opposing  democracies with rule of law.   War criminal Putin began the current murderous conflict invading  Ukraine in February 2022, shocked to find that the Ukrainians  courageously resisted. President Donald Trump provided Javelin missiles  and tried to deter Putin with troops in Poland.   Today, the West is united, with Sweden and Finland joining NATO, as  the European Union surpasses American aid for Ukraine. Simultaneously,  the Chinese Communist Party denies Taiwan's existence and the regime in  Tehran continues nuclear missile development to achieve death to  Israel, death to America.   Fellow dictators clearly see the conflict as dictator or democracy as  North Korean Kim Jong-un joins Putin. Supporters of democracy must  remain united as there is no third side to achieve peace through  strength. The choice is clear: Dictators or democracy.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues, moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with Biden's open borders.                            ____________________
