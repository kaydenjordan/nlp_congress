 I object.    Mr. President, will the Senator from Illinois yield for an  inquiry?    Mr. President, isn't it a fact, when the Senator was up  here talking and demanding that we pass that bill, that the bill wasn't  here? I have spent 40 years in the Senate, and I have never been able  to convince a Parliamentarian that we should vote on a House bill that  wasn't here. It wasn't here. The Republicans aren't in charge of the  House; it is the Democrats. Nancy Pelosi is in charge of the House.    Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry.
