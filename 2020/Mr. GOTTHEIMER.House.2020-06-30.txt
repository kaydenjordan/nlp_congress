 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment  to the Moving America Forward Act.   The train tunnel underneath the Hudson carries 200,000 people daily  between New Jersey and New York. It is literally crumbling after damage  from a century of use and flooding during Superstorm Sandy. It is in  imminent danger of being shut down. They are literally patching up  cracks. It is outrageous. Part-time fixes aren't enough. It is time we  actually do something about it.   Building the Gateway Tunnel is the most pressing infrastructure need  in our country. It is crucial to our economy. This tunnel connects 20  percent of America's GDP. If we don't fix it, it will literally be a  doomsday.   The Department of Transportation must explain why they have  downgraded this project to low priority.   What is their secret backup plan when we have to shut down the  tunnel?   What are we going to do for the economy?   We deserve to know. My amendment requires the DOT to develop and  publish their contingency plan within 60 days. We want to know their  doomsday plan because we have the right to know how they will address  this urgent crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes''.   I thank Chairman DeFazio. It is time we fix this doomsday before it  occurs.                                time  1700
