 Mr. Speaker, I know a steel company in western Pennsylvania  that makes compressors and turbines. They compete against General  Electric, but they have found a way to survive as a hometown company  that pays a union wage. Yet we tax this company. We tax them with our  poor infrastructure. They ship their goods out of the Port of  Philadelphia which should only be a 300-mile drive from their location,  but it is a 900-mile trip for their trucks to find roads and bridges  that can withstand the weight of their loads.   So this company that builds American, that hires American, and that  has stayed with us when so many have left pays three times what they  should just to get their goods to market.   For how long?   How long until GE simply outlasts them?   Or how long until they have to cut jobs because they simply cannot  cut these trucking costs?   So we can pay now by saving these jobs and create new ones building  things, or we can pay later with more unemployment and the damage done  by bad roads. That is the choice we are presenting with today's bill.   Does it cost money?   Yes. It is money that will go into the hands of people with  jackhammers, shovels, and trucks. That is money well spent. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill.
