 Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose S. 114.   A strong and sustainable Veterans Health Administration is critical  to providing America's veterans with the care they deserve. By funding  the Choice exception without investing in the VA itself, this  legislation explicitly prioritizes the private sector at the VA's  expense. This is not an acceptable way forward.   Care in the community has always been and will always be important in  ensuring veterans have access to care, the care that they have earned,  but it would be a profound mistake to funnel billions of dollars into  private care while neglecting the VA and the millions of veterans it  serves every year, and that is exactly what this bill does.   Veterans service organizations are speaking out, because they know  what is at stake. They understand the bigger policy implications of  today's vote.   This legislation is a referendum on the mistaken belief that the  private sector is better equipped to care for our Nation's veterans  than specialized VA doctors.   I have a statement from eight VSOs that echo these concerns, and I  include it in the Record.   Leading Veterans Organizations Call on Members of Congress To Defeat                  Unacceptable Choice Funding Legislation       Urge House to Work with Senate to Reach a Bipartisan, Bicameral                                 Agreement   (Joint Statement from AMVETS, DAV (Disabled American Veterans), Iraq      and Afghanistan Veterans Association (IAVA), Military Officers     Association of America (MOAA), Military Order of the Purple Heart    (MOPH), Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), Vietnam Veterans of America                 (VVA), and Wounded Warrior Project (WWP))         As organizations who represent and support the interests of       America's 21 million veterans, and in fulfillment of our       mandate to ensure that the men and women who served are able       to receive the health care and benefits they need and       deserve, we are calling on Members of Congress to defeat the       House vote on unacceptable choice funding legislation (S.       114, with amendments) scheduled for Monday, July 24, and       instead work with the Senate to reach a bipartisan, bicameral       agreement.        As we have repeatedly told House leaders in person this       week, and in a jointly-signed letter on June 28, we oppose       legislation that includes funding only for the ``choice''       program which provides additional community care options, but       makes no investment in VA and uses ``savings'' from other       veterans benefits or services to ``pay'' for the ``choice''       program.        Veterans health care benefits have already been ``paid       for'' through the service and sacrifice of the men and women       who wore our nation's uniform, millions of whom suffered       injuries, illnesses and lifelong disabilities.        In order to ensure that veterans can receive necessary care       without interruption, we call on House leaders to take the       time necessary to work together with Senate leaders to       develop acceptable ``choice'' funding legislation that not       only fills the current funding gap, but also addresses urgent       VA infrastructure and resource needs that led to creation of       the ``choice'' program in the first place.        All of our organizations are committed to building a future       veterans health care system that modernizes VA and integrates       community care whenever needed so that enrolled veterans have       seamless access to timely, quality care. However, if new       funding is directed only or primarily to private sector       ``choice'' care without any adequate investment to modernize       VA, the viability of the entire system will soon be in       danger.        We call on leaders in both the House and Senate to work       together in good faith, and we remain committed to supporting       such efforts, in order to quickly reach an agreement that       ensures veterans health care is not interrupted in the short       term, nor threatened in the long term.     The organizations signing the statement are AMVETS; the  Disabled American Veterans; Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans Association,  IAVA; Military Officers Association of America, MOAA; Military Order of  the Purple Heart; Veterans of Foreign Wars; Vietnam Veterans of  America; and Wounded Warrior Project.   I would like to quote from a few of the paragraphs:   ``In order to ensure that veterans can receive necessary care without  interruption, we call on House leaders to take the time necessary to  work together with Senate leaders to develop acceptable Choice funding  legislation that not only fills the current funding gap, but also  addresses urgent VA infrastructure and resource needs that led to  creation of the Choice Program in the first place.   ``All of our organizations are committed to building a future  veterans healthcare system that modernizes VA and integrates community  care whenever needed so that enrolled veterans have seamless access to  timely, quality care. However, if new funding is directed only or  primarily to private sector Choice care without any adequate investment  to modernize VA, the viability of the entire system will soon be in  danger.''   I also have letters opposing S. 114 from the Paralyzed Veterans of  America and the VFW. I include these letters in opposition in the  Record.         Washington, July 22, 2017.--Paralyzed Veterans of America       (Paralyzed Veterans) today weighed in on options being       considered to fund the veteran ``choice'' program, as the       House of Representatives considers a vote on a draft bill, S.       114 as amended, on Monday, July 24. Priorities for the       organization include open discussion on the best way to build       up specialized veteran-centric services offered by the       Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), while expanding access       to non-specialized healthcare for veterans without cutting       critical non-healthcare VA benefits.        ``The notion of streamlining VA is a necessary discussion       that must continue. The devil is in the details, though,''       said Sherman Gillums Jr., executive director of Paralyzed       Veterans of America. ``We do support the responsible `right       sizing' of VA, starting with the elimination of redundancies       and ultimately using cost savings to increase reinvestment in       VA's foundational services, such as spinal cord injury care.       Offsets, at least in part, may be necessary in order to       achieve that.''        Offsets, or program and benefit trade-offs used for       budgeting purposes, are not new to VA. Past offsets include       fees and collections related to housing loans and extensions       in the reduction of certain pensions used to pay for other       benefits. However, this is the first time Congress is       requiring VA to include deficit reduction as a component of       the agency's plan to maintain and expand the VA Choice       Program. Moreover, some veteran advocates have expressed       staunch opposition to offsets because they require VA to       employ a ``rob Peter to pay Paul'' approach to funding       programs.        ``Paralyzed Veterans' main concern is that using these       offsets to pay for VA healthcare comes at the expense of       expanding non-healthcare benefits, such as disability       compensation,'' explained Gillums. ``However, we are not       prepared to simply oppose offsets because we believe VA is       open to strengthening healthcare for our most       catastrophically disabled veterans, which matters above all       else. Paralyzed Veterans leads as an expert voice on the most       complex healthcare challenges these veterans face, and we       intend to use that voice to promote new ideas and progress.''        ``The bottom line is the discussion must continue with open       minds on all sides,'' concluded Gillums.                           About Paralyzed Veterans         Paralyzed Veterans of America is the only congressionally       chartered veterans service organization dedicated solely for       the benefit and representation of veterans with spinal cord       injury or disease. For 70 years, we have ensured that       veterans have received the benefits earned through their       service to our nation; monitored their care in VA spinal cord       injury units; and funded research and education in the search       for a cure and improved care for individuals with paralysis.        As a partner for life, Paralyzed Veterans also develops       training and career services, works to ensure accessibility       in public buildings and spaces, provides health and       rehabilitation opportunities through sports and recreation       and advocates for veterans and all people with disabilities.       With more than 70 offices and 33 chapters, Paralyzed Veterans       serves veterans, their families and their caregivers in all       50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico       (pva.org).

Sent: Monday, July 24, 2017.      Subject: VFW Urges Opposition to S. 114.        On behalf of the nearly 1.7 million members of the Veterans       of Foreign Wars of the United States and its Auxiliary, we       urge all members of Congress to vote NO on S. 114, which       would gradually privatize the VA health care system.        At the VFW's 118th National Convention, VFW National       Commander Brian Duffy asked our members what they thought of       this bill.            Respectfully,                                                 Carlos Fuentes,                             Director, National Legislative Service,                           The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S.     Madam Speaker, after more than 2 years and more than $10  billion, the VA Choice Program has failed to deliver on its promise of  shorter wait times for veterans.   It is time for us to recognize that private care is not the panacea  for the complex challenge of caring for our Nation's veterans and that  the VA's role must remain foundational to veterans' care. This bill  does not reflect that reality.   I urge my colleagues to reject this legislation while we continue to  work toward a bipartisan, bicameral solution.    Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3218,  which secures and strengthens the GI Bill for future generations of  veterans. It does so without cutting benefits from anyone who is  currently serving.   There are several provisions in this legislation worth celebrating.  Removing time restrictions for future student veterans and making this  a lifetime benefit, and increasing support for reservists, guardsmen,  and their families are among the long overdue improvements to the GI  Bill that are included in this legislation.   But the restoration of GI Bill benefits for students defrauded by ITT  Tech and Corinthian Colleges is particularly noteworthy for veterans in  my district and across the country. When those two schools abruptly  shut their doors, thousands of student veterans were left with  nontransferable credits, depleted  [[Page H6168]]  benefits, and none of the job opportunities they were promised. By  restoring their tuition and housing benefits, we are restoring a  measure of justice for these veterans, and we are restoring their  opportunity to get the education they deserve.   I hope this is just the start of our efforts to crack down on for- profit colleges that exploit veterans.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz for their  leadership, as well as the other members of the committee and the  veterans service organizations who contributed to the strength of this  legislation.   Madam Speaker, passing H.R. 3218 is an important step toward ensuring  that every person who serves this Nation has the opportunity to live a  rewarding and purposeful and prosperous civilian life. I encourage all  Members to support this bill.   Madam Speaker, before closing, let me just add my praise to the  chairman for his generosity and humbleness. I recognize, too, that this  bill does not bear his name but the name of a predecessor. That was an  incredible gesture, Madam Speaker. I salute the chairman's leadership.   Mr. ROE from Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Coffman), my good friend, a Marine and  Army veteran, and senior member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.
