 Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate participating in  this Special Order hour about things that, I think, the American people  really ought to be caring about.   The minute that Donald Trump took the oath of office and put his hand  in the air, he was in violation of the law. It is just a fact that the  Trump Hotel, which is in the old post office building--there is a very  explicit contract that says no elected official may enter into a  contract for that hotel and profit from the business in that hotel.  There was a lawsuit that was filed. It is still pending.   You may not think that is a really big deal, but how about this: What  if there were delegations from somewhere else in the world, some  country that really wanted to curry favor with the United States of  America, and decided a really good way to do it would be to move our  delegation to stay at the Trump Hotel?                                time  1715    Maybe we could have a big gala, we could have a party, and we could  make a lot of money from that. And guess what. Maybe the President of  the United States would notice that we are spending money in a hotel  from which he gains a profit, and that would be a really swell idea.   Well, actually, the Framers of the Constitution thought that was not  such a grand idea and very explicitly put into the Constitution  something that would prohibit any foreign government from influencing  U.S. policy. They were worried about the King of England. They were  worried about France. They were worried about other countries having  too much influence on the United States by currying favor with the  President and the decisionmakers, and so they introduced and put into  the Constitution very explicitly what they called the Emoluments Clause  in Article I, section 9 of the Constitution.   While ``emoluments'' is certainly not a word we use in regular  conversations--emoluments, I never used it before this and never heard  of it before this, actually--it is a concept that is part of our  Constitution, and it is very simple: that no government official should  receive benefits of any kind--of any kind--from a foreign government.  President Trump is clearly violating that constitutional principle.   So, unlike any Presidents before him, President Trump has actually  refused to fully separate himself and his family from his business  dealings. It is also very unusual, of course, that we haven't seen his  tax returns, which has been pretty standard for any President to  release his tax returns, and it has been a requirement for the Cabinet  that Mr. Trump has exacted from those nominees.   Because of his business holdings, Trump and his family are  constantly--constantly--receiving benefits from other countries,  whether it is foreign governments renting that space at the Trump Hotel  in D.C. or the loans and business agreements that the Trump  organization has with China, Russia, and many other countries. We don't  know them all. We haven't seen them all. That would be in his tax  returns and all the different sections of the tax return, his holdings  in Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, which he has refused to put into a blind  trust.   So it is troubling enough that President Trump and his family are  profiting off the Presidency, but now it is becoming clearer that this  lack of ethics could threaten our national security and national  interests. So if you haven't cared until now, you ought to start  caring.   Look at Russia. Trump has done business in Russia and has remained  uncomfortably close to Vladimir Putin. He refuses to release his tax  returns, which could clarify the specific financial interests that he  has in Russia.   President Trump knew his National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn,  was compromised by Russian intelligence and had misled Vice President  Pence; yet Flynn was allowed to remain in one of our most sensitive  national security positions until criticism from Congress, the media,  and the public became too much to ignore.   President Trump continues to gloss over the serious problems that led  to Flynn's resignation. Instead, he attacks the messenger and the leaks  that brought Flynn's conduct to light. These are bright red flags.  These are signs that the President has something to hide.   Americans deserve a President who they can trust is putting the  country's interests ahead of his own, that he is putting the country's  interests instead of another country's interests because that deal  might be in his interest.   There should be no question over the purity of the President's  motives, especially when he is making critical security decisions on  behalf of the Nation. If President Trump wants to assure the American  people that he deserves our  [[Page H1292]]  trust, he must be transparent. We need a bipartisan, independent  investigation of his conflicts of interest, particularly with Russia,  but not exclusively. He must release his tax returns, and he must fully  separate himself from his business dealings.   The corrupt practices of this administration must stop. Our country  and our Constitution demand nothing less.
