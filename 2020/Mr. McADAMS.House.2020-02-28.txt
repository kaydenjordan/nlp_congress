 Madam Speaker, Erma Helen Rosenhan turns 105 years old  today. Erma was born at home in 1915, in Salt Lake City, the seventh of  nine children born to German immigrant parents.   During Erma's lifetime, she has witnessed such developments as  electricity, radio, television, telephones, computers, cellphones,  automobiles, and airplanes.   These are all things that she did without for much of her young life,  and she has said that she was better off without them. Erma loves  simplicity.   Most of Erma's life has been dedicated to genealogy research of her  German ancestors. She has researched over 450,000 family names, going  back to the year 1150 AD.   Erma has also lived a very simple life, living very modestly and  saving her money. She once debated whether or not to extend her grocery  list to include a loaf of banana bread. After a minute of thought, she  said: ``Oh, what the heck. I feel reckless today.''   Because of her frugality, Erma has been able to donate tens of  thousands of dollars to humanitarian needs over the many years she has  been living.   At 105, Erma says: ``One person can make a difference, no matter how  old they are, so don't ever give up. I tell the Lord, I know I am old,  but I will do what You would have me do if You will help me, and He  always does.''   Erma's faith has influenced many, and she is not afraid to tell  people when they ought to shape up. Erma's 105 years has been  exemplary, a life full of selflessness and sacrifice.   From the United States Capitol, happy 105th birthday to Erma Helen  Rosenhan.                            ____________________
