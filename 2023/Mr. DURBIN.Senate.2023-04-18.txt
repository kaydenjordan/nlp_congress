 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak and  complete my remarks before the rollcall starts.    Mr. President, the highest Court in America should not  have the lowest standards when it comes to ethics, but for too long  that has been the case for the U.S. Supreme Court. It definitely needs  to change.   While the Senate was out of session for the Easter recess, the  independent nonprofit news organization ProPublica published a series  of stunning reports.   They found that a billionaire real estate developer and prominent  Republican donor, Harlan Crow, has given Supreme Court Justice Clarence  Thomas nearly 20 years of undisclosed luxury gifts and getaways: a  lavish yacht vacation in Indonesia, private plane trips, visits to a  deluxe mountainside resort, and more.   Then, just days ago, ProPublica found that in 2014, Crow's company  bought properties owned by Thomas and his family, including the house  where the Justice's mother still lives. These transactions were also  hidden, undisclosed, even though Federal law clearly requires that they  be reported publicly.   Let's be clear. Serving as a Federal judge, and especially a Supreme  Court Justice, is one of the highest honors in the Nation that we can  confer on an individual. But above all, it is a public service. Judges  and Justices are entrusted by the American people to serve the public  interest and administer equal justice under the law. That is why  taxpayers and not billionaire donors fund judicial salaries,  courthouses, and operations. Judges have a responsibility to put  service to others ahead of their own personal self-interest.   But the conduct revealed in ProPublica's reporting tells a much  different story. They show a Justice accepting secret, lavish luxury  trips and real estate purchases from a wealthy donor with interests  affected by the Court.   This is conduct we cannot tolerate, whether it is from a mayor, a  city council member, or other elected official, and we certainly  shouldn't tolerate it in the highest Court of the land. The Supreme  Court needs to clean up its act and fast.   Throughout our history, ethics scandals at every level of government  have inspired reform. Congress has repeatedly amended ethics laws  governing the House and Senate to ensure that there is transparency and  disclosure for the trips we take and the donations we receive. We have  a Code of Official Conduct that we must follow and Ethics Committees  that provide guidance and oversight for our activities. These  committees can launch investigations and penalize misconduct when it  occurs.   Congress has also passed numerous laws that affect the operation of  the Federal judiciary, including the Supreme Court. We pass  appropriations bills each and every year to cover judges' paychecks and  the operations of our courthouses. We have enacted financial disclosure  laws like the Ethics and Government Act and recusal laws like 28 U.S.C.  455 that apply to all Federal judges, including Supreme Court Justices.   We have long known there are shortcomings in the current ethics  standards for the highest Court in the land, the Supreme Court. For  example, the Justices do not consider themselves bound by the Code of  Conduct that every other Federal judge follows. Additionally, they do  not have clear and uniform processes for making and explaining their  decisions on whether to recuse themselves from a case where there is a  conflict of interest or an appearance of one. And as the recent  ProPublica series has revealed, some Justices simply aren't telling the  American people about the gifts and travel that they are accepting.   Frankly, the excuses we have heard thus far from Justice Thomas are  laughable. Claiming that a private luxury yacht in Indonesia from a  major political donor was ``personal hospitality'' that didn't need to  be disclosed is an absurd conclusion, and it is insulting to the  American people who expect Justices to be held to the same standards as  anyone else in government.   That is why reform is essential. It is critical to our justice system  and to our democracy that the American people have confidence that the  judges and especially the Supreme Court Justices can't be bought and  that they are serving the public interest and not their own personal  interests.   In the past, Congress has stepped up to strengthen court ethics. Just  last June, we passed the bipartisan Courthouse Ethics and Transparency  Act which applies the STOCK Act's reporting and disclosure requirements  to Federal judges and Justices. But the Supreme Court doesn't need to  wait on Congress to clean up its act. The Justices could take action  today if they wanted to, and if the Court fails to act, Congress must.    In the coming days, the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a  hearing on the need to restore public confidence in the highest Court  of our land, the Supreme Court. This won't be our first hearing on the  topic. We have held a  [[Page S1153]]  number of important hearings over the years on the need for judicial  ethics reform, including an important hearing in the last Congress on  the Court Subcommittee, chaired by Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island.  Some on the Republican side may claim that this focus on ethics is just  a reaction to decisions being handed down by the rightwing activist  majority of the Supreme Court. To them I say, check the record.   I have been at this pursuit for more than 10 years. I wrote a letter,  joined by Democratic colleagues, to the Chief Justice 11 years ago  urging him to adopt a Code of Conduct. The Senate Judiciary Committee  held a hearing in 2011 with Justices Scalia and Breyer. During that  hearing, I asked them about Supreme Court ethics, which was in the news  because of troubling reports even then of gifts being made by Mr.  Harlan Crow. Unfortunately, Chief Justice Roberts rejected our call to  act 10 years ago; and it appears that Harlan Crow took that as a sign  that he should ante up and increase his largesse. Is it any wonder that  we face a crisis of public confidence in the Supreme Court?   Our Constitution established a system of checks and balances between  the branches of government, and it established a system in which no  person is above the law.   There are few positions in our Federal Government more elevated than  Supreme Court Justices, but Justices are public servants, and they must  conduct themselves in that manner. Our job in the Senate Judiciary  Committee, and in the Senate, is to make certain that they do--nothing  less.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), and the Senator from New York (Mrs. Gillibrand) are  necessarily absent.   The result was announced--yeas 68, nays 30, as follows:                         [Rollcall Vote No. 84 Ex.]                                  YEAS--68       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Boozman      Brown      Cantwell      Capito      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Collins      Coons      Cortez Masto      Cramer      Duckworth      Durbin      Ernst      Fetterman      Fischer      Graham      Grassley      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      Kennedy      King      Klobuchar      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      McConnell      Menendez      Merkley      Moran      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Ricketts      Romney      Rosen      Rounds      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Thune      Tillis      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Welch      Whitehouse      Wicker      Wyden      Young                                  NAYS--30       Barrasso      Blackburn      Braun      Britt      Budd      Cassidy      Cornyn      Cotton      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Johnson      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      Mullin      Paul      Risch      Rubio      Schmitt      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Sullivan      Tuberville      Vance                               NOT VOTING--2       Feinstein      Gillibrand           The nomination was confirmed.

Ms. Solomon is a devoted public servant whose policy expertise and  commitment to the rule of law will serve  [[Page S1154]]  the Justice Department and communities across America. She has spent  nearly a decade working at OJP during the Obama and Biden  administrations, and she has served as the Principal Deputy Assistant  Attorney General for OJP since 2021.   Throughout her career, Ms. Solomon has led efforts to lower  recidivism, improve parole systems, and equip members of law  enforcement with the tools they need to combat crime. Previously, she  worked at Arnold Ventures and the Urban Institute, where she  spearheaded policy research on policing, prisons, and crime-reduction  programs.   A graduate of the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Ms. Solomon  has distinguished herself--both inside and outside of government--as a  foremost expert in creating a more efficient, evenhanded criminal  justice system that protects our communities and our families.   In a testament to her qualifications and temperament, Ms. Solomon has  been endorsed by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the  Correctional Leaders Association, and several former OJP officials.   After more than 5 years without a Senate-confirmed head of OJP, Ms.  Solomon's confirmation is long overdue. With her years of experience  within the Agency and her deep insights into our Nation's criminal  justice system, she will be ready to lead OJP from day one.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for her confirmation.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), is necessarily absent.

Every day, our Nation's bravest run headfirst toward danger to  extinguish fires and defend our communities. And they do it without a  moment's hesitation--no matter the risks they face. We saw that last  week, when a 2-day chemical fire raged at a plastics recycling plant in  Richmond, IN, forcing thousands of people to evacuate. Firefighters  worked around the clock, while inhaling toxic plumes, to battle the  flames and protect families. This was just weeks after firefighters in  East Palestine, OH, responded to a similar crisis, when a train  carrying toxic chemicals derailed and exploded into a raging ball of  fire.   But it is not only huge, headline-making fires that expose  firefighters to dangerous pollutants; it is nearly every household  fire, as well. The No. 1 line-of-duty cause of death for firefighters  is occupational cancer from toxic exposure. And yet fire departments  still lack critical equipment--like self-contained breathing  apparatuses--that protect firefighters from toxic gases. Even when  departments do have this gear on-hand, it can be dangerously outdated.  In many cases, this equipment is nearing--or past--its expiration date,  oftentimes by 10 years or more.   Before the recess, the Senate voted 96-0 to advance the Fire Grants  and Safety Act, which would help fire departments obtain updated,  lifesaving equipment. It would reauthorize two grant programs through  2030: the AFG Program and the SAFER Program.   Whether career, volunteer, or combination fire departments, AFG helps  ensure that they have the resources they need to train and equip  personnel. And SAFER helps with hiring and staffing to ensure 24/7  community protection. In the history of these programs, AFG has  provided $8.1 billion to fire departments, and SAFER has provided $5.2  billion. We need to pass this bill before these programs expire on  September 30, so our fire departments have the resources and personnel  they need to keep our communities safe.                            ____________________
