 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the bipartisan  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which includes a local hire  provision that I offered to allow local transportation projects like  the Los Angeles Metro to prioritize the hiring of local Angelenos for  projects that are taking place in their own backyard.   My district has recently had two major construction projects. On the  Westside, it is the Purple Line, which is going to connect UCLA to  downtown L.A. In South L.A., it is the Crenshaw Line, which is going to  bring a vital means of public transportation to neighborhoods  historically neglected when it comes to economic investment.   It really didn't make sense that people living in the neighborhoods  where the projects were going through could not be prioritized for the  jobs. That is why this provision is so important.   With the local hire provision signed into law, people in Los Angeles  neighborhoods can be prioritized for jobs in L.A. We are bringing  thousands of well-paying jobs to Los Angeles and putting tax dollars  back into the communities that paid for the projects in the first  place.                            ____________________
