 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the importance  of the National Apprenticeship Reauthorization Act.   Personally, Mr. Speaker, I want to say thank you to Susan Davis and,  certainly, Chairman Scott for putting this bill up. I am thankful that  so many of the priorities are included in this, ones that I have spoken  so highly of.   Last week was National Apprenticeship Week. As many may know,  registered apprenticeship programs have literally shaped my life. While  my three brothers went to college, I went to the other 4-year school. I  did an IBEW apprenticeship program to become an electrician.   ``Learn while you earn'' was my life. I understood that, that you  could take the knowledge that you learn at night at school in the books  and take it right to the job. That is the heart of what an  apprenticeship program is.   I supported my young family. I was able to continue that. I literally  went from the construction site to Congress.   Education is not one-size-fits-all. We hear that. For many, they  don't know if they want to go to college, build the college, or defend  the college. We need all of those, and that is how important it is.   The registered apprenticeship system is the most successful Federal  workforce training program in the history of the United States. Ninety- four percent of those people will have a job, when they complete their  apprenticeship, with a starting wage average of $70,000. It works.   But it is more than just a paycheck. It is about the dignity of a  job, the respect that comes with that.   In our country, there are so many ways that you can succeed. Whether  you are an apprentice in the shipyard, a medical tech, a Ph.D. from  Harvard, they are all the same in terms of value to this great country.  We need all of them.   The National Apprenticeship Act invests $3.5 billion in a proven,  successful system that has created over 1 million new opportunities.  But how important the standards are, particularly in the world that I  come from.    Mr. Speaker, why standards are so important is because  [[Page H5970]]  when storms hit our coast, electricians, linemen, come from around the  country to put that system back together. Could you imagine if they all  had their own program?   This is why standards count, particularly in the building trades,  because when there is not work in your hometown, you go to work in  another. We all work together, and that is why this is so important.   Since 1937, we haven't updated it. But just because it is old doesn't  mean it is not good.   It is handed down through generations. This is how we have trained  and given the next generation a proven, successful model.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the North  America's Building Trades Unions that talks about the importance of  what we are talking about today.                                                     North America's                                          Building Trades Unions,                                  Washington, DC, November 18, 2020.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: On behalf of the       over 3 million skilled craft professionals that comprise       North America's Building Trades Unions (NABTU), I write in       support of H.R. 8294, the National Apprenticeship Act of       2020.        I first would like to commend the work of the House       Committee on Education and Labor for their diligent efforts       to maintain the integrity of the Registered Apprenticeship       system and for their willingness to engage us on this bill,       which reauthorizes the foundational law on which our       apprenticeship programs are built. In the eighty-three years       since the Registered Apprenticeship system was created, our       nation, the economy, our industry and technology have       drastically changed. What has not changed is the need to       forever protect and enshrine the rights of those individuals       who enter an apprenticeship program, and H.R. 8294 continues       to protect the safety, well-being, and economic trajectory of       the apprentice.        More than two-thirds of all civilian registered apprentices       in the United States are trained in the construction       industry. Among these construction apprentices, seventy-five       percent receive their training at one of the 1,600 privately       funded training centers which are jointly administered by       construction contractors and building trades unions.       Investing over $1.6 billion in private capital annually in       our Registered Apprenticeship programs, the affiliated unions       of NABTU provide a debt-free ladder of opportunity to those       who seek a career in the construction industry. Our joint       labor-management programs have long been considered the gold       standard of the Registered Apprenticeship system.        The National Apprenticeship Act of 2020 protects many of       the hallmarks of the current system. This bill protects the       progressive wage scale for apprentices, which is often a       target of those in our industry who seek to put profits above       the well-being and economic security of the people they       employ. This bill protects the time-based model of       apprenticeship training that our programs have effectively       utilized for decades, while providing flexibility for new       industries that wish to enter the Registered Apprenticeship       system. This bill also protects apprentices by codifying       regulations that recognize collective bargaining agreements       contain exceptionally strong apprentice-to-journeyworker       ratios that not only ensure on-going, targeted instruction,       but also the level of supervision apprentices need to       guarantee their safety.        H.R. 8294 also makes some very important changes to the       Registered Apprenticeship program that NABTU has long fought       for. For the first time, there will be concrete standards       associated with pre-apprenticeship programs, which have       exponentially grown over the last several years as we       continue to work with our industry partners to increase the       diversity of apprenticeship candidates by recruiting women,       people of color and veterans. No longer can unscrupulous       contractors prop up pre-apprenticeship programs without       having clear and defined pathways into a Registered       Apprenticeship program.        Furthermore, H.R. 8294 codifies the Office of       Apprenticeship, with established funding streams to ensure       the necessary oversight of the program and expand technical       assistance that will grow Registered Apprenticeship       opportunities in new sectors. This bill strengthens the       National Advisory Committee on Apprenticeship, ensuring that       practitioners of Registered Apprenticeship, both industry and       labor, are given a voice to offer recommendations to further       strengthen the program.        While there are other avenues one may take to be trained in       the construction crafts, for generations, the safest, most       highly-skilled and productive construction craft workers in       the world have received their training through the Registered       Apprenticeship system. H.R. 8294, the National Apprenticeship       Act of 2020, will ensure the Registered Apprenticeship system       not only remains the gold standard in workforce training in       the construction industry, but that it is accessible for all       industries that seek a productive and highly-skilled       workforce. I urge swift passage of this bill, and look       forward to working with you to strengthen economic       opportunities in every community, both large and small,       across our great nation.            Sincerely,                                                     Sean McGarvey,                                                         President.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  National Apprenticeship Reauthorization Act so we can make sure we put  America back to work.                                time  1545
