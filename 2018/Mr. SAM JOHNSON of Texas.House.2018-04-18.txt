 Mr. Speaker, medical debt can be  financially crippling, and folks who have been fortunate enough to  receive debt forgiveness should not face surprise taxes from the IRS on  that debt.   Unfortunately, the current Tax Code is not clear on this issue.  Therefore, it is possible for a taxpayer to have their medical debt  canceled, but then be required to pay taxes on that forgiven debt as if  it were income.   That is plain wrong. To ensure medical debt forgiveness is not a  taxable event, last week, I introduced the Medical Debt Tax Relief Act.   I thank Congressman  John Larson for joining me in this effort, and I  urge our colleagues to join us both in support of this commonsense  legislation.                            ____________________
