 Madam President, as cochair of the Senate Recycling  Caucus, I am all for efforts to reuse material in a manner that gives  it a second life unless we are talking about recycling bad ideas. The  reckless tax-and-spend plan the White House and the majority are  threatening to bring forth once again is a terrible idea to revive.   The Senate wasted almost all of 2021 chasing this apparition. Now  here we are, over a year later, and our economic situation is much more  dire. Inflation is over 9 percent--the highest in more than four  decades. Many economists predict we are headed for a recession by next  year. There are indications that we are already there. Americans feel  this daily as prices at the pump and the grocery store eat away at  disposable income and as home price affordability becomes a thing of  the past.   According to a CNN poll last month, 64 percent of Americans feel the  economy is currently in a recession, but President Biden and allies of  his think that raising taxes, eliminating jobs, and spending billions  more will somehow help. Their wild claim that all of this spending will  reduce inflation was almost immediately debunked by the Penn Wharton  Budget Model, which found that, if enacted, the bill will have no  measurable impact on inflation.   Americans are struggling with high prices at every turn. Yet the  majority wants them to pay billions for Green New Deal programs that  could exacerbate energy security and food security concerns while using  fuzzy math to sell it as fighting inflation.   Their message to Americans is, We are sorry you are paying so much  for  [[Page S4016]]  every necessity you need, but we really have to plant some trees in  Brooklyn.   That is right. Tree equity--a Green New Deal program resurrected for  this bill--is the majority's secret weapon to fight inflation.   As the lead Republican on the Senate Ag Committee, I can attest to  how our section of the bill is chock-full of misplaced priorities like  this, but worse than that, when it comes to agriculture policy, this  bill sets a particularly bad precedent for farm bill programs. If they  go down this road, we very well might be looking at reconciliation as  the only way future farm bills are actually written. Whoever holds the  pen wields the fate for vital programs that farmers, ranchers, and  foresters depend on, not to mention nutrition programs that help low- income families and policies that allow conservationists to achieve our  shared goals.   We haven't had a single hearing on this bill. Yet its agriculture  title spends $40 billion--a huge amount allocated, with no input from  stakeholders, Republicans, and, quite frankly, most Democrats.   The majority is extending conservation programs until 2031--well  beyond the life of the next two farm bills, deliberately taking away  Congress's ability to change the focus of these programs or how they  operate.   The bill unilaterally creates a multibillion-dollar slush fund for  farm bill priorities shared by the President and his allies. That is a  terrible idea for any legislation, much less a bill that is  historically written in a very bipartisan fashion.   The current farm bill passed this Chamber with a record number of  ``yes'' votes on the floor. My goal, as current ranking member, is to  top that. To say this reckless bill jeopardizes the chances of that  would be an understatement. We have never written a farm bill in this  manner. It is antithetical to how the Senate--and the Ag Committee, in  particular--should operate. We have a storied history of working  together on the Agriculture Committee. Our stakeholders value the fact  that we approach the issues they face together rather than as  Republicans and Democrats. They appreciate that their voices are heard.   Unfortunately, with this decision, the majority has changed that  dynamic. In their zeal to pass their reckless tax-and-spend agenda,  they have undermined one of the last successful bipartisan processes  remaining in the Senate.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following letter from the Government Accountability Office, GAO, be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                              U.S. Government Accountability Office,                                                    Washington, DC.                                  Decision       Matter of: United States Department of Agriculture--          Applicability of the Congressional Review Act to the 2021           Updates to the Thrifty Food Plan      File: B-33732      Date: July 28, 2022                                    DIGEST         The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) issued a       document entitled Thrifty Food Plan, 2021 (2021 TFP). The       2021 TFP updates the market baskets used to determine the       value of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)       benefits to purchase food from retail stores.        The Congressional Review Act (CRA) requires that before a       rule can take effect, an agency must submit the rule to both       the House of Representatives and the Senate as well as the       Comptroller General, and provides procedures for       congressional review where Congress may disapprove of rules.       We conclude the 2021 TFP meets the definition of a rule under       the CRA and no CRA exception applies. Therefore, the 2021 TFP       is subject to the requirement that it be submitted to       Congress.                                   DECISION         On August 16, 2021, the United States Department of       Agriculture (USDA) issued a  [[Page S4035]]       document entitled Thrifty Food Plan, 2021 (2021 TFP). USDA,       Thrifty Food Plan, 2021 (August 2021), available at https://  FNS. usda.gov/TFP (last visited Jul. 12, 2022). We received a       request for a decision as to whether the 2021 TFP is a rule       for purposes of the Congressional Review Act (CRA). Letter       from Senator Tillis to the Comptroller General (Oct. 27,       2021). For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the       2021 TFP is a rule and thus subject to the submission       requirement of CRA.        Our practice when rendering decisions is to contact the       relevant agencies to obtain their legal views on the subject       of the request. GAO, Procedures and Practices for Legal       Decisions and Opinions, GA0-06-1064SP (Washington, D.C.:       Sept. 2006), available at https://www.gao.gov/products/gao- 06-1064sp. Accordingly, we reached out to USDA to obtain the       agency's legal views. Letter from Managing Associate General       Counsel, GAO, to General Counsel, USDA (Dec. 15, 2021 ). We       received USDA's response on February 11, 2022. Letter from       Associate General Counsel, USDA, to Managing Associate       General Counsel, GAO (Feb. 11, 2022) (Response Letter).                                  BACKGROUND       Thrifty Food Plan        The Thrifty Food Plan is defined by the Food and Nutrition       Act of 2008 as a diet required to feed a family of four       persons. See 7 U.S.C. 2012(u). The Act uses the cost of this       diet as the basis for allotments to households regardless of       their actual size. Id. These allotments take the form of       Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits to       purchase food from retail stores. See 7 U.S.C. Sec. 2013. In       order for a household to qualify for SNAP benefits its gross       income cannot exceed the poverty line. See 7 U.S.C.       Sec. 2014(c).        The 2018 Farm Bill amended the Thrifty Food Plan to require       USDA to ``re-evaluate and publish the market baskets of the       thrifty food plan based on current food prices, food       composition data, consumption patterns, and dietary       guidance'' by 2022 and at 5-year intervals thereafter.       Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 Farm Bill), Pub. L.       No. 115-334, title IV, Sec. 4002, 132 Stat. 4490, 4624 (Dec.       20, 2018). On August 16, 2021, USDA published the 2021 TFP.       USDA, Thrifty Food Plan, 2021 (August 2021), available at       https://FNS.usda.gov/TFP (last visited Jul. 12, 2022). The       2021 TFP is the USDA update to the TFP market baskets       required by the 2018 Farm Bill.        The 2021 TFP describes the approach and methods used in       reevaluating the Thrifty Food Plan. Prior to the 2021       reevaluation, the market basket prices were last updated in       2006. 2021 TFP at 30. The result of the 2021 reevaluation is       that the monthly cost of a market basket for the reference       family of four is $835.57. 2021 TFP at 34. This represents an       increase of $145.19 (in 2021 dollars) from the previous       market basket price. See id. at 34-35. The changes to the       maximum SNAP benefit allotments based on the 2021 TFP were       effective beginning October 1, 2021. 2021 TFP at 51.      The Congressional Review Act        CRA, enacted in 1996 to strengthen congressional oversight       of agency rulemaking, requires federal agencies to submit a       report on each new rule to both houses of Congress and to the       Comptroller General for review before a rule can take effect.       5 U.S.C. Sec. 801(a)(1)(A). The report must contain a copy of       the rule, ``a concise general statement relating to the       rule,'' and the rule's proposed effective date. Id. An agency       can find for good cause that notice and public procedure are       impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public       interest and the rule will then take effect at a time the       agency determines. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 808(2). Each house of       Congress is to provide the report on the rule to the chairman       and ranking member of each standing committee with       jurisdiction. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 801 (a)(1)(C). CRA allows       Congress to review and disapprove rules issued by federal       agencies for a period of 60 days using special procedures.       See 5 U.S.C. Sec. 802. If a resolution of disapproval is       enacted, then the new rule has no force or effect. 5 U.S.C.       Sec. 801 (b)(1).        CRA adopts the definition of rule under the Administrative       Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. Sec. 551(4), which states that       a rule is ``the whole or a part of an agency statement of       general or particular applicability and future effect       designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy       or describing the organization, procedure, or practice       requirements of an agency.'' 5 U.S.C. Sec. 804(3). CRA       excludes three categories of rules from coverage: (1) rules       of particular applicability; (2) rules relating to agency       management or personnel; and (3) rules of agency       organization, procedure, or practice that do not       substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency       parties. Id.        USDA did not submit a CRA report to Congress or the       Comptroller General on the 2021 TFP. In its response to us,       USDA stated the 2021 TFP was not subject to CRA because it       was not a rule within the meaning of the APA or CRA. Response       Letter, at 3-4. USDA also stated that it met the good cause       exception under the CRA, and, thus, was not subject to the       CRA's submission requirements. See id. at 7-8. For the       reasons explained below, we conclude that the 2021 TFP is a       rule under the CRA, does not meet any of the exceptions that       would exclude the rule from coverage, and is, therefore,       subject to the submission requirement of CRA.                                   ANALYSIS         To determine whether the 2021 TFP is a rule subject to       review under CRA, we first address whether the 2021 TFP meets       the APA definition of a rule. As explained below, we conclude       that it does. The next step, then, is to determine whether       any of the CRA exceptions apply. We conclude that they do       not.        The 2021 TFP meets the APA definition of a rule upon which       the CRA relies. First, the 2021 TFP is an agency statement as       it was issued by USDA to update market basket prices that       were last revised in 2006. See 2021 TFP at 1. Second, the       2021 TFP is of future effect, as it provides guidance for new       market basket prices on which SNAP benefits will be based       going forward, effective October 1, 2021. Id. at 51. See B-      316048, Apr. 17, 2008 (finding that an agency action was of       future effect because the action was prospective in nature       since it was concerned with policy considerations for the       future rather than the evaluation of past or present       conduct). Finally, the 2021 TFP is designed to implement,       interpret, or prescribe law or policy as it implements the       new market baskets as required by the Food and Nutrition Act       of 2008 and the 2018 Farm Bill. 2021 TFP at 4-6.        In its Response Letter, USDA asserts the 2021 TFP is exempt       from the APA's rule making provisions because it relates to       agency management and benefits, and, consequently, it is not       a rule. Response Letter at 4. We disagree with this       rationale. Specifically, USDA notes that the APA requires       notice and comment for all rules ``except to the extent       that there is involved . . . a matter relating to agency       management or personnel or to public property, loans,       grants, benefits, or contracts.'' [Emphasis removed.]       Response Letter, at 4 (quoting 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2)). USDA       argues that ``evaluating market baskets based on current       food prices is a matter relating to `agency management' of       [ ] SNAP and relates to SNAP `benefits.' '' Response       Letter, at 4. However, the language USDA cites in 5 U.S.C.       553(a)(2) pertains to an exception to the APA's rule       making process, not to the definition of a rule. Even       assuming the 2021 TFP is exempt from the APA's notice and       comment requirement, that does not mean it is not a rule       as defined by 5 U.S.C. 551(4). See B-323772, Sept. 4, 2012       (noting the CRA is intended to include within its purview,       almost all rules that an agency issues, not only those       that must be promulgated according to the APA's notice and       comment requirements). It should also be noted that 7       U.S.C. Sec. 2013(c) specifically directs USDA to       promulgate regulations related to SNAP ``in accordance       with the procedures set forth in section 553 of title 5.''       As discussed, the 2021 TFP is an agency statement of       future effect designed to implement policy, and,       therefore, meets the definition of a rule.        USDA contends that Congress did not require the 2021 TFP to       be issued as a rule because Congress did not specifically       require the 2021 TFP to be subject to CRA. Response Letter,       at 5. We disagree with this interpretation of CRA. We conduct       our analysis under CRA which requires all rules to follow the       procedures outlined in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 801. All rules are       subject to the procedures required by CRA, whether or not       Congress specifically requires it, before they can take       effect. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 801.        USDA also argues that Congress had constructive notice that       the 2021 TFP would increase SNAP benefits and, as a result,       USDA was not required to provide formal CRA notice to       Congress. Response Letter, at 5-7. However, constructive       notice is not an exception to CRA notice procedures. As       discussed above, CRA is a method of congressional oversight       of agency rulemaking. CRA requires agencies to submit a       report to Congress about the rule. 5 U.S.C.       Sec. 801(a)(1)(A). The submission of this report initiates       the congressional review process which can lead to Congress       disapproving a rule. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 801 (b)(1). It is the       report that triggers the CRA review process. As a result,       constructive notice of a rule is not the same as submitting a       formal report as required by CRA. While there are exceptions       for waiving a delay in the effective date of a rule, 5 U.S.C.       Sec. 808, there are no exceptions for submitting a report.        Having concluded that the 2021 TFP meets the APA definition       of a rule, we now turn to whether any of the three CRA       exceptions apply. We also address USDA's argument that the       good cause exception provides an exemption from the CRA's       submission requirement. As explained below, we conclude they       do not.        First, the 2021 TFP is not a rule of particular       applicability. Rules of particular applicability are       addressed to specific, identified entities. See       Administrative Conference of the United States, Miscellaneous       Statements, 39 Fed. Reg. 4846, 4849 (Feb. 7, 1974)       (explaining that a rule of general applicability is one with       an open class but a rule of particular applicability is       limited to those named). The 2021 TFP applies to all families       whose income falls below the poverty line and is not       addressed to specific, identified entities. Therefore, it is       a rule of general applicability and not a rule of particular       applicability.        Second, this is not a rule relating to agency management or       personnel. A rule relates to agency management or personnel       if it applies to agency employees and not to outside parties.       See e.g. B-331324, Oct. 22, 2019 (determining that 5 U.S.C.       Sec. 804(3)(b) does not apply when the rule deals with       actions a bank should take and not agency management or       personnel). The 2021 TFP deals with the  [[Page S4036]]       amount of SNAP benefits for qualifying families and, the       market basket costs in the 2021 TFP apply broadly to the       contiguous 48 states and the District of Columbia.        Finally, the 2021 TFP substantially impacts the rights of       non-agency parties because it has an effect on qualifying       families by granting increased benefit allotments designed       for them to obtain a more nutritious diet.        USDA contends the 2021 TFP meets the good cause exception       under the CRA, and, therefore, USDA was not required to       follow the CRA's submission requirements. Response Letter, at       7-8. In its response USDA stated that good cause existed to       issue the 2021 TFP with an effective date in August 2021. Id.       at 8. USDA further stated that this excepted it from carrying       out formal CRA notice before the effective date. Id. While       CRA does not provide an emergency exception from its       procedural requirements to submit rules for congressional       review, CRA and APA address an agency's need to take       emergency action without delay. Agencies can waive the       required delay in effective date requirement when an agency       for ``good cause'' finds (and incorporates the finding and a       brief statement of reasons in the rule issued) that notice       and public procedure are ``impracticable, unnecessary, or       contrary to the public interest.'' 5 U.S.C Sec. Sec. 553(b),       808(2). Therefore, an agency can provide for a rule to take       effect immediately while still complying with the agency's       statutory obligation to submit the rule to Congress for       review. Asserting a good cause exception does not serve to       waive the CRA's submission requirements all together.       Notably, the 2021 TFP did not incorporate a finding or       statement of the reasons why there is good cause for an       exception to the CRA's procedural rules to submit the 2021       TFP for congressional review, nor did the 2021 TFP include an       immediate effective date. Therefore, USDA did not properly       apply the good cause exception.        Thus, we conclude that none of the three exceptions that       would exclude the rule from CRA coverage, or the good cause       exception apply, and the 2021 TFP is subject to the       submission requirement of CRA.                                  CONCLUSION         The 2021 TFP is a rule for purposes of CRA because it meets       the APA definition of a rule and no CRA exception applies.       Therefore, even if exempt from the APA notice-and-comment       requirements, the 2021 TFP is subject to the CRA requirement       that it be submitted to Congress before it can take effect.                                             Edda Emmanuelli Perez,      General Counsel.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I rise to recognize and  congratulate the El Dorado Historic District Commission on being named  the 2022 Commission of the Year by the National Alliance of  Preservation Commissions.   Described as an oil ``boom-town'' of the 1920s, the city of El Dorado  is a community transformed by historic preservation. The El Dorado  Historic District Commission, established in 1984, works to protect,  enhance and improve districts of distinctive character, historic  interest, and value to promote the health, prosperity, safety, and  welfare of the city.   In 2020, the city of El Dorado and its Historic District Commission  released a citywide historic preservation plan drafted by the Lakota  Group, an Illinois-based urban planning and design  [[Page S4037]]  firm. Upon working with the community of El Dorado and seeing the  commission's efforts to preserve the city's history and heritage, the  Lakota Group nominated the city's commission for the Commission of the  Year award.   The commission received the award in July 2022, recognizing its  outstanding achievement, hard work, and diligence in preserving this  historic city in south Arkansas.   I congratulate the El Dorado Historic District Commission on this  notable award, and I am excited to see how it continues working to  preserve the neighborhoods, businesses, landmarks, and other  establishments that embody the rich history of the community.                            ____________________
