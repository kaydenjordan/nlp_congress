 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Congressman Adrian  Smith, for yielding, and I thank him, more importantly, for honoring  the life and memory of our mutual good friend Clayton Yeutter.   In my desk in my office there is a letter, and it was written to me  by Clayton Yeutter, former Secretary of Agriculture, a couple of years  ago. Of course, we all receive a lot of letters, but sometimes you get  one that you just want to keep close to you.   Clayton Yeutter was a gentleman, he was a farmer from Nebraska, and  he was a true statesman. In that letter, he basically kindly and gently  encouraged me in public service. He was the ideal public servant. He  expressed his sentiments to me personally, but in his public life, with  a great nobility, a great yearning and care for our country, he  committed himself in multiple ways to serving our institutions of  governance. But he never forgot his humble roots back in Nebraska.   So I simply want to say: Well done, good, faithful servant Clayton  Yeutter, my friend.   I thank the gentleman for honoring Ambassador Yeutter's life.
