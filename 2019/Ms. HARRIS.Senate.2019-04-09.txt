 I thank the Senator from Tennessee.   Dr. King continues:         You may well ask: ``Why direct action? Why sit ins, marches       and so forth? Isn't negotiation a better path?'' You are       quite right in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the       very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent direct action seeks       to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a       community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced       to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue       that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of       tension as part of the work of the nonviolent resister may       sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not       afraid of the word ``tension.'' I have earnestly opposed       violent tension, but there is a type of constructive,       nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth. Just as       Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in       the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage of       myths and half truths to the unfettered realm of creative       analysis and objective appraisal, so must we see the need for       nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society       that will help men rise from the dark depths of prejudice and       racism to the majestic heights of understanding and       brotherhood. The purpose of our direct action program is to       create a situation so crisis packed that it will inevitably       open the door to negotiation. I therefore concur with you in       your call for negotiation. Too long has our beloved Southland       been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in monologue       rather than dialogue.        One of the basic points in your statement is that the       action that I and my associates have taken in Birmingham is       untimely. Some have asked: ``Why didn't you give the new city       administration time to act?'' The only answer that I can give       to this query is that the new Birmingham administration must       be prodded about as much as the outgoing one, before it will       act. We are sadly mistaken if we feel that the election of       Albert Boutwell as mayor will bring the millennium to       Birmingham. While Mr. Boutwell is a much more gentle person       than Mr. Connor, they are both segregationists, dedicated to       maintenance of the status quo. I have hope that Mr. Boutwell       will be reasonable enough to see the futility of massive       resistance to desegregation. But he will not see this without       pressure from devotees of civil rights. My friends, I must       say to you that we have not made a single gain in civil       rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure.       Lamentably, it is an historical fact that privileged groups       seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals may       see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust       posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups       tend to be more immoral than individuals.        We know through painful experience that freedom is never       voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by       the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct       action campaign that was ``well timed'' in the view of those       who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation.       For years now I have heard the word ``Wait!'' It rings in the       ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This       ``Wait'' has almost always meant ``Never.'' We must come       to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that       ``justice too long delayed is justice denied.''        We have waited for more than 340 years for our       constitutional and God given rights. The nations of Asia and       Africa are moving with jetlike speed toward gaining political       independence, but we still creep at horse and buggy pace       toward gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. Perhaps it       is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of       segregation to say, ``Wait.'' But when you have seen vicious       mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your       sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled       policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and       sisters; when you see the vast majority of your twenty       million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of       poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you       suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering       as you seek to explain to your six year old daughter why she       can't go to the public amusement park that has just been       advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her       eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored       children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to       form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to       distort her personality by developing an unconscious       bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an       answer for a five year old son who is asking: ``Daddy, why do       white people treat colored people so mean?''; when you take a       cross county drive and find it necessary to sleep night after       night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because       no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day in and       day out by nagging signs reading ``white'' and ``colored'';       when your first name becomes ``nigger,'' your middle name       becomes ``boy'' (however old you are) and your last name       becomes ``John,'' and your wife and mother are never given       the respected title ``Mrs.''; when you are harried by day and       haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living       constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to       expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer       resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating       sense of ``nobodiness''--then you will understand why [I]       find it difficult to wait.    I would now like to yield to my colleague Senator Cruz from Texas.
