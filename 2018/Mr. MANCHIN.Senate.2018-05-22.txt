 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of S. 2906, which is at the desk; that the bill be read a  third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I would like the right to proceed.   I thank my good friend from North Carolina, Senator Tillis. He is  always willing to work in a bipartisan way. I thank him very much.   We have concerns about the VA and all of our veterans. He is in a  State that has a tremendous population, and  [[Page S2824]]  I am in a State with a tremendous population of veterans. I am  disappointed there is an objection to my bill.   I rise to speak to my frustration that the Asset and Infrastructure  Review, or the so-called AIR Act, provision is being included in what  is otherwise a very good package. I thank Chairman Isakson, Ranking  Member Tester, and Senator Tillis for all their hard work on the  overall MISSION Act.   The MISSION Act is going to do so many good things. It is going to  streamline how we provide non-VA care. It is finally expanding  caregivers for veterans of all eras, and it will make it easier for the  VA to hire high-quality providers.   I am against adding the AIR, which is the Asset and Infrastructure  Review Act, or I like to call it the VA BRAC. This bill could be  detrimental to rural veterans.   The AIR Act provision was supposedly added by House Republicans to  the MISSION Act because the Senate insisted the caregivers bill be  included. I am a proud cosponsor of the caregivers bill because it does  not make sense to give a benefit to one era of veterans and not give it  to them all.   I thank my colleague Senator Murray for the year she has dedicated to  the caregivers issue. The AIR Act was never voted on or discussed in  the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. The House Caregivers companion  bill is bipartisan and has 90 cosponsors. We could pass this bill  without the AIR Act in a heartbeat.   While I am generally supportive of efforts to cut waste, the AIR Act  will not come close to paying for this bill. Instead, it puts rural  hospitals and facilities like those in West Virginia in the crosshairs  of the VA bureaucrats and technocrats who do not know my veterans and  what they need.   The last time there was an asset review--the CARES Commission--was in  the early 2000s. It recommended closing the acute inpatient hospital  beds and contracting for acute care in the community for the Beckley VA  Medical Center. Only after stakeholders yelled and screamed did the  Secretary not follow their recommendations.   Today, those 25 acute care beds and 5 ICU beds are vitally important,  not just to our Southern West Virginia veteran community but the entire  community. Administrators at the surrounding hospitals have told me  they could not absorb the Beckley VA patient load. We were lucky then  to have vocal stakeholders holler and scream and a Secretary who  listened, but will we be so lucky in the future? Furthermore, should  veterans have to endure the uncertainty their VA hospital or CBOC may  not always be there for them?   My veteran population is nearly 40 percent Vietnam veterans. In the  last 10 years, there was a nearly 20-percent decrease in my veteran  population because our World War II and Korean veterans are dying, and  our Vietnam veterans are not getting any younger.   If we send this Commission in and they do the analysis, my fear is,  resources and funding will be realigned away from our patriotic West  Virginia veterans--Phoenix gets picked over Clarksburg; Los Angeles  over Beckley; Washington, DC, over Martinsburg; and Orlando over  Huntington.   I feel sure the VA will follow the law, hold their public hearings,  and read statements put in the Federal Register, but they will still  have the power to close or downsize West Virginia facilities. Just  because you are a veteran living in a rural area does not mean you  don't deserve the same quality and access of care that you would  receive in an urban area.   Is this truly about taking evaluation of waste or is this the slow  filing away of the VA infrastructure as we know it?   I am aware the MISSION Act just passed out of the House 347 to 70. I  have a lot of good friends on both sides of the aisle who want the  overall bill. It has the support of the national veterans service  organizations, and the effects of this bill will not likely come into  being until 2025. I will not be serving in the Senate then. Yet, for  the sake of the veteran population in West Virginia, I have to say  something publicly.   The AIR Act could have detrimental second and third order effects in  our communities. If this bill passes with the AIR Act in it, the powers  that wish to downsize the level of care we give to veterans will see it  as a victory, but they should be prepared for robust and exhaustive  oversight by me and my colleagues on the committee. If we don't have  the market assessments, access to other population data, and if the  central office doesn't start filling some of the healthcare provider  vacancies in West Virginia VA medical centers, I will reluctantly put a  hold on some nominees for this Commission. I am going to encourage my  colleagues from rural States who represent rural areas to do the same.   Thank you.    I agree with my colleague from North Carolina.   We don't want to continue if there are areas and assets that can be  done away with for efficiencies. I understand that can be done without  this.   I don't know the underlying reasons for it. The AIR Act was never  even discussed in our committee. We never had the bill in front of us  at all. That is all I was saying. How did this all of a sudden get  thrown in?   I understand--because of what we put in, the expansion of how we were  going to take care of caregivers to all populations of veterans--they  were upset on the House side. This was put in retribution to that. I  objected to how it was put in being what the intent was.   I believe the VA can dispose of excess properties that have been  closed, vacant, and not in utilization. I am concerned they are going  to come back and say: In the rural areas, we are going to close this  CBOC and consolidate. We have more need right now and a greater need  with some of our population base, especially with the conflicts we have  around the world now.   I never talked to a veteran who did not want veterans care if there  was any way they could get to a veterans hospital or clinic. They were  the people who knew them best and knew how to take care of their  concerns. That is all I am trying to preserve.   I don't know what the intentions are of this. That is why I wanted to  have  [[Page S2825]]  that removed, and maybe we can discuss it in our Senate VA Committee  and have a better way of reviewing the excess properties and properties  not being utilized.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I am incredibly honored to  rise and recognize a group of 23 heroic military veterans who will  travel from West Virginia this week to visit our Nation's Capital as  part of the ninth Always Free Honor Flight. On the occasion of their  visit, in which they will see for the first time the monuments built in  their honor, I want to express my utmost gratitude to these special men  and women for their extraordinary bravery and patriotism and for their  noble sacrifice to help keep our country free.   I have said this time and time again: West Virginia is one of the  most patriotic States in this great Nation. With one of our country's  highest per capita rates of military servicemembers and veterans, West  Virginia is undoubtedly one of our Nation's most patriotic States.  According to the Department of Defense, West Virginia had the highest  casualty rate in the nation during the Vietnam war, and I am so proud  that the Honor Flight will allow these West Virginia veterans to pay  homage to their brethren at the Vietnam Wall. The 23 veterans  participating in this week's Always Free Honor Flight truly embody the  Mountain State's history and contributions to the safeguard of our  American freedoms.   Our special West Virginians visiting this week represent warriors  from 50 to 94 years old and have traveled from all parts of our great  State, from Buckhannon to Bluefield, Princeton to Beckley, and many  places in between. In addition to our Mountain State veterans, one  veteran from North Carolina and two veterans from Virginia will be  accompanying their West Virginia neighbors on the daylong adventure. Of  the patriots attending, four served in World War II, two served in both  the Korean war and the Vietnam war, 17 served in the Vietnam war, two  served in the Cold War, one served in the Gulf War, and two served  stateside.   I would especially like to recognize our World War II Veterans who  will be on this Honor Flight. Ninety-four-year-old Sergeant Wetzel Ray  Sanders from Midkiff joined the Army in Princeton in 1941. He was a  gunner and rifleman stationed in Hawaii and is a Pearl Harbor survivor.  Former Seaman Samuel Helmandollar will also be coming to Washington,  DC. The Princeton native and 91-year-old joined the Navy in 1944 in  Huntington and was a gunner. We will also be joined by 93-year-old  Sergeant Rudolph Dillon Jennings from Bluefield. He joined the Army Air  Corps in 1943 in Princeton and was stationed in England and served in  the European Theater. John Howard Winfrey, a 93-year-old from Lindside  joined the Navy and Air Force in 1942. He served aboard ships in the  Atlantic and Pacific as a torpedoman 2nd class during World War II.   These men represent our Nation's Greatest Generation, and their  sacrifices and valor embody American patriotism. They fought in such a  pivotal war, in an era that threatened our existence as a nation.  Unfortunately, as the years go by, we are losing so many of our World  War II veterans, and we must show them our utmost gratitude each and  every day.   As I mentioned, we will also be joined by veterans of the Korean,  Vietnam, Cold, and Gulf wars. They engaged in combat all over the  world. They were pilots, helicopter gunners, and radio operators.   One of these veterans, Curtis Ray Vest of Bluefield, joined the  Marine Corps in 1952 in Freeman and served in both Korea and Vietnam.  In Korea, he served as a Field Observer for Field Artillery and was  stationed in Incheon and Puson. In Vietnam, he was part of the American  rescue mission of the French from Vietnam to safety in Japan.   Another of these Veterans is Sergeant Marshall Glenn Mann who joined  Air Force in 1968 in Falls Church. On March 4, 1971 during combat at  Khe Sanh, the Republic of Vietnam air lift urgently needed to get  ammunition to Khe Sanh in to support operation Lam Son719. The  objective of this mission was to destroy supply dumps and sever the Ho  Chi Minh Trail, which was the corridor running through eastern Laos  from North Vietnam to Cambodia and into South Vietnam. Because of the  Cooper-Church Amendment passed by Congress in late 1970s, US ground  troops and advisers were prohibited from entering Laos. However, U.S.  helicopters supported the operation and U.S. fighter bombers, and B-52  bombers provided air cover. Sergeant Mann received the Distinguished  Flying Cross for extraordinary achievement while participating in  aerial flight for this operation.   Another Vietnam Veteran joining us is Staff Sergeant Danny Lewis  Meadows, who joined the Air Force in 1966 in Beckley. Staff Sergeant  Meadows was a mechanic on KC-135 Air Refueling Tanker for two years and  refueled B-52 bombers and F-4 fighters in Southeast Asia. During his  last two years of service, Staff Sergeant Meadows was a crew chief on a  C-130 cargo aircraft in the Philippines and Vietnam. He flew to Saigon  and Cam Ranh Bay Vietnam for fifteen to twenty-one days each month. He  flew from several bases in Vietnam into the jungle to perform assault  landings. He was working on his aircraft and was attacked with rockets  and fell off the wing, broke his hip and wrist and with four months  remaining on his enlistment and was shipped back to the U.S. to  recover.   We will also have two Veterans that served in the Cold War One of  them, Jackson P. Thompson served as a Recon Specialist from 1971-76. He  was stationed at Fulda Gap in Germany, which was near the area between  the Inner German Border of East and West Germany that contained two  corridors of lowlands subjected to a potential invasion by Warsaw Pact  forces.   Showing our appreciation to those who have served is something that  we should do each and every day, but today is a special day to pay  tribute and thank those who have volunteered to put their lives on the  line for our freedoms. The memorials our Honor Flight participants will  visit today serve as an important reminder to us all that our freedoms  and liberties come at a steep cost. However, I know our veterans will  find special meaning and potentially long-lost emotions when they tour  such touching sites.   The brave West Virginia heroes today have all served this country in  a variety of ways, working both at home and abroad. They have engaged  in combat on U.S. soil in Pearl Harbor and all over the world, at the  Panama Canal, working on the docks of Saigon, protecting the border of  West Germany and serving in Desert Shield and Desert Storm. One of our  visiting Vietnam veterans, Sergeant Dean Fluharty, who joined the  Marine Corps in Parkersburg, earned a Purple Heart, Silver Star,  Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry and a Good Conduct Medal. But regardless  of their rank or duty, each and every one of these veterans answered  our nation's call and has served with incredible pride and valor.   This week's `Honor Flight' and the continued support of our Veterans  would not be possible without the dedication of so many volunteers and  caregivers. I would like to thank the four JROTC Cadets from Montcalm,  Bluefield and Princeton High Schools as well as the military spouses  serving as the guardians on this year's `Honor Flight.' These guardians  have selflessly given their time to travel alongside our veterans all  the way from Princeton, West Virginia to Washington, D.C. to share this  very special journey with them   I also commend those in the `Always Free Honor Flight' Network for  their dedication to providing our Veterans with such a unique and  meaningful experience. Without the diligence and passion of Dreama  Denver, President of `Always Free Honor Flight' Network and owner of  Princeton, West Virginia's Little Buddy Radio, as well as Pam  Coulbourne, the coordinator of these flights, many of our Veterans  would never have the opportunity to travel to Washington and pay homage  to the men and women they fought beside. Dreama and Pam launched the  `Always Free Honor Flight' in 2012 and every year, they continue to  make this dream a reality for many of our West Virginia Veterans.   I'd also like to recognize Sergeant First Class Paul Dorsey, Vice  President of Always Free Honor Flight and Official Photographer Steve  Coleman, who have done a tremendous job of ensuring that our Veterans  receive the recognition they deserve. Dreama, Pam, and Steve have also  dedicated themselves to the Denver Foundation, serving as incredible  examples of how individuals can give back to their communities.  [[Page S2831]]    I am filled with pride every time I meet the patriots who have served  our country, and I am so pleased to welcome West Virginia's most  courageous veterans, who are all heroes, to Washington, D.C. I  encourage all of my colleagues to join me in saluting them. They truly  inspire us all as we are reminded of their selfless service. It is  because of their bravery that all Americans enjoy the greatest  liberties and freedoms in the world.   God bless all our servicemembers and veterans, God bless the great  State of West Virginia, and God bless the United States of  America.                            ____________________
