 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding and also for his tremendous leadership.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 83. This  critical resolution helps put a check on this administration's reckless  and irrational unauthorized military actions against Iran.   The American people do not want, and we cannot allow, another  unnecessary war of choice in the Middle East. This resolution is an  important step in our efforts to prevent that from happening. This will  restore our constitutional duty over military action.   Also, we must take up my bill, H.R. 2456, to repeal the 2002 AUMF and  Congressman Khanna's bill to prohibit any funds for a war with Iran,  absent an explicit authorization. My 2002 AUMF amendment was included  with bipartisan support in the House and passed in the 2020 NDAA bill,  but it was stripped by Republicans from the final bill. Now, I know  why.   Madam Speaker, this administration has falsely claimed that the 2002  AUMF could be used as a congressional authorization to attack Iran,  which is completely outrageous.    Madam Speaker, let me be clear: U.S. military  deployment and operations carried out pursuant to the 2002 AUMF  officially concluded in 2011. Maintaining this authorization is not  only dangerous, but it is irresponsible.   Madam Speaker, it is past time to return to diplomacy and end these  endless wars, and I urge an ``aye'' vote on H. Con. Res. 83.
