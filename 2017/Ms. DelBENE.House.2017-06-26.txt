 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate LGBT Equality  Day. Today, we mark the anniversary of landmark victories at the  Supreme Court that moved our country toward one that is more fair, more  equal, and more inclusive of all Americans, and we are a better,  stronger Nation for it.   Each year, on June 26, we commemorate the decriminalization of loving  LGBT couples, in overturning of the discriminatory Defense of Marriage  Act, and now marriage equality in all 50 States.   But even as we celebrate this incredible progress, we must never  forget the work that remains.   The LGBT community continues to face staggering rates of harassment  and discrimination for who they are and who they love. I invite all my  colleagues to stand with me on the right side of history. America is  ready to take the next step forward.   So today, let's recommit to breaking down the barriers that remain in  fulfilling the American promise of liberty and justice for all.                            ____________________
