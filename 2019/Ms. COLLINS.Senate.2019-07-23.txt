 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  stand in recess until 2 p.m. for the weekly conference meetings.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 1:04 p.m., recessed until 2  p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer  (Mrs. Capito).  [[Page S4994]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill with my friend  and colleague from Maryland, Senator Cardin, that will benefit the  brave women and men who volunteer as emergency personnel: The Volunteer  Emergency Services Recruitment and Retention Act.   Across our Nation, volunteer emergency personnel play a critical role  in ensuring the safety of our communities and the well-being of our  neighbors. They serve as the firefighters, EMS, and other first  responders that we depend on in our times of need. The State of Maine,  for example, has approximately 9,785 firefighters who serve the State's  1.3 million citizens. Maine is largely a rural State, and more than 90  percent of firefighters are volunteers. Without these dedicated  volunteers, many smaller communities would be unable to provide  firefighting and other emergency services at all.   Often, communities seek to recruit and retain volunteers by offering  modest benefits. One of the most common benefits are Length of Service  Award Programs or LOSAPs. These are retirement accounts provided to  volunteer emergency responders. The legislation we are introducing  today would support these efforts by helping to ensure that these  nominal benefits to volunteers are not entangled in bureaucracy or  needlessly held back by regulations. Specifically, the Volunteer  Emergency Services Recruitment and Retention  [[Page S5016]]  Act would simplify how LOSAPs are taxed without increasing or reducing  Federal spending or taxes. It would do this by eliminating burdensome  and confusing IRS requirements that make it unnecessarily difficult for  volunteer emergency personnel to receive benefits and for departments  to administer plans.   Mr. President, we should take care to protect our volunteer emergency  personnel who serve this country with such bravery. Our legislation  would help us achieve that goal, and I urge my colleagues to join us in  supporting this bill.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill with my friend  and colleague from Maryland, Senator Cardin, that will benefit the  brave women and men who volunteer as emergency personnel: The Volunteer  Emergency Services Recruitment and Retention Act.
