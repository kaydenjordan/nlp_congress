 Madam Speaker, I commend our distinguished chair of the  Committee on Oversight and Reform, and the Congress, for bringing this  important legislation to the floor within 24 hours of it passing the  Senate.   It is a pretty exciting historic day.   I thank Congresswoman Jackson Lee for her sponsorship of this  legislation for such a long time.   Madam Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues in the spirit of joy and  pride as the Congress passes this legislation to declare Juneteenth a  national holiday.   With this step, Congress is ensuring that one of the most momentous  [[Page H2865]]  events in our history--which has been celebrated by millions,  particularly Black Americans for 150 years now--is officially  recognized; that it is enshrined in our history books, and it takes its  place of honor in our Nation.                                time  1800    Juneteenth is a beautiful and proud celebration of freedom for Black  Americans. It marks the day, 2 years after President Lincoln issued the  Emancipation Proclamation, when Major General Gordon Granger and Union  soldiers delivered the news of liberation in Galveston, Texas, not far  from the district the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee)  represents.   That day, General Granger conveyed the declaration that all are free  with ``an absolute equality of rights and rights of property.''   I know that Texas' special place in our Nation's history is cherished  by its delegation, especially, as I mentioned, the Chair,  Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, representing Houston. Thank you for  being the author of the legislation, the House companion of S. 475.   Thank you to the Congressional Black Caucus and its distinguished  chair, Congresswoman Joyce Beatty from Ohio, and the Texas delegation  and all Members who have worked for this official recognition over many  years, including Representative   Danny Davis. Thank you, also, to  Committee on Oversight and Reform chair, Carolyn Maloney.   We salute Senators Ed Markey and John Cornyn, leading in the Senate,  and congratulate them on yesterday's passage of S. 475 without  objection.   And let me salute the activists and leaders who carried this fight to  this day, including the late Dr. Ronald Myers. For decades, until his  passing, Doc Myers led the campaign to make Juneteenth a national day  of observance.   Over the past century and a half, Juneteenth has evolved into a day  not only of celebration but of reflection. This day reminds us of a  history much stained by brutality and injustice, and it reminds us of  our responsibility to build a future of progress for all, honoring the  ideal of equality that is America's heritage and America's hope.   I feel very honored to be here with the Congressional Black Caucus,  as I mentioned already, to speak on behalf of this legislation. I thank  them for making this day possible. I also had the honor of traveling  with them to Ghana almost 2 years ago at the end of July as we observed  the 400th anniversary of the first slaves coming to America.   John Lewis was with us on that trip to go to the Door of No Return,  which is now the Door of Return, as it urges people to come back.  Almost 402 years ago, the first slaves were pushed from Africa into  dungeons, which were deadly, and onto slave ships, which were death  ships, to come across the ocean to a place where they would be enslaved  for hundreds of years.   It challenges the conscience of the world, and certainly of America,  to even think about what happened to people in our country over that  period of time. But to be there with the Congressional Black Caucus was  a very, very special honor, and to see the connection between that Door  of No Return and Ghana and the connection to our Members of Congress on  the floor of this House today serving with such dignity and pride.   Madam Speaker, we know that the fight against racism and toward  equality has far to go, but it is a fight that continues with a renewed  sense of urgency all the time, now sparked by the murder of George  Floyd and so many others.   We salute Congresswoman Karen Bass as she continues negotiations on  the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which now must become law.   As we fight for its passage, the Democratic House remains committed  to real, effective action to advance justice, fairness, and opportunity  for all. That is the purpose of our Congressional Black Caucus in this  Congress. The Congressional Black Caucus is the conscience of the House  of Representatives.   Madam Speaker, I urge a bipartisan vote on this important legislation  and thank all Members who have led this effort which strengthens  America.   I hope we can have, again, a strong bipartisan vote.
