 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman for yielding time  to me, the chairman of Financial Services, Mr. Hensarling. I appreciate  his leadership and stewardship on our committee.   Mr. Speaker, I want to get into the bill in a second, but I can't let  the Dominican Sisters reference go.   It is not the Dominican Sisters who are using proxy advisers. It is  the largest financial investors in the world that are using these  advisers, which we are going to get into in a little bit.   And if you want to talk about sisters, I will talk about the Little  Sisters of the Poor, who have been ravaged by ObamaCare because they  can't practice their faith, if you want to talk about sisters. We are  not going to go there today.   Mr. Speaker, we are in a situation where, my friends, if you listen  to the debate, you might say, ``Well, Republicans are asking for a  little more regulation in the proxy advisory space,'' and Democrats,  miraculously, are saying, ``We don't want any regulation.''   Well, our concern is that you have consolidated power in two  companies that control 97 percent of the industry, and some have made  the claim and the allegation that there might be political motivations  behind both--or at least one--of these massive proxy advisory firms,  because Glass Lewis is owned by the Ontario Teachers' Pension fund, and  they might have a political agenda that might affect the  recommendations that have a massive impact on American corporate  governance. Maybe that could be the distinction between the two parties  in today's debate.   Mr. Speaker, we have covered this quite a bit, but I want to go into  it again. The role of proxy advisory firms in the U.S. economy is  incredibly important. It is important stuff.   These firms counsel pension plans and mutual funds and institutional  investors on how to vote their shares. No one is trying to get rid of  proxy advisory firms. We think they are a good thing, but we think they  should have a little bit of regulation and a little bit of oversight.   I think it is troubling, when you look at the share of institutional  ownership, in 1987, it was 46 percent. Today, that has grown to 75  percent, meaning that institutional investors control billions of  shares.   There was a recent study that was done by Stanford that says that  asset managers with $100 billion or more under their control only make  10 percent of the decisions on these proxy issues, meaning they  outsource 90 percent of the decisions to one of two firms,  consolidating great power in these proxy advisory firms.   This was pointed out before as well, but, again, two firms, 97  percent of the market share, writing analysis reports, voting  recommendations that affect the fundamentals of corporate governance,  mergers, acquisitions, approval of corporate directors, and shareholder  proposals.   What is of greatest concern is that these firms are not free of  conflicts of interest. For example, in addition to providing  recommendations to institutional investors about how to vote, proxy  advisory firms may advise companies about corporate governance issues,  rate companies on corporate governance, help companies improve those  ratings, and advise proponents about how to frame a proposal to get the  most votes. They are playing every side of the issue. They are getting  every dollar from anybody who cares about the corporate governance  space. They play everybody. And if you want access, you pay.   I am going to give you an example in just a little bit of one of the  hundreds of letters that I have received on this issue. But before I do  that, I think it is important to say: What are we asking for? What is  the radical idea that we brought to the floor today, which, by the way,  had six Democrats' support?    Mr. Scott commented about his support as well, and I know he had an  issue about the cost that this would have on proxy advisory firms; but  the CBO, which I rarely quote, did a study on this and said the cost to  proxy advisory firms of this bill is minimal, if  [[Page H10323]]  anything. I think his concern might be misplaced.   But what are we asking to do here? We are asking for accountability.  We are asking for transparency, responsiveness, and competition in the  proxy advisory space. By doing that, we will improve corporate  governance, and, in the end, we are going to protect investors.   Specifically, again, this bipartisan bill will ensure that proxy  advisory firms are registered with the SEC. They will disclose  potential conflicts of interest. They will maintain a code of ethics  and make publicly available their methodologies for formulating their  proxy recommendations.    Mr. Speaker, I don't know what my friends across the aisle  have about maintaining a code of ethics or disclosing potential  conflicts of interest or instituting an ombudsman to resolve issues  that might come up. This is commonsense stuff. This is good governance,  and I would encourage all of my friends across the aisle to join us.   Mr. Speaker, I want to read one part of a letter that I received that  I think embodies what is going on in corporate America.                                time  1400    I am not going to give the name of the company, but it says:         Upon contacting ISS and seeking explanation on one of the       recommendations, we were told there was a firewall between       the ISS recommendation group and the ISS group that deals       with corporate matters. Ultimately, we were advised that if       we were willing to join ISS, which includes payment of a       relatively substantial amount of money, we could have input       in the recommendations before they were made.    So, Mr. Speaker, pay for the input.    Mr. Speaker, it goes on to say:         Meanwhile, during our latest discussions we were again       advised that we could avoid some issues by subscribing to ISS       corporate services and thereby have some input before such       recommendations are published.    Mr. Speaker, of course, such a subscription would entail big payouts.   It goes on to say:         On the one hand, ISS makes wholly unsupportable,       unreasonable, and irrational recommendations regarding       corporate elections without investigation, regulatory       support, or even contact with the victim company. While, on       the other hand, seeking fees from the victim company for the       privilege of influencing ISS's recommendations.    Mr. Speaker, so what you have here is you have the mafia on the  streets. So, lo and behold, your little shop on the street corner gets  burglarized at 10 o'clock one night and at 8 o'clock in the morning,  and lo and behold, the thugs come in and say: Do you want to buy some  insurance? Do you want to buy some protection? Pay up. We will keep you  safe. ISS, Glass Lewis, you pay up, and we can help you with your  recommendation. We can help you with your ratings.   Mr. Speaker, this is thuggery.   Let's have a little commonsense oversight in this space. It is a good  bill.
