 Madam President, I reserve the right to object.   I want to start out by mentioning the great respect I have for  Senator Reed. I am deeply grateful for the chairman's service to this  country, both the service in uniform and as chairman of the Armed  Service Committee, of which I am a member.   I believe the chairman and I agree on a lot more than we disagree on,  but I take exception to several things that have been said about me by  Democratic Members of the Senate.   Every day this week, the majority leader has come to the floor and  attacked me by name. It is not very often the majority leader of the  Senate attacks a Senator by name 3 days in a row.   Now, in my former profession, I have been called everything so it  really doesn't bother me too much, but the majority leader has also  tweeted about me. That is good.   So let's get the record straight as we speak.   Right now, I want to talk about what I have done and what I am doing.  First of all, I am not blocking anyone from being confirmed or  promoted. Every single one of these nominees can receive a vote if  Senator Schumer wants it. In fact, one of the civilian nominees is  getting voted on this week. If Democrats are so worried about these  nominations, let's vote. If we are not going to vote on taxpayer-funded  abortion, then let's vote on these nominees. Voting is our job. It is  not much to ask of the U.S. Senate to do our job, to vote.   Senator Schumer and some of the other Senators have claimed that my  hold on these nominees is unprecedented.   Well, it is not. My hold is far from unprecedented. In fact, Senator  Bennet himself threatened to do this exact same thing just a few months  ago. Why? Because the Air Force planned to move Space Command from  Colorado to Huntsville, AL. We have talked about this recently. Two  years ago, we had a Senator from Illinois put a hold on 1,000 nominees  over the promotion of one single officer. So far, my hold has affected  184 nominations.    I also will note that these Senators haven't said a word about our  recruiting crisis that we have going on as we speak. Democrats are in a  panic about 184 promotions for generals and officers, and yet I have  not heard a word from them about the 15,000 enlisted soldiers we are  missing right now from last year's recruiting class. That is an entire  division.   There is another 8,600 who were discharged over the President's  vaccine mandate--kicked out. I don't hear a word about that from the  Democrats.   The military is down 23,000 enlisted soldiers due to the actions  taken by the Biden administration and his Secretary of Defense just  this past year. Yet Democrats are worried about 184 generals getting  their promotion? Only one of those things threatens our security. It is  not officer promotion.   When my dad was serving in World War II, we had one general for every  6,000 enlisted soldiers--one. Today, we have got one general for every  1,500. We do not suffer from a lack of generals in this country. We  suffer from a lack of recruits. Military experts have known for a long  time that the Pentagon is top-heavy.   This entire line of attack on me is absolutely false. The generals'  jobs are being done. Yet 23,000 enlisted troops that we are missing,  their jobs are not being done.   My Democrat friends keep saying abortion is necessary for readiness,  but I have yet to hear a shred of evidence to back that up. I have been  asking for months. Yet again, my Democrat friends have absolutely zero  evidence to show abortion makes our troops safer, stronger, or more  lethal.   And let's be clear about what we are talking about. We are not  talking about access to abortion. We are talking about taxpayers  funding for travel and extra paid time to get elective abortions.   We already have a policy. We already have a policy in the Army about  abortion, and it has worked fine. But this policy includes spouses and  dependents. We are talking about taxpayer funding for somebody's kid to  get an abortion  [[Page S1039]]  in another State. This has never been in the policy until now, because  Congress has ensured that the Pentagon cannot perform or facilitate  abortions except in legal circumstances, and limited.   This morning, I received an email from a soldier's mom in Alabama.  She said her son has had to pay thousands of dollars out of his own  pocket to buy uniforms and bedsheets. She said it is absurd to force  taxpayers to pay for travel for abortions while our troops--our  troops--are paying out of pocket for their uniforms. She is right. She  is exactly right.   And that is what this is all about. Earlier today. Senator Schumer  said this is about women making their own choices. That is not true.  That is exactly not true. This is about taxpayer funding. That is what  we are talking about. We have strict limits on taxpayer funding for  abortions in this country. That has gone through this building right  here. There has been a bipartisan consensus for 40 years. Yet, all of a  sudden, Democrats are saying the military can't win wars without  expanded abortion. It doesn't make sense.   Frankly, we already have policies for abortion in the military. Over  the last 5 years, there have been about 20 abortions a year performed  in the military. These have been in cases of rape, incest, and threat  to the life of the mom. Over the 40 years, I don't recall the military  ever once complaining that we weren't performing enough abortions. Not  one time have I heard that--not one time.   According to one report cited by the Pentagon officials to my staff,  the new policy would expand taxpayer-funded abortions from 20 abortions  a year to 4,000--4,000. And who is going to pay for that? The people in  this country are going to pay for it.   This goes beyond the law without anybody taking a vote here in this  building.   We were elected to pass laws. We were elected to do our job. The  Department of Defense wasn't elected. They were appointed.   In fact, this contradicts what Congress has actually voted for. This  includes some of the people complaining the loudest. Earlier this week,  37 Democratic Senators went on record in asking for the Department of  Defense to go beyond the laws that they themselves have voted for. Now,  in fairness, I would note that the chairman and Senator Schumer were  not on that list of 37 Senators.   But the idea that more abortions make our troops safer and more  lethal is absurd.   This has been a coordinated campaign to pressure me to lift these  holds. That doesn't bother me one bit, and it is not going to work.  Frankly, it is just going to make me do the opposite.   I am glad the majority leader is taking notes on these holds. If  Democrats want to expand taxpayer funding for abortion, then let's vote  on it. I am ready to vote on it. The majority leader, the last time I  looked, controls this floor. He can make it happen. And if these  nominees are so important, then we can vote on them too.   So far this year, the Senate has already taken 24 days off. This is  in addition to the 2-week recess in January and the 2-week recess which  starts at the end of this week. I have only been here for 2 years, but  I am told this is one of the slowest years in memory around here. I  don't have anything to compare it to. Sometimes, we don't even vote  until 5:30 on a Tuesday. People back home don't work those kind of  hours, but they are expected to pay for what we are talking about.   Yet the Democrats are in a panic over the idea of taking more votes.  I don't mind working full weeks. I worked all my life. I had a full- time job. I will stay here until hell freezes over. I am not going to  be intimidated by a campaign of selective outrage.   Let me remind the chairman that I gave the Pentagon fair warning. I  gave them fair warning. They chose to go forward with this policy.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  this letter I sent to Secretary Austin on December 9, 2022.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                   December 9, 2022.      Hon. Lloyd J. Austin III,      U.S. Department of Defense,      Washington DC.        Secretary Austin: Your October 20, 2022 memo directing the       Department of Defense to explore increasing access to       reproductive health care will have broad ramifications for       the department's readiness, manpower, and budget. On       Wednesday, December 7, my staff received a brief from the       (acting) Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs       and learned that you plan to implement these changes by       year's end. The brief also revealed estimates of how your       plan will expand the number of abortions subsidized by the       DoD. The estimates are as exponential as they are immoral.        The department's authorities to provide for or fund       abortions are governed by 10 U.S.C. Sec. 1093 which limits       these to cases of rape, incest, or pregnancies that threaten       the life of the mother. For years, the department has       averaged less than 20 abortions per year. The brief revealed       the policy intentions put forth in your October 20 memo,       ``Ensuring Access to Reproductive Health Care,'' would       increase DoD-subsidized abortions by as much as 4,100 per       year. That estimate does not include dependents, which your       policy also intends to cover, who might seek assistance in       obtaining an abortion.        This vast expansion of DoD-subsidized abortions is made       worse by how your plan will provide unrestricted access to       abortion. As six states and the District of Columbia have no       abortion restrictions, your policy would force taxpayers to       finance access to abortions without protections other states       have duly enacted such as waiting periods and prohibitions on       late-term abortions. Like me, many Americans find such       abortions morally repugnant.        When questioned on these issues, the department could not       provide analysis or estimates of how this policy change will       impact its budget, readiness, and manpower. It is       irresponsible to push forward with such a controversial       change to department policy without thorough due diligence on       how this will impact the readiness of the force.        Lastly, it is my conviction that this proposed policy       change is illegal, circumvents Congress, and exceeds your       authority. Should you implement these proposed changes to the       department's abortion policies, I will place a hold on all       future DoD civilian and general/flag officer nominations.            Sincerely,                                                  Tommy Tuberville,                                             United States Senator.     Now, I didn't want to do this, and I told the  Department of Defense that. I told the people who were in charge of all  the nominations.   This was the Biden administration's choice, and I am going to keep my  word. And because of that, I object.
