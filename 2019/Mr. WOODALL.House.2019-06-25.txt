 Mr. Speaker, I have the honor of hosting the guest  chaplain today, and I believe you were feeling his words that we are  all going to be held to account at the end, as you recall, in that vote  series there. Those are powerful words, and it is not just something he  shares in Congress today; it is something he shares with our entire  community.   If you recognized his voice in that prayer, Mr. Speaker, it is  because he is the host of the Touching Lives Ministry. It can be seen  in all 50 States and around the world.   He has his lovely bride of more than four decades, Teresa, with him  here in the gallery, and he leads back in my home State, Mr. Speaker,  Cross Pointe Church in Duluth.   He left First Baptist Church Snellville and was called to plant a new  congregation. It is a powerful ministry, not just with the Word, but  with what the Word tells us we should do in deed, and it is lived out  there every day.    From 2000 to 2002, Mr. Speaker, he was the president of the Southern  Baptist Convention. I told the gentleman earlier that, if he can handle  church politics, he can certainly handle the politics that we are  involved in here.   But the honor for me, because I have such deep respect for all of my  colleagues here, is to share a little bit of back home with each one of  you.   Dr. Merritt embodies the Seventh Congressional District values of  faith and family and duty, and I am grateful to him, not just for his  prayers in ministry to me, not just for his prayers in ministry to our  community, but to the entire Nation and to the world.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend on the Rules Committee  for yielding.   I love coming down to the House floor during Rules Committee time,  Mr. Speaker. It is kind of a one-on-one relationship we have with the  gentleman in that chair. It is a one-on-one relationship with our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle.   Candidly, I like the members of the Rules Committee. We have men and  women up there who fight hard on absolutely everything every day, not  because they are trying to be obstinate, but because they really  believe in what they are doing.   When my friend from Massachusetts said earlier he takes a backseat to  no one when it comes to standing up for children, I believe that is  absolutely true.                                time  1815    But the ranking member, the gentleman from Oklahoma, also takes a  backseat to no one. I have seen him and his leadership as chair of the  Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee last year. He was taking slings and arrows from all sides,  fighting the Republicans, fighting the Democrats, fighting Northerners,  Southerners, all folks of all stripes, trying to do the right thing for  the right reasons.   My friend from Massachusetts says that the administration is using  children for political theater. This isn't a Republican or Democrat  problem. This is a House problem we are having.   The Senate, Republicans and Democrats, came together nearly  unanimously to move a bill that we could send to the White House today  that would fund the problems that the gentleman from Massachusetts  referenced immediately, the funding shortfalls immediately, the  problems in staffing immediately, and the problems in counseling  immediately.   Instead, as the gentleman from Oklahoma pointed out, we tried to move  a bill last night at midnight. It fell apart because the Democratic  Caucus didn't have enough votes to move it, and in the last 12 hours,  instead of coming to Republicans to try to find a bipartisan pathway  forward, the Democratic Caucus has been largely insular looking for a  pathway to follow alone.   My friend from Massachusetts is 100 percent right. This is an issue  that should not be used to score partisan points. It should not be used  for political theater. It is an opportunity, one among many, but  perhaps the most important for us to come together and unite around  things that every man and woman in this Chamber believes in, and that  is serving our fellow man.   As the gentleman from Oklahoma said, we can start that road towards  conference with the passage of this bill tonight. But if we reject this  bill and bring up the Senate bill, we don't have to start the pathway  towards conference. We can start the pathway towards progress, towards  solution. We can end the talk and begin the action. I think that is  what every Member of this Chamber wants to do, and I hope they will  take yes for an answer.
