 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of  Dr. Joaquin Gonzalez Cigarroa.   Dr. Cigarroa was born in San Antonio but soon moved with his family  to Laredo, Texas. From an early age, he knew that medicine was going to  be his calling and devoted himself to academics.   He graduated as valedictorian from his class at Martin High School,  then went off to attend the University of Texas and then Harvard  Medical School, where he received his medical degree. He was the first  Harvard University medical student from the Texas-Mexico border.   After graduating, Dr. Cigarroa served his country as a first  lieutenant with the U.S. Army Medical Corps before returning to Laredo  and practicing medicine.   Dr. Cigarroa made a dramatic impact on education, not only in Laredo  but across the State of Texas, and also in healthcare.   He will be fondly remembered for his commitment to education,  healthcare, and a career that changed the way of life for so many  people.   Dr. Cigarroa is survived by his wife, Barbara Judith Raymond Flores;  their children: Patricia, Barbara, Francisco, Ricardo, Jorge, Carlos,  Gabriella, Joaquin, Maria-Elena, and Marisa--10 children; and, again,  by so many grandchildren and so many great-grandchildren.   Madam Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to honor the life of  Dr. Joaquin Cigarroa.                            ____________________
