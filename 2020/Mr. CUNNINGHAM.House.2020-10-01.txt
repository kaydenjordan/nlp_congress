 Mr. Speaker, when I came to Washington, I promised  that I would help to champion legislation that would make this planet a  better place for future generations, and that is why I am proud the ACE  Act will be signed into law.   The ACE Act is a bipartisan sportsmen's package that ensures that we  leave this planet in better shape than we found it.   The ACE Act serves as a thank-you to the outdoor enthusiasts of South  Carolina's First District, and the millions like them across the United  States, by providing reauthorizations for vital conservation programs.  The Lowcountry's hunters and anglers are some of the strongest stewards  of our natural resources, and this bill is a promise that this  partnership will continue for generations.   I want to thank Representative   Mike Thompson for his leadership. I  look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to get the ACE Act past the House and signed into law.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise the heroic  actions of Heidi Drees, a Jefferson Award winner.   On July 1, 2020, Heidi saved the life of a wounded Charleston County  deputy, Mike Costanzo, after deciding to stop when she saw a crumbled  human on the ground. Not only did she pull over to report and update  details of the accident to 911, Heidi did what any courageous and  kindhearted person would do; she comforted Deputy Costanzo in his dire  time of need. Heidi held his hand, kept him alert, and she did not  leave his side until medical professionals arrived on the scene.   Heidi and Mike have mutually agreed that they are connected for the  rest of their lives, and Heidi knows that it was a higher power that  put her there on that day.   I rise today to honor Heidi with the hope that she may be an  inspiration to us all if we find ourselves in similar situations.                            ____________________
