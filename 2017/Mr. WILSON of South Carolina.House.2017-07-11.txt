 Mr. Speaker, President Donald Trump's  success during his overseas trip to Poland and the G20 summit in  Germany makes it clear that America is once again the clear leader of  the free world.   In Poland, the President reaffirmed that Western nations will stand  together against threats to our security and our way of life. His  remarks focused on his strategy of peace through strength--increasing  defense spending, confirming our commitment to NATO, and promoting  American energy as an alternative to Russian sources in Eastern Europe.   During the G20, President Trump made it clear that, under his  leadership, America remains committed to blocking the funding of  terrorism and extremism, empowering women across the world, affirming  the right of nations to defend themselves, and pledging to end unfair  trade. Additionally, working with other foreign leaders, he  successfully negotiated a cease-fire in Syria.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism. Sadly, Canada has  forgotten the 26 Canadians murdered on 9/11 by awarding millions of  dollars to a confessed terrorist who killed U.S. Army Sergeant First  Class Christopher Speer, putting American families and Canadian  families at risk.                            ____________________
