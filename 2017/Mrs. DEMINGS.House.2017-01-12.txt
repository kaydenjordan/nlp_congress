 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand against the plan to  repeal the Affordable Care Act.   I believe my job as a Member of Congress is to work every day to  improve the quality of life for all Americans. If my colleagues and I  are going to do our job, access to affordable, quality health care is  the very foundation of that.   We know for a fact that the Affordable Care Act is working. Repealing  it would put millions at risk of losing access to health care in a  country that I know is the greatest. I ask today: Which family should  not have access to quality health care?   Repealing the ACA would also have a crippling effect on our economy.  Jobs will be lost. My State, Florida, is one that will be hit the  hardest. Almost 181,000 Floridians would be at risk of losing their  jobs almost immediately if the ACA were to be repealed.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to think long and hard about the  people and work to strengthen and not repeal the Affordable Care Act.                            ____________________
