 Mr. Speaker, I, too, am a person with preexisting  conditions, and I believe it is not just something that I should do; it  is a responsibility for me to be the staunchest advocate for people out  there who have preexisting conditions. That is why I am such an ardent  supporter of this bill.   I think every American and every person out there with preexisting  conditions should be asking themselves: How is it that they have  coverage if every single insurance provider has pulled out of the  market? If there is no entity to go to out there and provide insurance,  how is it that preexisting conditions could possibly be covered?   I have had the question constantly: How is it so difficult for  Republicans to get this bill passed, to get this through the floor? The  answer is this, and this is again the question that every American  should be asking themselves: Who is going out there and saying that  preexisting conditions won't be covered? It is the exact same group of  people that went out there and lied to the face of every single  American, telling them that if they liked their plan, they would keep  their plan; if they liked their doctor, they would keep their doctor;  that the average American family was going to save $2,500 or more on  health insurance.   That was a bold-faced lie. It was orchestrated by architects who  specifically went out with the intention to prey on the American  people. That is who is going out there selling these lies against my  party. I resent that completely because we have come up with a plan,  with a strategy to go out there and save health care for the American  people, and I couldn't be more proud of that.
