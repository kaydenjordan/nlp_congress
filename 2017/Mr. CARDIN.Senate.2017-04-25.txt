 Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination  of Rod J. Rosenstein to be the Deputy Attorney General of the United  States at the Justice Department. Rod has served the people of Maryland  extraordinarily well since 2005 as the U.S. attorney for the District  of Maryland. I am pleased to support his nomination, and I hope the  Senate will confirm him in very short order.   I might point out that he received a favorable recommendation from  the Judiciary Committee by a lopsided vote of 19-to-1.   Rod Rosenstein is the total package. He has committed his life to  public service. Rod graduated from the Wharton School of the University  of Pennsylvania with a B.S. in economics, summa cum laude, in 1986. He  earned his J.D. degree from Harvard Law School in 1989, where he was  the editor of the Harvard Law Review. He then served as a law clerk to  Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District  of Columbia Circuit. After finishing his clerkship in 1990, he became a  trial attorney in the Public Integrity Section of the Criminal Division  of the Department of Justice. He has remained at the Justice Department  for his entire career.   Mr. Rosenstein has devoted his life to public service. In Maryland,  Rod was appointed in 2005 by President Bush and then held over by  President Obama, with the strong support of his two home State  Senators, which include myself and the senior Senator at that time,  Senator Barbara Mikulski. Rod has now become the longest serving U.S.  attorney in the country today.   I really want to underscore that point. I know my colleagues know the  prerogatives we have when we come into office and there is an opening  at the U.S. attorney's office because of an election of a President  from your own party where the previous U.S. attorney was appointed by  the other party. In this case, it was a Republican who appointed Mr.  Rosenstein. President Obama came into office, and the senior Senator  and junior Senator had the opportunity to replace that U.S. attorney,  which has been the tradition in the Senate. Senator Mikulski and I had  no hesitation when asking Mr. Rosenstein to remain on as the U.S.  attorney in Maryland. We did that because we knew how valuable he was  for law enforcement in our State.   As U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland, Rod has garnered broad  bipartisan support from the State and local law enforcement officials  across our great State as he has tackled problems of crime, terrorism,  drug trafficking, gun and gang violence, civil rights enforcement,  environmental crimes, intellectual property fraud, and corruption. I  just mentioned a couple of those.   I sat down with the U.S. attorney to talk about gang violence in our  State because I had been to Central America and I saw the exporting of  gang violence from Central America to Maryland. The U.S. attorney, Mr.  Rosenstein, and I had a chance to talk about  [[Page S2512]]  the strategies we would use in Maryland to combat that. But he didn't  just work by himself at the U.S. attorney level; he worked with local  law enforcement to make sure we had a team approach.   In terms of his pro bono work, Rod wrote in his Judiciary Committee  questionnaire:         My entire legal career has been devoted to public service,       and much of my work directly benefits disadvantaged persons.       In addition to my official duties and public speaking, I have       taught without compensation at area law schools, served as a       judge at law school moot court and mock trial competitions,       and counseled other lawyers who have devoted some or all of       their career to public service.    He has truly been a model for many others in public service, a real  role model.   Let me share a few examples with my colleagues of how State and local  officials in Maryland have viewed Rod's work over the past decade. Let  me begin with the city of Baltimore, which has just entered into a  consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice to reform its police  practices after the death of Freddie Gray in custody 2 years ago.   Baltimore police commissioner Kevin Davis wrote:         Mr. Rosenstein and the Baltimore Police Department have       collaborated on numerous large-scale investigations and       resulting indictments of violent criminal organizations       operating in Baltimore City. Under Mr. Rosenstein's       leadership, the U.S. Attorney's Office and its prosecutors       operate with the highest sense of justice and integrity in       the course of these investigations and trials.    Commissioner Davis continues:         It is undeniable that Baltimore City is a safer place as a       result of Mr. Rosenstein's tenure as U.S. Attorney. Through       our professional collaborations, I have come to know Mr.       Rosenstein on a personal basis as well. Mr. Rosenstein is a       man of utmost character and intellect.    Former State's attorney for Baltimore City, Gregg Bernstein, a  Democrat, wrote:         Simply stated, Rod was a terrific partner. Even a cursory       review of his body of work as the United States Attorney for       the District of Maryland makes readily apparent that Rod was       committed to reducing the level of violent crime in       Baltimore. His commitment and effort trickled down to other       law enforcement agencies as well, including the Baltimore       City State's Attorney's Office.        In Rod, we saw a person who was not interested in personal       credit or accolade, but instead, one who created an       atmosphere of collaboration that had not been seen in       Baltimore for some time. It was much more important to him       that everyone was working as hard as they could to fight       crime in the City and the rest of Maryland.    Mr. Bernstein continues:         As a result of his tireless efforts, Rod helped to reduce       the homicide rate in Baltimore to historically low levels not       seen in decades. He also was responsible for supervising a       United States Attorney's Office that was able to dismantle       many of the gangs in Baltimore that were responsible for much       of the illegal drug trade and violence that have plagued the       City. He has earned the universal respect and admiration of       not only his colleagues in the United States Attorney's       Office, but other law enforcement agencies, and a debt of       gratitude from the public that has greatly appreciated his       work to make Baltimore a safer place to live and work.    State and local elected prosecutors of both political parties in  Maryland have also weighed in in support of Mr. Rosenstein's  nomination. Scott Shellenberger, the Baltimore County State's attorney,  wrote on behalf of the Maryland State's Attorneys' Association:         Rod has been an outstanding partner with every local       prosecutor in the State of Maryland. Whether it is partnering       with prosecutors in the City of Baltimore to stem gun       violence, to the prosecution of prison gang corruption both       in the city and in rural counties . . . Rod has always been       there for law enforcement. When prosecutors in this State ask       Rod for assistance, he does not care if you are a ``D'' or an       ``R,'' he has only cared about making this State a safer       place. Rod makes his decisions based on the law, the       evidence, logic and reasons, never allowing emotion or       passion to move him from his core mission.    I have full confidence that Rod will call it like he sees it without  regard to partisan or political considerations and that he will  continue to uphold his oath to support and defend the Constitution and  laws of the United States.   I must tell you that I have heard from State and local officials  directly who have worked with Rod on political corruption cases and  thanked Rod for the manner in which he collaboratively worked to root  out corruption and misconduct by State and local officials in Maryland.  As you can imagine, State and local officials do not always welcome  Federal investigations or prosecutions into their domain, so this  really speaks volumes about Rod as a prosecutor and a person and his  ability to get along and accomplish results.   Former Maryland attorney general Doug Gansler wrote:         I have always found [Rod] to be totally by-the-book and       completely apolitical. Rod understands the importance of       staying out of the political limelight. The fact that I am a       Democrat who served in elected office for 16 years and that       Rod was appointed by a Republican President never was       mentioned. He makes decisions for the right reasons and       articulates those reasons with aplomb. . . . Rod is and       always has been extremely ethical and conscientious,       qualities which have earned him the respect of his peers and       colleagues.    As Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein would basically serve as  the chief operating officer at the Justice Department and manage the  daily operations of the Nation's largest firm. The Department of  Justice is a sprawling Cabinet Department with more than 100,000  employees and a $28 billion budget. That is a pretty big undertaking.  It is good to know that a person of his reputation has shown that he  will not yield to partisan pressure but do what is right. It is good to  know that we have that type of person whom we can confirm as the Deputy  Attorney General. That is why it is so important that we have an  effective manager and leader.   Maryland attorney general Brian Frosh, a Democrat, wrote:         I have found [Rod] to be intelligent, principled, and fair.       As U.S. Attorney, Mr. Rosenstein has been an exemplary       leader. He inherited an office that was in turmoil. With a       steady hand and superb management, he has built it into an       institution that is universally respected in our state. He       has been able to recruit and retain extremely talented       attorneys, investigators and staff, and the office has been       effective and successful in carrying out its mission.    I expect Rod to exercise the same management style as the Deputy  Attorney General overseeing the dozens of divisions, offices, and  agencies at the Department of Justice. He will use that same commitment  that he used as the U.S. attorney for the State of Maryland.   Lastly, let me quote from former Deputy Attorney General James Cole,  who served in President Obama's administration under Attorney General  Holder. I know Mr. Cole well. He was the special counsel during the  House ethics investigation of former Speaker Newt Gingrich, which  committee I was on. Mr. Cole supports Mr. Rosenstein's nomination. Mr.  Cole writes:         Rod brings with him the knowledge, skill, experience, and       wisdom that is required for this job. He also brings an       understanding of, and respect for, the important role the       Department of Justice occupies in our government--the need       for it to not only enforce the laws, but to also maintain a       level of independence that enables it to have credibility in       the eyes of our citizens. Rod will make an excellent Deputy       Attorney General. . . . Even at an earlier age, he exhibited       the sound judgment and careful thought that was necessary to       handle the very sensitive public corruption cases that were       prosecuted by the [Public Integrity Section of the Criminal       Division].    That is Mr. Cole. Mr. Cole was a former Deputy Attorney General, and  he understands this role very well and understands Mr. Rosenstein is  uniquely qualified to hold this position.   I want to conclude by urging my colleagues to support Mr.  Rosenstein's nomination.   I especially thank Rod's family for their contribution to public  service as well. As we know, we can't do this without a supportive  family, and this service comes at a steep price in terms of time spent  doing public service and sacrifices made by his family. I thank his  wife Lisa and his daughters, Julie and Allison, for being willing to  share their husband and father with our country.   I urge the Senate to confirm Mr. Rosenstein's nomination to be the  next Deputy Attorney General of the United States at the Justice  Department.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.    Mr. President, today I wish to ask my Senate colleagues  to join me in designating April 2017 as National Congenital  Diaphragmatic Hernia Awareness Month. Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia,  also known as CDH, is a birth defect that occurs when the fetal  diaphragm fails to fully develop, allowing abdominal organs to move  into the chest cavity and preventing lung growth. When the lungs do not  develop properly during pregnancy, it can be difficult for the baby to  breathe after birth, or the baby is unable to take in enough oxygen to  stay healthy. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a birth defect that  occurs in 1 out of every 2,500 live births worldwide. Only about 50  percent of CDH cases are diagnosed in utero. The Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention, CDC, estimates that CDH affects 1,600 babies in  the U.S. each year. Every 10 minutes, a baby is born with CDH, adding  up to more than 700,000 babies with CDH since 2000. According to the  CDC, babies born with CDH experience a high mortality rate ranging from  20 to 60 percent, depending on the severity of the defect and the  treatments available at delivery; yet most people have never heard of  CDH.   Researchers are making great progress to determine the cause of this  birth defect and to identify optimal treatment methods. In fiscal year  2017, the National Institutes of Health funded approximately $4 million  in CDH research, an increase of $700,000 from fiscal year 2015. There  is still much progress to be made, however. The cause of CDH remains  unknown, and there currently is no cure. CDH survivors often endure  long-term complications, such as congenital heart defects and  developmental delays, and the average CDH survivor will face postnatal  care of more than $100,000.   Last month, members from the Association of Congenital Diaphragmatic  Hernia Research, Awareness and Support, also known as CHERUBS, visited  my office. Among them were David and Allison Finger and their daughter  Vivienne from Hyattsville, MD. Vivienne was born with CDH and had to  spend 60 days in the newborn intensive care unit after birth and had to  have surgery to repair the hernia when she was only 3 weeks old. On  March 18, 2017, Vivienne celebrated her second birthday and is doing  very well. Babies like Vivienne, born with CDH, today have a better  chance of survival due to early detection and research on treatment  options.  [[Page S2536]]    For these reasons, I am proud my colleague the junior Senator from  Alabama, Mr. Strange, has joined me in submitting a resolution  designating April 2017 as National Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia  Awareness Month. In previous years, I was pleased to work with his  predecessor, Senator Sessions, on this resolution. Designating this  month in this fashion provides an opportunity to raise public awareness  about CDH; promote quality prenatal care and ultrasounds to detect CDH  in utero; and support finding for the research necessary to improve  screening and treatment of CDH, discover the causes of CDH, and develop  a cure for CDH.
