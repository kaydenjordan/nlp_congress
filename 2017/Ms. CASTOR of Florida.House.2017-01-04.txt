 I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Republicans' Midnight  Rules Relief Act.   The bill is an unnecessary abdication of legislative responsibility  by the Republican-led Congress, and it is very poor public policy. The  bill short-circuits open debate and public participation. It is also  very wasteful because it jettisons carefully and long-crafted policies  that protect American families from threats to their economic security,  their health, and their safety.   Under the U.S. Constitution, after Congress passes a law, agencies  craft rules to implement that legislation. If Members of Congress want  to clarify or change executive branch regulations, they have a  responsibility to address the matter in a transparent way and through  open, regular order. Republicans don't want to do that, however,  [[Page H80]]  because the public might find out what they are doing.   This Republican scheme sets a dangerous precedent by expanding the  ability of the Congress to use the Congressional Review Act to  disapprove hundreds of carefully crafted policies at one time and with  very little notice or debate. Republicans want to reach back to last  May and cherry-pick policies that they do not agree with.   But how will the public know?   That will be difficult; and, in many instances, Republicans do not  want the public to know.   I urge my colleagues to reject this power grab by the new Republican  Congress. It is just like what they tried to do yesterday with the  Office of Congressional Ethics. These policies don't just come out of  thin air. There is a long, painstaking process with extensive public  comment. Public participation doesn't appear to be a priority in this  new Congress, so reject this dark bill. Side, instead, with our  democratic principles in America, which include open debate,  transparency, fiscal responsibility, and the security of our neighbors.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at  the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?    I am opposed.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:        Ms. CASTOR of Florida moves to recommit the bill H.R. 21 to       the Committee on the Judiciary with instructions to report       the same back to the House forthwith with the following       amendment:         Add, at the end of the bill, the following:       SEC. 3. EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN RULES THAT PROHIBIT                     DISCRIMINATION BY INSURANCE ISSUERS ON THE                     BASIS OF GENDER OR PREEXISTING CONDITION OR                     THAT MAKE HEALTHCARE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR                     WORKING AMERICANS.         Nothing in this Act, or the amendments made by this Act,       shall apply in the case of any rule that pertains to the       prevention of--        (1) discrimination by health insurance issuers and group       health plans on the basis of preexisting conditions or       gender, including in the form of higher premiums for women or       loss of benefits such as mammograms, cervical cancer       screenings, prenatal care, and commonly prescribed       contraception; or        (2) higher premiums or out-of-pocket costs for seniors for       prescription drugs under prescription drug plans under the       Medicare program under part D of title XVIII of the Social       Security Act (42 2 U.S.C. 1395w-101 et seq.).    Mr. ISSA (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  to dispense with the reading.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from California?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from  Florida is recognized for 5 minutes in support of her motion.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to  the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If  adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as  amended.   My amendment provides an important safeguard for the economic  security of American families by maintaining the consumer-friendly  protections in the Affordable Care Act for, one, the cost-saving  provisions in Medicare of lower prescription drugs for our parents and  our grandparents; and, two, the vital consumer protection that  prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage because someone has  a preexisting condition like cancer, asthma, or diabetes.   The Affordable Care Act, which Republicans say they want to repeal  without a replacement bill in sight, provided these very important  consumer protections for all Americans not just for the 20 million  Americans who gained health insurance through the marketplace or  HealthCare.gov, but for the vast majority of Americans who are covered  through Medicare, which is about 43 million Americans, and for the  folks who have health insurance through their jobs, which is about 155  million Americans.                                time  1445    Here is what the Affordable Care Act has done for those folks: One,  Medicare is stronger. The Affordable Care Act strengthened the Medicare  fund, extending its life by over a decade. In addition, Medicare  enrollees have benefited from huge savings in prescription drug costs.  They have also saved through preventative screenings for breast and  colorectal cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes; that when they  go to the doctor's office now, there is no cost, there is no charge.  That is the Affordable Care Act.   So if Republicans aren't careful in their zeal to repeal the  Affordable Care Act, they, in essence, will be asking our parents and  grandparents to pay more, a whole lot more for their prescription  drugs.   Let me get a little local here. I represent the State of Florida  where about 18 percent of Floridians rely on Medicare for their health  care. Because of the Affordable Care Act, it has started to close the  doughnut hole. Repeal it now and that stops. That goes away. Just in  2015 alone, 350,000 Florida seniors saved $351 million on their  prescription drugs. That is an average of about $1,000 per beneficiary.  So my amendment makes the point that Democrats are going to fight for  our older neighbors to keep those savings intact, brought to you by the  Affordable Care Act.   Second, we also want to put everyone on notice that Democrats intend  to fight tooth and nail to keep the vital consumer protection, one of  the bedrocks of the Affordable Care Act, that bars health insurance  companies from refusing to cover you or charge you more because you  have a preexisting condition or charge women more than men.   Whether you know it or not, all Americans have benefited from the bar  on discrimination from preexisting conditions since January 1, 2014. So  if you have health insurance through your employer, you have benefited  from the Affordable Care Act. If you have gone to healthcare.gov  because you are a student, part-time worker, or you don't have it  through your job, you have benefited. If you have health insurance for  your children through the Children's Health Insurance Program or  Medicaid, you are no longer subject to discrimination.   Remember a few years ago when insurance companies maintained a long  list of conditions where they said, if you have cancer or diabetes or  something, you are automatically excluded, that is the way things  worked. A congressional investigation into this practice during the  healthcare reform debate uncovered more than 400 medical diagnoses or  conditions that insurance used to justify coverage denial. At the top  of the list were cancer, heart disease, pregnancy, diabetes, HIV/AIDS,  multiple sclerosis, and muscular dystrophy.   You know what? Generally, States with the highest rates of denial  were in the South and the Midwest where the overall health status of  residents has consistently been worse than in other parts of the  country. The incidence of cancer, heart disease, and diabetes is higher  in those States.   Well, now you cannot be discriminated against for those preexisting  conditions. That kind of discrimination wasn't right. It had no place  in America, so we outlawed it in the Affordable Care Act. Like one of  my neighbors, Christine Roper in Tampa--Christine is 26. She recently  aged off her father's insurance and was unsure how to find coverage  because she has a heart condition and asthma. Before, she would have  been prohibited from getting health insurance, but not today. And we  are not going backwards. That is because millions of Americans who can  now buy coverage would be forced back into the ranks of the uninsured.   We are going to start this Congress off by standing up for our  families and rejecting any attempts to repeal and replace the  Affordable Care Act.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on my motion, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Well, according to the Midnight Rules Relief  Act, the public really won't know, and that is the point.    Well, according to the Midnight Rules Relief  Act, the public really won't know, and that is the point.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   In fact, there are extensive regulations listed as major rules  relating to Medicare because part of what we did in the Affordable Care  Act was to begin to change Medicare from a volume-based system to a  value-based system.
