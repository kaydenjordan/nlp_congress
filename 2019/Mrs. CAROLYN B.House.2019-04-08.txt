 MALONEY of New York and Mr. PETERS changed their vote  from ``nay'' to ``yea.''   So (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and  the concurrent resolution was agreed to.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
