 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the  kind actions of Vayda Bell of Bradford, Pennsylvania. After fires in  her local town left five households in her community destroyed and the  families in them displaced, 6-year-old Vayda decided to act.   Vayda Bell set out to help her community by setting up a lemonade and  snack stand on her street. Hoping to raise $100, she exchanged  refreshing treats for donations a few dollars at a time. By the end of  the day, she raised more than $800 to help her neighbors in need, which  was matched by a generous member of the community.   After setting out with the goal of helping five families in need with  the support of her family and community, she earned more than $1,600 to  be donated.   Thank you, Vayda, for stepping up in such an impactful way. Your  actions serve to inspire and instill your generosity in ourselves and  those around us.
