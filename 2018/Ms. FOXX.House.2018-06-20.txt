 Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight the recently designated  opportunity zones in North Carolina's Fifth District. Last month, the  U.S. Treasury approved 22 opportunity zones in North Carolina's Fifth  District as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Referring to areas with  untapped economic potential, The New York Times called the provision  ``the first new substantial Federal attempt to aid those communities in  more than a decade.''   With new incentives for long-term capital investment, opportunity  zones allow State and local governments to facilitate increased  economic development in rural and suburban areas often overlooked for  new investments as companies are drawn to thriving metropolitan areas.   Thanks to the tax cuts and regulatory relief delivered by this united  Republican government, the American economy is booming, and opportunity  zones will spread that prosperity to communities in need of new capital  to create wealth and grow.                            ____________________
