 Mr. Speaker, I stood in the well of this House some days  ago, when I was sworn in, and basically said that I am not naive.   Today, I rise in support of the Affordable Care Act and oppose any  effort to repeal it, which just took place. Since the ACA was enacted  in 2010, the uninsured rate in Pennsylvania has fallen by 37 percent.  Additionally, millions more Pennsylvanians, who would otherwise be  uninsured, have coverage with an employer, Medicaid, individual market,  or Medicare coverage as a result of the new protections provided by the  law.   No matter what lens you look through, Pennsylvanians and individuals  throughout our Nation have better health coverage and care today as a  result of the ACA. Let us keep moving forward and help our communities  have healthcare access, quality, and affordability.   Recently, our Pennsylvania Governor, Tom Wolf, sent a letter to  Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to underscore the importance of  furthering access to care, keeping prices affordable and spending in  check, and improving health care for those in our home State of  Pennsylvania.   Just in Pennsylvania alone, we have had over 670,000 individuals who  have enrolled in HealthChoices, Pennsylvania's mandatory managed care  Medicaid program. That is 670,000 individuals who previously did not  have access to quality of care.   We do not need the rhetoric of repeal and replace.                                       Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,                                          Office of the Governor,                                  Harrisburg, PA, December 20, 2016.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman McCarthy: Thank you for the opportunity to       weigh in on the critically important conversation about the       future of health care in our country. As Governor of the       Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, I am immensely proud of the       work we have done to further access to care, keep prices       affordable and spending in check, and improve health outcomes       since my administration began tackling health care as a top       priority.        One of my first decisions as Governor was to expand       Medicaid to individuals up to 138 percent of Federal Poverty       Level (FPL). Since that decision was made in February 2015,       more than 670,000 individuals have enrolled in HealthChoices,       Pennsylvania's mandatory managed care Medicaid program.       That's 670,000 Pennsylvanians that previously did not have       access to quality care, if they had access to care at all.       Total program enrollment now tops 2.8 million Pennsylvanians.       U.S. Census data shows that the commonwealth's uninsured rate       has dropped from 10.2 percent in 2010 to 6.4 percent in 2015,       and state General Fund costs have been reduced by more than       $500 million as a result of Medicaid expansion.        Even before the passage of the Affordable Care Act,       Medicaid was the largest single payer in the United States       for behavioral health services, including mental health and       substance use services. In the midst of an exploding heroin       use and opioid abuse epidemic that is gripping Pennsylvania       and the nation, the role that Medicaid pays in addressing       this epidemic cannot be understated. More than 3,500       Pennsylvanians died from heroin and opioid-related overdoses       last year and that number is expected to rise again in 2016.       However, in the first year of Pennsylvania's Medicaid       expansion, almost 63,000 newly eligible Medicaid enrollees       accessed drug and alcohol treatment. Demands on the treatment       system are growing by the day but Medicaid expansion has       opened the door to treatment that otherwise would not be       available, much less affordable, to those without insurance.        Of course, the benefits of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)       are not limited to those with Medicaid. The ACA has had far-      reaching positive impacts on every community in Pennsylvania       In 2016, more than 439,000 people had selected health       coverage through the Marketplace.        Seventy six percent of those Pennsylvanians received       subsidies to make those plans more affordable. In 2016, 60       percent of those enrollees could obtain coverage for $100 or       less after tax credits. For a family, that may be the       difference between choosing to pay for food for dinner or       having stable health insurance. In addition, several pieces       of the ACA, including the provision that allows children to       remain on their parents' insurance until age 26 and the       provision that requires coverage of pre-existing conditions,       have made the benefits of health insurance coverage more       enticing than ever before.        Nonprofits that have historically served as the safety nets       of our health care system saw some relief with the passage of       the ACA. For many, this meant they could finally bill for       some of the services that they've typically provided for free       for individuals who are uninsured. To shift the burden back       on to these providers to serve an enormous influx of people       who would lose access to insurance under an ACA repeal is       doing a disservice to our nonprofit partners and our       communities. The upheaval would be instant and real and would       devastate families that have finally been able to set aside       health coverage from their list of daily worries.        I respectfully ask that you carefully consider the needs of       the people as you move forward with discussions about the       future of the ACA. All too often we get swept up in the       politics and financial impacts to large businesses and big       political donors and forget that these are real people, who       suffer from real diseases and every day maladies. Americans       need real, meaningful health care coverage. They need options       that are affordable, easy to understand, responsive to their       needs, and available immediately--with no lapse in coverage.       They need leadership and compassion and solutions--and       together, we can provide them with all of those things.        I look forward to future conversations. Thank you again for       the opportunity to contribute to this incredibly important       dialogue.            Sincerely,                                                          Tom Wolf,      Governor.                            ____________________
