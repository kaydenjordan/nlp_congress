 Mr. Speaker, 56 years ago, our beloved  colleague, the late Congressman John Lewis, and hundreds of other  heroes marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge.   We now know this infamous day in American history as Bloody Sunday.   These warriors of justice were brutally harassed, beaten, and  murdered by Alabama State Troopers and county citizens, all fellow  Americans.   But it was because of their courage on that day, because of their  unwavering commitment to finishing that march that inspired President  Lyndon Johnson to sign into law the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   And it was because of their continued advocacy that the Voting Rights  Act was reauthorized in 1970, 1975, 1982, 1992, and again in 2006.   When I was chair of the CBC in the 107th Congress, we worked  diligently in a bicameral fashion to protect voting rights in this  country.   I teamed up with former Senators Tom Daschle, Chris Dodd, and our  current Senator Dick Durbin, to pass the Help America Vote Act of 2002.   Specifically, this bill was signed into law by President Bush on  October 29, 2002.   Help America Vote provided funds to our States to improve voting  equipment and train workers at polling places.   But even with all of the policy work to level the playing field, why  are we still advocating for our right to vote in 2021?   The answer is that there has been a widening gap of epic proportions  between the ideals of the Voting Rights Act and the harsh reality that  many  [[Page H1100]]  Black and Brown Americans face; that is, blatant and recognizable acts  of voter suppression.   Some of the ways it manifests itself is through partisan  gerrymandering, obstructive voter I.D. laws, felony disenfranchisement,  just to name a few.                                time  2045    But, today, we have doors of opportunity open, and we still must  refer back to Bloody Sunday and to John Lewis's leadership. Take this  Special Order hour, hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus, and in  the memory of John, as a prime example of our progress.   Mr. Speaker, it is in that spirit that I call upon Congress to pass  the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. We must eliminate that  type of discrimination, and we must protect and preserve widespread  voting access for all Americans.   I thank Congresswoman Beatty and Congresswoman Sewell for hosting  this Special Order tonight on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus.  It is time.   My last question is: How long?
