 Thank you, Mr. President. I rise, first of all, to thank  Senator Donnelly for his leadership and my colleagues.   I am speaking today on behalf of hundreds of thousands of people in  Pennsylvania who currently rely or will rely upon a pension. The  multiemployer pension program protects about 10 million workers and  retirees in about 1,400 pension plans across the country. In  Pennsylvania, that number is 230 multiemployer pension plans, with a  total of about 910,000 beneficiaries. Without action, the full pensions  of over 33,000 Pennsylvanians are at risk, as is the solvency of the  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. In 2017 the Pension Benefit  Guaranty Corporation paid $462 million to Pennsylvanians whose pension  plans had failed. That is about $5,800 on average.   Democrats in the Senate have been fighting to preserve these earned  benefits for our retirees for years, including our Nation's coal  miners. The fight for our coal miners we have just half-won. We were  successful in making sure that their promised healthcare benefits are  there for them, but we still have work to do with regard to pensions.   It is inexcusable that Americans who have earned these benefits have  to worry, as some do, and they have been worrying for many years.   We know what the tax bill did, among many things, for very wealthy  interests. The tax bill that got rammed through the Senate in December  of last year gave $13 billion in tax windfalls to our Nation's six  largest banks. That is $13 billion for 1 year--this year alone--and  they are all unpaid for. So the debt goes up. Six big banks get $13  billion, and yet this body, the Senate, can't deliver on the promise of  pensions to hundreds of thousands across the country.   Let me give you three quick examples in the limited time we have.  Debbie, from Western Pennsylvania, wrote about the miners pension act.  She said in part, talking about her family: ``We depend on my dad's  pension to survive on the limited income.'' So said Debbie from Western  Pennsylvania.   Dennis, also from Southwestern Pennsylvania, drove a truck for 25  years of his life, ``working long hours away from my family,'' he said,  ``to provide a good living.'' He said: ``I . . . would appreciate it if  you could do whatever you can to preserve that pension for my wife and  for me.''   Stuart from Northeastern Pennsylvania--the corner of the State I live  in--is a bakery and confectionary union pensioner. He said:         Please help save our BCTGM pension fund. I paid into that       pension system for 26 years and depend on it greatly. I work       three jobs and my wife works two jobs. We have put one child       thru college and one just entered.    None of these families should have to worry about these earned  benefits--this measure of retirement security, so we have a long way to  go. But I am grateful that we are willing to work together on both  sides of the aisle, and I am especially grateful that Democrats have  been united in finally keeping that promise to those who have earned  these benefits, those who have earned these pensions.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to highlight some of the great  successes of our drug courts around the Nation. May is National Drug  Court Month, and I have come to the floor today to highlight the work  of these innovative courts--I think that is an understatement--which  play a unique role in our justice system.   Participants in the drug court system receive treatment and support  services to help these individuals recover, and the individuals are  held accountable through regular drug testing and judicial supervision.   These courts are uniquely equipped for nonviolent substance abuse  offenders, and they provide eligible individuals with intensive  treatment, individualized consequences, and other medical services in  order to help them overcome their substance use disorder--something we  have heard a lot about in every State.   Participants are randomly tested for drug use and mandated to appear  frequently in court so that the drug court judge can review their  progress. The judge also holds drug court participants accountable for  their obligations to the court and, of course, to society at large. All  of these features make drug courts particularly important as we deal  with the opioid crisis that has affected so many individuals, families,  and communities in Pennsylvania and across the country. No  neighborhood--no region of the State--is safe in this horror that we  have been living through now for several years.   Given the scope and severity of the opioid epidemic, we need to  invest in effective solutions. I use that word purposefully-- ``invest.'' With their proven track record of success, drug courts  should be a keystone of our efforts to deal with the opioid crisis.   Drug court systems not only save money, but they also reduce both  drug use and crime itself. Recidivism rates among drug court  participants are significantly lower than for those defendants  undergoing traditional sentencing procedures. Around 50 to 70 percent  of drug court participants complete at least a year of treatment, and  75 percent of graduates remain arrest-free for the next 2 years. Let me  say that again: 75 percent of drug court graduates remain arrest-free  for the next 2 years.   Additionally, studies have found that the use of drug courts save  taxpayer money by lowering overall criminal justice costs. There are a  lot of success stories from drug court graduates, and I want to  highlight one today from Schuylkill County, PA, the Schuylkill County  Drug Treatment Court.   This constituent of mine struggled with opioid and alcohol use  disorder and spent time in prison before going through the drug court  system. According to the probation officer, this Pennsylvanian is now  ``gainfully employed, has regained a positive relationship with family,  is working towards maintaining sobriety and is now working towards the  long-term goal of buying a home.''   That is just one story about one individual, who said:         I used to think about how much I wanted to use and what I       wanted to use. Now I think about going to work and coming       home to my fiancee and children.    That is one success story but a very powerful story.   As the probation officer said, that is just one of many ``incredible  stories of progress and redemption found in drug courts.''   As we observe National Drug Court Month, I encourage my colleagues to  continue supporting the innovative and effective work of these drug  court programs. I want to thank the judges, officers, and other  professionals who help make these success stories a reality every week.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Alex Borgelt  of my staff be granted floor privileges for the duration of today's  session.
