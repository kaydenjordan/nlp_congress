 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from New  Jersey. It is an honor to join my colleagues here during this special  week.   Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago, I approached the podium for the first time  to give my speech on the House floor. I chose my topic intentionally as  it is an issue that I will always champion: protecting the lives of the  unborn. There is no effort more worthy than supporting life. This issue  defines our culture, our society, and our value system.   Every year, I am overwhelmed at the outpouring of effort, energy, and  support that floods this cause. So thank you, and thank you to my  colleagues in the House and Senate who join me in this fight. Thank you  to the health practitioners working nonstop to provide resources to  help new mothers choose life. Thanks to our advocates on the ground,  from the airwaves to in-person, for continually showing your support.  And thank you to our pastors and religious organizations for seeking  divine guidance and strength in this effort.   I am inspired by you all and will keep doing everything I can to  continue this fight to protect the unborn.
