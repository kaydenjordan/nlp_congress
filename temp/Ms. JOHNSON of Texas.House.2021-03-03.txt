 Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, March 3, 2021, I was  not able to make the recorded vote below. Had I been present, I would  have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 56.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to affirm my  support as an original cosponsor for H.R. 1280, the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act of 2021.   This is not a new issue. But one that we continue to revisit over.  And over. And over.   Madam Speaker, how many times will my Republican colleagues affirm  that Black Lives Matter as the blood of Black Lives cry out from  American cities and streets?    Despite what my Republican colleagues are purporting, the George  Floyd Justice in Policing Act will not defund the police.   But what it will do is bring us one step closer to justice by:  banning chokeholds; prohibiting no-knock warrants; ending the qualified  immunity doctrine that is a barrier to holding police officers  accountable for wrongful conduct; Combatting racial profiling;  Mandating there be data collection of these incidences for tracking,  including body cameras and dashboard cameras; and; establishing new  standards for policing.   George Floyd's death should not be in vain. And as a mother of a  black son. Grandmother to three black grandsons, I do not want to have  to worry about their safety when they encounter the police who are  sworn to protect and serve. Not be the judge, jury, and onsite  executioner.   Black lives matter, Madam Speaker, and it is past time that the laws  of our nation reflect it. That is why I am urging my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to support this bill. It goes without saying that I  strongly encourage its immediate consideration and passage in the  Senate.
