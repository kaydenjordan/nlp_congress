 Madam President, reserving the right to object.    Madam President, 7 years ago, the Government  Accountability Office included in its recommendations--something called  the High Risk List--a way for us to stop wasting money, which was not  to send checks to dead people. It was called improper payments to  deceased. The GAO said there was a way to fix this, a way to stop this,  and it proposed a way to stop it.   I worked with the late Tom Coburn to craft and introduce that idea  from the GAO into legislation. It cleared the Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs Committee not once, not twice, not three times  but, I think, four times. Since the departure of Tom Coburn, it has  been cosponsored by other Republicans, including, most recently, by  John Kennedy of Louisiana.   Improper payments are a huge deal for our Federal Government. The  Government Accountability Office tells us that, last year, improper  payments, overpayments, mistaken payments, and so forth were about $150  billion. That is billion with a ``b.'' The GAO thinks we ought to do  something about it, and it has been thinking we ought to have done  something about it for a long time.   The person who is the leader of the Government Accountability Office  is a fellow named Gene Dodaro. He has been the Comptroller General for,  I think, gosh, a decade or more. I was talking to Comptroller General  Gene Dodaro the other night. It was right after it was reported last  week that Treasury had sent out $1.4 billion worth of checks to people  who were deceased. It actually sent out checks with the word  ``deceased'' printed on the checks for all of these dead people, and  one of the people who got a check marked ``deceased'' was Comptroller  General Gene Dodaro's mother who died in 2018.   I happened to be on the phone last Thursday--I was talking to  somebody on my cell phone--when I got interrupted by a call from a  woman in Delaware whom I knew.   She was calling to say: I just heard on MSNBC that Treasury sent $1.4  billion worth of checks to dead people. Why don't you do something  about it?   We have been talking and thinking about doing something about it for  a long time, and we are still talking about doing something about it. I  think the time has come to do something about it. That is sort of where  we are at this point in time.   I understand this has been discussed off the floor for a little bit,  and maybe one of our colleagues has an objection to the consideration  of this bill by unanimous consent. It ain't like it hasn't been out  there for people to raise objections to it, to raise concerns. They  have had 7 years in which to do that, and for 7 years, the GAO has said  to please fix this part of the improper payments program. This doesn't  fix $150 billion, but it certainly is a good start. I don't know  anybody in his right mind who would say we should send checks and  continue to send checks to folks who are deceased. It just makes no  sense. It didn't make sense in 2013, when the idea was first presented  on the High Risk List by the GAO, and it doesn't make sense today.    I am happy to yield.    Senator Wyden has some concerns about the legislation.  Would he just take a couple minutes and explain what those are?   Again, I think my friend knows that it is something we have worked on  for 7 years--same concept reported out of committee unanimously,  repeatedly, and we are still waiting to get it done.   Let me yield to the Senator from Oregon.    Will the gentleman yield?    I think the concern raised by Senator Wyden is if the  Social Security Administration is going to be sharing this information  not just with the IRS and a handful of agencies, there is going to be  some cost involved in that sharing. That is a legitimate concern.  Speaking for myself--and my guess is speaking for my friend from  Louisiana--if there is an additional cost incurred by the Social  Security Administration, I am sure it is going to be a lot less than  $1.4 billion that we have just wasted in sending out these $1,200  checks over the last several months.   I will pledge--and will invite my friend from Louisiana to join me-- to assure Senator Wyden that we will work with him and his staff and  the folks at the Social Security Administration to make sure that the  Social Security Administration is made whole if the legislation that we  have just apparently adopted here--if it actually is adopted and signed  into law, we will make the Social Security Administration whole. That  is a very fair thing to ask of us, and we should do that.    I would be happy to.    The cost that might be incurred by the Social Security  Administration because they would be asked to share this information  more widely among Federal agencies than they do today.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his work, his  efforts, and his tenacity.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
