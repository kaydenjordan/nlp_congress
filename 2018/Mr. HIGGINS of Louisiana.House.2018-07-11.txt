 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of  H.R. 200, the Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing  Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act. I am a cosponsor of this  legislation.   Mr. Chairman, my State of Louisiana has a heavy presence of both  commercial and recreational anglers, and they all know that reforms  have been needed to our Federal fisheries data collection systems for  decades.   In some cases, especially in relation to the red snapper fishery in  the Gulf, rebuilding schedules, season lengths, and catch limits have  been based off data models from the 1980s. Technology has come a long  way since then, with universities and the Gulf States themselves  utilizing new methods of data collection that are producing positive  results that are at odds with the 1980s numbers that the Federal  Government has been using.   This bill will go a long way in promoting a modern science-backed  approach to management of our fisheries.   This reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery and Conservation  Management Act provides flexibility and stability that will promote  economic expansion through enhanced public access and opportunity for  recreational fishing in saltwater.   Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend and colleague, Congressman Young, for  introducing this bill, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to support its passage.                                time  1515
