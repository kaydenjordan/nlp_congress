 Madam Speaker, the world is watching, and the world is in  shock.   Today I rise to speak in support of this resolution condemning the  hateful rhetoric of Donald Trump. His comments were beneath the dignity  of the Office of President of the United States, and they have no place  in our country.   My four colleagues he attacked have every right to be in the United  States. They are just as American as any one of us, and it is shameful  that the leader of our country would seek to disparage them for  political gain. But the sad truth is that if we were to pass a  resolution every time Donald Trump were to say something offensive,  little else would happen in Congress.   For that reason this moment has to be about much more than condemning  [[Page H5854]]  Donald Trump. This moment has to be about moving our country back  toward its best values and ensuring that every American, regardless of  origin, race, or sex, has an opportunity to succeed.   The American people want to see us fighting for jobs, healthcare,  free elections, and policies that recognize the humanity of all who  seek refuge in our Nation.   As chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, I remember when the  President said to Black America: What do you have to lose?   When the leader of this Nation attacks two of our Members--two of the  four women are members of the Congressional Black Caucus--what we have  lost is a President who has dignity.    Someone who has the capacity to bring our country together  is what we have lost. But even for this President, this is a new low:  using rhetoric against someone of a different race based on the belief  that one's race is superior. Since the President will not lead, we  must.
