 Mr. Speaker, last Thursday, June 7, the Attorney  General of the United States, Jeff Sessions, announced that: ``After  careful consideration and with the approval of the President of the  United States,'' his lawyers joined the State of Texas in Federal Court  in a lawsuit to strike down standing provisions of the Affordable Care  Act that protect patients from being denied health insurance coverage  because of preexisting medical conditions.   This stunning announcement was made despite the fact that Congress  has not, and I repeat, has not repealed this part of the law, which is  right here, page 1 of the Affordable Care Act, and despite the fact  that President Trump and the Republican leaders have repeatedly  promised to leave this section of the law alone.   The President, in his 2017 State of the Union said: ``First, we must  ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have access to  coverage.''   Speaker Ryan: ``We are on a mission to make sure that everyone has  access to affordable healthcare, especially those with preexisting  conditions.''   The Representative who is the chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee that writes healthcare laws stated: ``We've talked about the  protection for those with preexisting illnesses for the last year, and  we're not going to budge either.''   Thursday's announcement by President Trump's Attorney General to  attack preexisting condition protections as unconstitutional, and the  deafening silence over the last 5 days in the wake of that announcement  from GOP leaders in the House, shows that all those heartfelt comments  and words were nothing more than crocodile tears.   From day one, the push to repeal the Affordable Care Act with no  meaningful replacement, and last week's latest attack, shows this  President and his political allies in Congress just plain don't care  about the millions of Americans who struggle with medical conditions  that they have no control over.   Mr. Speaker, this issue is not just a Washington, D.C., political  squabble. It is not just a courtroom battle between lawyers. It goes to  the heart of whether we, as a Nation, will join the rest of the  developed world to treat all Americans for disease, accidents, and  chronic illness in a fair and just manner.   Here are the facts. According to the Department of Health and Human  Services, up to 133 million Americans have conditions that insurance  companies, using the old rules of medical underwriting, defined as  preexisting conditions, conditions like diabetes; cancer; high blood  pressure, which I have; epilepsy; MS; Parkinson's; stroke, to name just  a few. Again, this is the list that insurance companies use to screen  people for whether or not they would actually deny them coverage at  all, no matter how big a subsidy or no matter how much money you had to  pay.   Last year, during the debate on repeal, I heard from constituents in  my district who benefited from the Affordable Care Act protections,  like Michelle from Killingworth who said: ``Before the ACA, I tried to  buy affordable health coverage, but I was turned down by major  insurance companies due to preexisting conditions.''   Patricia from Old Saybrook: My adult daughter has a chronic disease  that costs over $10,000 every 6 weeks to treat. Our insurance is a  godsend.   Richard from Killingworth, a 63-year-old former educator who  sustained TBI in an accident and was treated for prostate cancer:  ``Thankfully, due to the Affordable Care Act, I have been able to  access healthcare that I need.''   Michele from Preston, she and her husband rely on ACA coverage.   This decision by the Attorney General last Thursday cannot and must  not stand, and the voters in November will remember if this body does  not act to protect people, their health coverage, for preexisting  conditions.                            ____________________
