 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in  morning business.    Madam President, as you know, as you walk around the  Capitol these last couple of weeks, you have to notice the changes.  Quiet views of the Capitol, the seat of our government, are obstructed  by fences topped with barbed wire and servicemembers on patrol at every  corner, every entrance, and every gateway. These servicemembers, men  and women of our National Guard, are our neighbors. They are our  coworkers. They are members of our family. They are called away from  home, many of which volunteered to come here to the Nation's Capitol to  protect the very heart of democracy. They deserve our thanks. They  deserve our gratitude. They deserve our unwavering support.   With over 25,000 members of the Guard from every State, territory,  and District of Columbia present in Washington to protect our time- honored traditions, there is no greater representation of the best of  America here as we carry out the people's business. I am grateful to  them for their service.   Now, 2 weeks ago, I had the pleasure of visiting and thanking some  members of Vermont's own National Guard--Lieutenant Colonel Day, along  with Captain Lahr, and First Sergeant Stewart from Bravo Troop of  Vermont's renowned Mountain Calvary Battalion. They welcomed me and  introduced me to a contingent of the Vermonters present.   Now, through their deployment, they are asked to face challenges at a  moment's notice. They use the training and the teamwork that has always  helped them succeed in Vermont and overseas. They met those challenges,  and they exceeded those challenges.   Like all National Guard units when they deploy, these Vermonters came  to the District with deep ties back to our communities and the families  and employers that make their service possible.   I am privileged to be the cochair of the Senate National Guard  Caucus. I have heard, time and again, firsthand testimony from members  of the Guard that that hometown connection is the glue that makes what  they do possible. We are grateful to their families, their communities,  and their employers too. But that can be said about every Senator here,  including our distinguished Presiding Officer.   The Vermont Guard members I talked to carried with them the support  of Vermont communities, especially from Southern Vermont, where Bravo  Troop's armory is located. To give you an idea of how they are part of  the community, the deployment was led by the vice principal of  Brattleboro Union High School. It included the cousin of one of my  staffers. It was filled with soldiers with connections and stories that  make up the culture and community I proudly call home--Vermont. A  similar story could be told about the communities represented in the  units from every State and territory. I am especially grateful because  most of the soldiers from Vermont are going to deploy overseas later  this year. Everyone that came down this January volunteered to be here.   So much has been asked of the National Guard these last 3 months,  from the COVID-19 response to several disturbances this summer, to  safeguarding the Nation's Capitol--all of it on top of regular training  and deployment schedules.   To the men and women of the National Guard from every State and  territory and the District of Columbia, we appreciate the immense  contributions you have made to our country today and every day. You are  real patriots. You are real heroes, and democracy thanks you.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter to bring to our  leaders, you know, I first came to this Capitol when I was a teenager  with my parents. We came down from Vermont. I remember looking around  and walking through it, thinking what a privilege it was just to walk  here. And then, during my years at Georgetown Law School, I would come  here often just to see it, just to watch it, and to walk up the Mall  and look at the Capitol and say: That is democracy.   I never thought I would work here, but I have now for a number of  years.  [[Page S208]]  I found the assault on and the defilement of the U.S. Capitol mere  weeks ago was an attack on the bedrock of our democratic institutions  right here in the citadel of our democracy.   The toll that this insurrection has taken and will take on our great  Nation will be felt for so long. In addition to the physical damage  done, there is a human toll that this attack has taken on the lives  lost and the injuries suffered by so many brave officers of the Capitol  Police.   I was both in this Chamber and in the House Chamber during the time  this attack unfolded. The next morning, I recorded some of the  lingering physical damage to this building in several photographs that  I made.   But the attack also is about things you can't photograph, the unseen  scars in the Capitol community--the staff members and the Capitol  employees who work every day to help make our Capitol Building function  as it needs to function. Most Members of Congress were also roiled by  this attack. It has shaken all of us.   Chad Pergram of FOX News has written an essay that captures this  heavy toll on the people who work in the Capitol. I was so moved when I  read his essay.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record the essay by Chad Pergram written on January 31, 2021   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                       [From Fox News, Jan. 31, 2021]                         The Speaker's Lobby: Scars                             (By Chad Pergram)         I know of U.S. Capitol Police officers who are hurting.       Smarting. Reeling.        This, nearly a month after the insurrection at the Capitol       they are paid to protect.        I know of Congressional aides who are hurting. Smarting.       Reeling.        This, after a violent mob shattered windows and jimmied       doors, storming through the Capitol in which they work.        And these are the aides who weren't at the Capitol on       January 6.        These were staffers working from home during the pandemic.       They're still upset after seeing an insurrection of the       highest order in their workplace.        And then there are the aides who were working at the       Capitol on 1/6.        I know these aides are hurting. Smarting. Reeling.        They huddled for hours under desks. In a coat closets. In       restrooms. Barricaded, in rooms, just as they were taught in       a post-Columbine world.        This, as the violent horde marauded through Congressional       offices and deployed Trump flagpoles like battering rams to       break into the Speaker's Lobby off the House chamber.        These are the scars which will take time to heal.        But they are scars.        And scars never disappear.        The United States Capitol bears ugly scars of that       mortifying day. The lesions which remain are the hideous       fencing encapsulating the Capitol, draped with spirals of       concertina wire. There are the National Guard troops in       fatigues, toting M5 carbines, guarding the American Capitol.        But the scars will remain in heads and hearts long after       the troops depart.        An unsettling silence cloaks you once you enter the       Capitol's secure perimeter these days. You pass through the       fencing, showing your pass a few times as you walk. You pass       stretches of grass which is the Russell Senate Park.        It is a park in name only.        The grass is there. Some frost in winter. Benches. The       Robert A. Taft Memorial and Carillon, honoring the late       Senate Majority Leader.        But you can't really get there. You cross Constitution       Avenue. A car, like yours, already cleared for the ``Green       Zone,'' may trundle by.        There is no bustle.        Capitol Hill was always a hive of activity.        AidesTouristsLobbyistsSightseersSenatorsJournalistsGawkersJo      ggersToddlersPoliceOfficers.        Before the pandemic, a jumble of humanity. Just coming and       going. Doing the nation's business. Senators rushing to the       Senate chamber to confirm the Assistant Interior Secretary.       Or maybe a family just in from Spokane who've never set foot       in DC, pushing a three-year-olds' stroller, ambling around       the grounds. Lobbyists piling out of cabs on Independence       Avenue in front of the Longworth House Office Building.        Now, a stillness.        The pandemic hushed the daily bedlam of Capitol Hill.        Lawmakers may only show up to vote. And on the House side,       some don't even do that, voting from home. There are aides       who haven't darkened the door in close to a year. There might       be a smattering of tourists. Some joggers. Dog walkers.        A funereal silence.        That silence is incongruous with the quotidian scramble of       Capitol Hill. The Capitol and its environs are a shell of       what they once were.        The white marble is still there. The majesty of the Dome       remains. But that silence is haunting. The silence is a       signal.        It tells you something bad happened here.        I've been back at the Capitol most days since the riot. I       stayed at a hotel close to the Capitol around the       inauguration--so I could easily get in and out for work. My       wife drove me in the other days and dropped me off. If the       Capitol were locked down like this in any other circumstance,       I would likely hire an Uber, Lyft or take Metro. But the       pandemic presents a new level of difficulty just getting to       work and parking my car.        But I drove myself to the Capitol one day last week.       Officers inspected my badge and checked my trunk on multiple       occasions--twice after I got inside the Green Zone. There was       a lot of confusion about which way to go and where you were       supposed to drive. But after a while, I finally parked where       I usually do. There were no other cars there.        And then there was the silence. Just the rustle of       shriveled leaves, clinging to the trees, bombed by tiny ice       pellets from the sky.        No horns. No cars. No people.        The silence is one of those scars.        Some who work on Capitol Hill may never return, traumatized       by 1/6.        That's a scar, too.        And, there's likely an emerging scar.        The Capitol won't be the same.        Multiple investigations are now underway as to what went       wrong at the Capitol on 1/6. But one of the most       consequential lines came from Acting U.S. Capitol Police       Chief Yogananda Pittman. Pittman briefed House Appropriators       about the attack last week.        ``In my experience, I do not believe there (were) any       preparations that would have allowed for an open campus in       which lawful protesters could exercise their First Amendment       right to free speech, and, at the same time, prevent the       attack on the (Capitol) grounds that day,'' said Pittman.        Yes. There will be discussions about personnel, better       communications and barricades. Many reporters picked up on       what Pittman said about no ``preparations'' failing to avert       ``the attack.''        But there's another important line from Pittman. She use       the phrase ``open campus.''        That is what the U.S. Capitol complex generally was. An       open campus. And, it remains to be seen if it ever will be       again.        Prior to 1/6, people could traipse about the campus at       their leisure. Walk across the Capitol plaza. Pre-pandemic,       people could clear security and spend all day wandering       around the House and Senate office buildings, if they so       chose. It didn't matter if they had an appointment to see       someone or not.        The Capitol itself was closed unless you were there on       official business. You could also come to the Capitol to       watch the House and Senate in action from the galleries.        The difference between the Capitol, and say, the State       Department, is that the public doesn't have the right to just       show up at an executive branch building and waltz around.       Even the perimeter. But access to the Capitol is       quintessentially Congressional. It's a two-way exchange on       Capitol Hill. The people demand to interact with the people       who represent them in Washington. And, lawmakers insist that       their constituents have access to them. It's one of the only       ways American democracy functions.        Moreover, lawmakers want people to enjoy the grounds. The       view from the Capitol Hill vista, looking westward toward the       Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial is one of the most       dramatic in the world.        Openness made the Capitol unique. It also made it an       incredibly soft target--nearly two decades after 9/11.        So how does Congress address this? Barricades?       Appointments? No one on the grounds unless they've cleared       security blocks away? Controlled access? The closures of       Constitution and Independence Avenues?        They hardened the White House facility in the early 1980s       after the West Berlin discotheque bombing. They shuttered       Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House after the       1995 Oklahoma City bombing. That also forced Congressional       officials to shut off many streets which run between the       House and Senate office buildings.        So what scars will the Capitol now bear now?        The Capitol will be different. More restricted. Less       access.        And the quiet serves as a reminder to the bedlam on January       6.     With that, Madam President, I suggest the absence of a  quorum.
