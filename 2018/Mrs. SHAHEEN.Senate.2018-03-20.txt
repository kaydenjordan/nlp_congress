 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Menendez,  the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and my  colleagues from the committee to talk about the importance of diplomacy  as  [[Page S1821]]  we look at the many challenges and conflicts that the world is facing  right now.   From North Korea to Syria to Venezuela, there is really no end in  sight for growing tensions and conflict in the world. Our military  presence in Afghanistan is growing, we have approved lethal weapons for  Ukraine, and we are forging a new partnership with NATO in Iraq. I  support these efforts, but without a vigorous diplomatic capability to  back our military, these initiatives risk failure. Sadly, instead of  providing for a robust diplomatic corps, the administration has laid  the foundation for a weakened U.S. hand on the international stage.  Ultimately, this places Americans at risk. As Secretary of Defense Jim  Mattis said, it forces his men and women to buy more bullets. Equally  critical is the opportunity this provides for the great power conflicts  to continue and to fester.   In November, I wrote to then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with  the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, Senator John McCain, to  express bipartisan concern over the administration's State Department  hiring and promotion rates. I was told that the statistics we had  received from the American Foreign Service Association were wrong and  that the redesign of the State Department is not forcing anyone from  their jobs.   Unfortunately, since that time, the State Department has lost even  more precious, diplomatic talent. Congress has received a budget  request that cuts even more personnel, and Foreign Service hiring and  promotion rates continue to plummet. Last month, the highest ranking  senior Foreign Service officer, Tom Shannon, announced that he, too,  would be retiring. With his retirement, we will have no senior Foreign  Service officers serving in the Department's leadership.   To date, we have only one active career ambassador who will serve in  the entire State Department, and he is not even working in the  building. Aside from the mass exodus of critical talent, we are  allowing decades of investments made by our country and our diplomats  to dwindle along with their ranks.   For the past 2 years, the Senate has also received abysmally low  budget requests for the State Department and USAID.   Meanwhile, our problems aren't declining. The Kremlin continues to  sow chaos across the globe. China increasingly flexes its muscle by  buying strategic properties throughout Europe, Africa, and the Middle  East. We are facing the greatest refugee crisis since World War II. Our  intelligence community repeatedly warns that in this year's midterm  elections, Russia will repeat another hybrid operation against the U.S.  election. The obvious response to these challenges should not and  cannot be to reduce the operational capacity and personnel of the lead  agency that is responsible for alleviating global crises and promoting  the United States' public face throughout the global outreach. That is  the State Department.   Just this month, the New York Times revealed that the State  Department had failed to spend any of the $120 million allocated to  fund the Global Engagement Center, which is aimed at countering state- led misinformation campaigns. While America is under attack and Western  democracies are under attack by misinformation campaigns, the State  Department's response has been totally insufficient. It has been not to  spend any of the money that Congress has allocated. It seems the  administration is completely unaware of Special Counselor Mueller's  indictment against Russia's Internet Research Agency.   I wish to spend a minute to read from excerpts of Mueller's  indictment of 13 Russians, which came out last month. If we can look at  this through objective eyes, it reminds us all of the threats we face  because of Russia's interference.   This is stated in Mueller's document:         The [Internet Research Agency] is a Russian organization       engaged in operations to interfere with elections and       political processes.    I am quoting now from the indictment.         By in or around September 2016, the [Internet Research       Agency's] monthly budget for Project Lakhta (its interference       operation in the U.S.) exceeded 73 million Russian rubles       (over 1,250,000 U.S. dollars).    They are spending, on a regular basis, 1.25 million in American  dollars on this interference operation. For all of the people out there  who think this is a partisan issue, this is not a partisan issue. This  is an issue about interfering in our democracy. We can see how much  they are willing to spend to do that.   Continuing to quote from the indictment:         Defendants and their co-conspirators also traveled, and       attempted to travel, to the United States under false       pretenses in order to collect intelligence for interference       operations.        In or around 2016, the defendants and their co-conspirators       also used, possessed and transferred, without legal       authority, the social security numbers and dates of birth of       real U.S. persons without those persons' knowledge or       consent. Using these means of identification, defendants and       their co-conspirators opened accounts at PayPal; created       false means of identification, including fake driver's       licenses; and posted on Internet Research Agency-controlled       media accounts.    That is the Russian entity that is doing this.   Think about that. We know of the Kremlin's efforts to influence and  use the American people to its own advantage. It is laid out pretty  clearly in this indictment from Robert Mueller. Yet, somehow, the State  Department is incapable of spending $1 of the money that has been  allocated by Congress toward countering Russia's most overt, public  messages against the United States.   This is truly remarkable and, sadly, disappointing. The American  people deserve better. Unfortunately, the Global Engagement Center is  not alone in its lack of support from the administration. According to  an analysis of data from the Office of Management and Budget, last year  the State Department spent just 79 percent of the money that Congress  had authorized for the conduct of foreign affairs, the lowest level in  the last 15 years.   Many of us on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee would agree that  most of our greatest global achievements--the Marshall Plan, the end of  the Cold War, and the reduction of nuclear weapons--have been secured  through diplomacy. Without it, I fear we will stray far from President  Trump's ideal of brokering deals and instead cause irreparable damage  to one of America's most precious resources--our diplomatic corps. That  will harm this country's standing in the world and will have us viewed  as weak by our great power adversaries.   The hollowing out of the State Department under this administration  will cause irreparable damage to America's diplomatic efforts, and it  will harm our country's standing in the world. Congress has to step in  and make sure this doesn't happen.   I yield the floor.
