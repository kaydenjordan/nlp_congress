 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary life  and legacy of Montgomery County Commissioner Elton Dean, who passed  away at the age of 72 on June 7, 2022.   A native of Alabama's Seventh Congressional District, Chairman Dean  graduated from Montgomery's own George Washington Carver High School  before attending Selma University, where he received his associate's  degree.   Returning to Montgomery, Chairman Dean pursued his bachelor of  science at the Alabama State University, where he graduated in 1971  with a degree in business and economics.   Chairman Dean went on to become a successful businessman, putting to  work his entrepreneurial spirit to serve and improve his community as  owner of Dean Realty as well as 21st Century Hair Studio.   In November 2000, Chairman Dean was first elected to the Montgomery  County Commission, where he humbly and faithfully served the Second  District for over 20 years. Dean was elected vice chairman in November  2004 before making history in March 2009 as the first African American  to serve as chair of the Montgomery County Commission. Montgomery  County includes the historic city of Montgomery, Alabama.   Known as a dedicated public servant and passionate community leader,  Chairman Dean's legacy lives on in the countless projects and  initiatives that came into fruition under his leadership, including the  implementation of Montgomery County's back-to-school sales tax holiday.   Chairman Dean is also known for bringing the commission meetings to  the people by holding his ``On the Road'' initiative, which allowed  constituents to meet directly with their representatives.   Chairman Dean worked tirelessly to improve Montgomery County's  economic well-being. Among his most notable achievements, he oversaw  the implementation of the 1 percent sales tax in 2001, which generated  over $428 million for public education in Montgomery County, delivering  critically needed resources to the children of our community.   Chairman Dean never missed an opportunity to give back. Throughout  his adult life, he held countless positions, including serving on  boards and organizations throughout Montgomery County, which included  as executive board member of the South Central Alabama Boys and Girls  Club as well as board member for the Montgomery Improvement  Association, board member for the Central Alabama Community Foundation,  and chairman of the trustee board and mass choir member of Mt. Zion  African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. He was commissioner of the  Central Alabama Amateur Baseball League and commissioner of the  Southern League Dixie Youth Baseball.    A very strong advocate for his alma mater, Chairman Dean returned to  the Alabama State University later in life to serve as chairman of the  board of trustees for the Alabama State University. In this role, he  served for 9 years and generated $525 million worth of campus  improvement.   In his role as chairman of the board of trustees for Alabama State  University, I got to know Chairman Dean because he gave me, as a young  bond lawyer, the opportunity to represent my parents' alma mater, the  Alabama State University.   It was Chairman Dean who encouraged me to run for Congress, and for  his mentorship and his friendship, I am forever grateful.   Chairman Dean rightfully received numerous awards throughout the  community: the Pioneer Award by The Montgomery Tuskegee Times; the  Montgomery County Area Chamber of Commerce Chairman's Award in 2012;  the Citizen of the Year Award by the Sigma Phi Chapter of Omega Psi Phi  Fraternity in 2004; the Citizen of the Year Award by Kappa Alpha Psi  Fraternity, Montgomery's Alumni Chapter; as well as the Kershaw YMCA  Man of the Year.   Chairman Dean was a true public servant and a servant leader. Though  I know so many of us are heartbroken by his passing, I am eternally  grateful for our partnership on behalf of the citizens of Montgomery  County, Alabama, and blessed to have been guided by his mentorship as  well as his friendship over the years.   May his family find comfort in knowing that Elton Dean's legacy will  live on in the hearts of all those he impacted. As we mourn his  passing, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the  extraordinary life and legacy of Montgomery County Commission Chairman  Elton Dean.                            ____________________
