 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend a  Franklin High School graduate from Venango County on earning a  prestigious fellowship.   Michael Wisner, who graduated from Franklin High School in 2015 and  is expected to graduate from Princeton University in June, has been  awarded the Charles B. Rangel International Affairs Fellowship  following a nationwide contest.   The fellowship is funded by the U.S. Department of State and  administered by Howard University right here in Washington.   The Rangel Graduate Fellowship is a program that aims to attract and  prepare outstanding young people for careers in the Foreign Service,  where they can help formulate, represent, and implement U.S. foreign  policy.   The Rangel program selects outstanding fellows annually in a highly  competitive nationwide process and supports them through 2 years of  graduate study, internships, mentoring, and professional development  activities.   Michael is completing certificates at Princeton in African studies,  history and the practice of diplomacy, and Latin American studies.   He spent a summer abroad in Greece and a semester abroad in  Argentina, where he worked as an English as a second language  instructor. Since 2016, he has taught English as a second language at  the resource center of Catholic Charities in New Jersey.   Impressively, he also worked with Engineers Without Borders to design  and install a water system in Peru. As part of the project, he co-led a  12-person team to author a Spanish language water system manual for  community use.   During his time at Franklin High School, Michael was committed to  academics, sports, and community activities. He was named salutatorian  of his class. He played football and was captain of the team. He was  also a wrestler and attained the rank of Eagle Scout with Boy Scouts of  America.   Michael is the son of Tom and Nancy Wisner of Polk, Pennsylvania, in  Venango County.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for American men and women who are  committed to serving this country at home and abroad. I have no doubt  that Michael will excel in his fellowship and help promote positive  change globally. I congratulate Michael Wisner on this outstanding  achievement, and I wish him the best as he pursues this opportunity                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today on  Religious Freedom Day to celebrate the numerous faiths that people hold  across this great Nation.   Today we commemorate the 233rd anniversary of the passing of a State  law that has shaped and secured our important legacy of religious  liberty. On January 16, 1786, the Virginia General Assembly passed the  Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom. The bill, written by Thomas  Jefferson, states: ``All men shall be free to profess, and by argument  to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion.''   Just a few years later, this bill served as the inspiration for the  First Amendment, which affirms our right to choose and exercise faith  without government coercion or retaliation.   Today, Americans from diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds remain  committed to the values of faith, honesty, integrity, and patriotism.   Madam Speaker, our Constitution and laws guarantee Americans the  right not just to believe as they see fit, but to freely exercise their  religion. We observe this day in our homes, schools, and houses of  worship because we have the freedom and the right to do so.                            ____________________
