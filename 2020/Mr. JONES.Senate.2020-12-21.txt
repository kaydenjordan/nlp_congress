 Mr. President, as I mentioned in my farewell speech last  week, I also wanted to spend a few final moments here on the Senate  floor honoring my incredible staff. As the first Democrat elected to  the Senate from Alabama in two decades, I had no idea how many  brilliant young folks would want to come work in my offices, but we  were absolutely overwhelmed with the talent my election attracted--and  not just from Alabama--we had applicants from all over the country. We  of course tried to give priority to folks from Alabama, but we did have  a few from other States who brought special expertise and who, after  just a short time with us, became honorary Alabamians.   Some of my staff came from other Senate or House offices where they  had been biding their time, hoping 1 day to work for an Alabama  Democratic Senator. Their experience was critical. Some staff members  brought no legislative experience at all, but they were quick and eager  learners and got up to speed unbelievably fast. What they all  [[Page S7937]]  had in common was a deep and sincere commitment to doing the right  thing for the right reasons.   There were very few shortcuts and very few easy decisions, but we all  worked hard to understand the issues backwards and forwards and to do  our best for the people of Alabama and for our country. Although each  member of the staff was acutely aware that I would have to stand for  reelection in just 3 short years, they were as committed as I was to  not let political considerations enter into our deliberations. Instead  we focused on the needs of our constituents, big and small, and doing  all we could to make sure those needs were met.   Over the past 3 years, we have become a family, and we have had some  fun to boot. Equally important, we have gotten things done. We led or  coled over 20 bipartisan bills that were signed into law. We mustered  enough support to finally repeal the Widow's Tax. We secured permanent  Federal funding for HBCUs and minority-serving institutions. We made  things easier for folks applying for Federal student loans. We secured  authorizations and appropriations for hundreds of millions of dollars  in funding for defense-related projects in Alabama. We set up a process  to collect and make available to the public the Federal records from  unsolved civil rights crimes. We completed 2,094 requests for casework  help and responded to hundreds of thousands of calls, letters, and  emails from Alabama constituents. We submitted 624 letters in support  of Alabamians' grant applications, resulting in $270,973,411 in awards  for municipalities, nonprofits, colleges and universities, rural fire  departments, health centers, and others. Out of the outstanding high  school seniors who I nominated to our military service academies, 44  have received appointments, and that is in just our first 2 years  alone; we won't know the results for 2020 until next spring. We did  more than 1,000 interviews, speeches, townhalls, and events across the  State of Alabama and in DC. None of these things, absolutely none of  them, would have been possible without the hard work and unflagging  dedication of my staff.   My time in the U.S. Senate was enhanced immeasurably by the tangible  and intangible contributions of my staff. As I said earlier, we knew we  only had 3 years guaranteed, and we made the most of it. From our  amazing record of legislative accomplishments, to our warm and  welcoming office culture, to our emphasis on bipartisanship and  collegiality, we made a positive difference, and I am immensely proud  to have served with each of them.   Although it is impossible to go through the contributions of each I  do want to single out a few who really made the office click or were  responsible in some way for a major accomplishment.   First is my chief of staff Dana Gresham. Dana came to me by way of  the House and then the Department of Transportation. He has always been  a leader, and for me, I was so proud to have him as the first African- American chief of staff for a Democratic Senator. He was instrumental  in building the staff and guiding the delicate nature of Beltway and  Alabama politics.   My legislative director Mark Libell brought a level of experience and  direction to our legislative team that I think is unmatched in the  Senate. He brought a level of skill to the legislative process that is  largely responsible for the many successes we had.   Katie Campbell doubled as the deputy legislative director and  legislative assistant on our healthcare related matters. She brought a  tremendous amount of knowledge and was thus a tremendous resource for  our healthcare agenda, which was always one of my top priorities.   On the Banking Committee, I was fortunate to have Mike Berman for a  couple of years before he moved into the private sector. Mike began the  painstaking process of revising the country's money laundering laws  which his successor on the staff, Lauren Oppenheimer, picked up. Thanks  to their combined efforts and working with colleagues and various  stakeholders and regulators, Congress passed as part of the NDAA an  update to our money laundering laws for the first time in decades.   My friend of 20 years Cissy Jackson came to Washington after  practicing law with me in Birmingham. She had no legislative experience  but soon became a rockstar among the Senate staff on both sides of the  aisle, first with the Homeland Security Committee and then as my MLA on  the Armed Services Committee. So much of what we were able to secure  for the people of Alabama in the NDAA is a direct result of Cissy's  tireless and persistent efforts.   Rebecca Howard handled education policy for me. Through her efforts,  we secured additional and permanent funding for HBCUs, as well as the  success in simplifying the FAFSA form, which will allow so many kids in  Alabama to receive a college education. She also coordinated the annual  HBCU symposiums that we conducted each year.   The director of my State staff was Brantley Fry. Brantley made sure  that I stayed incredibly busy when I was at home. We traveled from one  end of the State to the other. We visited businesses, military  installations, schools, and farms. She coordinated the townhalls and  roundtables, all with an eye to the important issues facing the State.   Heather Fluit was my communications director and she did tremendous  work keeping the people of Alabama up to speed on all the good work  that we were doing in Washington and around the State. This could be a  difficult job at times on weedy issues like money laundering, but  Heather excelled.   I could not conclude these remarks, however, without once again  noting what was one of my proudest moments in the Senate when we  successfully eliminated the Military Widow's Tax. It took a tremendous  amount of effort and persistence in making that legislation a reality,  and so much of the credit goes to Sarah Kate Sullivan in my office.  Like me and my colleague Senator Collins, Sarah Kate never gave up, and  today, so many military families will benefit from her efforts.   My wife Louise and I thank each of these individuals listed below  from the bottom of our hearts.
