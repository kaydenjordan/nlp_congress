 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Preserving  Choice in Vehicle Purchases Act.   When I first read the Biden administration's plan to increase fuel  standards, which require 67 percent of all new vehicles manufactured be  all-electric by 2032, I was appalled. This plan does nothing to benefit  America and everything to benefit our greatest adversary, China.   Electric vehicle batteries require at least a 1,000 percent increase  in materials extracted from the Earth compared to a gasoline-powered  vehicle.   Who dominates the extraction and processing of these materials? You  guessed it: China. Nearly all the growth in mining to meet this demand  is expected to come from offshore, non-U.S. mines. Who has been buying  these mines? You guessed it: China.   China is the only one that stands to benefit from this drastic change  in policy, and American consumers will suffer.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this bill.
