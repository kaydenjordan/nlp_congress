Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, today, this body will, for what I hope is the final  time, meet its moral obligation to provide for survivors and responders  suffering from 9/11-related illnesses.   This obligation is two-fold.   First, on September 11, 2001, it was not just the city of New York  and the Pentagon that were attacked, it was the entire country. A  national attack has always required a national response. That is why  responders from around the country rushed to New York to aid in the  rescue and recovery effort in the immediate aftermath. Today, sick  responders and survivors live in all 50 States. This is a national  problem, and Congress must provide a national solution.   Second, tens of thousands of responders and survivors are sick  because the Federal Government, in its rush to get Wall Street  reopened, ignored the evidence and the expert opinions of scientists.  The then-head of the Environmental Protection Agency repeatedly assured  us that the air around the World Trade Center was ``safe to breath.''  We knew it wasn't, but the Federal Government kept insisting it was.   And, compounding the Federal Government's culpability was its failure  to conduct a comprehensive cleanup of the environmental disaster  created when the World Trade Center towers collapsed. For example, the  EPA administrator told the public that asbestos could be cleaned from  apartments with a damp cloth and a wet mop.   Based on these false assurances, students were sent back to schools  that had been contaminated with the toxic dust cloud without  ventilation systems being cleaned first. People kept working to clear  the pile for months with no protective equipment. Quite simply, the  Federal Government lied, and now tens of thousands of people are sick  with 9/11-related illnesses. It now falls to us--in the words of  Abraham Lincoln--``to care for him who shall have borne the battle and  for his widow and for his orphan.''   Three times, Congress has come together to provide a health program  and compensation for the victims of 9/11 through a victim compensation  fund, or VCF. Most recently, in 2015, we made the World Trade Center  Health Program effectively permanent, extended to 2090, but  reauthorized the VCF, the victim compensation fund, for only 5 years.   As we heard in a Judiciary Committee hearing last month, a 5-year  authorization was not nearly long enough. People are still getting sick  as diseases, such as cancer, often emerge only after long latency  periods. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that, in  the coming years, cancer claims will represent 63 percent of all claims  before the VCF, up from 44 percent today.   Further, as the number of sick responders and survivors continues to  rise, the limited resources Congress provided to the VCF have proven  inadequate and now thousands of families are facing up to 70 percent  cuts in compensation.                                time  1045    I refuse to accept that. Every sick responder and survivor should be  treated with the same dignity and compassion, regardless of when they  became sick, and no one should be forced to spend their last days  walking the Halls of Congress begging us to reauthorize this program.   That is why we are here today, to pass what I hope will be the last  authorization we ever need for the VCF.   This bipartisan legislation, with over 330 cosponsors, will reverse  all of the cuts in compensation and make those families whole. It will  extend the authorization for the VCF through 2092, substantially the  same timeline as the World Trade Center Health Program, and make  technical improvements to the program.   We have asked so much of our responders and survivors. It is time for  us to give them the peace of mind they deserve and pass this bill once  and for all.   Finally, I want to take a moment to recognize the three men after  whom we named this bill.   James Zadroga, Ray Pfeifer, and Luis Alvarez passed away after  battling 9/11-related illnesses. A month ago, Detective Alvarez  testified before the Judiciary Committee, just 24 hours before what was  supposed to be his 69th chemotherapy treatment, a treatment he,  ultimately, was too sick to receive. Two weeks ago, he passed away.   Like every responder and survivor of 9/11, these three men kept  fighting for this program, even when they knew it was too late for  them. That is the spirit of 9/11. This bill is now their namesake, and  we vote today in their name.  [[Page H5745]]    I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), one of the chief sponsors of the  bill.    Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to yield 1  minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of  the House, someone who has done more for this than anyone else. Without  the gentlewoman's strong support, this bill never would have passed  back in 2010.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Engel), who is the distinguished chairman of the Foreign  Affairs Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries), who is the chairman of the  Democratic Caucus.    Madam Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Swalwell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from New Jersey an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer).    Madam Speaker, I have one more speaker, and then I am  prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Suozzi).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, 9 years ago, I stood here and called up for  consideration the original 9/11 bill, the James Zadroga Act.   I want to thank Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, and Majority  Whip Clyburn for their roles in passing that bill, and now for moving  us as quickly as possible to get this bill done.   I also want to thank my colleagues from New York, the gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) and the gentleman from New York  (Mr. King), for standing with me in this fight for so long, and to  thank all the advocates, many of whom are here today, who have given so  much and have worked so hard to pass this bill.   Finally, I want to thank Lisette Morton, my longtime legislative  director and director of policy planning and member services for the  Committee on the Judiciary, who is leaving my team at the end of this  month after nearly 20 years.   Lisette worked for me on September 11, 2001, and she was tireless in  her efforts to get a proper detoxification and cleanup after the attack  in New York and to hold the EPA accountable for its failures. Without  her fierce advocacy and dedication, there would be more victims today,  and we would not be here considering this bill today. She will be  greatly missed by this institution, by my staff, and by me.   Now, Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.    I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.                                time  1130     She will be greatly missed.   Madam Speaker, I now urge all my colleagues to support this bill, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
