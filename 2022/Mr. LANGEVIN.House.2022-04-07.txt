 Madam Speaker, this is an important week for the future  of American diplomacy, especially as it relates to cybersecurity. An  open, interoperable, reliable, and secure internet is foundational to  U.S. foreign policy and national security in the 21st century, but this  vision for the global digital ecosystem faces greater challenges than  ever before.   Cybersecurity absolutely must become a core foreign policy priority  of the United States and, this week, we have taken a major step forward  in that regard.   On Monday, the Department of State formally launched the Bureau of  Cyberspace and Digital Policy. On the international stage, this bureau  will lead U.S. efforts to uphold standards of responsible state  behavior in cyberspace, shape digital standards that govern new  technologies, and protect digital freedoms around the world. I  congratulate Secretary Blinken and Deputy Secretary Sherman on this  significant accomplishment.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that this new  bureau receives the funding it needs to accomplish its critical  mission. And beyond that, I also look forward to enshrining this new  bureau in statute through the Cyber Diplomacy Act, a bipartisan bill,  which will ensure its long-term viability and the preservation of  cybersecurity as a key foreign policy priority for the coming decades.                            ____________________
