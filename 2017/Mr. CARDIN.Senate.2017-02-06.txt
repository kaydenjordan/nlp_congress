 Mr. President, as the Senate deliberates the nomination  of Betsy DeVos to be Secretary of Education, I have heard from more  than 4,200 Marylanders who have called my office, more than 3,700  Marylanders who have emailed me, and countless others who have sent me  messages via Twitter and Facebook, and, as Senator Carper has  indicated, those who have just stopped me on the streets and urged me  to oppose her nomination.   They have contacted me to express their strong support for public  education, and they are concerned about whether Mrs. DeVos is equally  committed to public schools. I share their concern. Marylanders and I  agree that our children deserve an advocate in this position who will  work to strengthen the ability of public school educators to serve our  children.   As a proud graduate of the Baltimore City Public Schools, I  understand the transformative powers that quality public school  education can provide a child. The education I received at city schools  has allowed me, the grandchild of immigrants, to represent Maryland in  the Senate. I owe that to my public education, my public school  education.   Maryland has made a commitment to providing adequate funding for  public education over the past decade. Consequently, Maryland has  consistently been a national leader in student performance and student  outcomes.   Each day, our State's nearly 880,000 students make their way to  classrooms of more than 60,000 and thousands of more support personnel  and education leaders in over 1,400 Maryland schools. I appreciate the  service of Maryland educators, not only from the perspective of a  lawmaker, a father, and a grandfather but also as a husband of a former  school teacher.   Mrs. DeVos appeared before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee to articulate her view on how to best serve our  students as Secretary of Education. I found several of Mrs. DeVos's  answers to the committee questions to be troubling, particularly what  appeared to be her tepid support for our Nation's public schools; her  failure to recognize the critical Federal civil rights safeguards for  children with disabilities; her inability to offer an opinion on  longstanding debates within the education community that she would be  expected to join as Secretary of Education; her support for President  Trump's dangerous campaign promise to eliminate gun-free school zones;  and her overall lack of response on how to provide students and their  families with affordable higher education.   Maryland families know and understand the value of a high quality  public school education. Since 2008, enrollment in our State public  schools has increased by nearly 36,000 students to a record enrollment  of approximately 880,000 students for the 2016-2017 school year.   While enrollment has continued to increase at a record pace, I am  proud that Maryland public schools have consistently ranked among the  top five public school systems in the country.   I worry that Mrs. DeVos's enthusiastic support for private school  choice programs could hamper the progress in State and local education  in Maryland and could prevent us from providing the highest quality  level of education for our public school students. School choice  programs that shift Federal fund dollars from public schools to defray  tuition at private schools weaken the ability of Maryland's hard- working public school professionals to deliver college- and career- ready education for Maryland's diverse students.   Certainly private schools play an important role in our education  system. As Senator Carper points out, he supports, I support, charter  schools within our public school system. I support the role that public  schools play. But we mustn't forget that more than 91 percent of  American children attend public schools. They and their families  deserve a Secretary of Education who will fight to strengthen public as  well as private education.   School choice programs are not one-size-fits-all solutions to  strengthen education in the United States. They leave out students in  our rural communities, for instance, and have been shown in Maryland  for the most part to support students who are already enrolled in  private schools.   I urge our Secretary of Education nominee--if she is confirmed--to  work to provide our public school teachers with the training, tools,  and resources necessary to provide all children with a high-quality  education. I was particularly concerned by Mrs. DeVos's apparent  unfamiliarity with critical Federal civil rights safeguards for  children with disabilities, guaranteed under the 1975 Individuals with  Disabilities Education Act, IDEA.   IDEA ensures that every child with disabilities is afforded a free  appropriate public education. Across my State, more than 100,000  children receive federally funded services under the IDEA to help them  succeed academically. Mrs. DeVos did not seem to know that States must  follow this critical civil education rights law if they accept Federal  funding.   Parents across the country advocate for their children on a daily  basis, utilizing the protections afforded to their children under the  IDEA. They deserve a Secretary of Education who understands her  responsibilities and the Federal Government's responsibilities to  children with disabilities. Last year's enactment of the bipartisan,  bicameral Every Student Succeeds Act was a true success.   This was an incredible accomplishment put together by Senators  Alexander and Murray. For the first time in 14 years, Congress  reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, legislation  that was first enacted 50 years ago as part of the civil rights era to  ensure that all of our children are able to attain a high-quality  education.   That act eliminated the outdated and ineffective accountability  system of adequately yearly progress and now provides States with the  flexibility to decide their own accountability system to identify,  monitor, and assist schools in need of improvement to best educate  their students.   We gave local flexibility but maintained accountability. That was a  major improvement in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The  modifications allow States to move away from reliance on a collective  set of test scores to measure students' proficiency. Now, States will  be able to design accountability systems that take into account student  growth over the course of a school year.   As Secretary of Education, Mrs. DeVos would be tasked with leading  the Federal implementation and review of the State development  accountability systems. But in a hearing before the committee, she  struggled to understand the definition of proficiency versus growth and  had to have committee members help her define those terms.   Maryland educators oppose the high-stake testing requirements under  the previous Federal accountability system. They deserve a Secretary of  Education who understands the basic concepts of Federal involvement in  our public schools, so they can effectively advocate for more accurate  accountability systems that better show student growth in the  classroom.   Mrs. DeVos's expressed support for President Trump's misguided pledge  to eliminate gun-free schools zones is deeply concerning. Maryland's  families have made it loud and clear to me that this approach is wrong  and would unnecessarily put our students in harm's way in the very  classrooms in which they are expected to learn. Since 2000, there have  been four school shootings across my home State. One shooting in a  school anywhere in our country is too many. Each of those incidents is  a tragedy, and I do not wish to see more students and educators put at  risk of additional tragic incidents of gun violence by allowing  firearms in our classrooms.   Rather than support the Federal programs developed under the  Elementary and Secondary Education Act to provide additional funding  for school-based mental health resources in our national public schools  that can provide assistance for those who may commit gun violence at  schools, Mrs. DeVos would spend those tax dollars on  [[Page S817]]  school choice programs and open up our classrooms to potential  violence.   In the coming months, future college students and their families will  sit at their family kitchen tables to apply for financial aid to pay  for college and await the news of their acceptance to the college of  their choice. I have talked to so many Marylanders who are struggling  with allowing their children to go to schools of higher education so  that they can be best prepared, but they are looking at the realities  of the cost involved in higher education. This is an exciting time, yet  an increasingly anxious time for parents and students as the cost of  attending college continues to rise.   Mrs. DeVos needs to demonstrate that she is familiar with the  process, the steps necessary to apply for Federal financial student  aid, and appreciates the enormous burden families increasingly  undertake to gain a foothold in the middle class through higher  education.   Mrs. DeVos appears willing to roll back protections for student  borrowing and to allow taxpayer funds to be put at risk of failing for- profit schools that do not provide students with the educational skills  necessary to join the workforce. At a minimum, I would expect her to be  an advocate to make sure that Federal funds are not used for these  schools that are not being held accountable for what they do.   I would like to hear Mrs. DeVos voice her support for America's  College Promise plan to provide academically successful students with  the ability to earn the first 2 years of their college degree tuition  free at a community college. So far I don't think she has said  anything. That is the most efficient way to try to educate our  children.   I appreciate Mrs. DeVos's willingness to serve, and I believe she is  sincere in her beliefs, but I am concerned that those beliefs, if  enacted, would harm the capability of America's public education system  to serve the vast majority of students across the Nation and pile on  needless costs to students, their families, and the American  taxpayer. Therefore, I will stand with Maryland's students, teachers,  and parents in opposing Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education.    With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of  Senator Jeff Sessions to be the next Attorney General of the United  States and to head the U.S. Department of Justice.   I have had the privilege to serve with Senator Sessions in the U.S.  Senate for nearly a decade. I have served on several committees with  him, including the years that I was on the Judiciary Committee. I no  longer serve on that committee, but I served there with Senator  Sessions.   I was listening to Senator Klobuchar's explanations of her concerns.  Senator Sessions is a person whom we work with, but it is his views and  his record that give me great concern.   Just looking back at the first 2 weeks of the Trump administration, I  think a growing number of Americans understand the importance of the  Constitution, the rule of law, the system of checks and balances, the  separation of powers, and the critical importance of the position of  the Attorney General of the United States.   Over the years, the Justice Department has grown into one of the  largest Cabinet departments, with over 100,000 employees, which touches  just about every aspect of life in America today. It is known as the  world's largest law office and the chief enforcer of Federal laws.   Just think about the work every day to keep America safe undertaken  by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement  Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and  Explosives, the Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Marshals Service, and the  U.S. Attorneys in every State and territory. Think about the work of  the National Security Division that tackles some of the toughest  terrorism and intelligence challenges we face every day. All of that  comes under the Department of Justice. All of that comes under the  Attorney General.   Think about the work of the Civil Rights Division to protect all  Americans, regardless of their background, to ensure that every  American--every American--enjoys full constitutional rights and  privileges. Think about the work of the Environmental and Natural  Resources Division, the Antitrust Division, and the Tax Division, and  so many other offices within the Department of Justice. It is the  direction of all of those agencies that come under the Attorney General  of the United States. These hard-working employees of the Justice  Department keep America safe every day while protecting American lives,  and some of them put their lives on the line to do so. We need an  Attorney General that will strengthen, not weaken, the Justice  Department and will help carry out its important missions.   The Justice Department is charged with ``[enforcing] the law and  [defending] the interests of the United States according to the law,''  ``[ensuring the] public safety against threats foreign and domestic,''  as well as ``[ensuring] fair and impartial administration of justice  for all Americans.'' That is their mission. That is their  responsibility.   The Attorney General is not the President's lawyer; he or she is the  people's lawyer. After carefully examining Senator Sessions' record-- including his Senate service, confirmation hearing, and advocacy on the  campaign trail for Mr. Trump--I am not convinced that he would be  independent and impartial to the President and Federal agencies. I am  not convinced he would enforce the law fairly and protect the civil  liberties and civil rights of all Americans.   Let me discuss some of my concerns with Senator Sessions' nomination.  In this debate, I do want to mention my resolution calling on President  Trump to divest his interest and sever his relationship to the Trump  organization. My resolution was first introduced last year. It is  intended to uphold the value and strictures of one of the most sacred  documents: the Constitution, the instrument that the President took an  oath to preserve, protect, and defend. It makes clear that Congress  will consider all transactions by foreign governments and their agents  with the Trump organization as potential violations of the emoluments  clause of the Constitution.   The Attorney General is likewise sworn to uphold the U.S.  Constitution and provide legal advice to President Trump and the  various Cabinet departments. He must exercise independent judgment. I  am concerned as to whether Senator Sessions would, in fact, advise the  President, as he should, that by holding on to Trump enterprises--by  not divesting or setting up a blind trust--he is putting himself at  risk of violating the Constitution of the United States.   It is not what the President wants to hear; it is what he must hear.  We need  [[Page S849]]  an independent Attorney General in order to make that recommendation to  the President of the United States.   Senator Sessions has strongly supported restrictive voter ID laws  that have had the effect of disenfranchising many otherwise eligible  voters and are frankly modern-day poll taxes. He has called the Voting  Rights Act intrusive as it seeks to protect minority voters. He praised  the Supreme Court's ruling in Shelby County v. Holder, which gutted a  key part of the Voting Rights Act, saying that it was ``a good day for  the South'' when the decision was handed down.   Our next Attorney General should be working on how to expand the  franchise, not restrict it. Now President Trump has said he will direct  Vice President Pence to lead a task force or commission to examine so- called voter fraud in the 2016 Presidential election.   We need an independent Attorney General.   Why is President Trump taking this action? Because Hillary Clinton  won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, and that gets under his  skin. He feels slighted. He feels his legitimacy is brought into  question. It doesn't matter that he won the electoral vote. So the  President will direct the Vice President, and presumably his next  Attorney General, to investigate these bogus claims of voter fraud.  Instead, the new Attorney General should examine voter suppression and  disenfranchisement in the elections. I fear this new study on  widespread ``voter fraud'' is simply a pretext to impose more onerous  restrictions on the right to vote--to try to keep a certain segment of  Americans--making it more difficult for them to vote because they may  be more likely to vote for someone other than Mr. Trump. That is not  what the Attorney General should be doing.   Based on his record, Senator Sessions would work with the Trump  administration to further restrict the right to vote and roll back the  clock on this cherished civil right, which is protected by our  Constitution.   On the issue of immigration, Senator Sessions has a long record where  he has fought against bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform in  the Senate. He led the efforts in 2007 and in 2013 to defeat bipartisan  legislation in the Senate. He used the untruthful ``amnesty'' tag to  describe the tough-but-fair pathway to citizenship in this legislation,  which passed by a 68-to-32 vote in 2013. He has opposed relief for the  DREAMers and has opposed the Delayed Action for Childhood Arrivals-- DACA--program. He supported anti-immigration State laws in Arizona and  elsewhere that the Supreme Court has struck down as unconstitutional.   During the Presidential campaign, Mr. Trump issued a press release  ``calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the  United States.'' Several days later, Senator Leahy offered a resolution  in the Judiciary Committee that stated, ``It is the sense of the Senate  that the United States must not bar individuals from entering the  United States based on their religion, as such action would be contrary  to the fundamental principles of which this nation was founded.'' The  vote was 16 to 4 in favor of the Leahy resolution. Senator Sessions  voted no and spoke against the resolution for nearly half an hour and  concluded by stating that the Leahy resolution ``goes beyond being  unwise. It is reckless. It is absolute and without qualification. It  could have pernicious impacts for decades, even centuries to come. It  may be even a step from the concept of the nation-state to the idea of  `global citizenship.' ''   Barring a religious test of people coming into our Nation would  create that type of a Nation? That is who we are as a Nation. Those are  our core values. We embrace diversity.   Senator Sessions' views are far outside the mainstream and would  unsettle many years of law and precedent that protect individual  religious beliefs. I am gravely concerned about how an Attorney General  Sessions would advise President Trump on the lawfulness of a Muslim  ban. He recently issued his Executive order, which a district court has  put on hold and is now being challenged in the Ninth Circuit. I  cosponsored legislation to rescind President Trump's discriminatory  Executive order barring immigrants from Muslim-majority countries and  suspending the U.S. refugee program.    I am also concerned as to how Attorney General Sessions would advise  the President on matters of immigration. Former Acting Attorney General  Sally Yates was fired and her conduct was called shameful by President  Trump, simply because she was upholding the Constitution, giving her  advice. The President has criticized the ``so-called judge'' who  temporarily stayed his travel ban with an ``outrageous'' decision, and  said that the judge would be blamed if a terrorist attack occurred in  the United States. The Attorney General has to be able to stand up to  even the President with these reckless words and actions. We need an  independent Attorney General who will uphold the Constitution and  recognize that he is not the President's attorney, he is the people's  attorney. I am not convinced that Attorney General Sessions would be  that type of person.   Senator Sessions led the opposition to the nomination of my fellow  Marylander Tom Perez to be the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil  Rights Division at the Department of Justice when President Obama  nominated him in 2009. At the time, Senator Sessions said:         I am also concerned Mr. Perez will not be committed to       fully enforcing our Nation's immigration laws, some I have       worked hard on. We need to create a lawful system of       immigration. . . . He previously served as the President of       the Board of CASA of Maryland, an immigrant advocacy       organization that has taken some extreme views and been       criticized by a number of people in the media. CASA of       Maryland issued a pamphlet instructing immigrants confronted       by the police to remain silent. CASA also promotes day labor       sites. This is where people, often without lawful status,       come and seek work . . . and [they] oppose restrictions on       illegal immigrants receiving drivers' licenses. He was       President of the Board.    That was Senator Sessions' quote. Senator Sessions also commented on  Mr. Perez directly:         I am concerned where Mr. Perez will be in this [running the       Department of Justice Civil Rights Division]. He has been       pretty active politically. When he ran for the Montgomery,       MD, county council he responded to a question asking, `What       would you like the voters to know about you?' Mr. Perez said:       `I am a progressive Democrat and always was and always will       be.' This is a free country and that is all right. I am just       saying, in all fairness, that statement makes me a little       nervous.    Again, quoting from Senator Sessions. The Senate did right by my  friend and colleague Tom Perez. He was confirmed by the Senate to the  Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice by a 72-to-22 vote.  Now, I understand people may have a reason to vote one way or the  other, but the reasons stated by Senator Sessions in regard to Mr.  Perez caused me great, great concern. Senator Sessions again opposed  Mr. Perez when he was later nominated to be Secretary of Labor. In both  of these cases, Senator Sessions' views were far outside the mainstream  on Mr. Perez.   As the senior Senator from Maryland, I know CASA of Maryland. I have  been there. I have seen the people they service. They do extraordinary  work to help the immigrant community. They are not a fringe advocacy  group. While Mr. Perez is a progressive, he is a dedicated public  servant, having been elected by the people of Maryland to the  Montgomery County Council and appointed by President Obama to run the  Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department and later the Labor  Department. Mr. Perez worked to expand the right to vote, protect the  rights of all Americans, and ensure American workers had a decent wage  and employers treated their employees with fairness and respect.   I fear Attorney General Sessions would turn back the clock on so many  civil and worker rights that we hold dear as Americans.   Senator Sessions opposed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate  Crimes Prevention Act. Senator Sessions supported a constitutional  amendment to ban same-sex marriages, opposed the repeal of don't ask,  don't tell in the military, and harshly criticized the Supreme Court's  recent decision legalizing same-sex marriages across the country. He  harshly criticized the Court for redefining a ``sacred and ancient  institution,'' and called the ruling ``part of a continuing effort to  secularize, by force and intimidation'' the Nation. Once again, I fear  an Attorney General Sessions would turn back the clock on LGBT rights  to a  [[Page S850]]  time when individuals would no longer have the legal right to marry the  person they love.   Senator Sessions voted against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, the  Paycheck Fairness Act, title X funding for contraception, breast  screening, and health services for low-income women, and  reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. He voted to defund  Planned Parenthood. I am concerned whether Senator Sessions would  enforce equal rights and protection for women as our next Attorney  General.   Senator Sessions has consistently fought against criminal justice  reform in the Senate and led the effort to defeat the recent bipartisan  proposals that would modestly reduce sentencing disparities and ease  ex-offenders' reentry into society.   Senator Sessions opposed my Ramos and Liu blue alert act due to  fiscal concerns, even though the legislation cost was scored at nominal  or less than $1 million for implementation by CBO. Law enforcement  agencies strongly supported my legislation, which was signed into law  by President Obama in 2015. Blue Alert helps our law enforcement  officers, those who are threatened or endangered or where there has  been an incident. It gives law enforcement the opportunity to apprehend  the suspect in a timely way. It scored nominal or less than $1 million,  and was used by Senator Sessions to block this important tool to help  our law enforcement officers.   Senator Sessions has generally condemned the Department of Justice's  use of its power to investigate law enforcement agencies accused of  misconduct and a ``pattern and practice'' of violating civil rights,  calling consent decrees that mandate reform following these  investigations ``an end run around the democratic process.'' That  causes me concern because that is an important part of what we are  doing in my hometown of Baltimore.   We had a major problem in the Freddie Gray episode. We requested a  pattern and practice investigation. We are now working with the consent  decree. The people of Baltimore and the people of Maryland are anxious  to get this matter moving forward and are anxious to see this consent  order bring a successful conclusion to that recommendation and  investigation.   Senator Sessions led the opposition to Senator Mikulski and my  recommendation of Paula Xinis to be a U.S. district judge for the  District of Maryland in the Judiciary Committee and on the floor. The  Alliance for Justice provided an account of Paula Xinis' confirmation  hearing, which I will quote from at length here.   ``Turning to the nominee of the District Court of Maryland, Paula  Xinis, Senator Sessions unleashed a line of accusatory questions  suggesting that Xinis' career as a public defender and civil rights  lawyer showed an `agenda' that she would invariably `bring to the  bench.' The questions were absurd and unfounded, but they could not be  dismissed as such. Instead, Mrs. Xinis had to patiently explain that  protecting the rights of America's most vulnerable and disenfranchised  had not left her tainted with disqualifying bias.''   ``Senator Sessions felt compelled to verify that someone with Mrs.  Xinis' professional background--which also includes time as a complaint  examiner in the DC Office of Police Complaints--would not be biased  against police officers. After asking her whether `police have a  responsibility to try to maintain an orderly and safe environment for  the people who live in a city' and whether a judge `should show empathy  for the difficulties that police officers face as well as' for those  who allege that police have violated their civil rights. Senator  Sessions closed with this:''   ``Can you assure the police officers in Baltimore and all over  Maryland that might be brought before your court that they'll get a  fair day in court, and that your history would not impact your  decision-making? And I raise that particularly because I see your firm  [Billy Murphy] is representing Mr. Freddie Gray in that case that's  gathered so much attention in Maryland, and there's a lot of law  enforcement officers throughout the state and they want to know that  they don't have someone who has an agenda to bring to the bench--can  you assure them that you won't bring that to the bench?''   ``The implication is clear: If you defend people against criminal  prosecutions, and especially if you represent people in civil rights  cases against police, there is a presumption of bias that you must  rebut before the Judiciary Committee. One wonders whether Senator  Sessions has asked a prosecutor if she would bring to her judicial role  an `agenda' against indigent criminal defendants or if a corporate  defense lawyer would be biased against employees who allege unlawful  discrimination or unpaid wages. I doubt very much he would ask that  same question in that circumstance.''   ``The depth of this double standard is underscored by Senator  Sessions' invoking Freddie Gray in particular. Freddie Gray, of course,  was fatally injured in Baltimore police custody after being arrested  without cause. His death led to grand jury indictments for six officers  on homicide and assault charges, and the Department of Justice opened a  civil rights investigation. Under these circumstances, representing Mr.  Gray's family hardly seems like an act of radical subversion that would  call into question one's ability to be fair, but in Senator Sessions'  view, any challenge to police authority can be done only in pursuit of  some extralegal `agenda.'''   Senator Sessions led the floor opposition to Paula Xinis. I am  pleased to report she was confirmed by the U.S. Senate, and she is now  one of our distinguished members of the District Court of Maryland,  where she serves with great distinction.   Senator Sessions was one of only nine Senators to vote against the  Detainee Treatment Act, which contained the McCain-Feinstein amendment  that prohibits ``cruel, inhumane, and degrading'' punishment for  individuals in American custody. He has left the door open to  reinstating waterboarding as needed. He has opposed shutting down  Guantanamo Bay.   These issues are critically important because we got word of a draft  Executive order that would bring back these types of torture centers-- which are not only a stain on America's reputation, they are  counterproductive and against our values and our law. We expect the  Attorney General of the United States to speak out against such  reprehensible types of proposals.   Thomas Jefferson wrote: ``The most sacred of the duties of government  [is] to do equal and impartial justice to all of its citizens.'' This  sacred duty remains the guiding principle for the women and men of the  U.S. Department of Justice, according to the Justice Web site. I would  urge all of us to keep that in mind.   I regret I do not have confidence that Senator Sessions will carry  out this task so I must oppose his nomination.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
