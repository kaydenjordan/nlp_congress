 Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.J.  Res. 111 to block the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's  arbitration rule.  [[Page H6274]]    The CFPB is charged with protecting consumers from unfair and abusive  behaviors by banks and financial firms. To that end, the CFPB's rules  would prohibit provisions requiring that a bank customer surrender the  right to participate in class actions.   This practice undermines a consumer's right to be compensated for  damages, particularly when they get nickeled and dimed by the fine  print in financial contracts.   Class actions often represent the only realistic option for consumers  who are ripped off to the tune of a few dozen or a few hundred dollars,  and they reduce the burden on the courts by consolidating claims,  thereby saving money for both plaintiffs and defendants.   Opponents of the CFPB's rule hope that, by prohibiting the  consolidation of claims, they can make potential damages so small that  the individual claims are not viable.   Meritorious claims from aggrieved plaintiffs who have suffered actual  damages would go uncompensated, and equally importantly, wrongdoers  would go unpunished.   I urge my colleagues to stand up for consumers and ensure that they  can be fairly compensated by actual damages and wrongdoers punished.
