 Mr. President, the Biden administration inherited both  the COVID-19 public health crisis and the dismantling of the  immigration system from the previous administration.   This amendment would tie the Biden administration's hands in  addressing arrivals at our southern border. It would prevent adapting  to changes in public health needs and making security-based decisions  related to protecting our homeland.   Forcing the indefinite preservation of title 42 authorities raises  both security and humanitarian concerns. This would prevent the  imposition of the consequence-delivery system that cracks down on  individuals who attempt to cross the border repeatedly. We should not  have to expel the same person for illegally crossing the border six or  seven times. We need to expel them once and use tools like removal and  prosecution to limit their ability to keep crossing the border  illegally.   This amendment also reduces the administration's ability to  appropriately care for unaccompanied minors.   We need to ensure that the administration has every tool at their  disposal as they work to tackle the pandemic and keep our Nation  secure.   I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3781
