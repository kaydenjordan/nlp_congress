 I thank my dear colleague and friend, Diane Black,  for her leadership on this most essential issue.   Madam Speaker, if you look behind us on this dais right here, it  says, ``Peace, Liberty, Justice.'' We inscribe these words all around  our Nation's Capitol and on our monuments, but in truth, we cannot find  peace in a society that does not protect its most vulnerable members.  We cannot find liberty when we are indifferent to one another, and we  cannot claim justice when we throw away innocent life.   Madam Speaker, I find it very interesting that the early feminist  movement was pro-life. They saw abortion for what it is: the  abandonment of women. Once an abortion occurs, as Maddie Brinckerhoff,  an early feminist lecturer, once said:         It is evidence by either a lack of education or resources,       she has been greatly wronged.    At the very least, I think, Madam Speaker, we can stand with the vast  majority of Americans and not use our taxpayer dollars to subsidize the  abortion industry and the violence against women.   Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, how much time is remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Colorado has 11 minutes  remaining. The gentlewoman from Tennessee has 30 seconds remaining.   Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).
