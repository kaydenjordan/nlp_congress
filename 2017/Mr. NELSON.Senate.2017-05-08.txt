 Mr. President, I want to talk as well about the  Republican healthcare plan and point out why it is moving on very  treacherous territory when it will affect the funding of Medicaid by  lessening the amount of Medicaid money that will be spent in the  States, because so much of that Medicaid money is going to address the  opioid crisis.   The opioid crisis, we found last year--you know, there was a lot of  talk about it being in New Hampshire when the eyes of America were on  New Hampshire in the New Hampshire primary. But the fact is, it is in  every State now. It is particularly so in my State of Florida. There  are something like 2,600 deaths that have occurred in Florida as a  result of opioid overdoses. So the seriousness with which we are  addressing this issue ought to be of extreme concern, and we ought to  be doing something about it. Yet a bill just passed by the House of  Representatives is doing exactly the opposite. It is going to cut  Medicaid. It is a fancy term, cutting Medicaid with a block grant. What  it means is that it is going to be capped. That means a State is not  going to get any more Medicaid once that cap has been hit, unless the  State responds. So, in essence, it is going to cost the States more  money. I don't think you will find many States that are in such a  fiscal condition that, in fact, they could do that.    So what are we doing? We are harming poor people and the disabled who  get their healthcare from Medicare and Medicaid. In fact, we are not  only harming all of them, but addressing the opioid crisis will be  particularly hurt.   What I want to talk about today is the Republican healthcare plan  that passed out of the House last week. This plan is going to increase  costs for older Americans. Remember, it is going to go on a ratio.  Instead of 1 to 3, or older Americans being charged three times as much  in health insurance as younger Americans, it is going to go up to a  ratio of at least 1 to 5, and maybe more. So it is going to increase  costs for older Americans. It is going to cut Medicaid, and it is going  to take healthcare coverage away from tens of millions of people.   Right now as a result of the ACA, there are 24 million people who  have health insurance coverage who did not have it before this law was  passed in 2010. It is going to reverse that. Do we want to take away  healthcare from people who can now have healthcare through Medicaid  and/or health insurance because they can now afford health insurance?  Is that really a goal the United States wants to do--to take away  healthcare through private health insurance? I don't think that is what  we want to do, but that is what the House of Representatives'  Republican healthcare bill has done.   If we just look at my State of Florida, there are almost 8 million  people who have a so-called preexisting condition. This includes  something as common as asthma. That is a preexisting condition. As a  former elected insurance commissioner of Florida, I can tell you that  some insurance companies would use as an excuse as a preexisting  condition something as simple as a rash and say: Because you have a  preexisting condition, we are not going to insure you. Under the  existing law, the Affordable Care Act, an insurance company cannot deny  you with a preexisting condition. Just in my State alone, there are  almost 8 million people who have a preexisting condition. Are we going  to turn them out on the streets because their insurance company says  they are not going to carry them anymore? I don't think that is what we  want to do.   The bill allows insurers to charge older Americans at least five  times more than what they charge younger adults. Is that what we want  to do?   What is the principle of insurance? The principle of insurance is  that you spread the risk. You get as many people in the pool as you  can--young, old, sick, healthy--and you spread that risk.   If you get fire insurance on your home, you are paying a premium  every month and the insurance company has calculated in an actuarial  calculation what it is going to cost you to insure, and you are part of  hundreds of thousands of people in that pool who are also insuring  against fire damaging their house. It is the same principle with health  insurance. So you get young and old, sick and well, and some people  with preexisting conditions, and you spread that risk over a lot of  people. One of the fallacies we hear is that we can create this by  creating a high-risk pool. In other words, we are going to set up some  money for people who have really sick conditions, and we are going to  take care of them. That is the most inefficient way to do it because  insurance is about spreading risk, not concentrating risk, which is  what a high-risk pool exactly is. So the House of Representatives,  which has concocted this thing called the Republican healthcare plan,  has come up with exactly the opposite idea of funding--instead of  spreading the risk, concentrating the risk, and then saying that they  are going out and getting $8 billion and that is going to pay for it.  It is not even going to touch it. It is the most inefficient way to  approach the subject of spreading risk, because they don't spread the  risk. They concentrate the risk.   What this bill does is that over 10 years it cuts over $800 billion  out of Medicaid. You start doing that, and you are going to lose what  we know of as Medicaid, a healthcare program primarily for the poor and  the disabled.   By the way, isn't it interesting that they cut over $800 billion and  save it out of Medicaid, and what did they do in the same bill? They  give upwards of $600 billion in tax breaks to those who are at the  highest income levels. Let me get this right. It is kind of a reversed  Robin Hood. I am going to take from the poor by cutting $800 billion,  and I am going to give to the rich by tax breaks for the highest income  folks. Is that what we want to do? I don't think so.   Medicaid is a program that guarantees healthcare for millions of  Americans, including children, people with disabilities, pregnant  women, and seniors on long-term care. Think about that. What am I  talking about? It is seniors in long-term care, seniors in nursing  homes, who don't have enough resources or enough assets in order to pay  for their care in their twilight years. Therefore, they are being paid  by Medicaid, and that is the only source of income to take care of  them. Is that what we want to cut in order to give a tax break for the  highest income group? It ought to be the reverse. That is upside-down  thinking.   Last week the Florida Medical Examiners Commission released new data  [[Page S2789]]  showing that over 2,600 Floridians have died from opioids in just the  first half of 2016 alone. Over the entire year before, 2015, fentanyl,  an opioid, killed 705 Floridians. Just in the first half of 2016,  almost the exact same number, 704, died. We have a problem in the State  of Florida, and there are a lot of other States that have the same.   Last month I went to a research institute down in Palm Beach County.  They are using NIH grant money to research new nonaddictive opioid  drugs. If they can come up with this, that is certainly all for the  better to help people with pain and so that they are not being given an  addictive drug. But we are not there yet, and we are using NIH money  that is going into that research.   Last month I sent a letter to the Republican leadership pushing for  more funding for the opioid fight and for the National Institutes of  Health, or NIH.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                           United States Senate,                                     Washington, DC, April 26, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan: As negotiations       over the latest stopgap government funding measure continue,       we urge you to focus on securing substantial funding in the       appropriations legislation currently being negotiated for two       of our most essential national priorities: fighting the       opioid epidemic and investing in our nation's biomedical       research programs.        Every day, 91 Americans die from an opioid overdose, and       despite the tireless work of many in our communities, this       public health epidemic is only getting worse. Currently, only       10 percent of individuals who need specialty treatment for       substance use disorder actually get it--not because we don't       know how to help, but in large part because there aren't       enough funds to provide these services. We need substantial       additional resources to fight this epidemic and fund       prevention, treatment, and recovery activities.        It is also essential that we increase our investment in the       National Institutes of Health (NIH), our nation's premier       research institution. NIH funding supports innovative,       cutting-edge research that plays a critical role in the       development of lifesaving cures for diseases. Our ability to       fight Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, cancer, heart disease,       and many other diseases depends on our willingness to invest       in science. While investments in the NIH have consistently       produced tremendous value, funding for the NIH has failed to       keep pace with inflation over the last several decades.        It is essential to provide new funding to fight the opioid       epidemic and support biomedical research at the NIH. This new       funding should not fill in for cuts made elsewhere to opioid       and NIH funding. It is also essential that opioid funding be       distributed to the communities that need it must and that       have been hardest hit by this terrible public health       epidemic.        While past Congresses have made promises about providing       states with additional funding to address the ongoing opioid       crisis, appropriations legislation like the pending budget       deal is where the bill comes due. Americans are counting on       Congress to live up to its commitments by supporting funding       for the priorities that matter most in their lives. Funding       to fight the opioid epidemic and support research into       lifesaving cures through the NIH rank at the top of this       list, and we urge you to include substantial additional       funding for these areas in the appropriations legislation now       being negotiated.            Sincerely,        Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Bill Nelson, Senator       Benjamin L. Cardin, Senator Tom Udall, Senator Dianne       Feinstein, Senator Debbie Stabenow, Senator Sherrod Brown,       Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Senator Al Franken, Senator Richard       Blumenthal, Senator Edward J. Markey, Senator Chris Van       Hollen, Senator Margaret Wood Hassan, Senator Christopher       Murphy, Senator Joe Manchin III, Senator Tammy Baldwin,       Senator Cory A. Booker, Senator Tammy Duckworth, Senator       Bernard Sanders.     So what we need to do is to take a comprehensive approach  to helping our State and local governments respond to this opioid  epidemic.   I was very happy to be an early part of putting together and  sponsoring a bill called the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act  of 2016 and of the funding included in the 21st Century Cures Act to  start putting more resources into our States right away for this opioid  epidemic. Those laws have resulted in Florida's receiving more than $27  million to help our State respond to the opioid crisis. Yet a lot more  action is needed, as you can see by just the first half of last year  alone, with 704 people dying from opioid overdoses.   Last week, in Florida a local paper reported about how the opioid  epidemic is affecting our Nation's children. In 2015 alone, 167 babies  were born in opioid dependency in just one city--Jacksonville-- contributing to Duval County's being tapped as having the second  highest number of babies born addicted to opioids in the State. Isn't  that sad that children come into this world and they are already  addicted?   We are dealing with people's lives here. We are dealing with their  health. The last thing in the world we ought to be doing is cutting the  resources of funding to help people who are in such dire straits. I  would urge our colleagues to think twice about supporting this  disastrous Republican healthcare bill.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
