 Mr. Speaker, Meghan is a fourth-generation Texas  A&M Aggie. Her decision to attend the prestigious school was never a  question in her mind. It was an amazing experience, until it wasn't.   One morning, while serving as a tutor in the athletic department, a  member of the Fighting Aggies football team twice her size exposed  himself to her not 2 feet away, making sexual advances toward Meghan  and becoming aggressive. Terrified and shocked, she abruptly left the  room, trying to remain calm as he followed her. Unbeknownst to Meghan,  her assailant had done the same thing to another tutor just hours  before.   Mr. Speaker, Meghan feels she did not get justice against her  attacker. Instead, she tells me, she was failed by a university that  was not totally committed to protecting victims.   Meghan was scared of the upcoming process, scared to go back to work,  terrified she might run into this individual again.   Before the hearing, the university claimed she did not need a lawyer;  the assailant wasn't facing any criminal charges. So she didn't hire a  lawyer. But she received no notice that her assailant had hired a  lawyer.   Months later, Meghan's assailant was found not responsible for  exposing himself to both tutors, with the panel stating it appeared he  had a skin condition and simply couldn't control himself.   The response she received was nothing short of appalling. The school  said: Sorry, Meghan, that you were offended, but there is nothing else  we can do.   So she appealed the case. She still believed in the university and  that the university would provide some justice for her. At the appeals  hearing, she was informed that the charge against her attacker had been  downgraded from sexual exploitation to sexual harassment; therefore,  she was removed from the remainder of the hearing.   Doesn't that seem odd, Mr. Speaker?   Also, no one from the university title IX office ever contacted her.  She never received any information regarding what sanctions her  assailant received, if any. Of course, Mr. Speaker, her assailant was  allowed back onto the football team.   Meghan felt abandoned by the university, and she thought the accused  was protected due to his special status.   As a former judge, I agree with Meghan that universities must put the  safety and care of sexual assault victims first, make it a priority.  Together with Carolyn Maloney and Jackie Speier, we have introduced  several pieces of bipartisan legislation to end sexual assault on  campuses.   First, the Bipartisan Campus Accountability and Safety Act,  introduced by Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, does many things,  including establishing a mandatory victim advocate on campus and  ensuring assault situations like Meghan's do not occur.   Second, the HALT Campus Sexual Violence Act, which will be introduced  this week by Congresswoman Jackie Speier and me, makes sure that the  universities do not shirk their legal responsibilities when responding  to sexual assault crimes.  [[Page H6268]]    Texas A&M is not alone in this fight to provide a voice for victims.  According to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, each year  one in five women will be assaulted while in college. That is a  staggering statistic.   Mr. Speaker, Meghan said it best: ``A&M has a chance to be fearless  on every front and to be fearless in the face of such horrible things  that are happening to victims.''   I applaud Meghan for having the courage to come forward and publicly  tell her story to the world. Other victims who have been suffering in  silence have been inspired to come forward and rally the cause, forming  an organization called the 12th Woman, a group of determined women  dedicated to stopping sexual assault on our university campuses.   This is not a question of loyalty and pride in Texas A&M. It is a  call to action. The 12th Woman is relentless in bringing change to the  way universities address sexual assault not just at A&M, but across the  United States.   Mr. Speaker, Congress needs to listen to Meghan and her band of  sisters and do what is necessary to make sure our universities are safe  from sexual assault on campus.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, North Korea's nuclear program is  perhaps the greatest threat to U.S. national security, but we must  never forget the horrendous plight of the North Korean people.   Little Kim and his dynasty are guilty of some of the worst human  rights abuses in human history. Freedom of religion and freedom of  speech do not exist in North Korea. Christians are routinely arrested,  tortured, imprisoned, and executed, their families sent to prison camps  for ``guilt by association.''   Reports estimate that almost 130,000 political prisoners are  suffering brutal conditions in highly secret work camps around North  Korea. Systematic murder, torture, rape, forced abortions, starvation,  and overwork are leading to countless deaths every day, and the Kim  regime is giving no signs of relenting.   Despite any nuclear agreement, we must make it clear that the United  States will never waiver in its support for basic human dignity of the  North Korean people.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
