 Madam President, the West Fargo, ND, dance team,  the Packatahnas, has returned home from the National Dance Team  Competition in Florida as national high kick champions.   This comes after winning championship titles competing this year with  the Class A Large Varsity schools in North Dakota. It is always cause  for celebration when students bring home a championship title, but this  year's award is one of several the team has won.   After more than eight high kick first place finishes at the State  level in the past 25 years, the Packatahnas were back-to-back national  champions in 2006 and 2007. Now 14 years later and after finishing  ahead of 22 other national teams, it has been especially meaningful for  these teammates to place another trophy in the school's award case.   The passion, dedication, and time the Packatahnas devote to their  dance team season rival that of other high school student athletes. For  several hours every day, they first work to develop their routines.  Then it is practice, practice, and more practice until they are ready  for competition.   At their side throughout this year was their coach, Shayla Pennick,  whom they credit for her commitment to them in this successful season.  Shayla knows the thrill they feel as champions because she competed  with  [[Page S1154]]  the team when the Packatahnas finished at the top 14 years ago. She  deserves recognition and thanks for sharing her time and talents to  help another team go as far as her high school team did.   Madam President, I join the West Fargo High School, the city of West  Fargo, and the rest of North Dakota in congratulating these talented  Packatahnas for finishing their season as champions. They are an  inspiration to all of us by demonstrating the good that can come from  combining a passion for excellence with plenty of hard work.                            ____________________
