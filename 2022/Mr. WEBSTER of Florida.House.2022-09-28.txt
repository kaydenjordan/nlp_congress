 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, first, I thank Chairman DeFazio for working with us on  this particular bill, the Global Aircraft Maintenance Safety  Improvement Act.   I am pleased that H.R. 7321, as amended, ensures the level of safety  we all expect in a way that is consistent with our bilateral safety  agreements and collaborative with foreign civil aviation authorities.   International buy-in and collaboration are key if we are to chart a  real path forward on aviation safety, and this bill strives to do that.   Notably, this legislation has markedly improved since last Congress,  and I, again, want to thank the chair and his staff for working with us  in a bipartisan manner.   Under H.R. 7321, our domestic repair stations will not be exposed to  retaliation by other countries, nor will American jobs be jeopardized.   Again, improving oversight of foreign repair stations without  damaging our standing and partnerships in the international community  is the goal here today. This is another example of our bipartisan  commitment to aviation safety.   Madam Speaker, I urge support, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, in closing, H.R. 7321, as  amended, continues our commitment to the traveling public by ensuring  aviation safety on the international playing field.   Madam Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3482, as amended, creates the National Center for  the Advancement of Aviation, a private, not-for-profit organization  dedicated to bringing government and aviation stakeholders together to  address aviation workforce issues.   United States aviation supports 11.3 million direct jobs and  facilitates more than a trillion dollars in economic activity, which  represents more than 5 percent of gross domestic product.   Every industry is feeling the pinch of labor shortages, and the  reality is that self-help measures undertaken by the aviation industry  are not enough to ensure advancement of the aerospace industry. We must  address the growing aviation workforce shortage to ensure our domestic  aerospace industry maintains its global competitive advantage.   This bipartisan legislation has widespread support across the  aviation industry, and I acknowledge that this bill was passionately  supported, as has been said, by the dean of the House, Don Young.   Mr. Speaker, in order to ensure our Nation's aviation dominance, we  must work forcefully to address the looming shortfall of aviation  workforce. Having a properly trained and dedicated workforce to meet  the near-term and future capacities needed in the aviation sector is  crucial to the underpinning of the high standard of safety that sets  America apart from the rest.   H.R. 3482, as amended, supplements the FAA's safety-focused mission  by ensuring just that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5641, the SPEED Recovery Act, is a bipartisan bill  that cuts red tape and helps expedite disaster recovery efforts,  especially in small and rural areas. This legislation updates what the  Federal Emergency Management Agency considers a small project.   The bill already passed the House in April, as has been said, and  today, it returns with a reasonable amendment from the Senate and adds  a report by the inspector general of Homeland Security to help ensure  that there is no fraud, waste, and abuse.   Increasing the small project threshold allows communities to recover  faster and allows FEMA to focus more of their time and resources on  larger, more complex projects that represent 90 percent of the disaster  costs.   I have heard from communities in my district about paperwork burdens  and increasing denials over technicalities, and I hope the commonsense  adjustments of this bill will improve this process.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico  (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.   Today, I rise again in support of H.R. 5641, the SPEED Recovery Act,  which is bipartisan legislation introduced by Ranking Member Graves  that passed the House in April.   This bill cannot be timelier as Puerto Rico is once again dealing  with the effects of yet another major disaster, Hurricane Fiona, while  also communities in Florida are facing Hurricane Ian as we speak.   We do have a lot of experience in those small projects that are never  done because of the red tape or the long procedures that need to be  dealt with between municipalities and FEMA.   Too often, cities and municipalities face the burden of rising costs  of material and labor, which means that the cost estimate for  relatively simple projects, such as street repairs, now surpasses the  threshold for what is defined as a small project.   Today, $123,000 hardly covers the most trivial work, and we can talk  about that. I mean, we still have a lot of those small projects since  Hurricane Maria that are not being done, and now, many of those  projects were hit by Hurricane Fiona. Although the money is there, the  process is so big that even the initial amount won't cover those  repairs.   We have had cases where there may have been resources to start and  finish promptly, but because of the price tag, we are forced to go  through a more complicated process with FEMA, which can take years,  years in which the people wonder when they will see the work.   When a community does not see even small things taken care of, that  weakens the social fabric and promotes displacement.                                time  1730    We cannot afford to keep going through that again. We have a  responsibility to make the Federal Government more efficient,  particularly in times of need.   By increasing the threshold for eligibility for small projects,  including adjustments for inflation, this bill will simplify that  process, reducing administrative burdens, resulting in faster start of  work and allowing more recovery projects to move forward.   Mr. Speaker, I support this commonsense bipartisan legislation, and I  urge all Members to support the Senate amendments and send them to the  President's desk. Across the Nation, our communities will need it.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume to close.   The amendments to H.R. 5641, the SPEED Recovery Act, is reasonable  and will help to strengthen accountability.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Senators Portman and Peters, who are the  bipartisan leaders of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs. Without their leadership in the Senate to push  forward this measure, we would not be here today.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who also helped  by being engaged in this particular issue.   Finally, I thank our great staff on both sides to get this bill to  the finish line, especially my subcommittee staff director, Johanna  Hardy and Maddy McCaslin.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this important legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, ensuring the safety of the traveling public is of  critical importance to this Committee. To ensure aviation safety, the  Federal Aviation Administration regulates airport firefighting  standards and requires airports to regularly test firefighting  equipment.   Currently, the fire suppressant foam required to be used at airports  contains PFAS. While FAA is working closely with the Department of  Defense to come up with an alternative that is just as effective at  suppressing jet fuel fires, there is still work to be done before that  alternative is made available.   Given that, this bill ensures that airports are able to acquire  equipment to test firefighting vehicles, in compliance with FAA  regulations, without discharging PFAS-laden foam.   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill passed the Senate unanimously, and  I urge support. This legislation is a good piece of legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, S. 3662 is a minor  adjustment of an AIP cost share to remove any barriers an airport might  have for acquiring firefighting testing equipment.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the bill and I yield back the balance  of my time.
