 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the passage of  the Speak Out Act.   As the co-chair of the Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence,  I have seen how perpetrators of workplace sexual assault and harassment  hide behind nondisclosure agreements to sweep their heinous conduct  under the rug.   Let's remember that the vast majority of assault and harassment in  the workplace goes unreported, and most perpetrators are never held  accountable. It takes tremendous courage for survivors to come forward.   I am so proud that under the leadership of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, this  House overwhelmingly passed the Speak Out Act yesterday, and we have  sent this commonsense, bipartisan bill to the President's desk.                            ____________________
