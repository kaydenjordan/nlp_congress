 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate an  extraordinary talent and force in the world of college football, LSU's  Jayden Daniels, the recipient of this year's Heisman Trophy.   Jayden's journey has been remarkable, defined by grit, determination,  and a love for the game. Winning the Heisman is not just a personal  victory, it is a testament to the countless hours of hard work,  sacrifice, and unwavering support of your teammates and coaches.   It truly takes a village.   Jayden's skill on the field has captivated fans, and his leadership  has inspired generations of future athletes.   As Jayden holds this coveted trophy, may he know that he has etched  his name in football history and Louisiana history. Mr. Speaker, I  congratulate Jayden on this well-deserved honor. I know it will be a  stepping stone to even greater heights.                               The City of Love     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  pastoral anniversary of Bishop Lester Love and Pastor Fran Love.  Twenty-five years of faithful leadership have shaped The City of Love  into a beacon of hope and inspiration.   Bishop Lester Love has shepherded The City of Love with a clear  vision. His exemplary leadership has not only guided his congregation  but has become a blueprint for leadership excellence in churches and  corporations alike.   Alongside him, Prophet Fran Love, a woman of unwavering faith, has  demonstrated her commitment to social justice through initiatives like  the Daughters of Life and Love, DOLL. I admire her active devotion to  uplifting others and serving mankind and womankind.   Together, they have led The City of Love with passion and a  commitment to community service. Their outreach organization, LOVE365,  has touched thousands of lives.   Beyond the pulpit, Bishop Lester Love and Prophet Fran Love have  become pillars of support for the greater New Orleans community. Their  influence extends far beyond the walls of The City of Love, reaching  into the hearts and lives of those they touch.   As I congratulate this remarkable couple, I also express my gratitude  for their friendship and guidance.   May the next chapter of your journey be filled with continued  blessings and fulfillment for the mission of love and the people that  you serve.         Awarding Congressional Gold Medal to Montford Point Marines     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  valor and resilience of the Montford Point Marines whose invincible  spirit has left a permanent mark on our Nation's history.   Eighty years in the making, eight courageous New Orleanians received  the Congressional Medal of Honor this November, a long overdue  recognition of their pivotal role as the first African Americans to  join the Marines.   Their names are:   Private First Class Granville ``Jack'' Alexander, Sr.   First Sergeant Nolan A. Marshall, Sr.   Staff Sergeant Charles E. Allen, Sr.   Corporal George A. Dupre, Sr.   Private First Class, Andrew J. LeBlanc.   Staff Sergeant Melvin O. Parent, Sr.   Sergeant Gilbert Smith, Sr.; and   Private First Class Lloyd B. Wills, Sr.   These heroes who fought to fight for America and made a way from no  way, faced adversity head-on and did it with pride and honor.    Barred from the national marines boot camp, they persevered at  Montford Point, enduring grueling training and overcoming the stigma  that African Americans couldn't serve as marines. They not only served  honorably, but they blazed a trail for 20,000 African Americans who  followed in their footsteps.   In 1949, Montford Point was decommissioned but their legacy endures.  Their sacrifice paved the way for diversity and inclusion in the Marine  Corps, and we proudly embrace their history and their service today.   Thank you for your incredible service.   God bless you, and God bless America.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank Ranking Member Scott for  his time and leadership in this matter.   I rise today in opposition to this bill. Monday night, the Rules  Committee considered my amendment, amendment No. 16, to H.R. 1147,  which would have provided an alternative, a healthy alternative to our  young people, people that cannot digest milk.   I heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle suggest that  this was a choice. Well, if there were a choice, then why not add soy  as a choice. Soy gives the equivalent of the nutritional values as  whole milk, but it does not have the negative impact that whole milk  has on a large swath of people in our community.   I will tell you those numbers. Ninety-five percent of Native  Americans have lactose intolerance. Ninety percent of African Americans  are lactose intolerant. Sixty-five percent of Latino Americans are, in  fact, lactose intolerant. Asian Americans, 90 percent. These are real  numbers. This is not about taste. This is not about profit. This is not  about bottom line. This is not about a powerful lobby. This is about  the safety, nutrition, and well-being of our young people.   We cannot ignore the impact that ingesting or attempting to digest  things that your body cannot and what impact it has on one's ability to  concentrate or do well in the classroom.   My colleagues and I formed a diverse group, represented by chairs of  the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the Asian Pacific American Caucus,  and a vice chair of the Congressional Black Caucus respectively. We all  firmly believe that the full House should be allowed to debate this  important measure, making sure that we were given the opportunity on  the floor to debate this amendment. I believe if given the opportunity  to be heard, even the other side could have and would have been able to  support.   What is most perplexing is how this amendment aligns with the purpose  of the underlying bill, to expand choice and to deliver healthy  beverages to the school counter. Our amendment is based on the text of  my bill, H.R. 1619, the ADD SOY Act. It amends the Richard B. Russell  National School Lunch Program to strike the onerous ``milk note''  requirement and to stipulate that the USDA reimburse school districts  to make a plant-based dietary alternative that is nutritionally  equivalent to cow's milk available in school. Yes, a choice, a real  choice.   When Congress enacted the milk mandate 80 years ago, the United  States was less diverse, and we did not understand the exact science  surrounding lactose intolerance. Between 70 to 90 percent of African  Americans today are lactose intolerant. Ninety percent of Asians, 95  percent of Native Americans, and 65 percent of Latinos are, in fact,  lactose intolerant.   The National Institutes of Health reports the majority of all people  have reduced ability to digest lactose after infancy, and it adds that  it is also very common in people from West Africa, Arab, Jewish, Greek,  and Italian descent.   Currently, if a student wants a nutritionally equivalent alternative  to milk, they need to get a doctor's note or parent's note to obtain a  plant-based beverage. Oftentimes, parents are working two jobs.  Oftentimes, unfortunately, parents don't pay as much attention or are  as in tune and have an opportunity to get to the school or even have  healthcare to go to a doctor to get a note. Should that child still be  punished and forced to drink something that their body simply cannot  digest?   How do you concentrate in the classroom when you are drinking and  attempting to digest something that your body cannot? What happens to  that child when they belly up to the desk and have to study or pay  attention but their body is telling them that they have eaten something  that does not agree with them? It causes a problem. It causes ridicule.  It causes the ability or inability to concentrate and perform at their  highest level. Because of this high barrier to entry, kids often don't.  Many skip school or don't do well in school as an alternative.   If 75 percent of African Americans are lactose intolerant, which is  true in my family, why should three-quarters of kids have to get a  note. It is not a medical disability to be African American. It is not  a medical disability to be Vietnamese American. It is not a disability  to be Native American. It is not a disability to be Latino.    Lactose intolerance is genetic. This isn't complicated. Kids should  be given  [[Page H6891]]  a healthy fluid beverage option that doesn't make them sick. Our  amendment would have provided a sensible solution. Allow the USDA to  reimburse school districts for soy milk, which so far is the only  plant-based milk that has been recognized under the latest formulation  of the 2020 American Dietary Guidelines to be healthy and nutritionally  equivalent to cow's milk.   Moreover, there is a primary reason that more than half of all milk  given to children is thrown into a cafeteria trash can unused, carton  after carton after carton of discarded cartons of milk that have never  been opened. At some point kids realize it isn't good for them and they  don't drink it. Whatever nutritional value you thought you were  affording by giving milk doesn't happen if young people can't consume  or digest it.   Many kids don't want milk because it makes them sick. According to  the USDA, 29 percent of cartons of cow milk served in our schools are  thrown into the garbage unopened. This comes out to be somewhere around  $300 million in annual waste of taxpayer funds for milk cartons. It is  clear that not only is it a food waste issue but a failure on the NSLP  to supply food to kids that are consumed and meet their daily  nutritional requirement. The present rate of food waste and taxpayer  losses is not acceptable.                                time  1415    Mr. Chair, I ask whether my Republican colleagues think it is a good  policy. Is that good stewardship of our tax dollars? Is that delivering  good health outcomes for all kids?   If they believe it is, then they should agree and recognize that  adding a true alternative is a good thing. I remind my colleagues that  it is not a medical condition to be Black, Latino, Asian, Jewish, or  other ethnicities.   This is an issue of racial equity and inclusion, as well as  tightening government spending and waste. It is both a matter of  squandering tax dollars and a matter of fairness. The kids who have the  least and who have the most difficulty raising their voices are being  denied a food staple that they simply cannot stand.   We must fix this. Let us strive to do better for the next generation  and equip them with the nutritional sustenance at the lunch counter  that can give them an opportunity to not just survive but thrive.   Mr. Chair, I implore you to think about the children. Don't think  about the profits. Don't think about the lobby. Don't think about the  efforts of a winner or loser. Let's put children first.   Let's make sure that we, as a Congress, recognize the value of  fighting for those who have not been given the opportunity to fight for  themselves.   Add soy. Create true alternatives. Do not force people to digest  things that their bodies simply cannot.   Mr. Chair, it is for this reason and this reason solely that I cannot  support this measure without true alternatives.
