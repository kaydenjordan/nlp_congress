 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment to H.R. 1873 ensures that we  make up-front vegetation management planning a requirement for  utilities that hold transmission rights-of-way on public lands.   I agree with Mr. LaMalfa's intent to address the threats of  wildfires. Coming from local government, as the former county  supervisor for Santa Barbara, I have experienced firsthand the  obstacles and challenges of balancing red tape and coordination among  stakeholders.   Now, as the Representative for the Central Coast in California, I can  tell you, we are no strangers to wildfires. Just last year, my district  witnessed the devastating impacts of the Rey and Sherpa fires.   Unfortunately, the impacts of these wildfires are widespread. The  Sherpa fire burned 7,474 acres in Santa Barbara County and the Los  Padres National Forest for nearly a month last June. Then in January of  this year, the heavy rains in the area triggered mudslides and  flooding.   If we can take action to prevent wildfires, we should. We know it  pays to be prepared. Congress needs to act to improve better  coordination and clarity between Federal and land managers and utility  companies that hold rights-of-way on public lands. In improving  coordination, we can help utilities prevent fires due to overgrown  vegetation or trees contacting power lines.   In turn, it would help the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land  Management respond more quickly and consistently for requests to access  and maintain rights-of-way on public lands. At the same time, the  agencies can function as good stewards of our natural resources while  enhancing their effectiveness in addressing fire hazard vegetation.   While well-intentioned, H.R. 1873 does not solve the problem of poor  coordination.   Mr. Chairman, the underlying bill does not address the threats of  wildfires because the rights-of-way maintenance plans described in the  legislation are voluntary. Currently, owners of transmission lines can  work with the Federal land managers to develop these plans. This is no  different than the status quo.   That is why I introduced my amendment to ensure that we make up-front  planning a requirement for utilities.                                time  1545    I urge passage of my amendment to make sure that we are prepared and  minimize the threats of wildfires.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, unfortunately, this bill is in search of a  problem. Voluntary is the status quo. That is the case today, and we  see the wildfires happen day in and day out. So, again, I urge my  colleagues to support my amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
