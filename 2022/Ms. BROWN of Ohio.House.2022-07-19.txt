 Madam Speaker, it has been more than 3 weeks since  the Supreme Court ignored the constitutional right to privacy that  guaranteed women could make their own reproductive health decisions.  Now, States are encouraged to restrict or ban abortion and birth  control.   We are now witnessing the horrifying consequences of an extreme  agenda to criminalize women's reproductive health decisions, including  the arrest of doctors.   Americans overwhelmingly support protecting women's reproductive  rights, and I stand here today to affirm their voices and carry out  their will.   Last week, House Democrats passed two strong bills to defend women's  right to decide. This week, we will once again ensure progress, not  regression, when we pass the Right to Contraception Act.   Far-right extremists continue to wage an all-out war to control  women's reproductive rights, but we will continue to put people over  politics and ensure birth control access for all.                            ____________________
