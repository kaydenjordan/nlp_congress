 Madam Speaker, I have been speaking a little bit lately  about our supply chain issues and the effects of inflation on real  Americans, real families, and talking a lot about food grown in this  country and the effects of some of the decisions made by government on  the ability to grow food, especially in my home State of California,  which affects so much of the supply chain for fruits, vegetables, and  nut products that the whole country, and even the world export market,  enjoys and uses.   What we are wrestling with right now are decisions made by Federal  and State agencies on the effects of water supply in California and the  ripple effect it has on so many products.   For example, earlier this year, a decision was made to withdraw what  is called a TUCP, a temporary urgency change petition, for the amount  of water that would be flowing from our storage in California out  through the delta and into the Pacific. This is geared toward how much  water is going to be there for delta salinity and fish habitat  situations in the delta and upstream, somewhat.   There was an opportunity back in December and January to curtail some  of the water flows that were coming out of limited storage we already  have in the State of California, mainly Shasta Dam and Oroville Dam,  this on the heels of a drought last year.   Lake Oroville, for example, hit its lowest number ever. It didn't  even make hydropower for the first time in 50 years because the lake  was so low.   So, decisions were made based on a pretty decent amount of rainfall  in October and quite a bit of rain and snowpack in December to withdraw  what was called the TUCP, the temporary urgency change petition, which  would have the ability to let less water out through the delta and a  little less for the salinity and fish habitat issues.   By the way, the fish, one of the ones we are talking about, is called  the delta smelt. They haven't found one, in what they call trawls  looking for the fish, in 3 years. They are pretty much nonexistent.  Yet, we are still allowing hundreds of thousands of acre-feet of  precious water to go out through the bay to somehow try to mitigate  that situation.   They decided to withdraw the change petition, the TUCP, a decision  made on January 21, to say we are going to go ahead and let the water  flow at a higher level than is necessary. Water will be trickling out  of our dams, out of our storage, at a rate much more than is needed for  a perception of salinity or fish.   At the time when we are looking at drought in California, low water  supplies, and all the unrest we have in the world's food supply chain-- Hungary, for example, is not going to export grain this year. Russia  and Ukraine had been world market participants in grain, especially  Ukraine.   Ukraine is a very, very rich country in wheat and many other ag  products. Their farmers, right now, are out there trying to plant crops  amidst all the bombs being dropped on them by Russia. God bless them.  But farmers in this country are having bombs dropped on them by Federal  and State agencies taking their water away.   At a point where we could have curtailed a little bit of the water  going out through the delta and kept it for ag use to grow rice, to  grow almonds, to grow olives, to grow tomatoes, many things that we  need, they decided on January 21, no, we are just going to let the  water go out at the same rate.   At that point, Lake Shasta was only at 35 percent of its capacity.  Lake Oroville was only at 45 percent of its capacity. They thought,  well, we are going to bank on the idea that more rain is going to come  post-January 21 up until maybe April 1, when, historically, the  rainfall tapers off.   These lakes are both well under half full. They decided, no, we have  plenty of water because we had a massive amount of rain and snow in  December. I mean, they threw the baby out with the bathwater, so to  speak, in making this decision because anybody could have seen that we  needed to keep every drop in those lakes that is coming in there to  build them up.   Now, had they reached the flood stage where they have to allow a  buffer of space in the dams to provide for flood control, which is  approximately about 850 feet of elevation in Oroville and, I am going  to guess, about 70, 75 percent of capacity--they are well below that.  They thought, oh, we are going to have so much water coming in that we  will meet these marks.   Well, guess what? The rain did not come in the latter part of January  or February or March, and now we are in the first few days of April.   Here at this point, we are going to be short on food, short on water,  and they are just now thinking about putting the TUCP in here in early  April. It is very shortsighted and appalling.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, our strategic oil reserves are meant to be  for emergency use, an emergency resource in time of war or other  disaster.   At such an uncertain time that we have, with Eastern Europe embroiled  in a big conflict, it would be wise for us to keep the reserve full.   Indeed, President Trump filled the reserve up at the time when prices  were low on fuel. Now, President Biden thinks that by releasing this  oil, it is going to somehow affect the price of oil  [[Page H4202]]  around the world and our own economy. It is not.   So far, 80 million barrels have already been released, but it hasn't  driven down prices. Instead, the reserves we have in the ground that  oil people can produce for us are the things that are going to change  oil prices, not tapping into our reserves.   There is only going to be a few days' worth to run the country on, or  bleeding it out over 180 days, 1 million barrels at a time.   Tap into our energy we have so abundantly in this country. That will  affect the market for us, for our allies in Europe, and actually truly  make a big difference, instead of playing this little game with our oil  reserves that doesn't do anything other than look like we are doing  something.   Let's get back to work on putting Americans to work and our energy  dependability on us and not on others. I ask the President to change  directions on this policy.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  471, the PAUSE Act, to protect all Americans from Biden's border  crisis.    Mr. Speaker, President Biden recently announced his  fiscal year 2023 budget, the proposal includes a plan to spend $73  trillion in a 10-year period that will add $15 trillion to our national  debt; this at a time when government spending is already driving  inflation and making all these items that much more expensive: Airline  fares, lodging, gas, the cost of automobiles, new or used.   I stopped in at a dealer the other day and they are finding that  people are actually willing to pay more for a used  [[Page H4386]]  car than what the car cost new, or trucks. It is crazy.   So the American people are suffering right now under these economic  conditions, all man-caused, all government-caused, pretty much.   So with record-breaking inflation and gas prices, we are, instead,  having a budget that is crafted to not combat these issues, but add to  them. It radicalizes our energy in the new Green Deal that these guys  want to do, making more cost, making energy even less available to  Americans.   It includes zero mention of resuming the Keystone Pipeline, since  that was something on the first day of office they decided to put a  stop to.   The budget should be focused on getting people back to work, to  making America thrive, combating inflation, not causing it;  strengthening our energy independence, which will bring prices down,  not playing around with the strategic reserve and, you know, bleeding  out a million barrels per day.   That strategic reserve has a purpose, and it isn't playing economics  with it; it is supposed to be there for, indeed, a time of crisis for  our country.   So, instead of relying on Russian oil and relying on other imported  oil from Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, whoever, we can do our own national  oil independence with our own known reserves.   So, the direction the Biden administration is taking with all this  spending, it is starting to mimic my home State of California really,  because our regulatory and tax policies there are already the model for  what not to do. The Federal Government shouldn't follow that.   So let's come back to common sense. I urge President Biden and the  Democrats to not adopt this giant spending plan but move in a direction  of getting people back into production again. Come out of this COVID  crisis, put them back to work, have our economy thrive, with our energy  independence, food independence, because California's ag situation is  being decimated by the water being taken away.   I asked the President to help us on this. Help us grow food in this  country and get prices back down and not have empty shelves. That  should be focus of how you help American people, not more crazy  spending.
