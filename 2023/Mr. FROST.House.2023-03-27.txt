 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I am furious, angry that  three kids died today in Nashville, Tennessee; angry that hundreds of  parents had to cry their eyes out today not knowing if their child  would come home from school; and angry that we have to live day after  day when we turn on the news to see rampant gun violence claiming life  after life.   All of this is because of politicians in this Chamber that have been  bought and paid for by the NRA, that put profits over people, over  human lives, cowards who wasted our time last week passing a parental  bill of rights, not giving a damn about the rights of children to be  able to go to their classroom without the fear of being gunned down due  to senseless gun violence.   It is likely that, at this moment, the next mass shooter is planning  their shooting. What will this Chamber do about it?   I filed my first bill last week to simply create a Federal office of  gun violence prevention. Three kids are dead today, and every day that  we wait, 100 more people die.    I pray to God that there are some Republicans in this Chamber who can  help support my legislation to save lives.                            ____________________
