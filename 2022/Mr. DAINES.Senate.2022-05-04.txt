 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that,  notwithstanding the previous order, it be in order to offer my motion  to instruct at this time.    Mr. President, I call up my motion to instruct conferees,  which is at the desk.    Mr. President, if we have learned anything over the past  few months, it is the importance of supporting ``Made in America''  energy.   Since Europe has divested in traditional energy, Vladimir Putin has  weaponized it and has Europe over a barrel. This is the path America is  headed down if the administration continues to stonewall traditional  American energy development.   For the sake of our national security, we must unleash American  energy production, which includes an ``all of the above'' energy  portfolio with renewables, hydropower, oil, gas, nuclear, and coal.  Energy security is national security, and a global, energy-dominant  America is a safer world.   We should also not be sending money to China like the House bill does  in a package that is meant to help us win the race against China. It  just doesn't make sense.   I urge my colleagues to support this motion to instruct and reject  the provisions from the House that weaken the energy security of the  United States.
