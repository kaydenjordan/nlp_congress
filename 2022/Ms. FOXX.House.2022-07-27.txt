 Mr. Speaker, the Biden administration is canceling massive  amounts of student debt. Many borrowers have seen thousands of dollars  of debt canceled through Biden's actions, and that is just the start.  The administration is getting ready to hand out more money courtesy of  taxpayers.   So, for the two-thirds of Americans who never earned a degree, where  is your money? Where is the money for the construction worker in North  Carolina or the stay-at-home mom in Tennessee? Why should these  Americans pay for someone else's degree when they never went to  college?   You know who is getting the money, though? Doctors, lawyers, and  graduate students. Many of these borrowers will receive $100,000 or  more.   It is unfair for taxpayers to pay the debts of lawyers and doctors  who earn six figures.   By appeasing the progressives, President Biden is throwing the middle  class under the bus.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, when it comes to bailouts, Congress just can't seem to  help itself. Under President Biden, taxpayers have been forced to  bankroll the so-called American Rescue Plan which included an uncapped  bailout for failing and insolvent multi-employer pensions.   From footing the bill for this excessive government spending to  record-high gas prices, taxpayers can't catch a break in Biden's  America, and today we are considering another bailout that will force  taxpayers to cover the tab for failed, privately run pensions.   What message does this send to the men and women who have their own  retirement accounts to worry about or have no retirement accounts at  all?   More pension bailouts set a damning precedent. In case anyone has  forgotten, we work for hardworking taxpayers in this country. As  Members of Congress we have an obligation to ensure that taxpayer  dollars are being spent as efficiently and effectively as possible.  Unfortunately, too many ignore this important duty and are happy to  mortgage the future of the next generation with reckless spending.    On top of the price tag, there have been no hearings and no markups  on H.R. 6929.   Is this the standard the House wants to operate under--one where any  piece of legislation can be fast-tracked to the floor without due  consideration and scrutiny?   Under Democrat control, good governance has long been abandoned in  the people's House.   In 2009, when Delphi Corporation completed its 4-year bankruptcy, its  defined benefit pension plans were terminated and taken over by the  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, PBGC, a process that has been  well-established. At that time, the Delphi pension plans were  collectively underfunded by $7.2 billion. Delphi did not make required  contributions to its pension plans in the 4 years it was moving through  bankruptcy. The salaried employee plan, in particular, was only 48  percent funded with $2.4 billion in assets and liabilities of $5  billion.   Fast forward to today, and we are considering a bill that would dole  out money like candy. Under this bill, participants would receive a  retroactive lump-sum payment, or ``top-up,'' of the difference between  what was paid by PBGC and what the plans would have paid had they not  been terminated.   But here is the kicker, Madam Speaker: this top-up would come with an  additional 6 percent interest, and all participants would receive their  original monthly benefits moving forward.   Let's turn our attention to the precedent that this bill sets for the  entire single-employer pension system. Currently, PBGC's single- employer insurance program is funded exclusively by premiums paid by  employer plan sponsors and does not--does not--receive taxpayer  dollars. PBGC is the trustee of over 5,000 terminated single-employer  plans.   Madam Speaker, please pay attention to this next part. By topping up  one plan, Congress will be pressured and expected to top up the  remaining 5,000 terminated plans and every future terminated plan.   How many plans does PBGC currently insure?   More than 23,000 active, single-employer plans are currently insured.   So, Madam Speaker, what is next on the docket?   Should Congress roll up its sleeves and make whole every American's  401(k) plan that took a few hits?   Again, how about Americans who do not have a pension plan?   There are many of those. Imagine the harebrained schemes that  Congress could start pulling out of its hat if given this  encouragement. We should be protecting taxpayers, not feeding them to  the wolves.   This bill is a slap in the face to fiscal responsibility. H.R. 6929's  cash giveaway will force taxpayers to shoulder a  [[Page H7214]]  cost of $800 million over the next decade and $1.3 billion in all to  bail out underfunded, privately run pension plans.   Another bailout of failing pension plans does nothing but stick it to  hardworking taxpayers. This bill simply underscores the fact that  Congress is too misguided to focus on real issues.   Madam Speaker, hardworking taxpayers cannot afford more senseless  bailouts. Enough is enough.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Keller).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Turner).    Madam Speaker, my colleagues say we are here to help  people. Our first job is like the doctor's oath: First, do no harm.  This bill does harm.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Davidson).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Madam Speaker, proponents of H.R. 6929 continue to cite the  statistics that the salaried employee pension plan was 86 percent  funded in 2009 and, therefore, should not have been terminated. This is  misleading and simply not the case.   When the salaried employee plan was terminated in 2009, it was  roughly 50 percent funded with $2.4 billion in assets and $5 billion in  liabilities. Delphi had not made required contributions to the plan in  the previous 4 years.   Further, Delphi was moving through bankruptcy proceedings, and the  company stated publicly it was unable to fund its pension plans before  reaching an agreement with PBGC to terminate the plans.   Delphi had not made required contributions to the pension plans in  the 4 years it was in bankruptcy proceedings. Delphi was liquidating  assets in bankruptcy, and the plan had only enough assets to pay for  half of its benefit obligations.   Finally, if the Delphi salaried employee plan was truly as well  funded as proponents suggest, then why did it not have enough assets to  cover the benefits owed to workers and retirees?   Madam Speaker, this is a big problem for the taxpayers of this  country when we start bailing out pension plans in this way. We have a  process through the PBGC, and that process should be followed.   Madam Speaker, it is important, really important, to make sure the  Record is accurate. Most Delphi salaried pension plan participants who  are being discussed today either received no cuts in their pensions or  saw cuts of less than 10 percent.   PBGC typically becomes a trustee of a single-employer plan when the  employer that sponsors the plan declares bankruptcy and the plan has  insufficient assets from which to pay all promised benefits. When PBGC  becomes a trustee of a single-employer pension plan, plan participants  receive their full benefits up to a statutory maximum benefit, a  benefit set by Congress.   The maximum guarantee in 2009, the year of Delphi's bankruptcy, was  $4,500 per month or $54,000 per year for retirees who began receiving  benefits at age 65. That is a very high amount of money that many  Americans will never earn per year, let alone have for retirement.   PBGC reported in 2019 that 84 percent of retirees who receive  benefits from PBGC are paid the full benefit amounts they earned under  their retirement plans, meaning they do not have their benefits  reduced.   In the case of the Delphi salaried employee plan, 72 percent of  participants were not affected by PBGC's statutory benefit limit. Of  the remaining 28 percent, 36 percent saw less than a 10 percent  reduction.   Madam Speaker, again, I am speaking for the Americans who will never  get a pension benefit because they have worked so hard but never made  enough money to have a pension or don't have employers that pay pension  benefits. We are bailing out people who are making a lot of money.   Madam Speaker, wages aren't keeping up with inflation. A Washington  Post economic columnist recently pointed out that workers are  experiencing the biggest decline in years in inflation-adjusted pay.  According to a new report, 75 percent of middle-income families say  their ``income is falling behind the cost of living.''   Given persistent and rising inflation, H.R. 6929 is the last thing we  should be considering. It will cost taxpayers nearly $800 million over  10 years and $1.3 billion in all to bail out Delphi's underfunded,  privately run pension plan.   Americans across the country do not want to fork over their hard- earned dollars to fund a costly project that was cooked up in Congress,  especially when many have their own retirement accounts to consider or  have none at all.   By doubling down on an already failed strategy, taxpayers will be  forced to cover the cost of this cash giveaway. This sets a terrible  and troubling precedent that will embolden the Federal Government to  bail out thousands of other privately run pensions.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to oppose this fiscally  irresponsible catastrophe of a bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.                                time  1630     Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The first thing I will say, I never said that the bill was a partisan  bill, and I would like to clarify the record on that point.   This amendment directs the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to  issue a public request for information regarding the long-term solvency  of the agency's single- and multiemployer insurance programs, and to  submit legislative recommendations to Congress within 2 years.   I don't question the sincerity with which my colleague from Virginia  offers this amendment. However, if H.R. 6929 is signed into law, this  report will be a day late and a dollar short.   Last year, under the guise of COVID relief, congressional Democrats  and President Biden enacted an uncapped taxpayer-funded bailout of  failing and insolvent multiemployer pension plans. While the most  recent estimate of the bailout indicates taxpayers are on the hook for  $90 billion, without a cap on the total amount of spending, the bailout  could cost much more.   Worse yet, Democrats refused to address the structural failures of  the system, refused to hold plan trustees accountable, and encouraged  further plan underfunding.   The Education and Labor Committee has been wrestling with the  problems facing the multiemployer pension system and the looming  insolvency of PBGC's insurance program for decades. The committee has  held countless hearings on the topic. Congress even established a Joint  Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans, of which  Chairman Scott and I were members.   We already know the problems with the system, and we don't need to  wait another 2 years for PBGC to issue a report with recommendations.  Plans do not adequately fund their promises. A comment was made about  keeping promises. Well, we need to fund the plans. They overpromise,  undercontribute, and refuse to make responsible adjustments,  ultimately, digging themselves into deeper holes.   Further, PBGC has submitted legislative recommendations regarding  multiemployer pensions that Democrats have routinely ignored. For  years, under both the Obama and Trump administrations, PBGC recommended  [[Page H7219]]  Congress establish a variable rate premium for multiemployer plans to  align premiums better with the risk these plans pose to PBGC.   Single-employer plans pay a much higher flat rate premium as well as  a variable-rate premium. Multiemployer plans should do the same.  Single-employer plans are also subject to much stricter funding  requirements that better protect the benefits of workers and retirees.   Meanwhile, poorly managed multiemployer plans fail to collect  adequate contributions for the benefits they promise and bet on risky  investments in hopes of making up the difference.   While I appreciate the amendment's implicit admission that throwing  billions of dollars at multiemployer plans has not solved the problem,  this fig leaf amendment does nothing to address the fundamental flaws  of the underlying bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  close.   Madam Speaker, again, I don't think we need another study. We don't  need to delay action on this 2 years. What we need to do is increase  premiums and impose stronger funding requirements.   The plans are underfunded. It doesn't take an accountant or a rocket  scientist to figure that out. Pogo said, ``We have met the enemy, and  he is us.'' We, in Congress, are the problem. We need to do this.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1645     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
