 Mr. President, I am honored to recognize the  incredible life and achievements of veteran Nell ``Mickey'' Stevenson  Bright, a pioneer of aviation during the Second World War and a proud  Utahn. Nell earned her silver wings from the Army Air Corp as one of a  highly select group of women serving in the WASP program, or Women  Airforce Service Pilots. These brave women flew over 60 million miles  in support of the war effort and were finally awarded the Congressional  Gold Medal in 2009 in recognition of their valor.   As a young woman, Nell looked to the sky and saw an opportunity to  chart her own course. After learning to fly at age 19, Nell undertook  an ambitious new challenge--applying her aviation abilities to serve in  the military. While the war raged around the world, Nell applied and  was accepted to train with the Army Air Corps in Sweetwater, TX.  Accustomed to the intense heat, wind, and dust as a daughter of Canyon,  TX, Nell proved her talents in conditions that would trouble any  uninitiated pilot. Crosswind landings were second nature to the young  pilot-in-training, and she quickly earned her silver wings. She was one  of 1,074 women to achieve this prestigious distinction from over 25,000  applicants.   WASPs flew every airplane the Army had in order to execute a variety  of wartime support operations. Nell flew the B-25 twin-engine bomber,  P-47 pursuit planes, and multiple Navy bombers. WASPs transported  planes and cargo from manufacturers to bases, towed targets for live  anti-aircraft gun practice, and simulated strafing missions. With  friendly anti-aircraft guns firing live rounds at the women in the sky,  even their training exercises were extraordinarily dangerous. Thirty- eight WASPs lost their lives over the course of their service. Their  sacrifice to our country will never be forgotten.   Successfully navigating military aircraft through the skies of war is  a challenge for the most decorated pilots, but the WASPs faced  adversity on the ground, too. Unfortunately, discrimination was present  on base. As women, the WASPs were told not to eat in the officer's mess  hall, instructions they promptly ignored. The Tuskegee Airmen, the  first Black pilots in the service, also faced similar barriers on base.  The WASPs spoke up in their defense, and the commanding officer  assented. When the 20 airmen were required to sit segregated, the WASPs  refused to accept the injustice and joined them.   WASPs would continue their fight for recognition after the war,  contesting their civil service classification despite holding military  officer status. In 1977, the WASPs received veteran status, which  granted them their well-earned and hard-fought benefits.   Nell is a pioneer of military aviation, and her legacy will continue  to inspire the next generation of public servants, particularly young  women. By virtue of her bravery and valor, she helped break gender  barriers in the military and contributed to the ever-growing diversity  in our ranks today. After her service, Nell established a successful  career as a stockbroker in Arizona and continued to challenge  traditional gender norms.   Today, Nell calls our great State of Utah home. In 2014, she received  the Minute Man Award from the Utah National Guard and Honorary Colonels  Corps for her service to her country and community. She also earned the  2014 Leadership and Excellence Award from Brigham Young University,  ROTC.   Nell Stevenson Bright celebrates her 100th birthday on June 20. Our  State and our country owe her a debt of gratitude for her courage,  valor, and groundbreaking public service. Thank you, Nell.                            ____________________
