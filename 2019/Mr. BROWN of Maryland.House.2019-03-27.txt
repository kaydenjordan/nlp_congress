 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Let me start by saying it is a privilege to be able to stand on the  floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in this year, in this term,  and in this session of Congress to participate in the debate and the  discussion and to offer an amendment on this historic bill, the  Paycheck Fairness Act.   I would like to first thank my friend and colleague, the chairman of  the committee,  Bobby Scott from Virginia, for his leadership on this  issue and this bill. I want to recognize the decades' long work of my  colleague from Connecticut, Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, on the  underlying bill and her efforts, along with many other women, including  Maryland's former Senator Barbara Mikulski to finally ensure that women  are paid and treated fairly in the workplace.   My amendment would enhance pay transparency protections in this bill.  This amendment would make it unlawful for an employer to discriminate  against an employee for simply discussing or inquiring why they are  being paid a certain wage or salary.   Mr. Chairman, if you found out that you were being paid less than  your colleagues for the same work, you would probably demand to be paid  more. But for too long, it has been considered taboo to discuss your  salary with your coworkers let alone confront your boss if you were  being paid unfairly.   When pay is transparent, organizations must be able to justify each  employee's salary, thus reducing or eliminating any type of bias.   That is why the Paycheck Fairness Act puts transparency front and  center and why my amendment goes a little further and gives every  employee the right to negotiate the higher pay.   Since Congress has not been able to act over the past several years,  States have led the way in promoting pay transparency, including  California, Illinois, Louisiana, and my State of Maryland. In Maryland  we added very broad pay transparency protections to ensure employees  the ability to discover and discuss disparities in pay, and we even  expanded prohibitions against discriminatory pay practices to include  gender identity, an item that I would hope that this Congress may take  up later this session.   But my amendment today reiterates the importance of transparency in  the workplace. Every employee should be able to advocate and negotiate  for themselves without fear of reprisal. According to the Carnegie  Mellon study, men are four times more likely than women to ask for a  raise, and when women do ask, they typically request 30 percent less  than men do.   We should be encouraging employees, regardless of their gender, to  inquire and discuss disparities in pay with their employers and  advocate for themselves if they aren't being paid fairly or if it is  simply time they received a well-deserved raise.                                time  1630    Mr. Chairman, at a time when wages are not rising fast enough,  Congress must ensure every working American is paid equally and fairly  and is empowered throughout their salary negotiation process.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, unfortunately, historically, the  cloak of confidentiality has often been the shield used by employers to  discriminate against women when it comes to paycheck fairness.  [[Page H2872]]    I encourage all my colleagues to support my amendment and the  underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
