 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R.  3055. Ethylene oxide--also known as ETO--is an industrial chemical used  to sterilize medical equipment and manufacture products like anti- freeze.   We have known for decades that ETO is dangerous, and in 2016, EPA  listed it as a known carcinogen.   Dozens of facilities around the country--including two in my district  in--use and emit ETO into the surrounding communities. My constituents  in Waukegan and Gurnee are rightly concerned about the local levels of  ETO and any possible health consequences.   When our neighbors in Willowbrook, Illinois faced similar questions  about ETO, the EPA's community engagement provided vital data to inform  residents about the public health risk they face, and the steps they  were taking to mitigate the threat.   But the EPA has left dozens of communities around the country,  including my constituents, in the dark. These are localities that we  know face high ETO levels, yet the EPA refuses to hold public forums to  answer our community's urgent questions.   Every American should have confidence in the safety of the air that  they and their families breathe. The EPA needs to do its job and engage  with communities where that assurance is under threat.   This amendment would set aside $25,000 for EPA public engagement on  ethylene oxide to communities identified in the National Air Toxic  Assessment to face dangerous emissions levels of this known carcinogen.  This is a small sum, but one that would have a big effect on the  families living in these communities.   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment.
