 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2786, the Promoting Small  Conduit Hydropower Facilities Act of 2017.   In 2013, our committee moved bipartisan legislation by Representative  McMorris Rodgers and Representative DeGette that created an exemption  from hydropower licensing for certain conduit hydropower facilities of  5 megawatts capacity or less.   Under the provision established in the McMorris Rodgers-DeGette bill,  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, must determine within  15 days after receipt of a notice of intent to construct a small  conduit project by the developer if the project meets the qualifying  criteria for exemption under the law.   If FERC makes an initial determination that the project meets that  criteria, current law requires FERC to publish a public notice of that  determination and provide the public 45 days for an opportunity to  comment on or contest FERC's determination.   That bill went on to be signed into law by President Obama and, as of  May of this year, has resulted in qualifying 83 projects being exempted  from Federal licensing requirements.                                time  1315    The bill before us now, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2786, sponsored by Mr.  Hudson and Ms. DeGette, will amend the Federal Power Act to lift the 5- megawatt cap on conduit projects that could qualify for exemption. The  bill would also reduce from 45 days to 30 days the amount of time the  public will have to comment on or contest FERC's determination of  whether a project qualifies for exception.   There is clearly strong support on both sides of the aisle for the  development of conduit hydroelectric projects and for efforts like the  Hudson-DeGette bill, which cuts red tape to ensure that environmentally  sound projects can move forward quickly and efficiently.   However, Mr. Speaker, the original version of this bill cut the 45- day timeframe for public comment on a proposed exemption too much, down  to 15 days. That, in my view, Mr. Speaker, and that of many of my  colleagues, was too short a period of time to allow for meaningful  public input into the process.   Fortunately and wisely, Mr. Speaker, Chairman Upton and Chairman  Walden accepted an amendment by Ranking Member Pallone that reduced the  amount of time for public notification by a third, from 45 days to 30  days, rather than the 15 days that many of us felt was excessive.   As a result, we now have a bill that is good policy, that cuts down  on unnecessary regulation, while properly balancing the interests of  hydropower development with that of the public.   The bill was rightfully reported by the committee with the unanimous  support of Members on both sides of the aisle, and I hope the full  House will do the same today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette), the cosponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us sponsored by the gentleman  from Washington State (Mr. Newhouse) would authorize the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission to extend, up to 6 years, the date by which the  licensee for the Enloe Dam hydropower project, No. 12569, is required  to commence construction. This is necessary because the project's  licensee is not likely to commence construction by the designated  deadline.   Under the Federal Power Act, Mr. Speaker, FERC is unable to further  extend that deadline administratively, so action by the Congress is  required. In the event the license expires before this legislation is  enacted, the bill contains language reinstating the license as of its  date of expiration.  [[Page H5938]]                                     time  1330    FERC has no objection, Mr. Speaker, to this piece of legislation, and  neither do I, and I hope that my colleagues will support the passage of  H.R. 951.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to also commend my friend and my colleague from  the great State of Michigan, the chairman of the Energy Subcommittee,  my longstanding friend, Mr. Upton, for working with my office to bring  H.R. 3050, the Enhancing State Energy Security Planning and Emergency  Preparedness Act of 2017, to the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, this Upton-Rush bill represents bipartisan negotiation  between Chairman Upton and myself to much-needed Federal guidance and  resources to the States that are on the front lines when it comes to  protecting critical energy infrastructure and responding once disaster  strikes.   Members on both side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, support the State  Energy Program, and this bill will help provide resources to further  develop and enhance the State energy security plans.   Since their inception in the 1970s, State Energy Programs, bolstered  by Federal aid, have assisted States in developing these energy  security plans in order to help prevent disasters from happening and to  mitigate the damage once they do occur.   Mr. Speaker, funding provided in this bill will help States to  implement, revise, and to review their energy security plans while also  laying out criteria for the contents of these plans. These emergency  plans have been instrumental in improving States' abilities to identify  potential energy disruptions, quantify the effects of the disruptions,  establish response plans, and limit the risk of further disturbances,  whether they be natural or manmade.   Federal funding and leadership has also been critical in helping  States and local stakeholders identify the roles and responsibilities  of the various agencies in times of emergencies while also supporting  training and response exercises.   Mr. Speaker, as the Trump administration weakens America's leadership  role globally by signaling its intentions to withdraw from the Paris  Agreement, it is even more vital that we provide the resources and  funding needed for States to take more of a permanent role in advancing  smart and sustainable energy policy.   Mr. Speaker, Federal leadership and investment must continue to play  a vital role in developing State Energy Assurance Plans, and it is my  hope and my expectation that this legislation will indeed bolster these  State-led programs by enhancing Federal support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
