 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Reichert for his work on  this.   As Chairman Brady said, this is very important. I have a lot of  manufacturers in my district who really can't get parts in this country  and they depend on other countries, and it is vital that they remain  competitive. So I thank Chairman Reichert for his work on this.   I rise today to support the reauthorization of the Generalized System  of Preferences program, or GSP.   In 2016, job creators and producers in my State saved $16 million on  $422 million worth of imports. In 2017, producers in my State saved $17  million on GSP imports through reduced tariffs. These savings translate  directly to how much companies can reinvest in their businesses and  their employees.   GSP also provides the executive branch with effective enforcement  strategies to make sure the United States is not being taken advantage  of in trade deals.   President John F. Kennedy once said: ``A rising tide lifts all  boats.''   This is the opportunity before us today. We can support American  prosperity while helping lift others out of poverty.   I urge support of this bill, Mr. Speaker.
