 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a journalist who,  through hard work and determination, brought the news to the people of  Illinois' 17th Congressional District. Barb Ickes has been in newspaper  storytelling for more than 30 years. She has broken countless news  stories, exposed corruption, and helped Quad-City Times readers through  record floods, tough economic times, and monumental political events.   She helped us navigate crossing the Mississippi River with her  ``bridge beat'' and took us to her ``off-limits places.'' Barb has seen  it all, and she has shared it with our community.   As Barb retires from her position as managing editor with the Quad- City Times, we recognize her accomplishments and the legacy that she  leaves for the next generation of news reporters.   I am honored to wish her the best as she turns the page to her next  chapter.                            ____________________
