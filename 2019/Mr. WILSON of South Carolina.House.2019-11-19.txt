 Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, I walked in  the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation One Walk at Segra Park, home  of the famous Columbia Fireflies. I am grateful to have been able to  support such an important cause and walk in support of eradicating type  1 diabetes.   The money raised at the JDRF One Walk in Columbia supports life- changing research that gives hope to those impacted by type 1 diabetes.  It is an autoimmune disease that strikes suddenly and is serious and  stressful to families, challenging families across our district.   Currently, there is nothing that can be done to prevent type 1  diabetes and there is no cure. JDRF is a leader in funding diabetes  research, motivated by their vision of a world without type 1 diabetes.  This organization works tirelessly to improve the lives of those  affected by this disease by accelerating life-changing breakthroughs to  cure, prevent, and treat diabetes.   I appreciate JDRF Palmetto Chapter Development Director Beth McCrary  for her hard work and success in coordinating the JDRF Walk in Columbia  and for her advocacy for ending type 1 diabetes.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
