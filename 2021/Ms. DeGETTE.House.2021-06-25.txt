 Mr. Speaker, along with Mr. Peters and Mr. Lamb, I am  very proud to stand as the sponsor of the House companion of S.J. Res.  14, and I rise in strong support of the legislation.   The purpose of the legislation is very simple. It is to reduce our  methane emissions and to help stave off the worst effects of the  climate crisis before it is too late.   Methane, as we all know, is one of the most potent greenhouse gases  on the planet, and when it is released into our atmosphere, it becomes  a leading contributor to global warming.   Climate experts agree that one of the most important things we can do  right now to combat the climate crisis is to reduce the amount of  methane in our atmosphere, and that is exactly what this legislation  does.   It restores the 2016 methane emission rules that were put into place  during the Obama administration, and it negates the Trump  administration's last-minute attempt to roll back these rules on its  way out the door.   One-third of all of the methane that is released in this country  comes from the production of oil and gas.   This legislation will, once again, require our oil and gas producers  to take the steps needed to reduce the methane emitting from their  drilling sites.   These emissions don't just harm our planet. When methane is released  from oil and gas sites, it is often accompanied by other pollutants  that are known to cause additional harm to people's health.    That is why this legislation is so important, and that is why the  Trump administration's egregious attempt to eliminate these important  rules and let oil and gas companies release more methane from their  drilling sites was met with such outrage and fury by citizens across  this country.   And you know something?   And not just from the citizens, but from the biggest oil and gas  companies in the country, including ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, and more,  and also from smaller producers around the country. These are the  companies that stand to benefit most from the rollback of the methane  rules, and even these are against it.   So when I hear the ranking member talking about how we are going to  be on the backs of oil and gas companies, the very companies she is  talking about support this legislation today.   I just want to read a few of the names of the companies, large and  small, that support the rollback of the Trump administration's methane  rule and the reinstatement of the Obama-era rule:   BP America; Shell U.S.; Equinor North America; Total USA; ExxonMobil;  Jonah Energy; Pioneer Natural Resources; EQT Corporation; Interstate  Natural Gas Association of America; Cheniere; DTE Energy; Equitrans  Midstream Corporation; Occidental Petroleum; Devon Energy; Edison  Electric Institute, which is a consortium of groups; Center for  Liquefied Natural Gas; Austin Energy;  [[Page H3141]]  Calpine Corporation; Pacific Gas and Electric Company; Tenaska, Inc.;  and others have all submitted comments, and the comments they have  submitted are in support of S.J. Res. 14 and the rollback of the Trump  administration's egregious rule.   So when my colleagues on the other side say this is going to hurt oil  and gas, the very companies they are talking about support this because  the Trump administration's rule was so extreme and egregious.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a summary of the quotes in  support of this legislation from these companies, a letter from BP, a  letter from Occidental, and a letter from Equinor.            Energy Companies Support Federal Methane Regulations         Many oil and gas companies publicly support direct federal       regulation of methane because methane pollution hurts public       health, the planet, and the industry itself. These companies       also support restoring the common-sense requirements to       control methane pollution that were eliminated and undermined       at the end of 2020.        Methane regulations work to reduce methane emissions and       waste from oil and gas operations. To meet the requirements,       companies use cost-effective tools and off-the-shelf       technologies to find and plug methane leaks and reduce       venting and flaring. But the previous administration revoked       all federal air pollution limits for oil and gas transmission       and storage facilities and created legal confusion that       undermines further progress in cutting methane pollution.       Here's what industry is saying about closing these loopholes       and directly regulating methane:        BP America: ``Direct federal regulation of methane is key       to preventing leaks throughout industry and protecting the       environment--and gets us closer to #netzero. That's why we       support the Congressional Review Act methane resolution.''        Shell US: ``Sound policy surrounding natural gas is       critical to its role in the energy transition. We need to       restore the direct federal regulation of #methane emissions--      and we urge Congress to approve the methane resolution under       the Congressional Review Act.''        Equinor North America: ``Ensuring that natural gas       continues to provide climate benefits means reducing       emissions from its production. We support the methane       resolution under the Congressional Review Act. Direct federal       methane regulation is an important step on the pathway to net       zero.''        Total USA: ``Curbing methane emissions with bold policies       is imperative to get to #NetZero2050. We welcome direct       federal regulation of #methane emissions and support       resolution via the Congressional Review Act #cutmethane.''        ExxonMobil: ``Last year we [ExxonMobil] announced our       support for the direct regulation of methane emissions for       new and existing oil and gas facilities. That hasn't       changed.''        Jonah Energy: ``Jonah Energy believes in common sense       federal regulation of methane emissions to reduce impacts and       achieve climate goals. We support Congressional Review Act       measure S.J. Res. 14 (https:/lnkd.in/ebHbACW) that will       reverse prior rulemaking and allow reasonable federal       oversight of methane. In fact, we opposed the rollback by the       last administration. Achieving climate goals is important in       our backyard, and across the nation. Reasonable federal       regulations of methane emissions provide consistency and       certainty covering all sectors of natural gas development and       promote public confidence our national energy sources.        Pioneer Natural Resources: Pioneer has long supported       federal regulation of methane if those regulations encourage       innovation and operational flexibility. Clear rules would       provide certainty for operators and strong environmental       benefits. We support use of the CRA to reinstate regulation       of methane''        EQT Corporation: EQT Corporation supports congressional       resolutions that would reinstate a rule imposing a federal       standard on methane. Company believes the ``responsible       development of natural gas will help meet future global       energy demand as we address climate change together''.        Interstate Natural Gas Association of America:- ``We       support federal methane standards . . . our members have a       long history of minimizing methane emissions from their       operation. A stable regulatory framework will allow the       industry to invest in the critical infrastructure necessary       to reduce emissions and meet increasing demand for cleaner       and more affordable energy.        Cheniere: To maximize the climate benefits of natural gas,       we recognize the imperative to minimize #methane emissions       across the natural gas value chain. We support effective       policies and regulations that reduce methane emissions,       including the current Congressional Review Act effort to       restore federal regulation of methane emissions. Cheniere       will continue to collaborate with industry, academia and the       scientific community to deliver cost-effective solutions that       reduce methane emissions from the natural gas sector. We also       will continue to push for increased transparency regarding       methane emissions reporting and data, as well as efforts that       create a level playing field with all operators domestically       and internationally.        DTE Energy: Strong, sensible methane regulations at the       federal and state level give our industry the foundation on       which to go even further through these voluntary initiatives.       Providing a proper regulatory framework ensures industry's       ability to continue to make important progress reducing       methane emissions. [Public Comment 11/25/2019]        Equitrans Midstream Corporation: ``We must continue to push       our industry forward in a meaningful way in order to       effectuate real mitigation of climate change impacts, and we       support approval of the methane resolution under the       Congressional Review Act,'' said Diana Charletta, president       and chief operating officer of Equitrans Midstream.        Occidental Petroleum: ``We support the direct regulation of       methane . . . because it is very potent and we need to have       regulations in place to ensure that we have adequate controls       throughout the industry.''        Devon Energy: We believe a meaningful reduction in methane       emissions is essential to managing the risks of climate       change. While the Congressional Review Act is an       extraordinary legislative tool that should be used       judiciously and with caution, we support the ongoing effort       in Congress to chart a path toward a durable framework for       regulating methane at the federal level that encourages       innovation and operational flexibility.        Edison Electric Institute: EEi supports Congress using the       Congressional Review Act to enable EPA to develop strong and       cost-effective federal regulations on methane emissions       throughout the natural gas supply chain for new and existing       sources.        Center for Liquified Natural Gas: The Center for Liquefied       Natural Gas (CLNG) and its members support the proposed       resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act       (CRA) and the reinstatement of regulations of methane       emissions from the natural gas sector.        Austin Energy, Calpine Corporation, Pacific Gas and       Electric Company, Tenaska Inc, and Others (Joint Comments):       ``EPA should continue to directly regulate methane from new       sources in the oil and natural gas source category . . . the       importance of controlling these emissions is clear when       considering that the oil and natural gas source category is       the largest source of anthropogenic methane emissions in the       US, contributing 31 percent of US methane emissions in 2017,       according to EPA's Inventory of US Greenhouse Gas Emissions       and Sinks: 1990-2017 (published in 2019).''                                   ____                                                 BP America, Inc.,                                      Washington, DC, June 10, 2021.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Cathy McMorris Rodgers,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers:       bp's ambition is to become a net zero company by 2050 or       sooner and to help the world get there too. This includes       advocating for policies that support net zero.        bp supports the direct federal regulation of methane for       new and existing sources across the value chain. Methane is a       potent greenhouse gas with a warming potential 80 times       greater than carbon dioxide over the first 20 years in the       atmosphere. We believe regulation is needed to ensure all       companies are prioritizing methane emissions reductions. This       is why bp supports the Congressional Review Act resolution on       methane.        We appreciate the leadership of Representative DeGette and       others who recognize that regulating methane is good for the       environment, business, and for US energy security. Further,       we believe regulation can help preserve the role for natural       gas in a low carbon future.        bp is in action to reduce methane emissions from our       operations. We aim for zero routine flaring in our US onshore       operations by 2025 and have recently completed construction       of a $300 million electrified, central processing facility in       the Permian Basin in Texas to enable emissions reductions.       Additionally, we aim to install methane measurement at all       our existing major oil and gas processing sites by 2023,       publish the data, and then drive a 50% reduction in the       methane intensity of our operations.        This is a critical decade for climate action. We appreciate       the leadership of Representative DeGette and the work of this       committee to advance this issue in Congress.        I, or a member of my team, will be happy to meet with you       or your staff to talk more about bp's ambition and our       efforts to minimize methane.            Sincerely,                                                   Mary Streett,                                    Senior Vice President, Americas,      Communications & Advocacy.                                   ____                                                       Occidantal,                                         Houston, TX, June 10, 2021.        Members of the Energy and Commerce Committee: Thank you for       the opportunity to provide our views on H.J Res. 34. The       demand for energy and products that rely upon oil and natural       gas will continue to rise globally, and we take seriously the       charge to provide for those needs while approaching Net-Zero.       Occidental was the first U.S. oil and gas company to       establish comprehensive net-zero greenhouse gas emissions       goals, with a pathway to Net-Zero before 2040 for Scope 1 and       Scope 2 emissions, and an ambition to achieve Net-Zero for       Scope 3 emissions before 2050. Your efforts to evaluate and       advance legislation to address climate change are critical to       helping companies like Occidental achieve these objectives.  [[Page H3142]]         Occidental supports the data-driven, direct regulation of       methane which is why we support H.J. Res 34. Earlier this       year, President Biden directed EPA to draft new methane       regulations for both new and existing sources and we are       working with the Administration on those efforts. This       legislation will clarify EPA's authority to regulate methane       and allow EPA additional flexibility to write a thorough       rule. Because it has access to the most comprehensive       emissions data via GHG reporting program and other means, we       strongly believe that EPA should lead the effort to regulate       methane. In their rulemaking process, EPA should work with       external stakeholders to craft public policy that achieves       methane emissions reductions, incentivizes early action, and       supports flexibility and innovation. We look forward to       sharing data and best practice information about our       operations with EPA to assist in the creation of strong and       effective regulations.        Occidental thanks Representatives DeGette, Lamb, and Peters       for their leadership on this important legislation and we       look forward to additional opportunities to collaborate on       ways to approach Net-Zero.            Sincerely,                                                   Vicki Hollub,                              President and Chief Executive Officer,      Occidental.                                   ____                                                       Equinor US,                                                      April 9, 2021.      Hon. Tom Carper,      Chairman, Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Shelley Moore Capito,      Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Environment and Public           Works, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Chairman, House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Cathy McMorris Rodgers,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Energy and Commerce,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Carper, Ranking Member Capito, Chairman       Pallone, and Ranking Member Rodgers: Equinor US encourages       members of both the Senate and House to support a proposed       resolution of disapproval, under the Congressional Review Act       (CRA), to rescind the recent rule ``Oil and Natural Gas       Sector: Emission Standards for New, Reconstructed, and       Modified Sources Review'' and largely reinstate the Obama-era       regulations of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector.        In 2019, we submitted comments to the US Environmental       Protection Agency (EPA) opposing the then proposed rule and       outlined our view that regulation of methane is a necessary       part of a comprehensive, economy-wide policy program to       address global climate change.        In those comments, Equinor US noted that ``it is important       to have a federal regulatory `floor' that provides a       consistent, flexible, predictable, and comprehensive policy       framework for the sector.'' We stand by this policy approach       and believe that a return to the 2012 and 2016 standards,       until a more workable regulation or pieces of legislation,       considering modern technological developments, can be passed       and/or implemented.        Equinor US appreciates the strong leadership of many in       Congress who recognize the role of responsibly-produced       natural gas in the energy transition and we believe that the       deployment of the Congressional Review Act to undo the 2020       rule is appropriate and in line with our own net-zero       ambitions.            Sincerely,                                                Chris L. Golden,                                       Senior Vice President, Global                                       Unconventionals, Equinor US.                                time  0930    I will just say that if we don't act now and if we let this rule  stand, it is going to increase methane emissions in this country by  nearly 1.6 tons by 2025. It will also result in a release of an  additional 1.8 million tons of volatile organic compounds and more than  16,000 tons of hazardous air pollutants right into the air that we  breathe.   If we are going to get serious about addressing the climate crisis,  let's get serious about cutting our methane emissions. If we are going  to get serious about protecting the public's health, let's pass this  legislation today.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this important bill that has  widespread support, not just from environmentalists, not just from the  public, but from the oil industry itself.   Let's do what the people have elected us to do. Let's put their  health and safety, and the health and safety of our planet, above all  else. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on S.J. Res. 14.
