 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 55 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 55         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 7) to       prohibit taxpayer funded abortions. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall       be considered as read. All points of order against provisions       in the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       Majority Leader and the Minority Leader or their respective       designees; and (2) one motion to recommit.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House  Resolution 55, which provides a closed rule for consideration of H.R.  7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full  Disclosure Act. This bipartisan bill will codify and make permanent  what is commonly referred to as the Hyde amendment and expand Hyde  amendment restrictions to all Federal agencies.   First offered in 1976, the Hyde amendment prevents taxpayer dollars  from being used to fund abortions through government programs like  Medicaid. These restrictions have been maintained for more than 40  years through the annual appropriations process, including the most  recent continuing resolution passed last December. It is time that  these important protections against the use of taxpayer funding to pay  for abortion be made permanent.   A GAO report in 2014 found that, under ObamaCare, over 1,000  insurance plans covered elective abortion. Those plans are purchased  with taxpayer subsidies. H.R. 7 would stop this and make ObamaCare  conform to the Hyde amendment. If the Hyde amendment had been applied  to ObamaCare, as President Obama promised it would be, the number of  federally subsidized plans with elective abortion coverage would have  been zero.   As we work to repeal and replace the deeply flawed ObamaCare, we need  to ensure taxpayer subsidies are not used to pay for abortion coverage.   According to a Marist Poll conducted last July, 62 percent of  respondents--a majority of the women asked--and including 45 percent of  those who identify as pro-choice do not support taxpayer funding for  abortions. H.R. 7 simply codifies and makes permanent a protection  against the use of taxpayer funding for abortion that the majority of  Americans and certainly a majority of my constituents in Wyoming  support.   Therefore, I urge support for the rule to allow consideration of H.R.  7.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would just note that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle  have referred several times now to the massive turnout for the women's  march here, and we, ourselves, will be having, I am sure, a very large  turnout this week; as well as I would like to point out that that  women's march excluded groups that were pro-life women's groups. And so  the notion that somehow it was reflective of all women in this Nation  is fundamentally misleading.   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes of my time to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Smith), the cosponsor of this bill who has done tremendous  work.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Tennessee (Mrs. Black).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, it is no surprise that our colleagues on the other  side of the aisle would rather talk about just about anything besides  the text and the substance of the rule and the bill that we are about  to consider.  [[Page H624]]    The transparency that is important to this debate and that is  relevant for this discussion today is transparency that is in the rule  and in this bill that would require that insurance companies make sure  that people understand what they are purchasing and whether or not they  are purchasing a plan that will, in fact, provide abortion coverage.   I also just want to note that although there may be some in this  Chamber who view The Washington Post Fact Checker as the oracle and  font of all wisdom, he got this one wrong, as he has in many cases,  and, in fact, failed to understand that there are, as we meet here  today, monthly advanced payments of U.S. taxpayer funding going to  insurance companies or to exchanges to pay for health insurance plans  that subsidize abortion on demand.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Jody B. Hice).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Babin).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Hultgren).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I just want to make a point in terms of my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle and the constant reference to women,  women, women, as though all women believe what they believe.   They have very strongly held views on the other side of the aisle,  but the notion that somehow all women can be categorized as being pro- abortion is just simply wrong and, frankly, offensive to those of us  who have different views.   Madam Speaker, I would like to say, at this point in time, that we  are not making any kind of a dangerous attack on women's rights.   My colleagues have accused us of being relentless. We are relentless.  We are relentless, Madam Speaker. We are relentless in defense of the  unborn, the most vulnerable among us.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Rothfus).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Smith).    Madam Speaker, under the Constitution, all funds for the  District of Columbia are appropriated by the United States Congress, so  we in the Congress bear a particular and additional responsibility for  funds in the District of Columbia.   I would also note, Madam Speaker, that there are no limitations in  the District of Columbia on when an abortion can be performed; and  therefore, if we were to lift this amendment, if we were not to have  this rule in place, you could potentially have the U.S. taxpayers in a  situation where they were being forced to fund even late-term abortions  in the District of Columbia, which is fundamentally against the Hyde  amendment, fundamentally against everything that we have supported and  against the majority of the people in this Nation.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sessions), the chairman of the Committee on Rules.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am really heartened today, Madam Speaker, to hear so much concern  from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle about making sure  that patients and individuals have the right to make decisions about  their own health care. I would expect, then, to see support from the  other side of the aisle when we are in a position where we are putting  in place our replacement for ObamaCare. That is one of the main reasons  we are repealing ObamaCare, getting the government out of the business  of telling people what they can and can't have with respect to their  own health care. That is not the issue that we are debating here today,  however, Madam Speaker.   I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his tireless work  on this issue and for introducing this bipartisan bill. A majority of  Americans across the country share the view that we must continue to  work to protect the lives of mothers and their unborn children. As you  have already heard, Madam Speaker, the Hyde amendment is responsible  for saving the lives of at least 2 million babies, the most vulnerable  among us.   Codifying a permanent restriction on the use of taxpayer funding for  abortions is long overdue. I urge adoption of both the rule and H.R. 7  so we can continue to protect and save lives.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
