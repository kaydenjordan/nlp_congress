 Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, this past April, Attorney General Sessions  announced a new zero tolerance policy--those were his words--for the  southern border. Last month, the Chief of Staff to the President said  that this new zero tolerance policy ``could be a tough deterrent. . . .  The children will be taken care of--put into foster care or whatever.''  That is what he said. To justify his zero tolerance policy, Attorney  General Sessions cited Romans 8, a Bible passage that was used  throughout our history to justify human slavery.   The administration knew precisely what the effect of this action  would be; yet they did it anyway. The result is that over 2,300  children have been separated by the U.S. Government in the name of the  American people since May.   The results are the images we see of children caged in chain-link  enclosures. We hear it in the young boys and girls crying for their  parents--all done in the name of America. That is an image that has  ricocheted all across the world, just as the image of Bull Connor's  dogs tearing at Birmingham's children ricocheted across the world. It  said to the world that we actually weren't upholding the high ideals  that our Founders set out to create.   Well, that is terrible, but what is also terrible is that President  Trump will take no responsibility for what he has done and instead  takes on a cheap political tactic, which I think he thinks he can get  away with. There is a lot of evidence he will get away with it because  of the repetition on cable news that somehow Democrats are responsible  for this. The President said:         I hate the children being taken away. The Democrats have to       change their law. That's their law.    That statement is false. It has no basis in reality. And I will  presume that he is not using the children as a negotiating tool. I am  not going to come to the floor and make that accusation. There are  people who have said that because they are searching for some logic to  explain how he could say something that is so false.    He tweeted: ``The Democrats are forcing the breakup of families at  the Border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda.'' That is  what he wrote. That is ridiculous, and we know it is false because  until they created this zero tolerance policy, which they thought would  deter other immigrants, the United States of America handled this  matter in a way that managed to enforce our laws without doing hideous  violence to our bedrock values as a nation.   When migrants with children cross the border unlawfully, the  government has broad discretion about whether to charge the violation  as a criminal offense or a civil offense, and every American  administration--every American administration, including the Trump  administration until 6 weeks ago, dealt with it as a civil matter and  avoided the trauma of family separation by charging them for illegal  entry and deporting them.   During the first 15 months of this administration, until Attorney  General Sessions started this zero tolerance policy, the Trump  administration--not the Obama administration--did this with nearly  100,000 immigrants who were apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border.   In terms of the law, nothing has changed in 6 months. The only thing  which has changed is the administration's policy and their decision to  file criminal charges for every unlawful crossing, including cases that  involved families with young children. I think that is the wrong  policy.   By the way, the Attorney General doesn't make up stories about it is  the Democrats' fault. He said this is what will happen because of their  policy, but the President will not admit it. American citizens, thank  goodness, don't want this done in their name. They don't want our  history besmirched by  [[Page S4250]]  this action and the coverup of whose responsibility it is. That is why  a bipartisan group--a bipartisan group--of 75 former U.S. attorneys  called for an end to the policy of family separation. It is making  their exercise of prosecutorial discretion more difficult.   More than two dozen of the largest religious groups in America have  asked the President to please relent, knowing he has the power to do  so--Rev. Franklin Graham and nearly a dozen evangelical leaders,  Republican Governors, Republican colleagues of mine who have not only  said they detest the policy but that the President can change it  anytime he wants.   Those are the facts. I don't know how to solve the problem of  newscasters who are willing to repeat things that aren't true. That is  hard to do, and it is difficult to separate fact from fiction when we  have a President who is allergic to the truth.   For my own sake, at times like this, I think it is important to  listen to voices like First Lady Laura Bush, who wrote an op-ed in the  Washington Post last week that was so moving. It amazes me that, in  2017, any American citizen would have to write it, but thank goodness  she did.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mrs. Bush's op-ed piece  be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Washington Post, Jun. 17, 2018]     Laura Bush: Separating Children From Their Parents at the Border                             `Breaks My Heart'                              (By Laura Bush)         Laura Bush is a former first lady of the United States.        On Sunday, a day we as a nation set aside to honor fathers       and the bonds of family, I was among the millions of       Americans who watched images of children who have been torn       from their parents. In the six weeks between April 19 and May       31, the Department of Homeland Security has sent nearly 2,000       children to mass detention centers or foster care. More than       100 of these children are younger than 4 years old. The       reason for these separations is a zero-tolerance policy for       their parents, who are accused of illegally crossing our       borders.        I live in a border state. I appreciate the need to enforce       and protect our international boundaries, but this zero-      tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my       heart.        Our government should not be in the business of warehousing       children in converted box stores or making plans to place       them in tent cities in the desert outside of El Paso. These       images are eerily reminiscent of the internment camps for       U.S. citizens and noncitizens of Japanese descent during       World War II, now considered to have been one of the most       shameful episodes in U.S. history. We also know that this       treatment inflicts trauma; those who have been interned have       been twice as likely to suffer cardiovascular disease or die       prematurely than those who were not interned.        Americans pride ourselves on being a moral nation, on being       the nation that sends humanitarian relief to places       devastated by natural disasters or famine or war. We pride       ourselves on believing that people should be seen for the       content of their character, not the color of their skin. We       pride ourselves on acceptance. If we are truly that country,       then it is our obligation to reunite these detained children       with their parents--and to stop separating parents and       children in the first place.        People on all sides agree that our immigration system isn't       working, but the injustice of zero tolerance is not the       answer. I moved away from Washington almost a decade ago, but       I know there are good people at all levels of government who       can do better to fix this.        Recently, Colleen Kraft, who heads the American Academy of       Pediatrics, visited a shelter run by the U.S. Office of       Refugee Resettlement. She reported that while there were       beds, toys, crayons, a playground and diaper changes, the       people working at the shelter had been instructed not to pick       up or touch the children to comfort them. Imagine not being       able to pick up a child who is not yet out of diapers.        Twenty-nine years ago, my mother-in-law, Barbara Bush,       visited Grandma's House, a home for children with HIV/AIDS in       Washington. Back then, at the height of the HIV/AIDS crisis,       the disease was a death sentence, and most babies born with       it were considered ``untouchables.'' During her visit,       Barbara--who was the first lady at the time--picked up a       fussy, dying baby named Donovan and snuggled him against her       shoulder to soothe him. My mother-in-law never viewed her       embrace of that fragile child as courageous. She simply saw       it as the right thing to do in a world that can be arbitrary,       unkind and even cruel. She, who after the death of her 3-      year-old daughter knew what it was to lose a child, believed       that every child is deserving of human kindness, compassion       and love.        In 2018, can we not as a nation find a kinder, more       compassionate and more moral answer to this current crisis?       I, for one, believe we can.    This is what she wrote:         I live in a border state.    She lives in Texas.         I appreciate the need to enforce and protect our       international boundaries, but this zero-tolerance policy is       cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart.        Our government should not be in the business of warehousing       children in converted box stores or making plans to place       them in tent cities in the desert outside of El Paso.    I am going to read that again. Mrs. Bush wrote: ``Our government  should not be in the business of warehousing children in converted box  stores or making plans to place them in tent cities in the desert  outside of El Paso.'' No, it shouldn't. She wrote:         These images are eerily reminiscent of the [Japanese       American] internment camps . . . of World War II, now       considered to have been one of the most shameful episodes in       U.S. history.    We now have another one confronting us right now. That episode was  shameful. At the time, America was in the midst of a great world war,  the second in a generation. The country had just emerged from the  largest economic depression in our country's history. There was deep  anxiety about jobs and national security, and that anxiety manifested  in what became a terrible injustice perpetrated by the U.S. Government  against Japanese Americans.   President Roosevelt's order called for the relocation of Japanese  Americans into prison-like camps. Many Governors throughout the West  opposed the camps at the time not because they were unjust but because  it was out of bigotry of Japanese Americans. They didn't want them in  their State, even if they were locked up in a prison.   Kansas Governor Payne Ratner declared that they ``are not wanted and  not welcome.'' Wyoming Governor Nels Smith threatened that Japanese who  come to his State would be found ``hanging from every pine tree.''   An exception to that was Colorado Governor Ralph Carr, a Republican.  Speaking to a crowd of farmers, Carr said:         If you harm them, you must first harm me. I was brought up       in small towns where I knew the shame and dishonor of race       hatred.    ``I grew to despise it,'' Carr said, pointing to the crowd, ``because  it threatened the happiness of you and you and you.'' Carr spoke out  about that injustice. He gave voice to vulnerable people when it was  politically unpopular. In fact, he lost his political career as a  result of what he said. His courage may not have won him much notice or  applause at the time, but he is in the honor roll of history, and we  hold him up as an example of our responsibility to stand for justice  and to stand against cruelty. His example should inspire us, but it  also should make us wonder what would have happened had he not been  there.   Like Governor Carr, all of us have to choose whether we are going to  stand against a policy of locking up children. We shouldn't do it. We  didn't do it. The Bush administration didn't do it. The Obama  administration didn't do it. The Trump administration didn't do it,  until this so-called zero tolerance policy was put in place. Now, the  U.S. Government has essentially jailed a bunch of children who can't  see their parents. This isn't helping the national security of the  United States.   Our immigration system is broken. Sitting in that chair before the  President was the Senator from Florida. He and I worked together in the  Gang of 8 to write an immigration bill that passed the Senate with  almost 70 votes in 2013. It spent $40 billion on border security. It  had internal security. It created a visa system so we could see who was  here lawfully and who had overstayed their visa and kick out the people  who were causing trouble. I sometimes think he doesn't actually want a  wall; he just wants the issue of a wall.   We could be working with countries in our hemisphere to try to  resolve the issues they face--violence, corruption, absence of rule of  law, very limited economic opportunities for people--so people could  stay there instead of trying to come to the United States just so their  kids can survive. That would be a useful thing for us to engage in.   A couple years ago when we had the kids coming to the border, I asked  myself--I am the parent of three daughters: What would it take for me  to send one of my daughters, when they are 13 years old, with a drug  smuggler 1,500  [[Page S4251]]  miles to the U.S. border? What fear would I have had to do that?   I went down there. I think the President should go down there. I went  to Mexico and El Salvador and Honduras, and I met in the backyard of  our Embassy with a bunch of young people who had either tried to get  into this country and failed or tried to get into this country and  succeeded. It was very clear they are absolutely terrorized by the gang  violence down there, by the insistence on the part of gangs that these  kids join gangs, and by the complete abject lack of economic  opportunity. There is none. That could affect the national security of  the United States, and we should have an interest in trying to make it  better.   I would put my record on immigration and border security up against  any single person in this Chamber because I helped write and pass a  bill that spent $40 billion on border security for the United States.  Our dysfunction in the House of Representatives caused us not to pass  the bill there. Now, we have reached a level of even more dysfunction  because the President is making up what is actually causing the problem  at the border and enjoys the political theater of going over to the  House of Representatives and having a conversation with people about  how we are going to solve a problem he created and that his  administration created and that Republicans and Democrats in this  Chamber alike know he created.   Let me close just by saying that we live in a democratic republic--I  have said that on the floor--and a democracy will not last very long if  the government is separated from the people. We are a self-governing  enterprise. In order to do that well, in order to put America's  children in the position they deserve to be put in, in order to honor  the heritage our parents and grandparents passed on to us, in order to  assure America's leadership role in the world, we have to seek the  truth as citizens. It is a fundamental responsibility that each of us  has.   We don't have to agree with each other about much, but we have to  find a way to ascertain the truth and then govern toward that and  figure out ways of moving the country forward. With an episode like  this, I get more and more worried we are reaching a point where it is  going to be hard to pull back from the brink.   When we are living in a time when our President tells us that our  allies threaten our national security, we need to ascertain the truth  of that statement. When we are told trade wars are easy to win, and we  end up paying more for steel than the people we are fighting a trade  war with, we need to figure out what the truth actually is. When  somebody runs for office saying they are going to have a beautiful  healthcare plan that is going to cover everybody in America at a really  low price, we ought to check and see whether that is happening. When  somebody tells you--even though it is repeated over and over and over  again on one cable TV station in America--that he is going to pay off  the debt in 7 years and then comes to Washington and gives us the  largest deficit we have seen outside of wartime or recession, we owe it  to our children to ascertain the truth of the matter.   We owe it to our children to do that, and we owe it to the world to  treat the children on our southern border with some dignity--the  dignity any human being would deserve.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
