 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                                Hurricane Irma     Mr. President, as we saw yesterday, Mother Nature once  again has crippled part of our Nation. Hurricane Irma made landfall on  Sunday, hitting the Lower Keys of Florida and then moving up the  State's western coastline. Like Hurricane Harvey in my home State of  Texas, the devastation in places like Marco Island and Orange County  means tough days and long nights ahead for the residents there.   My prayers, like those of so many others, go out to those who have  been impacted by this devastating storm, including those who evacuated  safely but will soon travel back to Florida, finding that everything  they had is gone as a result of the storm.   As Irma continues to affect Florida and the southeastern United  States, we stand ready to support the people in those States just like  so many did for us in Texas with Hurricane Harvey.                           Remembering September 11    Mr. President, on another separate note, as we all have seen and  recall, today is the solemn anniversary of a day that has had an even  more profound impact on our country than the recent storms. September  11 will always be remembered as the day that never quite goes away, the  day that remains a reminder of what can be taken from us in the blink  of an eye.   I have always said that it is etched in my memory like only one other  event in my lifetime, and that was in 1963 with the assassination of  President John F. Kennedy. I remember where I was and what I was doing  at that time when I first heard about it. Of course, I remember exactly  where I was and what I was doing when I learned of the  [[Page S5089]]  terrible events of 9/11. I was on the telephone talking to a colleague  of mine when my wife said: You need to see what is happening on the  television. I turned on the TV just in time to see the second plane hit  the towers in Manhattan.   Yes, it was 16 years ago that 19 Islamic terrorists snuck into our  country in defiance of our laws and attended flight schools in defiance  of all propriety. Sixteen years ago today, they hijacked four  commercial planes full of innocent passengers and, at 8:46 a.m. on  Tuesday morning, flew the first one directly into one of the tallest  buildings in our largest city in the United States.   Seventeen minutes later--the event, which my wife directed my  attention to on the TV set--the second plane hit, and shortly  thereafter, flight 77 slammed into the western wall of the Pentagon,  and Flight 93 crashed in Pennsylvania. Thanks to the heroic actions of  passengers on Flight 93, that plane could have very well headed here to  Washington and crashed into the Capitol, taking who knows how many  lives along with it.   As it was, 3,000 people were killed that day, and afterward almost  300 million U.S. citizens saw the world anew through fresh eyes. The  terrorists must have thought they could bring our Nation down, topple  it as they did the twin towers, but they badly miscalculated. They were  wrong. An America shocked was an America strengthened. America is  sometimes called the slumbering giant which, once awakened, is a  fearsome thing to behold, and that is exactly what happened after 9/11.  After we all took many deep breaths and thanked God for what was left,  we stood up and we fought back, united.   We primarily did that through our military--the core of our national  defense--those who took the fight to al-Qaida in places like  Afghanistan but also all the rest who surrounded and supported our  Armed Forces and intelligence personnel every step of the way.   Sixteen years later, we continue to confront new terrorist threats  and adjust to new geopolitical realities. I recall the statement of the  former Director of National Intelligence, who said, after 50 years in  the intelligence community, he had never seen a more diverse array of  threats confronting America than he did at that time, and nothing has  changed in that respect, which is why today America must maintain a  sense of vigilance, a sense of purpose, and a sense of moral clarity  regarding evil in all of its novel forms.   We must also ask if we are still standing behind our Armed Forces the  way we committed to do following the terrible events of 9/11. We must  make sure our military servicemembers have everything they need because  to do otherwise is to shirk our duty and to forget how our national  security is ultimately achieved.   One way we uphold that responsibility is through the National Defense  Authorization Act. If passed, this would mark the 55th year it is  signed into law. Later today, we will vote to take up this legislation,  and I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting that vote.   The Defense authorization bill ensures that crucial Department of  Defense programs are continued and establishes how our military funds  will be spent. The version of the bill which has been reported out of  committee helps reverse the readiness crisis created by the previous  administration. In the words of my friend, our colleague from Texas,  Mac Thornberry, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, ``We  have too few planes that can fly, too few ships that can sail and too  few soldiers who can deploy.'' That sums up the situation exactly.   The Defense authorization bill exemplifies our commitment to reverse  this downward trend. I don't know why it is that America tries to cash  the peace dividend at every turn when we have no peace, but that is  what has happened. Although the hole the previous administration placed  us in is deep, this bill authorizes the funds necessary to begin  restoring readiness, rebuilding capacity, and modernizing military  infrastructure.   I was recently at Sheppard Air Force Base in Wichita Falls, TX, the  base which trains half of all Air Force pilots in the country. They  told me one of the biggest problems they have is recruiting and  retaining pilots for the U.S. Air Force. While people will accept lower  wages for military service because they believe in serving the country,  if, because of cuts in funding for the Air Force and for the military,  they simply can't fly like they need to in order to be ready for the  next fight, many of them get discouraged and are tempted to go to work  in the private sector where they can earn more money. So we need to  make sure our troops--all of our Armed Forces--have the readiness  capability, and we need to fund that appropriately.   This bill will authorize appropriations for personnel and equipment,  including aircraft made in my home State--the Osprey, made in Amarillo,  TX, and the F-35 made in Fort Worth.   Finally, the Senate version will also authorize critical funding to  increase maritime capacity as well. Back in the 1980s, the Navy had  about 600 ships; today, we have 277, less than half. It is crucial that  we procure ships, aircraft, and munitions, continue to develop our new  military technology on our existing platforms and in the evolving cyber  domain, and reduce our shortfall in end strength--that we do all of  those things. These steps will provide our servicemembers with the  training and equipment necessary to defeat ISIS, al-Qaida, and  terrorist and state actors that threaten the United States and our way  of life.   Perhaps even more significant, in terms of the threat to the United  States and world peace, sending a message to Vladimir Putin and the  Russian Federation that America is no longer in retreat, but America  can be relied upon as a strong partner, and America's leadership role  in world affairs will be reestablished, will send a very important  message of deterrence to the bullies, the tyrants, and the  authoritarians around the world; to China, another major threat to  international security and peace that is being so aggressive in not  only developing arms that allow it to project power to different parts  of the Pacific and beyond but threatens maritime transit and safe  travel through places like the Strait of Malacca, where so much  international trade and national security travel occur.   Our colleagues in the House have passed their version of the Defense  authorization, and now it is our job to get it done. By passing a  strong defense bill and authorizing the sort of resources our military  needs in order for America to maintain its leadership role in the world  and provide a credible threat to deter aggression on the part of our  adversaries, we will leave our Nation and the world a safer place and  better off. It is one small way today that we can honor the memory of  those we lost 16 years ago.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Arizona (Mr. Flake), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr.  Graham), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Isakson), the Senator from  Florida (Mr. Rubio), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Scott), and  the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Strange).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio)  would have voted ``yea.''
