 Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of Arts in Education Week  and the power of art to improve student learning, inspire creativity,  and boost academic achievement at all ages.   The arts speak to all of us in different ways. I am inspired by the  performing arts, while others are drawn to design and, still, others  express themselves through music. The exposure to and participation in  creative disciplines empowers us to courageously innovate, a key to  success in school and beyond.   Mr. Speaker, in my home State of Rhode Island, music education is  encouraged, actually, in State law. Unfortunately, Congress has not  demonstrated the same commitment. I am extremely disappointed that the  Republican appropriations package for fiscal year 2018 eliminates the  Arts in Education program, a vital source of funding for arts programs  across the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, we must invest in the arts, not cut funding, and empower  the next generation to realize their potential to create.                            ____________________
