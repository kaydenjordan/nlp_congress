 Mr. Speaker, I rise as a proud cosponsor of the  Moving Forward Act and to urge support for two public safety amendments  I authored.   The first amendment is based on a bipartisan piece of legislation,  the SAFE TO DRIVE Act, which is co-led by my colleague Congressman    Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin. This legislation creates a new grant  program for States that ban non-navigational viewing, ensuring States  have robust resources to promote campaigns against distracted driving.  Every day, nine people are killed in the United States from distracted  driving.   Mr. Speaker, my second amendment, which I authored as chairman of the  Committee on Oversight and Reform's consumer protection subcommittee  with Congresswoman Katie Porter, requires clearer height and weight  requirement labels on children's booster seats to better protect  children and their health and safety. Most parents believe the booster  seats that they buy are safe, but research shows that 7 out of 10  children are improperly restrained.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge adoption of this measure.
