 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I certainly  fully appreciate Senator Hagerty's interest in protecting the First  Amendment and ensuring that legitimate speech is not unduly or unfairly  restricted. I am also committed to holding big tech companies  accountable. I held a series of bipartisan oversight hearings on social  media this Congress, including bringing top executives in to testify  and to answer tough questions.   The legislation, though, we are discussing today has not been  considered by the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.  I certainly look forward to working with my colleague to explore these  issues more fully, but given this bill has not been marked up by the  committee, I object.
