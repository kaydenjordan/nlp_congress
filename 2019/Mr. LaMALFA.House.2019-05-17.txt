 Madam Speaker, I rise to commend the Federal Railroad  Administration and the Trump administration for putting a stop to the  wasteful Federal spending on California's high-speed rail boondoggle.  This will save nearly $1 billion that can be used for anything else to  help Americans' transportation system.   At a time when tax increases on every mile you drive are being  contemplated ostensibly for our highway needs, how can we keep wasting  dollars on a project that ``has repeatedly failed to comply with the  terms of the 2010 agreement and has failed to make reasonable  progress''?   It is no longer even a high-speed train project nor does it even  connect San Francisco to L.A. but, instead, terminates in an almond  orchard somewhere north of Bakersfield.   It has tripled in price since 2008, when put in front of the  California voters, and is still at least $70 billion short of the $100  billion tripled price or more. That $70 billion will not be coming from  this Congress.   Let's channel these hard-earned tax dollars into highways people  need, want, and can actually use, or water storage, or just about  anything else.                            ____________________
