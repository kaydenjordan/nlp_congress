SEC. 2. REAFFIRMATION OF POLICY AND FINDINGS.         (a) Reaffirmation of Policy.--Congress reaffirms that the       long-term goal of the human space flight and exploration       efforts of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration       shall be to expand permanent human presence beyond low-Earth       orbit and to do so, where practical, in a manner involving       international partners, as stated in section 202(a) of the       National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization       Act of 2010 (42 U.S.C. 18312(a)).        (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) In accordance with section 204 of the National       Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of       2010 (Public Law 111-267; 124 Stat. 2813), the National       Academy of Sciences, through its Committee on Human       Spaceflight, conducted a review of the goals, core       capabilities, and direction of human space flight, and       published the findings and recommendations in a 2014 report       entitled ``Pathways to Exploration: Rationales and Approaches       for a U.S. Program of Human Space Exploration''.        (2) The Committee on Human Spaceflight included leaders       from the aerospace, scientific, security, and policy       communities. With input from the public, the Committee on       Human Spaceflight concluded that many practical and       aspirational rationales together constitute a compelling case       for human space exploration. These rationales include       economic benefits, national security, national prestige,       inspiring students and other citizens, scientific discovery,       human survival, and a sense of shared destiny.        (3) The Committee on Human Spaceflight affirmed that Mars       is the appropriate long-term goal for the human space flight       program.        (4) The Committee on Human Spaceflight recommended that the       National Aeronautics and Space Administration define a series       of sustainable steps and conduct mission planning and       technology development as needed to achieve the long-term       goal of placing humans on the surface of  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
