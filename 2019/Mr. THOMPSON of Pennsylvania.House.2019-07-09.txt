 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 3073, the TICK Act, which would help combat the rise of tickborne  and bloodborne illnesses across the country. These diseases are rapidly  becoming a serious and growing threat to public health with more than  300,000 estimated cases annually.   In my home State of Pennsylvania alone, ticks are a common threat to  those who explore our vast network of trails and public lands in  Pennsylvania.   While ticks carry a variety of harmful diseases, Lyme disease is one  of the most prevalent. Currently, there are no uniformly accepted  treatment options for patients with chronic symptoms of Lyme disease.   The TICK Act would develop a national strategy to prevent and treat  Lyme and other diseases, including those spread by mosquitos and fleas.  It would also authorize the Centers for Disease Control to award grants  to State health departments to support early detection and diagnosis,  improve treatment, and raise public awareness.   I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 3073, and I urge my colleagues to  cosponsor this legislation to prevent and treat Lyme and other vector- borne diseases.                            ____________________
