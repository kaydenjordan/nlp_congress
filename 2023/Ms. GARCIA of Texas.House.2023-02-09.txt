 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of Michael N. Mosteit.   Mike was a trailblazer in the labor movement, a dedicated public  servant, and a loving family man.   As a member of IBEW Local 66 for over 50 years, he strived to ensure  our workers had fair representation and proper wages.   I had the honor of standing shoulder to shoulder with Mike many  times--defending workers, organizing, walking the picket line, winning,  and sometimes trying and trying again.   The work was never about the money. It was about fighting for the  quality of life and transformational difference a good job can do for a  family.   That is what leadership is: wanting something better for others than  you have for yourself. That was Mike Mosteit.   Our hearts go out to his loving wife, Carol, a wonderful educator in  her own right, and their son, Joshua.   Rest in peace, Mike. We will keep up the fight until we meet again on  another picket line. God bless.                            ____________________
