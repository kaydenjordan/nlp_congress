 Mr. President, I recall the first time I sat down with  the late great Senator Bob Dole after I had been elected to Congress.  And the purpose of that meeting was to get to know the Senator, but I  had a big issue I was getting ready to vote on, and I wanted to get his  advice. As I presented to him the legislation I was going to be voting  on the next day, he stopped and looked at me, and he said: Roger, what  you need to do is just go back to Kansas and listen to the people of  Kansas. They will tell you the answer to that question.   So this August was no different than any break I have had. Like many  of my colleagues, we went back to our home States. I went from Wathena  to Wichita, from small towns to big cities, from the inner city to  rural America; and we listened. We sat down with unions, small  businesses, big businesses, folks from financial services, and farmers  and ranchers. We sat down with leaders from public schools and private  schools.   We had roundtables. We did multiple roundtables on childcare,  homelessness. We sat down with multiple minority business owners, and  we talked about the challenges they had, specifically about access to  capital. We did roundtables on nutrition and healthcare.   In Abilene, KS, we celebrated the 70th anniversary of the Small  Business Administration, founded by our 34th President of the United  States, Kansans' own Dwight David Eisenhower; we participated in a DHS  human trafficking event and in history. I thought I had seen all the  history from Kansas, but we found two more locations that were  underground railroads where they particularly housed freedom seekers-- one in the Quindaro Ruins of Kansas City, KS, and the John Brown cabin  in Osawatomie.   But of all the things we did that I think is important was our  fentanyl awareness campaign: One Pill Can Kill.   I am often asked about going from being a physician to a Senator and  what is the difference. And I would describe that as a physician, I  could impact maybe 30, 40, 50 people in one day; but as a U.S. Senator,  I have the opportunity to impact thousands of people and to save lives.  In this case, that is exactly what the goal of this One Pill Can Kill  campaign was.   We thought that as kids return to school would be an ideal time to  get out that message that, indeed, one pill--one fake pill laced with  fentanyl--can kill. Our entire Kansas delegation participated, and I am  grateful for their support. We had over 100 Kansas organizations  actively participate as well, reaching out to their own networks. From  law enforcement, the KBI was outstanding, the sheriffs; our community  health centers; colleges; high schools; health departments--anyone we  could get to, to get that message out that one pill can kill.   Every day, our staff did an incredible job of arming every one of the  organizations with information to help get that word out. It resulted  in thousands of social media posts across the State, and I am grateful  for the local media--the newspapers, the radios, the television  stations--that resulted in hundreds of articles that, indeed, one pill  can kill.   And I think the story is easy to tell, and that is what we tried to  do was just tell the story of fentanyl, how the cartel is alive and  well across the State of Kansas; that they are lacing Xanax, Adderall,  and Percocet with fentanyl, and even marijuana they are lacing with it;  that this is now the No. 1 killer of young adults.   I am sad to say that most every day, we lose a Kansan to fentanyl  poisoning. In fact, we are using Narcan 10, 15, 20 times a day. I  talked to a fireman in Kansas City who said every day they are making  runs because of fentanyl.   And again, we just wanted to share the story of where fentanyl is  being sold, how its sold, its deceptiveness, and the efforts required  to combat it.   I will just close with this: It is easier to get a fentanyl tablet  and cheaper to get a fentanyl tablet delivered to your home than it is  to order a piece of pizza. For a dollar a pill, you can now get  fentanyl delivered to your home. And all it takes is just one of those  pills to kill.   For the sake of our children, I pray that we can secure our borders,  that we would stop the influx of fentanyl into Kansas and the rest of  this country. And in doing so, we can save literally hundreds, if not  thousands, of lives. Our weeklong campaign pushed us closer to that  goal.   I yield the floor.
