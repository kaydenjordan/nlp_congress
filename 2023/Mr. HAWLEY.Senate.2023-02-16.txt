 Mr. President, I thank Senator Moran for the opportunity  to say a few words and congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs and  all of Chiefs Kingdom. I just want to add my words of congratulations  to the Hunt family. To Clark and Tavia and all of their kids, thank you  for your friendship, thank you for your tremendous leadership.   I want to say congratulations to the president of the Chiefs, Mark  Donovan, to Andy Reid, and I particularly want to add a word of  congratulations to my friend Harrison Butker, who delivered the game- winning kick, both in the AFC Championship and also in the Super Bowl.  He had a tremendous, tremendous season. Of course, the entire team had  a tremendous season. But, just on a personal note to Harrison, well  done, man--as you would say, to the heights.   So congratulations to all of the team, and I look forward to seeing  this resolution and the memorialization of this victory entered into  the Congressional Record.   With that, I yield back to the Senator from Kansas.
