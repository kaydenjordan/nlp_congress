 Article IV, section 1.   ``Full faith and credit shall be given in each State to the public  acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other State. And the  Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts,  records and proceedings shall be proved, and the effect thereof.''  [[Page H105]]         Mr. Speaker, I oppose U.N. Security Council Resolution  2334--an anti-Israel, anti-Jewish attempt on behalf of pro-Palestinian  nations to delegitimize Israel and ethnically cleanse East Jerusalem  and Judea and Samaria of the Jewish people.   The Israelis have long been willing to compromise large swaths of  land in this region in pursuit of a two-state solution. It has been the  Palestinians who have, time and again, declined real offers on the  table for their own state. Just think about this reality. If the  Israelis agreed right now to make all of the concessions this U.N.  Security Council resolution calls for, there would still not be peace.  A viable two-state solution isn't just about Israel's recognizing the  Palestinians' right to exist; it is also about the Palestinians'  recognizing Israel's right to exist.   As for me, I stand for freedom, and America should stand strong-- shoulder to shoulder--with Israel.   President Obama lit a menorah this year at the White House. He  reflected on Hanukkah as a celebration of the  [[Page H154]]  Maccabees' fight for freedom--the Maccabees, who lived, prayed, and  fought on the land that this resolution now calls illegally occupied  territory. It is an insult this resolution was passed just one day  before the start of Hanukkah. Israel is one of America's greatest  allies and is a beacon of freedom and liberty in a very dark region of  the world. The Obama administration, by allowing this resolution to  pass, is attempting a dangerous shift in American foreign policy that  cannot be allowed to stand.   I encourage all of my colleagues to support this resolution, and I  thank Chairman Royce for his leadership.
