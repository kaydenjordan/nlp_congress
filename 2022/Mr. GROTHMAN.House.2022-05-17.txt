 Madam Speaker, I will make some comments on the  reauthorization bill. This is one of these big bills that is 268 pages.  I don't have time to go through all of the problems with the bill, but  I am just going to touch on some highlights, or low lights.   In this area of high inflation, with a bill like this, the first  thing I look at is the cost. The cost of this bill--right now, we are  spending about $9.9 billion on this topic. Over the next 6 years, they  expect it to increase to $16.2 billion. You are looking at a 63 percent  increase in spending on this area at a time where we really don't have  any money to increase anything. So I want the American public to  understand there is a big spending increase here.   Secondly, I will talk about a very important population to me, though  a population that is not talked about enough, and that is the fact that  we are continuing to allow a provision in law which I think is damaging  to people born with different abilities. Right now, they are not able  to work at work centers, which is one of these places that sometimes  pays under minimum wage, until they are at least 24 years old. We would  never tell anybody of other abilities that you are not allowed to work  until you are age 24. But by making it--I won't say impossible, but  very difficult to work at a work center until age 24, I think you stunt  the people's growth.   I was really hoping we would use this opportunity to allow people  with different abilities to begin to work at 18 or 19 years old.  Anybody who tours these work centers cannot help but be touched by how  proud these folks are to work there. I wish they could work there at  age 18 instead of 24.   The next thing I will point out is a clear feature of this bill is to  dramatically expand Job Corps; in other words, government jobs that are  a steppingstone, I guess, if you can't find another job. There has  never been a time, I think, in American history in which they are  looking for more people to work. So as I go around my district, be it  the service industry, agriculture, light manufacturing, they are  begging for employees. What is Congress going to do? They are going to  go in there and say, no, we are not going to let you work at the local  restaurant; we are going to have you work for Job Corps. I think that  is a mistake.   The fourth thing I will point out is this obsession with racial  biases and gender identity. There is a bill right now that the majority  party has that is called the LGBT Data Inclusion Act, in which they  expect everybody, I guess, to tell their employer what their sexual  preferences are. I have been doing this job in politics for a long  time. I have never had a discussion about sexual preferences with any  of my employees. I would feel embarrassed to ask them. But this bill  clearly implies a world in which when you apply for a job, let's talk  about our sexual identity.   The fifth thing I point out is we have a big problem in this country  at our southern border. In this bill, in committee, we tried to have E- Verify to apply to all of these jobs; in other words, to make sure that  if we are going to have such a program, at least it is American  citizens who take advantage of the program. That amendment was shot  down in committee.   What does that tell me? It tells me that one more time, along with  free medical care, along with Pell grants, the majority party wants to  help out people who are coming here who shouldn't be here. E-Verify  really should have been part of the bill. I don't think the American  public wants another government program designed, at least in part, to  benefit people who are here illegally.   Those are some of the greatest hits of the bill.    Madam Speaker, it was a big day a couple of days ago  because the new immigration figures  [[Page H5092]]  came out for the month of April, and it is something that ought to be  banner headlines in all the newspapers. I will report them.   In April, 185,000 illegal immigrants entered the United States.  Sometimes people talk about the number of contacts we have; some of the  people turned around. Madam Speaker, 185,000, that is up from 152,000  in March. It is 185,000 this April; 66,000 last April; and two Aprils  ago, under a different administration, it was under 6,000.   Let me repeat: In April 2020, 5,700 people entered the country, and  we didn't know exactly who they were; last April, 66,000; now, 185,000.   In there, we have 8,600 unaccompanied children. People want to worry  about families being broken up, that they will send them somewhere in  the United States. But 8,600 children entered the country  unaccompanied.   In any event, if we have any newspaper people listening, they ought  to report this as the banner headline tomorrow.                            ____________________
