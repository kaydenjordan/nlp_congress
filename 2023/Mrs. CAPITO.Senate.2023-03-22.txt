 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a constant  issue in front of the American people that has haunted, I think, and  will haunt this President during his tenure in the White House. It is a  subject that my Republican colleagues and I have highlighted in this  Chamber--we did just several weeks ago--and this is the continued lack  and disregard for border security in our country.   Last week, the White House Press Secretary said that when it comes to  the Biden administration and border security:         We're going to secure the border and do the work.    Well, I wonder what it was that has found this newfound urgency at  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. And why has it taken 785 days for the Press  Secretary to acknowledge the problem?   Maybe it is the record 2.7 million migrant encounters in fiscal year  2022. Or could it be the more than 4.9 million illegal border crossings  since President Biden took office? Or how about, for the first time in  history, monthly apprehensions at the southern border have surpassed  150,000 for 24 consecutive months? Or that in a season when illegal  border crossings are typically lower, Customs and Border Protection  encounters rose 2 percent last month with heroine seizures increasing  99 percent and fentanyl seizures increasing 58 percent?   Whatever the reason--whatever the reason--I sure would like to  welcome the White House to the same page that we as Republicans have  been on since day one of this administration.   While my colleagues and I have been sounding constant alarms about  the porousness of our border, the Biden administration has, No. 1,  stopped making needed updates to our physical border system, leaving  gates inoperational and open; they have halted deportations and have  been inconsistent in implementing effective policies that kept illegal  border crossings under that 150,000 level for 4 consecutive years  prior. There is no denying that this crisis is a self-manufactured  crisis.   Maybe most encompassing of their priorities regarding security of our  country is that the Department of Homeland Security is one of the few  Agencies--and they are the ones tasked with this difficult issue--is  one of the few Agencies facing an overall budget cut in the President's  latest budget proposal. Remember, a budget is your priorities; it is  where you want to do your work.   In an age where it seems that the President and the Congressional  Democrats cannot spend enough, they decide to make room for more  spending and their radical priorities by putting the Agency in charge  of defending our homeland on the chopping block first. I don't know  about you, but that doesn't seem like something an administration that  is going to ``secure the border'' should be doing.    Perhaps even more alarming are the comments made by the DHS Secretary  regarding their budget allotment. Secretary Mayorkas outlines six  priorities in the budget summary that he claims the Agency can work to  accomplish with the help of the budget. Toward the top of the list-- this is the Department of Homeland Security. Toward the top of the  list, ``invest in climate.'' The second-to-last priority, ``help secure  the border.'' That is simply unacceptable, especially as migrant  encounters at the southern border in fiscal year 2023--where we are in  now--are already outpacing the records set in 2022.   My colleagues and I hear the Biden administration quite clear:  Securing the border has not been and never will be a priority for this  President or his Department of Homeland Security.   What makes this admission so devastating is that while the  administration continues to balk at serious attempts to secure the  southern border, countless Americans are dying at the hands of the  illicit drugs that make their way into our communities through that  same southern border. Last month alone, 2,282 pounds of fentanyl--which  we know is lethal in extremely, extremely small doses and small  amounts--and 10,333 pounds of methamphetamine were seized at the  southern border. That amount of fentanyl is the equivalent to 517  million lethal doses.   Our Border Patrol is stretched unfathomably thin with very little  support from the administration. There is no telling how many--the  amount of drugs that are getting through undetected. I was just talking  about the ones that we got.   Just last month, I spoke in this Chamber regarding a recent drug bust  in my home State of West Virginia. As investigators from the U.S.  Attorney's Office in the Northern District of West Virginia recovered  cocaine, meth, and fentanyl, they discovered that these deadly  substances had been shipped directly through the U.S.-Mexican border to  Ohio via a tractor-trailer. The connection between the southern border  crisis and our addiction epidemic back home could not be any clearer. I  have said it before, and I will say it again: Every State--my State--is  a border State.   While President Biden and his administration continue to put  confusing and often conflicting words before action, if they even take  action, my colleagues and I continue to make it a concerted effort to  get to the bottom of this chaos.   Just this past weekend, I joined a bipartisan, bicameral group of  lawmakers to travel to Mexico City where we met--with quite lengthy  meetings--with Mexico's President Lopez Obrador. While there, we held  meetings on the United States security posture with regard to Mexico,  the chaos at our border, the devastating impacts of fentanyl in our  communities, and the violence and trafficking perpetrated by the  Mexican cartels. All these issues are top concerns to us here in this  country.   It is clear that Mexico needs to continue to address corruption at  their ports of entry, and the President emphasized this. They need to  focus on the fentanyl precursors coming from China that are coming into  our country.   I am very excited and happy that we secured a commitment from  President Lopez Obrador that their administration will confront China  regarding fentanyl precursors being shipped into their country. This is  a major step in cutting fentanyl trafficking in the United States at  its source and is needed to alleviate the chaos and corruption  currently happening at the border between our two countries.   There is no way to deny that both the United States and Mexico--that  border has stressed our countries beyond belief. I think we serve as  partners with Mexico. We need to be partners--and good partners--with  Mexico to solve this problem.   We are facing historic levels of illegal immigration. We must  continue to meet these challenges with urgency and a willingness to  work together, and we certainly got that message conveyed to the  Mexican President and a reciprocal message coming back from him and his  administration.   As my Republican colleagues and I will continue to make clear today,  Republicans stand for solutions and not just spending. We stand for  action, and we also stand for border security.   I encourage President Biden to join us in this effort and work toward  bipartisan border solutions that are effective; that support our Border  Patrol officers; and that also, in the end, will save countless lives.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on  the previous issue begin immediately.  [[Page S887]]     I ask for the yeas and nays.
