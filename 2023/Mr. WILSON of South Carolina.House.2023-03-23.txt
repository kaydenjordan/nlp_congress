 Mr. Speaker, The Washington Post lead  editorial on March 10 confirmed the murderous invasion of Ukraine by  war criminal Putin demands Western support of Ukraine as `` . . .  President Biden will be tested and judged by his own success in making  a similar case for this country to step up by applying its military and  industrial might.''   Sadly, there ``is a gap between the West's supportive rhetoric on  equipping Ukraine . . . and the pace of actual deliveries of arms and  ammunition.''   ``It's critical that the administration perceive those interests  clearly and explain them compellingly. . . .   `` . . . for our European allies' security but also to maintain a  basic principle of civilized international relations: that one state  cannot invade and subjugate another. . . . It is also crucial to  transmit the message to China, North Korea and other would-be  aggressors that the United States will stand fast in defense. . . . `'   In conclusion, it is clear ``President Biden will be tested and  judged'' by his decisions to support the courageous people of Ukraine.   Thank you, Prince William, heir to the British throne, for visiting  the British troops in Poland training Ukrainians for freedom. President  Andrzej Duda is the courageous President of Poland.                            ____________________
