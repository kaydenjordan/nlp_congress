 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, today the Senate will vote on a  bipartisan War Powers Resolution offered by Senator Kaine directing the  President to terminate the use of U.S. Armed Forces for hostilities  against the Islamic Republic of Iran.   The Constitution is clear: Congress has the power to declare war. The  President has no authority to enter the United States into another  endless conflict in the Middle East, but I fear that the President's  erratic decision-making, his lack of strategy, his inability to control  his impulses may bumble us into a war nonetheless, even if he doesn't  intend it.   With this bipartisan resolution, the Senate will assert its  constitutional authority and send a clear bipartisan message that the  President--this President or any President--cannot sidestep Congress  when it comes to matters of war and peace. It is important to do this  now.   The President's actions in the Middle East have escalated the  confrontation. Before the State of the Union, the President himself  said that war with Iran was ``closer than you thought''--  [[Page S1054]]  his words. Now, let me be clear, nobody in this Chamber will shed a  single tear over the death of Iranian General Soleimani, but that  doesn't mean that we disregard the potential consequences of the strike  or any comparable action. It is more than appropriate for Congress to  affirm that it has authority over any major long-term hostilities with  Iran, as the Constitution prescribes.   Yet, still, some on the other side have claimed that this War Powers  Resolution is nothing more than an attempt by Democrats to embarrass  President Trump. The Founding Fathers would laugh at that assertion.  One of the great powers they gave Congress--not the executive--was the  power to declare war. This resolution is partisan? Well, then, why are  a good number of Republicans supporting it?   Let me say this again. This resolution is going to pass with a  bipartisan majority of Senators in support--a rarity these days. If  this is purely an attempt to embarrass the President, well, it is going  to be a bipartisan one.   We need to stop pretending as if both sides of the aisle aren't  concerned about the President having too much leeway over matters of  war and peace. That is why this resolution is bipartisan, because both  sides of the aisle agree that for too long Congress has ceded our  constitutional authority to the executive branch, and we are taking an  important step today to claim that authority back.   Now, today there will be amendments offered that will seek to do one  thing and one thing only: undermine what we are trying to achieve today  and provide the President's lawyers with get-out-of-jail free cards. My  colleague from Arkansas has an amendment that will create an exception  for operations against foreign terrorist organizations. It sounds  reasonable at first, but any enterprising lawyer in the administration  could use this amendment to justify the type of unilateral escalation  of hostilities that this legislation would prohibit. My colleague from  Florida has an amendment that seeks a similar outcome. My friends on  both sides who wish this resolution to pass should vote down these  amendments. They cut against the core of the legislation. Senator Kaine  told me that if this amendment passed, the Cotton amendment, he would  be forced to vote against his own bill. What good would that do for  those of us who want to pass it anyway?   One final point. With respect to the situation in Iran, we still  don't have a clear picture from the administration about our strategy  in the region. The only gesture of transparency that this  administration has been able to muster was a classified all-Members  briefing conducted more than a week after the strike. There were 97  Senators who attended, but only 15 Members got to ask questions before  the administration, led by Secretary Pompeo, practically sprinted out  the door with a less-than-genuine commitment to return. Our demands for  a followup briefing have been ignored by the White House, Secretary  Esper, and Secretary Pompeo. Those briefings should have occurred  before the action. I learned about what we were doing in the news, and  2 hours later got a call from the administration.   I fear that by keeping Congress and the American people in the dark,  President Trump may be directing military operations in a manner that  doesn't stand up to public scrutiny. When you are forced to consult  with Congress and when Congress has the power to declare war, quick and  sloppy thinking evaporates because people have to at least examine the  issues in some detail, and the American public has some say.   That is why Senator Kaine's War Powers Resolution is a matter of  necessity. I commend Senator Kaine and his colleagues on the job he has  done, including my colleague from Illinois, sitting right here, and I  urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it.                            Department of Justice    Madam President, now on the Department of Justice. In the short week  since the conclusion of the President's impeachment trial, the  President has reminded us of all the reasons why Congress must serve as  the check on the Executive.   The President has dismissed members of his administration who  testified in the House impeachment inquiry, including, for no reason,  the twin brother of one of the witnesses. The administration has  reportedly withdrawn the nomination of a senior Pentagon official who  merely advised her colleagues about the legal implications of delaying  assistance to Ukraine. Truth--when the President doesn't like the  truth, it has no place in this administration, and people who speak  truth to power are summarily dismissed.   On Tuesday, after career prosecutors made sentencing recommendations  for Roger Stone, who was found guilty of witness tampering and lying to  Congress, the President tweeted that his former colleague and confidant  was being unfairly treated. Soon afterward, it appears the Attorney  General or other political appointees at DOJ countermanded the  sentencing recommendation and will instead advise a more lenient  sentence for the President's friend. As a result, all four career  prosecutors connected to the Stone case withdrew from the case or  resigned from the Justice Department entirely--a clear signal they  believed the revised sentencing conflicted with their professional and  ethical obligations as prosecutors.   Of course, it was not enough for the President to just lean on the  Justice Department to make it easy on his old pal. The President went  on publicly to attack the judge who would decide Mr. Stone's fate-- another example of the President's blatant contempt for the  independence of the judiciary.   In the past, Chief Justice Roberts has spoken out in defense of the  independence of the judicial branch. When the President, during his  campaign, attacked Judge Curiel, the Chief Justice released a statement  saying:         We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or       Clinton judges. We have an extraordinary group of dedicated       judges doing their level best to do equal right to those       appearing before them. The independent judiciary is something       we should all be thankful for.    That is what Chief Justice Roberts said.   Well, President Trump is once again attacking a Federal judge--in  this case, Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is presiding over the Stone  case. The Nation now looks again to Chief Justice Roberts to make clear  to President Trump that these attacks are unacceptable. Speaking of the  independence of the judiciary in broad and general terms is well and  good. It is a good thing to do, but to not speak up now, when in the  middle of this brouhaha a judge is being attacked by the President  before she makes a sentencing decision, that is when we really need the  Chief Justice to speak up. Now would be the time for Chief Justice  Roberts to speak up. Now would be the time for the Chief Justice to  directly and specifically defend the independence of this Federal  judge. I hope he will see fit to do that and to do it today.   I have also called on the inspector general of the Justice Department  to investigate the Roger Stone matter. The Judiciary Committee in the  Senate should do the same, but even without formal investigation, it is  abundantly clear that something is rotten in the Justice Department.   The President can corrupt our Justice Department in two major ways:  pressuring it to investigate his opponents or using its power to reward  his friends. The impeachment of the President concerned the first  abuse: The President wanted a foreign power to announce an  investigation into one of his political opponents or funnel allegedly  incriminating information to our Justice Department. The President  explicitly mentioned the Attorney General during his phone call with  the Ukrainian President. More recently, Attorney General Barr has  publicly said that the Justice Department has now set up a channel to  receive information from the President's personal attorney, Rudy  Giuliani, about the Ukraine scandal. It seems to be an attempt to  accomplish the same goals the President was just impeached over.   The events surrounding Mr. Stone's more lenient sentencing  recommendations are an example of the second way Presidents can corrupt  the Justice Department: improperly rewarding the President's friends.  In the wake of Watergate, Congress passed laws and made crucial reforms  so this kind of abuse of the levers of power will not happen again, but  here, right now, the President is using the hallowed Justice  Department--the only Cabinet agency named for an ideal, Justice--as his  personal law firm. He is using the Justice  [[Page S1055]]  Department named for an ideal, Justice, as his personal law firm.   What a shame. What a defamation of what the Constitution is all  about.   My Senate colleagues who believed the President would be chastened by  impeachment have been completely and disastrously wrong. The only  lesson the President has learned is that there is nothing he can do  that Senate Republicans will not forgive or rationalize or simply  ignore. The lesson the President has learned is that the courts are  unlikely to stop him, too, because the Senate Republican caucus has  voted to confirm virtually every judge he has nominated, no matter how  unqualified or ill-suited to the bench.   We are staring at a crisis of the rule of law. The institutions  designed to check Executive power are crumbling before our very eyes.  The crisis was the President's own making, but it was enabled and  emboldened by every Senate Republican who has been too afraid to stand  up to the President and say no.   I yield the floor.
