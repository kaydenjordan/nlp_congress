 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share with you a letter  from Antonio, a constituent of mine affected by this shutdown. He says:         I am an air traffic controller at O'Hare Airport. This is       already a stressful job, but a job that I love. This shutdown       is adding an extra layer of stress to all of the controllers       working around the country. With the shutdown going past a       month, we are all stressing about bills, how to put food on       the table, how to pay for childcare, et cetera. We don't have       the luxury of escaping from the stress of this job because,       when we go home, the stress just continues as worrying.        Finding out that our vision and dental benefits would be       billed to us with the expectation that we pay those bills out       of our own pockets, despite having no paycheck for over a       month, has only added to that stress. This shutdown is going       to be a massive safety risk for the flying public if it       doesn't end soon.    I have more from Antonio, which I will include in the Record later.                            ____________________
