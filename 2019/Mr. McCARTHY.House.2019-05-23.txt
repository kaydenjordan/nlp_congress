 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Before I begin, I want to thank both sides. I want to thank the  chairman and I want to thank the ranking member, not for the bill that  is on the floor today but for the bill that was put out of committee.   When we look across the country, we see division. Very seldom can we  ever find a bill that gets every Democrat's and every Republican's  support, but that is what we look for, that committees can work  together.   The whole reason bills go through committees before they come to the  floor is this is where the expertise is, this is where the debates  happen, this is where it is combined together.   But now I want to apologize to the chairman. I don't know what the  gentleman's leadership did or why. But why would they change the moment  that we have for the country to see something that they haven't seen in  a while? Why would they do something that a chairman and a ranking  member and every member on that committee, regardless of where they  come from across this country, regardless of party, agreed to?   Special interest has power. Special interest is more powerful than  the members who are in that committee with the expertise. Special  interest is more powerful than Members of Congress finding common  ground. Special interest is more powerful with the leadership on the  other side.   They should not treat their Members this way. They should not treat  America this way.   So let's talk about this bill. Because what it really goes to is, how  powerful is this special interest, and who are they hurting?   Many parents choose to use a 529 savings account to help them save  money for their children's education. We all agree on each side of the  aisle that the most important thing that happens when you have a child  is the opportunity that they will have. It is no longer about what you  will become; it is what your children's opportunities will be.   We all agree that education is the great equalizer. It doesn't matter  where a person grows up or what side of the street they live on, but  education will give everybody that opportunity.   As a Republican leader, when I watched this committee work, I was  proud. I was proud of both sides. I was proud that they were able to  come together. And where they came together was on 529 accounts. These  plans allow them to invest in a tax-free account, incur interest, and  spend it on educational expenses like tuition.   For many years, these accounts only applied to college-related  expenses, but, today, thanks to the Republican-led tax reform law in  2017, families can now use those funds to pay K-12 costs too.   Because why would we want to hurt somebody? Maybe they were in a bad  school district or have other reasons. We want everybody in America to  have that opportunity. That was a big win for all families--Republican,  Democrat, Green Party, didn't matter.   Under current law, 529 savings accounts cannot be used for K-12 book  costs, tutoring expenses for when kids fall behind and we want them to  be able to catch up, fees for college admission exams--anybody that has  a child at that age knows how much is spent on all of the exams--or to  pay for educational therapy for students with disabilities.   Wouldn't everybody want to help that child with disabilities? I  believe so. The action of the committee proved that. Every Democrat in  the committee said that, and every member on the Republican side said  that. I was proud of that.    But, unfortunately, special interest has more power. This is why, to  me, I have real concerns on this bill. The official bill report is  fantastic, what came out of committee. But when it got to the Democrat  leadership, I guess they had different plans.   Now, I shouldn't be shocked, because I was sitting in this well last  week with the same dilemma. Another committee, Energy and Commerce, was  dealing with a really important issue, much like what we are dealing  with today, prescription drugs. And what happened was that both sides  agreed on how to make prescription drug prices lower and give Americans  more options, and they all voted for it. But it went right through that  leadership, Madam Speaker, on the other side, and special interest won  again. They put a poison pill in, so that will never become law.   Madam Speaker, because special interest pressured this leadership to  change this bill, it says something. To me, it says three things very  clearly.   It seems to me that the Democratic leadership is not the same  Democratic leadership that I knew in the past. There are people on the  other side of the aisle who call themselves Socialist Democrats. It  seems to me that they want institutions, not individuals, to be focused  on education funding. They want partisan interests, not parents, to  decide how children learn. And they want the Federal Government, not  families, to have control over their money.                                time  1015    But that is not what the American people want. The American people  want exactly what happened in that committee, exactly the power that  brought all the Republicans and all the Democrats together. They don't  want special interests to continue to run this House.   The committee proved they could stand up. Whom did they stand up for?  Those who need it the most: the parents of children with disabilities,  leveling the playing field so every child has an opportunity when it  comes to education.   Of all the issues that could divide us, Madam Speaker, I don't  understand why the leadership did that to the Ways and Means Committee.  I don't think that is right for the work that the chairman and the  ranking member put in. We deserve better. We displayed that we could be  better. Unfortunately, special interests won over the parents, and that  is wrong.
