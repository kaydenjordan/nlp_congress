 Mr. Speaker, 5 years ago today, Caitlan Coleman, an  American citizen from York County, Pennsylvania, which I am privileged  to represent, was taken hostage by the Haqqani Network, an offshoot of  the Taliban, while hiking near the Pakistan and Afghanistan border.   Caitlan has given birth to two boys while in captivity, boys whose  only life experience has been that of a hostage and surrounded by  violence and fear. I speak with Caitlan's mom and dad regularly. While  my heart breaks for them, as fellow Americans, as a father with  children of my own, I am crestfallen and horrified for them.   Caitlan and her family are Americans. We cannot rest until they are  released and returned safely to the arms of the United States. I urge  my colleagues to join me in praying for the safe return of Caitlan, her  husband, and her two children, but also for her family and loved ones  for whom time stopped 5 years ago.   I implore the U.S. State Department to use every resource at our  disposal to bring our American citizens home.                            ____________________
