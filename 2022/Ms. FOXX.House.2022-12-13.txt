 Mr. Speaker, President Biden is turning the Federal Student  Loan Program into a titanic heading straight for an iceberg.   The Biden administration's changes to these programs will make a bad  system worse.   For starters, President Biden's sixth extension of the student loan  repayment pause brings the total cost of this unjustifiable policy to  $195 billion. This is foolish by every measure.   Most college-educated workers were not the ones to lose their jobs  during the pandemic and were able to adjust to flexible work  arrangements, so why are they getting special treatment from the Biden  administration?   Would it be fair to force student loan borrowers to pay off the car  and mortgage loans of the millions of blue-collar Americans who lost  their jobs because of forced economic shutdowns? The answer is a  resounding no.   To add insult to injury, President Biden is falsely promising a $400  billion bailout knowing full well this illegal, disgraceful action will  likely get struck down in court.   Using the livelihoods of 40 million borrowers to score political  points at the expense of hardworking taxpayers and the next generation  of students is politics at its worst.   President Biden's use of the executive pen to stab taxpayers in the  back doesn't end there.   Since taking office, President Biden has been canceling massive  amounts of loans under the guise of ``fixing'' broken programs. The  very programs Democrats themselves created, including nearly $50  billion through the administration's illegal waivers.   This is a blatant disregard for the rule of law. Our student loan  system already operates in the red, and these changes will ensure it  costs taxpayers even more.   Yet, it is only the tip of the iceberg.   Indeed, the Biden administration's new income-driven repayment plan,  IDR, will turn Federal student loans into untargeted grants costing  taxpayers a fortune in the process.   Because President Biden couldn't get his radical agenda through  Congress, he is dismantling the Federal student loan program and  pushing Democrats' free college plan by executive fiat.   Between slashing payments for high-income graduate students to  expanding the number of individuals who will receive forgiveness,  economists and policy experts agree that the average student loan  borrower will pay roughly half of what he or she owes if this plan is  enacted.   This is not what taxpayers signed up for when the program was  created, and it is certainly not the plan Congress wrote and passed.   These changes will have long-term consequences because they create  perverse incentives for over-borrowing. Why would students make smart  financial decisions when they know Uncle Joe or another administration  will pay off their loans?   Instead of solving the problem for all borrowers, President Biden is  sticking future borrowers in a ship with cracks in the hull.   These foolhardy changes will accelerate tuition, inflation. With  taxpayer-subsidized tuition, colleges and universities will have no  incentives to keep costs down. It will also turn more postsecondary  institutions into degree mills.   The only thing loan forgiveness does is encourage colleges and  universities to offer even more degree programs they know do not pay  off once students enter the workforce.   Our country needs reforms that can right the ship, not sink it even  deeper into a fiscal abyss. Republicans are proposing commonsense  solutions that will make the Federal student loan program seaworthy.   The REAL Reforms Act provides targeted relief for those that need it  most instead of stealing from taxpayers to provide ineffective and  expensive bailouts.   This legislation also provides practical solutions for the underlying  problems plaguing higher education.   These are the kinds of policies we need, policies that will make our  Federal student loan program capable of serving borrowers without  throwing taxpayers overboard.    Mr. Speaker, on December 8 the House passed the James M.  Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2023 on a  bipartisan basis.   I am particularly proud to see that my amendment, the Defense  Maintenance Data Transparency Act, was included in this crucial  package.   The challenges facing the Department of Defense's inability to access  [[Page H9707]]  necessary data to award truly competitive contracts to small businesses  in America is unacceptable.   My amendment would direct the Secretary of Defense to clarify  existing, ambiguous terms in the U.S. Code as well as in DOD's  acquisition regulations that, once corrected, will help the DOD access  the data it needs to promote greater opportunity for small businesses  to compete for maintenance service contracts and has the potential to  save millions of taxpayer dollars.   Greater competition within the defense industry means more value for  every hardworking taxpayer in America.                            ____________________
