 Madam Speaker, I rise as the dean of the Indiana  delegation, and I am joined by my fellow Hoosiers, to recognize our  fallen colleague, Jackie Walorski, here on the floor. We also recognize  her two staffers, Emma Thomson and Zachery Potts, who passed away with  her while serving the constituents of the Second Congressional  District.   Hoosiers mourn the loss of a leader known for her kindness, dedicated  public service, and strong work ethic. We all stand together to  celebrate the generous spirits of Jackie, Emma, and Zach, and their  lives of public service. We also lift up their families as they deal  with this tragic loss.   Madam Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Indiana (Mr. Banks).    Madam Speaker, I send to the desk a privileged resolution  and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1319         Resolved, That the House has heard with profound sorrow of       the death of the Honorable Jackie Walorski, a Representative       from the State of Indiana.        Resolved, That the House has heard with profound sorrow of       the death of Zachery Potts and Emma Thomson, staff members of       the Honorable Jackie Walorski.        Resolved, That the Clerk communicate these resolutions to       the Senate and transmit a copy thereof to the families of the       deceased.        Resolved, That when the House adjourns today, it adjourn as       a further mark of respect to the memory of the deceased.    The resolution was agreed to.
