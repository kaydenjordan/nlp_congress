 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Esther Begam, a  Holocaust survivor who recently received her high school diploma from  Wayzata High School at the age of 88.   In 1942, Nazis invaded Poland and forced 11-year-old Esther and her  family into a labor camp. Esther tragically lost her mother and her  brother in Auschwitz, as well as her older sister in another labor  camp.   After the war, she married another survivor and moved to Minnesota to  start a family. In 2010, she was invited to share her story with the  Wayzata High School history class, where she was asked what her biggest  regret was, and Esther said she wished she had received her high school  diploma.   So after hearing her story, the school was able to arrange a  graduation ceremony. Last month, Esther was presented with a diploma in  front of her children, her grandchildren, and her great-grandchildren,  receiving a standing ovation that was 71 years overdue.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Esther Begam on her accomplishment after  overcoming an incredibly difficult life challenge. She is truly an  inspiration.                            ____________________
