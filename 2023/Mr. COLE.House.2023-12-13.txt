ADOPTION OF HOUSE RESOLUTION 917.         House Resolution 917 is hereby adopted.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 918.    Mr. Speaker, today is a sad day for myself, for the  institution, and most of all for the American people. My duty today is  one I do not relish. I am sure that every other Member of this  institution feels the same way.   Yesterday, the Rules Committee met and reported out a measure under  our original jurisdiction. H. Res. 918 formalizes an inquiry into  whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of Representatives to  exercise its constitutional power to impeach the President of the  United States.   Three months ago, at the direction of then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy,  three committees--those of Oversight and Accountability, Ways and  Means, and the Judiciary--began this impeachment inquiry.   Over the succeeding months, the committees have done their work and  have done it well. The inquiry is now at an inflection point. The three  committees are nearing the end of their investigations. The White House  has chosen this moment to stonewall and resist the legitimate  investigative powers of the House.   Mr. Speaker, while I do not believe the House must hold a vote on the  floor to initiate an impeachment inquiry, doing so may be said to be  best practice.   We are taking up today's resolution that will formalize the  impeachment inquiry that has already begun. This will ensure not only  that the inquiry has the full authority of the House but also that the  House can enforce its subpoenas and ensure that the Biden  administration can no longer refuse to cooperate with the  investigation.   I will briefly describe the procedures for this inquiry. The  resolution tasks three committees--Oversight and Accountability, Ways  and Means, and the Judiciary--with continuing their current inquiries.  It establishes procedures for conducting hearings and calling and  questioning witnesses. It grants the minority equal time to question  witnesses and the right to request their own witnesses.   At the conclusion of their proceedings, it provides for the  Committees on Oversight and Accountability and Ways and Means to  transmit their findings and supporting documents to the Committee on  the Judiciary, which is the committee that traditionally considers  impeachment matters. It gives the President the right to participate in  the proceedings before the Committee on the Judiciary.   Finally, the resolution authorizes the Committee on the Judiciary to  transmit to the House resolutions, Articles of Impeachment, or other  recommendations.   The procedures we are adopting today closely parallel those the  Democrats created in 2019. In fact, H. Res.  [[Page H6879]]  660 from the 116th Congress was our guide. After all, those procedures  are now a precedent of the House.   Mr. Speaker, impeachment, especially impeachment of a President, is a  starkly serious matter. It is something that no Member of the House  should want to do. The House has rights and obligations under the  Constitution. We are charged with providing the oversight of the  executive branch, and we are the sole institution in the country  granted the awesome power of impeachment. It is a power that must be  used selectively and wisely, and only after full deliberation.   With today's resolution, we are ensuring that the House will be able  to complete its inquiry. We will secure the evidence we need and  uncover the facts we need to make that full and fair determination.   Only at the end of the road can we make a decision on how to proceed.  I take no joy in today's resolution, but I know the House will do its  duty. We owe our committees, the institution, and the Constitution no  less.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the resolution, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman  from Kentucky (Mr. Comer), who is the chairman of the Committee on  Oversight and Accountability.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan), who is the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Indiana (Mrs. Houchin), my very good friend and distinguished member of  the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Just for the Record, all these amendments are on the website of the  Rules Committee. It is not like they are mysteriously hidden someplace.  They are in plain view on the website of the Rules Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Norman), my good friend and also a distinguished member of the  Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Roy), my good friend and distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Smith), my very good friend and distinguished Chairman of  the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Missouri.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock), my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Timmons), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Fry), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Donalds), my very good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H6886]]         Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I do.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Armstrong), my very good friend and  the sponsor of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close, and I urge all my colleagues to support the resolution.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot today, heard a lot about Donald  Trump. We have had ad infinitum insults to the majority. We have had  pejorative language. We have had pounding on the table.   Why? Simply because we want to empower three committees in Congress  to do what the White House asked us to do; that is, to have a formal  vote on the floor before they fully cooperate. That is all we are  doing.   If my friends are so confident--again, as one of my colleagues  mentioned from the Rules Committee--what are you worried about? It is  an investigation. It is open.   We hardly talked about what the resolution is about, which is how we  are going to proceed.   How are we going to proceed? Almost exactly as my friends proceeded  in 2019. Their playbook, their play, their approach. There is nothing  unfair that we are asking to be done.   Since September, the House has been engaged in an impeachment  inquiry, examining whether sufficient grounds exist for the House to  exercise its constitutional power to impeach the President of the  United States.   Today's resolution simply formalizes that inquiry and grants the  House full authority to enforce its subpoenas--subpoenas that have been  denied as recently as today.   My friends have some pretty experienced lawyers on their side. Most  of them will tell you it is better to have a deposition before you have  a hearing, let alone a trial.   All we are trying to do is get the needed people who have been  blocked or refused to cooperate to come in and testify under oath  before Congress.    The resolution follows closely, again, as I said, the procedures  established in 2019. It empowers the three committees to continue their  existing inquiries. At the end of the inquiry, it provides for the  Committee on the Judiciary, the traditional impeachment committee, to  report to the House resolutions, Articles of Impeachment, or other  recommendations.  [[Page H6888]]    It is deeply unfortunate that we are here, Mr. Speaker, but today's  resolution will ensure that the House can fulfill its obligations under  the Constitution. So it is with respect for the Constitution, for this  institution, and for this great Nation that we proceed. That is all we  are trying to do today. We had very little discussion of that, but we  ought to entertain that.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to remind everybody of a few facts.   We have millions of dollars from foreign entities that have flowed  towards shell companies that we didn't even know existed until the  investigations uncovered them. We have whistleblowers, public servants  of long standing that have come in and told us their efforts to  investigate either Hunter Biden or the wider schemes that have been  obstructed.   We have lots of things to be concerned about. Our committees need to  be empowered with the tools that are required to pursue the truth and  then come back and tell us what they found and have a recommendation as  to how we should proceed. That is all today is about.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
