 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 5, strike lines 21 through 26.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 533, the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would strike the provision in  the bill that would add increasing employment and earnings to the  Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, or MIECHV,  as it is generally referred to.   I, obviously, share the goal of increasing employment and earnings  across the country. However, home visiting is not an employment  program. It is a program to strengthen families to make kids healthier,  safer, and more ready to learn when they start school. Those are the  outcomes home visiting models strive for, and those are the outcomes  they achieve.   I mentioned the other day in the Ways and Means Committee that I know  the good that these programs do firsthand. In Passaic County--because  most of these programs are run through counties throughout America--our  home visiting program worked with a pregnant mom expecting a child with  a heart defect.   The baby required open heart surgery shortly after being born last  July. After the surgery, the newborn continued to have health  complications. At times, his mom felt depressed and hopeless and feared  that her child was not going to survive.   The home visiting program's family support worker was able to assist  the mom by connecting her to services, providing her with emotional  support, and acting as a liaison with the hospital where her son was.   We know the negative impact that postpartum depression can have on  new moms and their babies. The home visiting program was able to  connect this mom to supportive services and resources and alleviate her  depression so that she could be a healthy and pleasant mom. I am happy  to report that, after nearly 3 months in the hospital, this little boy  was finally able to go home, and his mother continues to work with the  home visiting program in northern New Jersey.   I don't think anyone can hear that story and not see value in the  services that were provided. The home visiting program helped a mom,  like so many other mothers across America, navigate her newborn son's  healthcare crisis and manage the mental health issues associated with  it.   But under the provision that my amendment is seeking to strike from  the bill, this outcome would not be measured as a success. There is  something wrong with that.   Most home visiting models focus on families with newborns or very  small children and focus on building a parent-child bond. That is a  fact. Many home visiting programs focus on teen parents and young  mothers, and the priority is to keep them in school and make sure they  continue their education.   There are currently 18 evidence-based home visiting models. None of  them  [[Page H7513]]  provide employment services, none of them measure employment and  earnings.   Home visitors have raised concerns that having to ask families about  employment and earnings would be intrusive when you know what the focus  of the program is, and would undermine the relationship they are trying  to build with families.   Even if the data is collected without specifically asking families  for it, knowing their performance is being measured based on their  client's labor force participation--here is the kernel of the issue-- will likely make home visitors feel they have to press their clients to  work even if, like in the case of the mom in Passaic County, that  should not be the main object.   Additionally, this bill provides no new funding. We are not asking  for any new money here. Any resources devoted to supporting work would  have to be diverted from MIECHV's core purposes.   I urge my colleagues, Mr. Chairman, to support this amendment to make  sure children and families served by this program get the support and  service that they truly need.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, as I said, there are currently 18  evidence-based home visiting models. Also, there is nothing added to  the budget; no extra currency I am asking for.   I would ask the sponsor of the bill what he would tell this woman  from Passaic County, New Jersey, one of many examples that I have. I  ask him what his answer would be to that woman.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey  will be postponed.                    Amendment No. 3 Offered by Ms. DelBene    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3  printed in House Report 115-331.   Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 9, line 16, strike ``Organization'' and all that       follows through line 21 and insert ``Organization, 100       percent.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 533, the gentlewoman  from Washington (Ms. DelBene) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington.   Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would eliminate the dangerous  cuts to Tribes who don't meet the bill's match requirement. I urge all  of my colleagues to support it.   I am proud to represent a number of Tribal communities in the Puget  Sound region that each have a rich history, identity, and culture. But  they face unique challenges.   The need for home visiting services is particularly high among  American Indians and Alaska Natives. Young people who live on  reservations are twice as likely to become teen parents. Nearly three- fourths of the parents served by Tribal home visiting services live  below the Federal poverty level. And the majority of Tribal  beneficiaries have less than a high school diploma.   The good news is that Tribes are already using home visiting  resources to implement evidence-based models that have decreased  depression, substance abuse, and stress among parents, while improving  health among children.   Seventy-seven percent of Tribal home visiting programs have improved  family outcomes in at least four different areas, such as improving  maternal and newborn health, increasing school readiness, reducing  domestic violence, and strengthening parents' economic self- sufficiency.   The bad news is the need for help in Indian Country has far exceeded  the limited funding available through the home visiting program. In  fact, less than half of qualified applications for Tribal home visiting  can be granted under the current funding levels.   Some States have tried to address these shortages with State  resources, like my home State of Washington, which has voluntarily used  State funding to meet the needs of Tribal families. But it is not  enough.   The underlying bill provides no new resources to address the  nationwide shortfall in Tribal funding. Instead, it adds a match  requirement that could be the end of home visiting on reservations  altogether.   Most Indian Tribes struggle economically and already face challenges  providing help to families. I understand that Tribal administrators  have said almost none of them could meet the match requirement in this  legislation.   Indian Tribes have also generally considered Federal match  requirements to be a violation of Tribal sovereignty. As such, they may  have to refuse the funds and shut down home visiting programs if the  bill is enacted with the match requirement.   I appreciate that the chairman has delayed the implementation of the  Tribal match and reduced it to 30 percent. But, realistically, the  effect will be simply to give Tribes more time to shut down their home  visiting programs. The match requirement will still be completely  unworkable for them in 2022.   The Federal Government has a responsibility to our Tribal communities  to do everything we can to support their people, strengthen their  families, and expand economic opportunity.   Mr. Chairman, the underlying bill takes a dangerous step in the wrong  direction for our Tribes, but we still have the opportunity to stop it.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR.
