 Mr. President, thank you.   Senator Roberts, thank you for your comments.   I am nervous today, and more nervous now that I have heard you speak,  because I am concerned that this may be for the first time in our lives  that I have ever spoken longer than you. That makes me nervous.   ``I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution  of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I  will bear true faith and allegiance to the same.''   These are words spoken by Pat Roberts more than once, but on  September 15, 1958, age 22, Pat Roberts  [[Page S7385]]  joined the Marine Corps, and he has lived by his oath, by his promise  to do exactly that every day thereafter and in every job he pursued  here in the Congress of the United States, in the House and the Senate.   He indicated he served as the chief of staff for Senator Frank  Carlson, one of those Kansans who served the U.S. Senate and is so  highly regarded even today. He served as the chief of staff for  Congressman Keith Sebelius.   I met Pat Roberts 50 years ago, in 1969. A few years later, in 1974,  I became an intern in the office of Congressman Sebelius. Pat has been  my boss for 45 years.   When I describe Pat, I tell people our most common conversation is  never spoken. It is symbols. Pat does this: Come here; sit down. Every  time I tell Pat this, he, in his Jack Benny voice, will say: ``Now cut  that out.'' But for 45 years: Come here; sit down.   And Pat, while you discount that and I highlight it, it has been some  of the most enjoyable time in my life, where I have had the opportunity  to be your friend and to listen to what you had to say. I suppose if I  thought long and hard, I might find something that wasn't good advice,  but I can't remember it. So everything in those circumstances was  something that I continue to value today. I learned something in every  conversation.   Knowing Pat for 50 years, I told him that he just keeps me around and  he puts up with me because I have at least heard of the people he  knows.   He does know people. Pat and I both grew up in times of politics in  which your relationship with voters, your relationship with  constituents, your relationship with Kansans was paramount. Pat knew  the school superintendent in every community. Pat knew the executive of  the chamber of commerce and the newspaper editor. He knew the president  of the county Farm Bureau.   I don't know how many times I heard Pat say: I am going home to talk  to the coffee klatch in Dodge City or I am going to sit on the wagon  tongue and I am going to hear from Kansans what they have to tell us.   Politics, as you heard from Senator Roberts, is in his blood and in  his family--Wes Roberts, the chairman of the Republican National  Committee; Frankie Roberts, the staff person for Strom Thurmond. It is  in his blood and in his family. It is not just politics, but public  service.   In 1980, Pat Roberts decided to be an office holder, not an office  staffer. The first letter I ever wrote to an editor of a Kansas paper  was to my hometown, where his primary opponent lived. I supported Pat  Roberts in a letter to the editor when his opponent was somebody who  was highly regarded and a friend of mine. But Pat Roberts' friendship  and his commitment--who he is as a human being and his sworn oath--told  me that Pat Roberts was the person I wanted to be my Congressman. The  constituent in me said: This is the guy I want serving me and my fellow  Kansans.   He won that election in January of 1981 and became a House Member  representing the First Congressional District of Kansas, known in our  State as ``The Big First.'' The geography of that district today--and  almost true when Pat was the Congressman--is the size of the State of  Illinois. The largest city is Salina, which then had a population of  about 35,000. It is a rural place, and it fit the Pat Roberts' mode of  representation, which was, I know them and they know me.   He was elected with a significant majority of voters. He won seven  times to be reelected to the House of Representatives. He never  received less than 60 percent of the vote, and in his last election to  the House of Representatives, he received nearly 78 percent of Kansans'  approval. Sitting on those wagon tongues and listening in on those  coffee klatches had its consequence.   It is the kind of politics that Pat described that I hope we return  to, in which it is all about taking care of Kansans, taking care of  Americans, setting aside our differences and finding common ground,  just as Kansans--particularly, rural Kansans--have to do in their  community.   On January 3, 1997, Pat was sworn in as a Member of this body. I  asked Robin, my wife, what it is I might say today. She said she  remembers in about early 1996--maybe late 1995--she answered the phone,  and it was Pat Roberts. What he said was, Tell Jerry to put his running  shoes on.   Pat Roberts gave me the advantage of knowing his plans well in  advance of the public or potential opponents, and set the stage in my  life as somebody whom you would look at and think there is no chance of  ever being a U.S. Senator, but Pat Roberts found value in me and gave  me the opportunity to serve where I serve today. I never thought I  would catch up with Pat in the House of Representatives. I never  thought I would catch up with Pat Roberts in the U.S. Senate, but  because he and his friends took an interest in me and because this is  America, that became possible.   Pat is only the 34th Kansan to serve a term in the U.S. Senate. I  like that number. Pat will recognize that 34 is special to Kansans. We  are the 34th State admitted to the Union, and he is the 34th Senator to  serve a term from Kansas in this body.   Pat Roberts told me to put my running shoes on, gave me a chance, and  we have had those running shoes on for a long time thereafter.   Pat is that fourth generation Kansan who knows us. I would say one of  his greatest contributions to our State, to the Midwest, and to the  country has been his distinguished career in leadership in agriculture.  The farm bills that he mentioned, the work with Democrats and  Republicans coming together, fighting for competitive and fair  markets for our producers, the support for crop insurance--there is no  question that Kansas and American farmers, ranchers, and producers had  a strong voice in Congress as a result of Pat Roberts being here.    He is distinguished by being the first Member of Congress to chair  both the House and Senate Agriculture Committees. In the next Congress,  we will begin the process of writing another farm bill, and it will be  the first farm bill since the Agriculture and Food Act of 1981 that  will be written without Pat Roberts' direct influence.   However, Senator Roberts' legacy and impact on farm policy will be  felt for generations to come as a result of his work in the 1996  Freedom to Farm Act, the 2000 Agriculture Risk Protection Act that  modernized crop insurance, and many, many other pieces of consequential  legislation.   In his early years in the Senate, as Senator Roberts indicated, he  led the Intelligence Committee. This was during the 9/11 attacks. Under  his leadership, the committee conducted a sweeping and exhausting  review of U.S. intelligence, which led to critical reforms to put us in  a better position to know more and protect Americans better. That work  in intelligence reform earned him a spot in a very distinguished guest  speaker program, the prestigious Landon Lecture Series of Kansas State  University.   Combining his experience in agriculture, intelligence, and in  defense, Senator Roberts has laid the groundwork for the National Bio  and Agro-defense Facility at his alma mater in Manhattan, KS. It brings  great opportunity to our State, and we are so pleased to have Pat's  accomplishments benefit the country and our State for generations to  come.   Pat Roberts deserves great credit for the Eisenhower Memorial. I have  been around this issue for a long time. It has been challenging from  the get-go. Nothing was easy, and controversy apparently follows every  new memorial on the National Mall. I have no doubt that in the absence  of Pat's leadership, his bringing people together and perhaps, yes, his  sense of humor, Kansans' President Eisenhower would never be seen  honored and respected at the memorial we now have.   He, Senator Roberts, advocates for policies he believes in. He  compromises when necessary, and he always has a way of bringing  everyone together, often with a joke ready to ease the tensions when  things get stressful.   I always used to tell him: I saw that, once again, you became the  funniest Member of Congress. You got an award.   He always would correct me: No, I am not the funniest Member; I am  the most humorous Member.   Many times he has been designated the most humorous Member of  Congress.   Some of the most important work he has done for Kansans won't be  memorialized in laws passed or signed into law here in Washington, DC,  but in the  [[Page S7386]]  meaningful change he made back home among the people whom he and I care  for and love. How about the rural hospitals he fought for to keep their  doors open or the family farms that are still operating because of  decisions and efforts he made? He has consistently, continuously fought  to get farmers and ranchers, to get rural communities, to get the  people of Kansas the right resources at the right time.   I have had the challenge of following in politics in my life, in both  the House and the Senate, those humorous people--Pat Roberts being one.  The greatest challenge, probably for both of us, is Bob Dole. How can  you ever follow Bob Dole in any way and how can you compete with his  sense of humor and, particularly, his wit? So I asked Senator Dole what  it is I might say on this floor to honor Pat Roberts. As usual, he took  my responsibilities away from me and said: Here, just read this.   So these are the words of Bob Dole:         One of my first memories of Pat was when he worked for the       late great Sen. Pat Carlson. Of course that was well over 50       years ago, when Pat was just a young child and I was . . .       well . . . maybe just a teenager. Pat has the best sense of       humor of anyone in Congress--I'm not sure how he acquired it,       but I know it serves him well today. Pat--I honestly don't       know what it is like to be retired, but people tell me it's       great. Be forewarned, though, the rest of the world doesn't       operate exactly like the Senate . . .        If anything goes wrong or breaks at home, your trusted       Chief of Staff isn't on speed dial to put out the fires.       Plus, there's nobody to dial your calls for you anyway.        Put your alarm clock up for sale on eBay--(1) somebody out       there might want to buy a beat-up clock once owned by a       famous Senator and (2) you won't need to wake up early ever       again in your life . . . unless you just want to go sit in       the D.C. traffic for old time's sake.        You'll have to brew your own coffee . . . so buy one of       those space-age looking contraptions or make friends with       your local barista.        You'll have to share elevators with the rest of the world       now, so just stop looking for that ``Senators Only'' sign.        Your grandkids are now your information technology       department, so reward them accordingly if you want your       computer to be up and running. Or just ask Alexa.        But in all seriousness, Pat, you've earned some time off       for a job well done in Congress over these past 40 years.       Kansas has certainly benefited from your steadfast       leadership. You care about the Sunflower State, and you care       about our nation--and that's always been what matters most.       Your strength of character, plain-spoken optimism, and       determination to make a positive difference in people's       lives--that's what people will remember about your legacy of       public service here. You're a great American and a dear       friend, and Elizabeth and I wish you nothing but the best for       you and Franki from here on out. One important point of       clarification, though--the filibuster simply doesn't work at       home.        God Bless America,        BOB DOLE.    I know that all of us and Kansans have great regard for Senator Dole.  I also know that Kansans and all of us have great regard for Pat  Roberts. My guess, in knowing Pat, is that his role model--the person  he may admire the most--is that Kansan Dwight Eisenhower. In the book  ``How Ike Led,'' which Pat gave us all a copy of, I read that Ike led  with a sense of humor as part of the art of leadership of getting along  with people and getting things done. He also said the supreme quality  for leadership was, unquestionably, integrity. Without it, no real  success was possible no matter whether it was on a section gang, a  football field, in the Army, or in an office.   Pat Roberts, I have no doubt that you have lived up to that role  model--that Kansan who is esteemed around the world--and you have led  like Ike led. I thank you and your staff for all that you have done for  Kansas and for America. I thank you for what you have done for me and  our team. Your mom and your dad--your dad, you say, got you started in  this politics world. I knew your mom; I never met your dad. They would  be so proud of you for the service that you are completing this term.   To Franki, David, Ashleigh, and Anne-Wesley, thank you for your  support and engagement. It is not Pat Roberts--it is the family--and  you have all been engaged in his politics and his public service day in  and day out.   Robba and I wish you and Franki absolutely the best.   I told a Kansas farmer what I was doing but didn't ask him for any  advice as to what to say. His last comment--he is a rancher from  Elkhart--was, ``As a Kansan, I would want to know that my Senator  fought for my values in DC and that the Senator did everything he could  to ensure our part of the world was a priority to the Nation.''   To the rancher in Elkhart, Pat Roberts is exactly that--a Kansan who  fought for our values at home while in Washington and did everything he  could do to ensure that our part of the world was not forgotten in this  part of the world.   So, Pat, I guess you said thank you to Kansans, and you said thank  you to this Senate. I think it is time for me to say in return, on  behalf of all Kansans, thank you for your service to our Nation and to  our State. For a life being well lived, you are the example. Thank you.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, for those of us who have the privilege of  working in the U.S. Senate, it allows us the opportunity to meet  wonderful people who care about their country, who go to work every day  and make sure that the country is safe and secure.   One of those individuals, whom I met over the last year--met a year  ago and now has worked in my office--is Army LTC Kevin Ryan. He is a  member of my staff as an Army fellow participating in the U.S. Army  Congressional Fellowship Program.   I want to take a moment to recognize LTC Kevin Ryan's contribution,  certainly, to my office, to my capabilities of representing Kansas in  the U.S. Senate, but his commitment to the country as well.   Before he departs my office to return to the big Army at the start of  the new year, I want to express my appreciation to Colonel Ryan for all  of his hard work and his dedication and his service to our country.   Kevin's 14 years of service in the U.S. Army have developed his  leadership abilities and shaped his perspective on major defense issues  of national significance. These assets and attributes have made him an  invaluable asset for our team as we work to serve Kansans, members of  the military, and our veterans.   Before joining our office, Kevin's assignments have taken him around  the world in service to our country.   Kevin earned his commission from Norwich University, the Military  College of Vermont. He has served four combat tours, two in Afghanistan  and two in Iraq, and he has also been deployed to Korea, Germany, and  Italy. His most recent deployment took him to Iraq in 2017, where he  served as a senior intelligence officer for the brigade that assisted  Iraqi security forces in the liberation of Mosul from the Islamic  State.   Kevin is lucky to have his wife Lindsey, his daughter Colleen, and  son John by his side. He is blessed to have their unwavering support.   Kevin joined our team in January of 2019. From day one, he embraced  Kansas, its people, and the challenges they face day in and day out. He  is well known for displaying his love of Kansas outwardly, often  wearing a Kansas necktie in meetings and on Zoom calls.   He has made it a priority to spend time in our State and learn from  Kansans so he can bring their thoughts and ideas back to the Nation's  Capital. These personal conversations with Kansans and Kevin's  experience in the Army helped drive meaningful policy.   He has led the efforts to recognize the important work of the 6888th  Central Postal Directory Battalion, the only all-African-American, all- female battalion to be deployed overseas during World War II. The Six  Triple Eight, as this battalion has come to be known, sorted millions  of pieces of backlogged mail so the troops serving on the frontlines  could hear from families and loved ones. Their efforts boosted morale  and directly contributed to our servicemembers' fighting spirit toward  the end of the war. Kevin has been a tireless advocate for these women,  and I commend his dedication to this cause.   Though I am sad he will be leaving our office at the end of the  month, I know he will serve the Army well next  [[Page S7412]]  year in the Army's programs office, where he will be a highly effective  ambassador to Congress for the Army.   Kevin is one of the most impressive military officers I have had the  honor of knowing. I hold him in the highest regard, personally and  professionally. He is a significant asset to our country and to the  U.S. Army. Kevin represents the best the Army has to offer, and I know  he will continue to benefit the future of our Nation.   There is no group of people I hold in higher regard than those who  serve our Nation, and I want to reiterate my gratitude to Kevin and to  his family for their dedication and service to our Nation.   Once again, Kevin, thank you for all you have done for Kansans, all  you have done for our team as we serve those Kansans. You have been a  model of selfless service and leadership. I know you will continue to  do great things throughout your Army career and your life of service,  wherever that path may lead.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
