Russia Cryptocurrency Transparency Act                                 H.R. 7338         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Russia Cryptocurrency       Transparency Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) On February 24, 2022, the Government of the Russian       Federation, led by Vladimir Putin, launched an unprovoked,       full-scale invasion of Ukraine.        (2) This unprovoked act of aggression violates Ukraine's       right to independence, sovereignty, and territorial       integrity, and constitutes an emergency in international       relations.        (3) The invasion by the Government of the Russian       Federation of Ukraine caused significant displacement in       Ukraine and triggered a broader humanitarian crisis in       Europe.        (4) On March 23, 2022, the Department of State released a       statement assessing that the Russian Armed Forces committed       war crimes by launching indiscriminate attacks on civilians       and non-military infrastructure, including apartment       buildings, schools, and hospitals, leaving thousands of       innocent civilians killed or wounded.        (5) The United Nations Office for Coordination of       Humanitarian Affairs has projected that, over the next three       months, 12,000,000 people living in Ukraine will need       humanitarian assistance, 6,700,000 people will be internally       displaced, and 4,000,000 people will flee Ukraine.  [[Page H7987]]         (6) Rapid humanitarian assistance is necessary 6 across       sectors to address the needs of refugees and internally       displaced persons from Ukraine.        (7) Cryptocurrency has been used as an effective cross-      border payment tool to send millions to the Ukrainian       Government, Ukrainian army, and Ukrainian refugees with       limited access to financial services.        (8) In response to the war of aggression by the Government       of the Russian Federation, the United States has imposed an       array of sanctions, cutting off major Russian financial       institutions from Western markets and freezing the assets of       numerous Russian oligarchs.        (9) Given that regimes sanctioned by the United States have       used cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions, there are       increasing concerns that these digital assets may be used to       circumvent the sanctions now imposed on Russia and Belarus by       the United States and other foreign countries.       SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATIONS FOR STATE DEPARTMENT                     CRYPTO CURRENCY REWARDS.

(b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to       the appropriate congressional committees a report on the use       of cryptocurrency as a part of the Department of State       Rewards program that--        (1) explains why the Department of State made the       determination to pay out rewards in cryptocurrency;        (2) lists each cryptocurrency payment already provided by       the State Department;        (3) provides evidence as to why cryptocurrency payments       would be more likely to induce whistleblowers to come forward       with information than rewards paid out in United States       dollars or other prizes;        (4) analyzes how the State Department's use of       cryptocurrency could undermine the dollar's status as the       global reserve currency; and        (5) examines if the State Department's use of       cryptocurrency could provide bad actors with additional hard-      to-trace funds that could be used for criminal or illicit       purposes.        (c) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined.--In this       section, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress''       means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of       Representatives;        (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.

(2) The expansive presence of companies linked to the       Chinese Communist Party, such as Huawei, in global mobile       networks and the national security implications thereof, such       as the ability of the People's Republic of China to       exfiltrate the information flowing through those networks and       shut off countries' internet access, demonstrates the       importance of the United States remaining at the       technological frontier and the dire consequences of falling       behind.        (3) The significant cost of countering Huawei's market       leadership in telecommunications infrastructure around the       world underscores the urgency of supporting the       competitiveness of United States companies in next-generation       information and communication technology.        (4) To remain a leader at the International       Telecommunication Union (ITU) and preserve the ITU's       technical integrity, the United States must work with       emerging economies and developing nations to bolster global       telecommunications security and protect American national       security interests.        (5) Multilateral cooperation with like-minded partners and       allies is critical to carry out the significant effort of       financing and promoting secure networks around the world and       to achieve market leadership of trusted vendors in this       sector.
