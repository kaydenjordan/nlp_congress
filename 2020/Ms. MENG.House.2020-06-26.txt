 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because our Nation is screaming  out, grieving for those killed by police brutality and racial  injustice.   I rise today because, for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, a police officer  pressed his knee on George Floyd's neck, slowly killing him, but we  know there are countless more who will forever remain faceless and  nameless because their stories were never recorded.   I rise today because Black lives matter.   Last night, I proudly voted to pass this historic, transformative  bill, the Justice in Policing Act.   This bill would finally put in place unprecedented and bold reforms  to curb police brutality and racial profiling and combat the epidemic  of racial injustice.   Mr. Speaker, we cannot turn our backs on the cries for justice. We  cannot go back to a system that would look the other way when faced  with police brutality.   The Senate must follow the House's lead and immediately pass this  bill because this moment of national anguish demands nothing less.                            ____________________
