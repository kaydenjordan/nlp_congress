 Mr. Speaker, I rise to condemn H.R. 2811,  the GOP's Default on America Act, which puts politics over people by  making deep cuts that kill jobs, harm the economy and immediately  impact families, seniors and small businesses in Northwest Washington.  According to House Budget Committee and White House estimates, in my  home state of Washington, the Default on America Act would:   Put 371,000 people at risk of losing Medicaid coverage;   Cut approximately $67 million in Title I funding for schools serving  low-income children, impacting an estimated 420,000 students and  reducing program funding to its lowest level in almost a decade;   Make college more expensive for at least 308,000 students who receive  Pell Grants;   Threaten access to food assistance for 19,000 people;   Eliminate preschool and child care for at least 4,800 children;   Increase housing costs for at least 17,400 people;   Eliminate at least 6 air traffic control towers;   Cut at least 240 rail safety inspection days;   Repeal investments in cleaner, cheaper energy--threatening at least  800 clean energy and manufacturing jobs announced in Washington since  the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.   The Default on America Act would also undermine transportation  safety, harm the environment and prevent communities from investing in  critical infrastructure projects for the next decade.   By making the U.S. default on certain debt obligations, the extreme  GOP plan would also downgrade the U.S.' credit rating and international  standing.   According to House Budget Committee estimates, in Washington's Second  Congressional District, defaulting on the debt would:   Kill about 7,300 jobs in Northwest Washington;   Jeopardize Social Security payments for 103,000 families in my  district;   Put health benefits at risk for 295,000 individuals in my district  who rely on Medicare, Medicaid or Veterans Affairs health coverage;   Increase lifetime mortgage costs for the typical homeowner in  Washington by approximately $81,000;   Raise the costs of a new car loan for the typical American by  approximately $800;   Threaten the retirement savings of more than 102,000 people near  retirement in my district, eliminating $20,000 from a typical  retirement portfolio.   Congress must put people over politics by ensuring the U.S.  government meets its obligations while ensuring historic investments  like the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act  are fully implemented to create more jobs, lower costs and build  cleaner, greener, safer and more accessible communities in the Pacific  Northwest and across the country.   I call on my House colleagues to join me in voting ``No'' on the  extreme GOP Default on America Act.    Mr.  Speaker, I rise to condemn H.R. 2811, the GOP's Default . . .  voting ``No'' on the extreme GOP Default on America Act. The  SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired . . . .
