 Mr. Speaker, I stand before you with a heavy heart to  remember a young woman whose passion and dedication touched the lives  of many in the Springfield community and beyond.   Emma Shafer was a remarkable activist who sought to create positive  change in the world around her. From an early age, she understood the  power of her voice and the importance of creating good trouble.   Her commitment to social justice and equality was unwavering, and she  inspired people of all ages to join her in the pursuit of a better  world. Whether she was serving as a board member for the Resistor  Sisterhood organization or volunteering to deliver groceries for the  Springfield Immigrant Advocacy Network, the list of Emma's involvement  in the community was endless.   Not only was Emma an outspoken advocate, she was also an avid reader  and lover of theater and passionate supporter of the arts.   As we mourn her loss, we celebrate her life by continuing the work  she started by carrying the torch of activism and by striving to create  a world she dreamed of: one filled with love, equality, and opportunity  for all.                            ____________________
