 Madam Speaker, I rise today for an issue that I have  wanted to address for several weeks. I want to thank the voters of New  Jersey's 10th Congressional District for reelecting me to Congress.   It is a tremendous privilege to represent my district, one that I  honor  [[Page H8705]]  every day when I take actions to better the lives of the people in my  district.   The district will look different for the 118th Congress. I will miss  representing the communities of Bayonne, Bloomfield, Glen Ridge,  Maplewood, Rahway, and South Orange. But I welcome the communities of  Caldwell, Cranford, Essex Falls, Garwood, and Kenilworth into my  district.   Now that the election is over, Congress must work together with  President Biden to lower inflation and gas prices. Americans are  struggling, and we must do everything we can to help them.   Again, I thank the voters of my district for their trust and  confidence as I continue to represent them in Congress.                            ____________________
