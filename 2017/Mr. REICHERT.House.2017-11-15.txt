 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and for  his leadership in bringing this tough piece of legislation. I mean  tough in the sense that it has taken years to put this together and at  least 40 hearings on the legislation that is presented today.   Mr. Speaker, when I travel my district from the suburbs of Auburn,  Washington, to the orchards of Chelan, I hear the same thing from  middle-income, hardworking families, from the apple grower in  Wenatchee, the tech entrepreneur in Issaquah, and the growing family in  Maple Valley, Washington: They want to keep more of their hard-earned  money, plan for the future, and they want to have some certainty in  their future. They want to care for those they love.   They deserve a plan that gives them the opportunity at their first  job or a better job. They deserve a chance to decide how they want to  spend their money.   It is their money. Why wouldn't they deserve that chance?   They want a Tax Code that is simpler, fairer, and that works for  them. They want the same bright future for their children.   This is a bill that is not just a tax bill, but it is a bill that  reignites, in my opinion, the belief in the American Dream.   In the Eighth District of Washington State, the median income family  of four will receive a tax cut of $3,654. In Washington State, 21,875  new jobs will be created.   This plan will change lives. It will energize our economy and get our  economy booming again.   As we went through this process, I asked myself several questions  over the last few years, to be honest with you. Here are the questions:   Will this plan make the American economy boom again?   Will this plan create jobs in America?   Will this plan increase paychecks?   Will this plan put more money in the pockets of hardworking  Americans?   Will this plan make the Tax Code fairer and simpler?   The answer I came to and I think that Americans will come to, Mr.  Speaker, is a resounding ``yes.''                                time  1715
