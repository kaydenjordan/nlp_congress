 Mr. Speaker, we must act on the border  security crisis. However, with a divided Congress, we can act only on a  bipartisan basis to be successful.   Any immigration reform needs to reflect our shared American values  and the needs of our modern economy. We must set aside the partisan  infighting and unite for the greater good and strength of our country.   On border security, I said it was a priority to travel to the  southern border to see the challenges for myself. That is why I am  heading to the Rio Grande Valley along the Texas-Mexico border today to  do just that.                            ____________________
