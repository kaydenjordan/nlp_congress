 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Foxx for yielding.   I rise today in support of our Nation's workers and businesses. We  must find ways to work together to help our economy recover from COVID- 19.   However, this bill is not the answer, and it is not even close. This  bill will nationalize the disastrous California policies that have  forced businesses out of my State, killed jobs, and hurt workers.   As we saw in California, businesses that can afford lobbyists  eventually get carveouts, while small businesses are left holding the  bag.   The last thing we should be doing during this time is passing  legislation that will kill jobs and make our recovery even harder. From  Uber and Lyft drivers to financial advisers to local artists, we should  support workers' freedom, our gig economy, and create policies to  promote innovation.   We should learn from the failings of AB-5 in California and vote  ``no'' on the PRO Act.
