 Mr. Speaker, extreme weather is climate change unfolding  before our very eyes. This past weekend, the San Francisco Bay Area  recorded temperatures in the 90s and 100s--a far cry from our usual  temperate summer weather.   My region wasn't the only part of the country feeling the heat. The  month of July has been a scorcher for the whole country with no end in  sight. In fact, the Fourth of July was one of the hottest days on Earth  in at least 50 years--a record that scientists said would have been  virtually impossible without climate change.   The story doesn't end with heat waves. Other climate disasters, like  severe storms and wildfires, have been and will continue to be more  intense and more frequent.   Earlier this year, atmospheric rivers and devastating flooding  pummeled my district, nestled between the Pacific Ocean and the San  Francisco Bay, causing millions of dollars in damage.   Many Americans can afford to shield their properties from climate  disasters and have done so over the years, but families who are already  struggling to make ends meet are often left behind. This is especially  true for households of color, many of whom live in more disaster-prone  areas.   We need to ensure everyone, regardless of their income, can shield  their properties against the most devastating consequences of climate  change.   That is why I introduced the Weatherization Resilience and Adaptation  Program, or WRAP Act, along with 20 of my colleagues from across the  country, from California, but, also, Texas, Pennsylvania, Louisiana,  Ohio, and Michigan. We stand together.   My bill would help low-income homeowners, affordable housing  providers, and mobile home communities harden their property so they  are more resilient to climate-driven natural disasters. Homeowners  would get help to pay for things like double-pane windows, heat  resistant roofing, artificial berms and dunes, and more.   The Biden administration recently announced a nearly $1 billion  investment through the Inflation Reduction Act that will assist the  owners of federally subsidized affordable housing buildings to become  more resilient to climate disasters.   The WRAP Act would build on this historic action by helping  individual property owners and the owners of other types of low-income  housing who are left out of the IRA program.    It is unfortunate that climate resilience-building measures are seen  through a partisan lens. The reality is far different. Climate  disasters don't distinguish between so-called red States and blue  States. We are all impacted. Congress has the opportunity to shield our  most vulnerable communities before disaster strikes.                            ____________________
