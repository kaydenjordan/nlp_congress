 Mr. Speaker, we have a lot of committee hearings and a  lot of subcommittee hearings here every week, and the press is not able  to adequately cover them all.   I highlight the committee hearing in which we examined the current  assistance of the United States toward what is left of Afghanistan.   The United States, being the United States, even after we left that  country, gives from $4 billion to $5 billion in aid, which should be  humanitarian aid to help the Afghan people. In the hearing, we heard  from the inspector general, who is somewhat of an auditor of American  programs, as to what was becoming of the money.   Our wonderful United Nations, together with the State Department,  together with the Department of Defense, together with the USAID, some  of these agencies breaking the law, refused to open up their books and  tell our auditors what they are doing with the money.   I hope, as we head into appropriations season, we do not forget that  when we give money to the United Nations, they ignore our requests to  find out what is happening to the money. I hope the American public  also remembers what the Departments of Defense and State are doing.                            ____________________
