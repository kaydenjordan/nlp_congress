 Mr. Speaker, on rollcall Nos. 300 (motion to suspend the  rules and pass, as amended H.R. 2292), and 301 (motion to suspend the  rules and pass, as amended H.R. 2457), I did not cast my vote. Had I  been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on both of the votes.                            ____________________
