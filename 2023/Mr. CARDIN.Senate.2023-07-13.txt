 Mr. President, as our Nation celebrated on July 4th, our  birthday, with festive block parties, in one example in Baltimore, it  turned into tragic gun violence in our own backyards and across the  country.   It has been a deadly summer so far, and we have only made it to the  middle of July. In my home State of Maryland, in Salisbury, 14-year-old  Xavier Cordei Maddox was killed and six others injured during an  overnight July 4th block party.   It came just after a horrific mass shooting on July 1st at an annual  block party in the South Baltimore Brooklyn neighborhood, which claimed  the lives of a young man and a young woman, while injuring 28 others,  many of whom are teenagers. Twenty-year-old Kylis Fagbemi died at an  area hospital, and 18-year-old Aaliyah Gonzalez was pronounced dead at  the scene.   Just weeks before the shooting, Gonzalez graduated from Glen Burnie  High School in Anne Arundel County. Gonzalez had recently decided to  enroll at Anne Arundel Community College to stay closer to her family,  according to news reports. Now she is dead.   I joined Governor Wes Moore and Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott in a  visit to the Brooklyn neighborhood on Independence Day. As I said at  that time, this is a dark moment for our community and our country.  People who shouldn't have guns have guns, and they are causing  irreversible harm.   Public safety always must be our top priority. Sympathy and words are  not enough. A comprehensive approach to reducing violence includes  cracking down on illegal guns, many of which flow from other States  into Maryland. We must also enact stricter regulations on legal gun  purchases.   Mayor Scott of Baltimore summarized the need for action:         You're talking about a country where it's easier for a 14-      year-old kid to order pieces to put a gun together and go out       and use it and commit a crime than it is for me to get       Claritin D from CVS. That's what we should be talking about       every day in this country.    Maryland has been working on this. The general assembly, with  Governor Moore's signature, recently enacted legislation in Annapolis  to strengthen gun safety rules regarding carrying concealed weapons,  restrict the carrying of firearms in sensitive locations such as  schools and healthcare facilities, strengthen safe storage requirements  for firearms, and raise the age from 18 to 21 to qualify for a handgun  permit.   Following the Brooklyn shooting, Mayor Scott stood up a coordinated  neighborhood stabilization response within the community under the  auspices of the Mayor's Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement.  This response focused on addressing trauma and stabilizing the  neighborhood, in partnership with community-based organizations and  city agencies.   Our Federal partners also have been working to make Baltimore safer,  with a focus on reducing violent crime and the homicide rate,  particularly gun crime. U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Erek  Barron recently noted that overall homicides and nonfatal shootings in  Baltimore are continuing to trend down significantly. While this is  little consolation to the victims of the recent shootings and their  families, as of the half-year mark in 2023, homicides were down over 22  percent and nonfatal shootings were down over 12 percent.   In Congress, our Maryland delegation has worked to increase resources  and investments to improve public safety in Baltimore and throughout  our State. This has included direct resources to local governments,  community organizations, colleges, universities, and others.   I have introduced bipartisan legislation to end cyclical violence and  protect crime victims and have sponsored legislation that boosts  Federal assistance for State and local witness protection programs. I  continue to urge the U.S. Justice Department to provide additional  resources to combat violent crime in Baltimore and throughout the State  of Maryland.   It is important to understand that the horrific and seemingly endless  instances of gun violence are not limited to our State. Sadly, over the  July 4th holiday, there were at least 538 shootings, in which 199  people were shot and killed, and 520 were shot and wounded, across a  total of 43 States and the District of Columbia. This is a national  problem that must be addressed at the Federal level in conjunction with  State and local measures.   President Biden is correct that we have the power to make a change  and end the cycle of violence caused by guns in our society. He  recently stated that ``as we have seen over the last few days, much  more must be done . . . across America to address the epidemic of gun  violence that is tearing our communities apart.''   When I heard that half the victims in the Brooklyn shooting were  under 18 years old, it bought back memories of last summer when a  masked shooter in Uvalde, TX, killed 19 children and 2 teachers.   Following that tragedy, Congress formed a bipartisan working group  and within a month of the shooting passed the Bipartisan Safer  Communities Act. President Biden signed this legislation  [[Page S2454]]  into law, which finally broke the decades-long gridlock on gun safety  legislation. It is already making a difference with increased funding  for community violence intervention and prevention initiatives,  including some underway in Baltimore.   The new law strengthens protections for victims of domestic violence  by adding convicted domestic violence abusers to background checks. It  creates a new source of funding for States to implement ``red flag''  laws, which help to keep weapons out of the hands of dangerous  individuals who should not have access to a firearm. It cracks down on  criminals who try to evade licensing requirements and makes clear which  gun sellers need to register, conduct background checks, and keep  appropriate records. It also strengthens the background check process  for those under 21 years of age seeking to buy firearms by ensuring  that officials have access to juvenile and mental health records.   Importantly, in July 2022, shortly after the passing of this historic  gun safety legislation, the Senate--I will acknowledge that  unfortunately it was on a party-line vote--finally confirmed Steven  Dettelbach to be the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,  Firearms and Explosives, ATF. The ATF had not had a permanent Senate- confirmed Director since 2015, due in part to lobbying by the National  Rifle Association to keep this position vacant. The ATF now has a  permanent leader in place who can carry out its critical mission to  stem the illegal use and trafficking of firearms among other important  priorities.   There is no single solution to this deadly problem. We have to attack  this from all directions until our children and our neighbors stop  being shot. In addition to battling the scourge of illegal weapons and  changing the mindset at the community level, there has to be--we have  to end the knee-jerk reaction of every disagreement trying to be  settled by the use of handguns.   It is time--way past time--for Congress to pass commonsense  additional legislation, such as renewing the assault weapons ban;  requiring background checks for all gun sales, including unlicensed  sellers; eliminating the Charleston loophole that allows for a sale to  go forward if a check is not completed in 3 days; banning the  importation, sale, manufacture, transfer, or possession of magazines  that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition; raising the minimum age  for assault weapon purchases from 18 to 21; requiring the safe storage  of guns; and ending gun manufacturers' immunity from liability.   These are just a few additional examples we could do right here in  the U.S. Congress and make a difference. As a community and as a  Nation, we are not powerless to act. In fact, we have a responsibility  to do something meaningful to save lives.   Most Americans support commonsense gun safety action. Saving lives is  the right thing to do, and it should never be partisan. Gun violence  affects both urban and rural communities, and daily gun violence  affects both large and small communities, even when it doesn't make the  headlines.   I urge my colleagues to take action now--not wait for another mass  shooting--to break this ongoing cycle of violence in so many of our  neighborhoods and communities.
