 Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 30th anniversary  of the creation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in  Europe's--OSCE--Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights-- ODIHR--one of the world's most preeminent and comprehensive human  rights protection bodies.   In 1990-1991, during the signing of the Charter of Paris for a New  Europe that created ODIHR, a spirit of ``profound change and historic  expectations'' prevailed among the United States, nations of Europe,  and the Soviet Union.  [[Page S7457]]  Revolutionary for their time, heads of state and governments resolved  to ``build, consolidate and strengthen democracy as the only system of  government of our nations.'' Further, by affirming that government's  first responsibility is to ensure the ``protection and promotion of  human rights,'' they explicitly linked the full attainment of those  rights with ``the foundation of freedom, justice and peace'' and set  the standard for relations and security within and among nations.   Now, 30 years later, I am deeply concerned that the fundamental  freedoms that ODIHR was founded to safeguard are in peril.   Authoritarianism is on the rise in Europe. Credible reports allege  there are more than 750 political prisoners in Belarus, many detained  for participating peacefully in protest of the fraudulent elections of  August 2020 and the brutal government crackdown that followed. In  Hungary, Viktor Orban's administration continues its unprecedented  consolidation of Hungary's media, even as opposition figures organize  to resist him. In many countries across the OSCE area, we have  witnessed an alarming rise in anti-Semitism, racism, religious and  other intolerance, and violence against women. These scourges have  worsened the conditions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic that  disproportionately affect the most vulnerable in our communities.   With these and other challenges in mind, ODIHR's valuable work to  assist nations to live up to their commitments is more relevant and  more needed than ever.   ODIHR is empowered by states to ensure respect for human rights,  fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, and to promote and strengthen  democratic institutions and tolerance. ODIHR actively partners with  OSCE's 57 participating states, civil society, and international  organizations to support human rights defenders, enhance the  independence of judiciaries, and promote human-rights-based policing.  It offers legislative reviews and develops tools to support local  government officials, including the Words into Action project, which  enhances social inclusion within local communities and for which I  proudly help secure funding.   The most visible demonstration of ODIHR's collaboration with the  United States is perhaps in the field of election observation, where  its methodology is rightly seen as the gold standard in international  election observation. Since its founding, ODIHR, the Department of  State, and the U.S. Congress, through the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly,  have deployed thousands of American citizens and legislators to observe  the conduct of elections across the OSCE area, including in the United  States. Since OSCE states pledged in 1990 to hold free and fair  elections, elections observation has been recognized as one of the most  transparent and methodical ways to encourage states' commitment to  democratic standards and is a hallmark of ODIHR's work.   For nearly 30 years, ODIHR has organized Europe's largest human  rights review conference, the Human Dimension Implementation Meeting-- HDIM--gathering thousands of representatives of governments,  parliaments, and civil society for 2 weeks around the same table to  review progress on human rights commitments. Unfortunately, the HDIM  did not take place this September. Russia blocked consensus to hold the  meeting, thereby denying the OSCE region's nearly 1 billion citizens of  a meaningful and sustained opportunity to hold their governments to  account.   In September, Russia also prevented ODIHR from deploying a full and  independent election observation mission to observe its Duma elections.  Likewise, Russia was responsible for the closure of OSCE's border  observation mission, which provided valuable insight into the personnel  and materiel flowing across Russia's border into the temporarily  occupied areas of eastern Ukraine.   ODIHR's work is more important and relevant than at any time since  its founding at the end of the Cold War. I would like to take a moment  to extend my heartfelt appreciation to ODIHR's 180 staff from 35  countries, upon whose dedication and professionalism we rely as we  strive to realize an equitable and just future for all.   ODIHR is not only the human rights arm of the world's largest  regional security organization; it is also the independent body endowed  to assist us as we pursue this important goal.   The phrase ``Vancouver to Vladivostok'' is routinely invoked to  describe the organization's broad geographical reach. However, it is  perhaps ODIHR--and OSCE's--revolutionary and comprehensive concept of  ``security,'' which includes military security, economic and  environmental cooperation, and human rights, that is its defining  characteristic and most important contribution to world peace and the  reason why we should all be celebrating ODIHR's 30th anniversary this  year and take steps to ensure its success for years to come.                            ____________________
