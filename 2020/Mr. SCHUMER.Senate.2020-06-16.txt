 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday, the Supreme Court ruled that  the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does, in fact, prohibit employment  discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.  It was a landmark decision that represents a step forward--a big step  forward--on the long march to full equality for LGBTQ Americans. We  salute that decision. That is what the Supreme Court should be doing-- moving us in a direction of equality and fairness. All too often, it  doesn't these days. So this was a refreshing breath of fresh air from  that Court.   The march, of course, is not over. Yesterday's decision, welcomed as  it is, reminds us that, even today, even in 2020, we have so much work  left to do to advance the cause of justice and equality for all  Americans. Only a few days ago, our laws didn't clearly establish that  you couldn't be fired by your employer simply because of who you are  and whom you love. Yesterday's decision is not the end of the fight. It  was one step forward. If it is wrong to discriminate against people  because of whom they love and because of who they are and if it is  wrong to discriminate against people on the basis of sexual orientation  and gender, isn't it wrong on the job? If it is wrong to discriminate  against people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender on  employment, isn't it wrong on housing? Isn't it wrong on so many other  issues?   That is why we need the Equality Act to pass. The decision is  certainly not the end of the fight. Disparities and discrimination on  the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity still exist in so  many aspects of our lives--education, housing, credit, public spaces,  services, and in many other ways. If it is wrong to discriminate  against people because of their sexual orientation and gender on jobs  and employment, it is equally wrong in these other areas like housing  and education. We need to pass the Equality Act, which expands the  prohibition of discrimination to many other needed areas.   Today, Senate Democrats will send a letter from our caucus to Leader  McConnell urging him to schedule the Equality Act for a vote on the  floor. The House passed it a year ago. It has been languishing in  McConnell's legislative graveyard. I would say to my Republican  colleagues: If some of the most conservative people around, like  Justice Gorsuch and Justice Roberts, can come to the conclusion that we  should stop discriminating, where are you? The Senate Republicans only  seem 30 years behind the times on this issue for sure.   I urge the leader to put the Equality Act on the floor now, and let's  extend what the Supreme Court did in terms  [[Page S2983]]  of employment to so many needed other areas. Wake up, my Republican  friends. The times, they are changing, and discrimination against LGBTQ  Americans should be over once and for all and should be the law of the  land in every aspect of our lives                           Justice in Policing Act    Madam President, now, on another issue where the Republican caucus  seems to be behind, since the killing of George Floyd sparked  nationwide protests, we have been pushing our colleagues in the Senate  to respond to our national pain with collective action. This is a  moment in American history where a great mass of our people are  demanding change in the streets of our largest cities and smallest  towns. Now is the moment to reach for real, lasting, strong,  comprehensive change. We cannot merely make some changes around the  margins.   Democrats drafted and proposed comprehensive police reform  legislation last Monday, the Justice in Policing Act, led by Senators  Booker and Harris. With 4 weeks to go in this current session, we have  asked Leader McConnell to commit to a vote on the Justice in Policing  Act before July 4. We didn't say: ``Do our bill immediately.'' We asked  our Republican colleagues to commit to a debate on our bill before July  4--within the next 4 weeks--but so far we haven't heard any indication  from the Republican majority that we will take up comprehensive police  reform this month.   Last night, a member of the Republican leadership said a bill was  unlikely before July 4. Of course, Leader McConnell has also reportedly  told his caucus that the Senate was unlikely to do another COVID relief  bill until after July 4. When it comes to urgent national priorities,  the Republican majority is like a broken Magic 8-Ball that keeps  saying: ``Ask again later.''   Peaceful protests have continued for 3 weeks, and Republican Senators  want to wait another month, maybe even longer, to consider reform on  the floor of the Senate? The popular anger over long-simmering issues  of police brutality and racial justice has reached a tipping point.  There is no reason to wait. There is no reason to delay. By delaying  action, Senate Republicans are playing the same dangerous political  games that they played after mass shootings last summer.   Why is it that, when it comes to confirming rightwing judges who want  to roll back the clock on healthcare and on voting rights, Senate  Republicans always make time, but when it comes to making real changes  to police departments, Senate Republicans are already making excuses?  Democrats and the American people who overwhelmingly support real  meaningful change and accountability in our Nation's police departments  will not rest until we achieve comprehensive and bold reform.                                 Coronavirus    Madam President, of course, we are also still waiting for the  Republican Senate majority to propose anything related to COVID-19.  Only a few weeks ago, Leader McConnell said that another coronavirus  relief bill was likely during the June work period. Once again, in  typical fashion of this Republican majority, the deadline has slipped,  and now we have no time to consider another COVID bill before July 4,  and this will have very real consequences for the American economy.   Leader McConnell is willing to blow through his own deadlines, but  some deadlines will arrive whether the Republican leader likes it or  not. Whether he likes it or not, his inaction is creating some very  steep cliffs for our economy and for the American worker. Funding for  the very popular and bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program will run  out on June 30. State and local governments need to finalize their  budgets by July 4, and many of them will be forced to cut back on  critical public services without public support. The moratorium on  evictions that we passed in the CARES Act expires on July 24. The  emergency unemployment insurance we passed in the CARES Act expires on  July 31, and K-12 schools need over $150 billion and as much time as  possible to safely reopen this fall.   So, Leader McConnell and Republicans, there are at least five cliffs  and many more we face if we don't act soon: the cliff of funding small  business, the cliff of helping State and local governments, the cliff  on evictions, the cliff on unemployment insurance, and the cliff on the  need for schools to reopen in September.   Today, Leader McConnell and I received a letter signed by over 100  economists and scholars, including two former Chairs of the Federal  Reserve, three former Chairs of the Council of Economic Advisers, and  two Nobel laureates, urging Congress to pass another relief package  commensurate with the $16 trillion hole in our economy caused by COVID- 19. At a minimum, these distinguished economists wrote: The bill should  include ``continued support for the unemployed, new assistance to  states and localities, investments in programs that preserve employer- employee relationships, and additional aid to stabilize aggregate  demand.''   It sounds a lot like the Heroes Act, which passed the House of  Representatives, but, once again, it is sitting in Leader McConnell's  legislative graveyard. Economists from all walks of life are telling  Senate Republicans to get off the mat and do something to help the  economy before it is too late. Governors from both political parties  are pleading for aid. Even the Chair of the Federal Reserve, Jay  Powell, appointed by President Trump, is sounding the alarm about the  need for another emergency relief bill.   When will Senate Republicans finally get the message? When will they  understand that unless we do these things, the economy will decline in  the future, and that millions who are unemployed, millions whose  businesses are in jeopardy, and millions who want to see schools open  will not get what they need? We must act now. When will Republicans in  the Senate finally get the message? We need to act   I yield the floor.
