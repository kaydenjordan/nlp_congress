 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Military  Appreciation Month.   Serving in America's Armed Forces is one of the most courageous and  selfless decisions citizens of this country can make. It is a decision  we should never cease to honor and celebrate. Too frequently, however,  our Active Duty servicemembers and their families do not receive the  essential care and support they need and deserve.   Force readiness is contingent on a servicemember's ability to be  confident that their family is kept safe when they are called to serve.  Too often we find that these families aren't safe. They are living in  homes with toxic mold and no recourse. Their drinking water has been  poisoned by years of chemical dumps with no recourse.   It is simply unacceptable. As a new member of the House Armed  Services Committee, I will always stand up to ensure that those who  have so bravely defended our freedoms have access to the essential  resources and support they need to thrive.   Military families serve too, and it is time we recognize this and act  to show them the appreciation they deserve.                            ____________________
