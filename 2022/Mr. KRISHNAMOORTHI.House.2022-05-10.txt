 Mr. Speaker, I stand in honor of veterans across  this country, in Illinois, and, of course, in my Eighth District of  Illinois which I represent. I salute veterans for their bravery, their  courage, their sacrifice, and their patriotism. I wish to honor the men  and women who take up our flag in service for our great Nation and  express my immense gratitude.   It is for this reason I have introduced this bill to rename the Post  Office in Schaumburg, Illinois, in honor of the veterans of the Iraq  and Afghanistan Wars. Since 2001, between 2 to 3 million servicemembers  have served in post-9/11 war operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The  new name of this Schaumburg Post Office will be a constant reminder for  my community of the bravery of veterans from these wars.   How we honor our veterans reflects who we are as a country. I look  forward to passing my legislation today to rename this Post Office in  honor of veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars.
