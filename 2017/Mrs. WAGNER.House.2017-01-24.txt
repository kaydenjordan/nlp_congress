 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague, the  gentlewoman from Tennessee, Diane Black, for her wonderful leadership  on this issue along with Congressman Smith, also, for his wonderful  leadership.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the No Taxpayer  Funding for Abortion Act. The Hyde amendment has received bipartisan  support for 40 years because it is a testimony to the freedom of  conscience for all Americans and the dignity of the unborn.   I am heartbroken that opposition to the amendment has become a  political gimmick. All human beings--the born, the unborn, the young,  the old, the sick, and the healthy--are entitled to a government that  promotes their dignity, their conscience, and their gift of life.   This bill spells out Congress' commitment to all people--including  children--across our Nation that the profits of Big Abortion should not  be pilfered off the hard work of the American citizen. No tax dollar  should be spent on the destruction of human life.   In passing this bill and making the Hyde language permanent, we  affirm that protecting children and mothers is our most precious duty  as Members of Congress. Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for  life.
