 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator  Casey be recognized to offer a motion to commit, which is at the desk;  that the time until 2:15 p.m. be equally divided in the usual form for  debate on the motion; and that at 2:15 p.m., the Senate vote in  relation to the motion with no intervening action or debate. I further  ask that following disposition of the motion, the majority leader be  recognized.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                 Request for Authority for Committee to Meet     Mr. President, the Judiciary Committee does not have the  approval of the Democratic leader to meet; therefore, they will not be  permitted to meet past 12:30 p.m. this afternoon.   I ask unanimous consent that the request for authority to meet be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                     Committee on the Judiciary,                                  Washington, DC, November 28, 2017.                          Committee on the Judiciary         Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee       on the Judiciary be authorized to meet during the session of       the Senate, on November 30, 2017, at 10:30 a.m., in SD-226 of       the Dirksen Senate Office Building, to conduct an executive       business meeting.            Sincerely,                                               Charles E. Grassley,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about the  historic opportunity we have before us to grow the American economy, to  create jobs, and to make sure Washington has less money in its pockets  and the people across this country have more money in their pockets.   I rise to support the pro-growth tax reform proposal before the  Senate. I rise to support modernizing and simplifying the American tax  system to make it competitive. I rise to support American workers who  haven't seen wage growth for far too long. I rise to support American  families.   It has been 30 years since this country last reformed the Tax Code.  We haven't modernized our Tax Code in over 30 years, since 1986. Since  that time, we have had lobbyists and special interests adding on and  building on loopholes and giveaways to what once was a competitive tax  system. That 30 years of drag on the Tax Code has made it more out-of- date day by day. It is so out-of-date that American families and  businesses now spend 6 billion hours and $263 billion every year just  to file their taxes. That is bigger than the economic output of the  nation of New Zealand, just to file our taxes every year.   Meanwhile, we have watched the world change since 1986 significantly.  Other countries have learned how to use their tax codes to entice U.S.  businesses overseas--businesses from around the globe--to their  country, to move away from the United States to their countries' more  competitive tax code. That disparity between the U.S. Tax Code and  foreign tax rates has literally chased jobs and wages out of this  country. Companies now not only invest in low-tax foreign countries,  but they leave U.S. dollars abroad without bringing them back into the  United States. Those billions have piled up, and now it is estimated  that there is somewhere around $2.5 trillion in foreign profits being  held by U.S. multinationals overseas.   That tells us three things: No. 1, corporations will find low-tax  jurisdictions; No. 2, without this reform, it isn't changing anytime  soon; No. 3, American workers are the ones who are paying the cost of  this failed economic system. It is the American workers who suffer in  the form of higher taxes, lower wages, and a less competitive economy.   We have before us an opportunity to change this. This reform will  bring the kind of relief Americans have been demanding for a number of  years, for over a decade--lower taxes, higher wages, and less time and  hassle filing their taxes. This change will mean that a family of  four--according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation--earning the median  family income of $73,000 would see a tax cut of nearly $2,202. That is  a 60-percent cut next year over what they paid last year with the  passage of this bill. A single parent with one child and an income of  $41,000 will see a cut of more than $1,400, according to the  nonpartisan Tax Foundation. That is a cut of 70 percent in their tax  rates from what they paid this past year to what they would pay next  year. This change will bring thousands of dollars in higher wages as  companies begin to invest in America again.   The Council of Economic Advisers has estimated that just lowering the  corporate rate alone would raise average income around $4,000 to $4,385  in my home State of Colorado. The academic literature supporting that  analysis suggests the gains could even be bigger. This change will  reduce the wasted billions of hours spent filling out the paperwork,  dotting the i's and crossing the t's, just to file your taxes.   The Council of Economic Advisers estimates that after passage of this  bill, about 92 percent of taxpayers will use the standard deduction  rate rather than itemize their taxes, and because the standard  deduction will have been expanded, they will end up being better off.   It shouldn't be more fun going to the dentist than it is figuring out  your taxes. We can't let this moment pass without bringing this relief  to America's taxpayers. Doing that would only chase more dollars and  jobs out of the country. The result of voting against this reform can  be summed up in the information I have right next to me.   Here is the first one. This shows how our corporate tax rate over  time--since the 1980s and 1990s--has stayed flat, has stayed the same,  while OECD nations and while our competitors have lowered their rates  and become more and more competitive over time. Countries like France,  Germany, Spain, Italy, Greece, and country after country have lowered  their corporate tax rates far less than our rates today. Indeed, the  average European corporate statutory rate is around 18 or 19 percent.  The United States remains stuck at 35 percent--the highest statutory  tax rate in the industrialized world.  [[Page S7519]]    When a company decides it wants to expand or buy new equipment, it  looks at these rates to see how much extra revenue it needs to generate  in order to make the expansion profitable. The higher the rate, the  harder it is to generate enough revenue to justify the investment.   It doesn't take much more than this chart alone to know that  investing abroad has made a lot of sense to far too many people.  Businesses have responded to this. They have moved. As a result,  business investment in capital in the United States is at a low.  Investments in new structures, equipment, and intellectual property  have some of its lowest rates we have seen.   Indeed, Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Kevin Hassett recently  warned that there is a ``crisis in our country'' because of the lack of  what is called ``capital deepening''--which is what an economist would  use for the term meaning the impact of capital stock--on worker  productivity. Worker productivity, in turn, is what drives up wages.  That makes sense. The more productive a worker is, the more the  employer is willing to pay that worker to keep him or her.   That leads us to the other piece of information that is important to  look at. You can see the effects here. The relationship between  corporate profits and wages has broken down over the past couple of  decades. Prior to 1990, when corporate profits went up by 1 percent,  wages went up by more than 1 percent, but that has changed because of  our uncompetitive tax system. From 2008 to 2016, a 1-percent increase  in corporate profits corresponded with only a 0.3-percent increase in  worker wages. When we hear about a growing income inequality, which is  something we have to address, this is part of the story. This is part  of the reason we have income inequality, because that ratio has shifted  as a result of people going overseas, money being kept overseas, and  our tax rates simply being out-of-date and out of order.   One of the biggest culprits is that corporate tax rate. It is what  causes that disconnect between profits and wages. Businesses are  investing those dollars overseas, and they lay off workers in the  United States, expanding in Poland instead of Portland or not just  expanding at all. No matter which option they choose, the American  worker loses out. That is why experts say employees bear 45 percent to  75 percent of the burden of corporate taxes--because businesses invest  in them less the higher the tax rate goes.   That brings us to the third point of information. The empirical  evidence is remarkably clear. Countries with lower tax rates have much  higher wage increases than countries with higher corporate tax rates.  High-tax countries, like the United States, have weak wage growth, less  than 1 percent--even close to zero. You can see this. The highest  statutory corporate tax rate countries in the world have less than 1- percent wage growth. High-tax countries, like the United States, have  that extremely weak wage growth. Low-tax countries, though, see the  wage growth of 1 percent, 1.5 percent, 2 percent, 4 percent, and that  is because low-tax countries create an environment that encourages  businesses to grow and to expand, while high-tax countries, like the  United States, chase money out of the country.   Over the last several years, we have been told we need to get used to  low wages--that we have to get used to low wages and low GDP growth. We  have been told we just need to accept a secular stagnation theory; that  the American economy's prime has gone away. I don't believe that. I  don't think anybody in this country should believe that. I believe our  economy's best days are ahead of us if we pass the kind of policies we  can this week.   Until we get our Tax Code competitive again, there are people who are  going to think the secular stagnation is all we can get. They will be  stuck with low growth, low wages. Bipartisan groups have pushed for  ways to change this: Simpson-Bowles Commission, Wyden-Coats, even  President Obama himself called for tax cuts in his 2011 State of the  Union Address. In fact, President Obama's economic adviser, Larry  Summers, said that reducing the corporate tax rate and lowering the  competitive disadvantage faced by American multinationals is ``about as  close to a free lunch as tax reformers will ever get.''   Here we stand at the end of this reform process, and the opponents of  this reform simply pound their fists on their desks and shoot off  standard talking points about millionaires and billionaires. They told  us from the outset, in a letter to Senator McConnell, that they didn't  want to cut taxes for everyone, so they wouldn't play a meaningful part  in crafting the package. What a shame that has been. They could have  worked with us, offered proposals that would help us find that solution  that benefits all. They rail against different specifics, often mixing  up what is in the House proposal with what is in the Senate's proposal  because it is politically expedient.   There really have been no honest, substantive amendments to make the  bill better, as we have asked time and time again. It is unclear if  they will even support amendments that mirror the bills they themselves  have introduced because I am afraid the opponents aren't interested in  making the bill better. They are interested in a political fight and  continuing to see Americans suffer under low wages and high taxes, but  they don't tell us why, other than ``just not this bill.''   We have a chance to help the middle class. We have a chance to cut  taxes, to grow the economy. For Coloradans, it means more jobs, it  means higher wages, it means true economic growth. Let's get away from  that Atari-era 1986 Tax Code, and let's put forth something that works  for this generation, the next generation, building competitiveness,  building opportunity, and building an America we were all proud of.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.
