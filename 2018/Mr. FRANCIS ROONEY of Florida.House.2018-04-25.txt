 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to continue  to talk about how dangerous the offshore drilling business is for the  eastern gulf and our environment in Florida.   Blowouts reached an all-time high offshore in 2016. For every 1,000  new wells offshore, 20 blowouts occur.   For 14 years, Taylor Energy has had a well off of south Louisiana  that has leaked. It has leaked hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil  every year.   Leaks from LL&G's pipeline leaked 392,700 barrels of oil in 2017, and  in 2016 Shell Oil had a similar leak in one of their pipelines. That is  really bad because Shell Oil is one of the best companies in the  industry. It shows you that human error cannot be eliminated from  offshore drilling, and we should ban it in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.  [[Page H3562]]                                ____________________
