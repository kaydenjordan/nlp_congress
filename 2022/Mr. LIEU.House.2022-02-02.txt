 Madam Speaker, Democrats are fighting for the people.   Along with President Biden, we enacted the American Rescue Plan and  the infrastructure law. That has resulted in the fastest GDP economic  growth in nearly four decades, the lowest unemployment rate in five  decades, and the fastest 1-year job creation in U.S. history.   Growth is up. Wages are up. Unemployment is down.   And Democrats recently completed over 1,200 events to highlight the  infrastructure law, a law that is going to rebuild roads, bridges,  highways, airports, and ports; get lead out of our water; put broadband  everywhere from rural areas to inner cities and everywhere in between;  and create good-paying union jobs, jobs that cannot be outsourced.   These 1,200 events are also a reminder that 200 Republicans voted no  on this infrastructure law. That is the difference.                            ____________________
