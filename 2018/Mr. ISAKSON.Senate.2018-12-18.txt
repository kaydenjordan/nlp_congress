 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, knowing that we are in morning business,  I would like the recording folks to divide my remarks in two separate  places at the appropriate time in the Record.   I am here to do something every Senator does at one time or another  in their career, and that is pay tribute to another politician, one  back in my home State of Georgia who is retiring at the end of this  year after serving two terms as Governor of the State of Georgia.   I am going to say great things about him because he is a great guy,  he is a personal friend, and he has done a wonderful job, but I will  tell you what else I am going to do. I am going to do something a  little different.   When we elected Nathan Deal in Georgia, we had no idea at the time  that it was a three-for-one. When Nathan, his wife, Sandra, and his  chief of staff, Chris Riley, came, the three of them were a new A-Team  in Georgia. Do you remember the A-Team on television? When you had a  real disaster coming and you needed real help, you would call these  guys, and they would come in from nowhere and solve your problem. They  were tough. They were smart. Well, Nathan is that way too. He is tough,  and he is smart. He is also crafty enough to realize that your wife  always knows better, and he gave her a role in education in Georgia,  and she has improved it a lot.   Chris Riley, his chief of staff and his pilot and a good friend, did  a tremendous job and was a great liaison to all of government, whether  it was other States or Congress, the Senate and the House.   Nathan has been a great Governor of our State. Georgia is now the No.  1 place in the country to do business. We have been elected I think 6  consecutive years or 6 out of the last 7 years as the best place in  America to do business.   Georgia is thought of--by many people who think about it--as ``Gone  With the Wind'' and the Old South, but Georgia is now the 8th largest  State in the United States of America, having moved under his  administration from 10th to 8th. Our votes in the electoral college are  now prized, our role in politics is rising, and our influence in the  country is rising--all because of that.   He has also brought new jobs to Georgia--not just repeat jobs or old  jobs where we have added on but new jobs. Nathan was smart enough to  realize that--when America started investing in cyber technology and  when we found out that Fort Gordon, which is in Augusta, GA, was going  to be the Cyber Command of the United States of America, our Governor  didn't sit there and say ``Isn't that great?'' and go brag about what  we were doing in the Federal Government; he established a cyber center  in Augusta, GA, and invested $50 million initially to get it started.   Today, there are young people who are starting careers in Georgia in  cyber technology, which is going to be a proving ground for jobs in the  future, all because of Nathan's realization that if you build it, they  will come. And if we built Fort Gordon, which the Federal Government  did, and if the Cyber Command represented by the U.S. Army and the  Signal Corps is going to be our cyber watchdog, then if we have cyber  educational tools, like STEM subjects, in our elementary and high  schools in our State, we will be so much better off.   Nathan did something else that very few Governors do--he built on  another Governor's success and made it even better. Zell Miller, a  former Member of this body and the person I succeeded after he left,  created the HOPE Scholarship of Georgia, which everybody has heard  about.   In Georgia, most of our kids who enter--from our State--a college go  on a full scholarship paid for by the Georgia Lottery. It is called the  HOPE Scholarship. Running for Governor on that proposal, Zell beat me,  and he made me a big believer.   It has worked great, but Nathan said: You know, that is not good  enough. We don't want to just help the top students who have B averages  or better; we ought to bring up the bottom students so they have a  chance to go and grow and maybe one day go to college. So he created  something called REACH. REACH is a program he designed to reach out and  bring in those who were not getting the help they should get. It stands  for Realizing Educational Achievement Can Happen, and it is  scholarships that go to kids who had no chance of having it happen, who  subscribed to building themselves up and making themselves better.   Now, in Georgia, we have a lot of kids on the HOPE Scholarship, but  1,800 of those on the REACH Scholarship are kids who would have never  been in college under a scholarship otherwise. His wisdom, his  knowledge, and his ability to bring that REACH Program together is  building future contributors who otherwise might have been future wards  of the State.   Ironically, we are now debating the criminal justice system in the  Senate. We are going to have some votes later on today on that and big  debates about it all day long. We have been talking about both sides of  the issue. Are you letting them out too early? Are you not letting them  out too early?   Nathan Deal was the originator of reform of the criminal justice  system to see to it that those who were getting ready to get out  anyway--let me repeat that--those who were getting ready to get out  anyway had an opportunity that when they got out, they would have more  of an education or better preparedness for work because of the programs  created by Governor Deal so that they could volunteer in prison if they  wanted to, not just as a bribe for them to study or do something well  but to give them a chance and sell them on the promise of a job and a  future rather than just being a recidivist on early release.   By doing so, there are some amazing statistics that have happened in  our  [[Page S7761]]  State in terms of the number of people who have gotten released who are  getting jobs who weren't before and the increase in the number of  African Americans in prison who are getting out and going to work  rather than going back to prison. People he has reached out to in our  prison system--we have had a decrease in our population not because we  didn't convict them, not because they aren't serving their time, but  because those who, when they got out--under the REACH Program and under  the other programs we have, they got an education in their last couple  years in prison and got out and made something of their lives.   That is the way you do things. It is easy for any of us to take the  easy thing to do, but the hard thing to do is something a lot of  politicians won't reach out for, but Nathan Deal has.   Something else hard to do is getting kids to read. I have three  children and eight grandchildren. I was chairman of the board of  education in my State, and I know some kids love to read, but a lot of  them hate it. I used to always tell kids: You know, if you can't read,  you can't do anything. If you can read, you can do everything.   Nathan's wife, Sandra, who is one of the most wonderful women you  could ever possibly hope to meet, dedicated her services as first lady  to reading comprehension for kids. In 8 years, she visited 1,000  schools in our 189 school systems and 159 counties. The reading scores  in our State have gone up, not down. The focus on reading has gone up  in our schools. Because of Sandra's leadership and her example, because  she got in and did it, they are doing wonders.   When the Federal Government came out with our program on parks--you  know the little passbook you get now when you go to a Federal park and  you get it stamped, kind of like a passport--she did the same thing for  our State parks, partnering with the Federal Government to increase the  use by our kids and our families of the parklands they pay for as  taxpayers.   I could go on and on and on, but to do so might be to talk too much.  But you can't say too much about somebody who has contributed 8 years  of their life to their State and brought home so many things--first in  economic development, first in job creation, first in really making a  difference in education, first in reforming the criminal justice  system, first in getting cyber technology as the main heart and soul of  Georgia's focus in the future--all those things. And his two partners  on the A-Team--Chris Riley, his chief of staff, and his wife, Sandra-- deserve equal credit with Nathan. I know I am supposed to brag about  just Nathan, but I want to brag about all of them because I know them  and worked with them daily. Those three as a combination make a great  team.   Mr. President, I would like to go to the second subject I was going  to talk about and ask the clerk to divide this in the Record at the  appropriate place.                             The Blue Water Navy    Mr. President, I want to talk about the blue water Navy for just a  second.   Everybody in this room, everybody in the Senate knows that is an  issue we had last week on the floor for a UC. We lost by one vote. We  had 1 objection out of 100. One Member objected to its being adopted by  unanimous consent, so it has not been adopted. It is going to be  pending--another UC--sometime in the next few days, and the people  working on the bill--I as chairman of the Veterans' Committee and  others on the committee--are doing yeoman's work to try to get it  through.   There are those who had some concerns who are looking for any  information they can find to maybe knock the legs out from us in terms  of the momentum we have gotten on the bill. Most recently, as of 2  o'clock this afternoon, CBO decided all of a sudden, in the middle of  the night, to issue a new correction on its last estimate of what the  program was going to cost, and in that estimate, they doubled it from  $1.2 billion to $2 \1/2\ billion. Of course, on that estimate that they  before said they weren't going to make another estimate on--they  decided to do it at the last minute--it is whatever figures they came  up with, and I am not going to argue with their figures because they  are as made up as any figures I might want to make up. I could make up  as good figures as anybody else that show the cost of that to the  taxpayer.   But I know this: There are somewhere in the area of 60,000 Americans  who fought in Vietnam in the U.S. Navy, on the forces that used the  water, who are not eligible for napalm- or Agent Orange-based cancers  they developed because they didn't serve on the land. Blue water is  those who served in the Navy and not on the land. The rest of those-- the soldiers on the land--got it. So today we have soldiers who served  in Vietnam, fought, risked their lives--some of them have already  died--who, if they get cancer, if they get non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or  if they get some of the other cancers that have been conclusively  proved that this is a derivative or a contributor to, they get a  benefit, but if they only served in the Navy and they never put a foot  on the ground, the VA uses that to separate them from being eligible.  It is just like what some of these insurance companies do when they  want to lower their cost--they lower their benefits.   Well, the VA did this as an agency under their authority to do so. It  wasn't passed by the Congress. What we are trying to do is take  something that has been taken away from them and give it to those  soldiers who have earned it, deserve it, and ought to get it. Is it  going to cost a little more? Sure. But it always costs a little more to  do what is right rather than perpetuate what is wrong.   So when you have the chance today, Members of the Senate, or tomorrow  or the next day to vote on the blue water Navy UC that we are going to  try to offer, if you have a question, if you have read the CBO letter,  if somebody is lobbying you, come see me. I won't hurt you. I can't. I  am not smarter than anybody, so I won't intimidate. But I will tell you  the truth, because as chairman of the Veterans' Committee, I care about  our vets. We owe them everything. They risked everything to be here  today, and they deserve, if we made a wrong in the past, for us to fix  it.   The VA deserves to be pointed out when they make a mistake, as they  did in this, so they never make it again.   Together we can be a great team, but separated, we have veterans who  lose, and we are never the great team we ought to have.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
