 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Bucks  County Opportunity Council, Community Action Agency, which serves low- income families throughout Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and its economic  self-sufficiency program, which recently graduated its 300th family  from poverty.   This individualized program works with families to end the cycle of  poverty by building a plan of action and working with a coach to attain  new training and education. To graduate, participants in the program  must be free from welfare subsidies, have secured employment, live in  safe and affordable housing, have access to safe and reliable  transportation, maintain a balanced budget, and have a healthcare plan  for their entire family.   Mr. Speaker, this program is working. Aside from the total number of  graduates, last year's class of families have more than tripled their  salaries. Moreover, in our community, every dollar invested nets nearly  $5 saved in cash welfare subsidies.   I am proud to stand with the Bucks County Opportunity Council in  their mission to reduce poverty and partner with our community to  promote economic self-sufficiency. Our community is a better place  because of their work.                            ____________________
