 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my  remarks, followed by Senator Ernst for 3 minutes, prior to the  scheduled rollcall votes.    Mr. President, this morning, I was proud to welcome  President Zelenskyy to the Capitol. I was glad our colleagues had an  opportunity to hear from him firsthand and ask questions about the  state of Ukraine's counteroffensive.   At the risk of repeating myself, American support for Ukraine is not  charity. It is an investment in our own direct interests, not least  because degrading Russia's military power helps to deter our primary  strategic adversary, China.   As I have discussed this week, competition with China is a global  proposition. But increasingly, the Biden administration's approach to  the PRC reflects a faulty assessment of the challenge this competition  presents.   A few week ago, the Secretary of Commerce visited Beijing to tend the  soft power of American businesses in China. Unfortunately, the PRC had  already targeted Secretary Raimondo with hard power, successfully  stealing her official email in a cyber attack just weeks earlier.   To the extent that economic relations with China are deteriorating,  it is because on President Xi's watch, Americans and other foreign  businesses are facing a state that increasingly expropriates companies,  steals intellectual property, welds workers inside of apartment  buildings, and forces business leaders to attend communist  indoctrination sessions.   So the Biden administration is uninterested in negotiating trade  deals with our allies and partners. But it seems desperate to double  down on trade with Communist China.   PRC officials publicly mocked Secretary Raimondo's efforts as  ``doomed to fail'' and vowed that ``China will never let down  individual vigilance because of a few `beautiful words' from the U.S.''   This is hardly the only time the Biden administration has tilted at  windmills, literally and figuratively. Remember special climate envoy  John Kerry's own recent trip to Beijing. He sought common ground on  green energy goals with a nation that publicly pledged not to stop  increasing carbon  [[Page S4639]]  emissions for the better part of a decade.   Unsurprisingly, our former colleague failed to secure a meeting with  President Xi or his foreign minister. Perhaps, as I have discussed  before, the CCP had already made that latter official disappear.   China is America's single greatest strategic adversary. The PRC is  not inclined to do America or the West any favors. And political  relations with Beijing have declined not because of insufficient  economic ties but because of China's concerted efforts to intimidate  its neighbors, spy on our communications, steal our technology, and  undermine global free markets.   The sooner the Biden Administration accepts that reality, the sooner  the United States can engage more deeply with allies and partners who  share our interests in preserving the peace.   Russia's escalation against Ukraine has taught allies in Europe a  valuable lesson about the dangers of economic overreliance. Views are  changing across Europe as our allies take a new look at the nature of  the dictatorship in Beijing and its friendship without limits with  Moscow. The German foreign minister, for example, has publicly warned  against replacing dependence on Russian gas with new economic  dependence on the PRC.   Asian allies have long been concerned with the PRC's growing  assertiveness. They understand that Russia is a Pacific nation with  significant air and naval presence in the Far East.   Americans who focus single-mindedly on the Indo-Pacific would do well  to consider Russia's own military power in that region. Just last  month, the Russian and Chinese navies conducted a joint patrol off the  coast of Alaska, the largest such operation in anyone's memory.   These revisionist powers are not going to go away. They will not be  classified by economic envoys. Strategic competition will continue to  test global interests and reach.   It is time to work more closely with friends and allies. It is time  to invest more seriously in hard power and industrial capacity. It is  time for the Biden administration to prioritize actions over words.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on another matter, the Biden  administration announced yesterday that it is seeking new recruits in  its war on affordable and reliable American energy to fill the ranks of  a new program called American Climate Corps.   While the administration works overtime to freeze sensible  development like energy pipelines, its latest initiative would,  essentially, set up a taxpayer-funded pipeline for turning climate  activists into climate bureaucrats.   Now, President Biden's nostalgia for FDR's New Deal is already well- documented. So setting aside the absurdity of Washington Democrats'  fixation with the Green New Deal, it would be hard to imagine an  economic moment less well-suited to a new Depression-era work program.   This isn't the early 1930s, when the American people were up against  high unemployment and low inflation. In fact, what the Democrats'  runaway spending has dumped on working families today is just the  opposite. For 2 years now, we have historic inflation and a record  labor shortage.    This is such a profoundly tone-deaf idea it couldn't even earn the  support of the President's own party here in the Senate during votes on  Democrats' so-called Inflation Reduction Act last year. Not a single  one of our colleagues joined Senator Sanders in voting for his  amendment to create a climate work project on the taxpayers' dime.   Apparently, that hasn't deterred President Biden or the leftwing  activists behind the wheel of his administration's energy policies.   As working families struggle to afford gas, electricity, and  groceries, the advice from wealthy blue State liberals is, apparently,  to shell out for an expensive electric car and foot the bill for the  so-called Climate Corps.   There is no Hoover Dam or Lincoln Tunnel on the other side of this  nonsense spending, just Potemkin jobs and a new make-work program when  there is plenty of work to go around.   Activists are calling it climate justice. But it doesn't sound like  justice to the working families trying to get by President Biden's  watch.                            ____________________
