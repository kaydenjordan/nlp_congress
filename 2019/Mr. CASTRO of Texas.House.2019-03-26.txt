 Madam Speaker, I first want to say thank you to  my colleagues in the House, Republicans and Democrats, and also in the  United States Senate who voted to terminate the President's emergency  declaration to build a border wall across the U.S.-Mexico border.   There is a humanitarian crisis at the border, but there isn't an  invasion, and there is not an emergency of the sort that the President  speaks of. What we have here is an act of constitutional vandalism, the  President trying to take the power away from the House of  Representatives and the U.S. Senate, the executive trying to steal the  power of the purse from the Congress.  [[Page H2809]]    If Congress allows this to stand, then 15, 20 years, 30 years from  now, we will look back upon this as a time that gave both Democratic  and Republican Presidents incredible power to ignore Congress and  completely go around this body to do the things that they will in terms  of domestic politics.   There are landowners in Texas who are going to lose their land. This  is the largest Federal land taking of Texas land, I believe, in  history. Many people in Texas will lose their land. Many people will  have their land values devalued, some of them very significantly,  because of this.   Military construction projects in Texas are also at stake: $265  million worth of Texas military construction; projects at Joint Base  San Antonio, which includes those in my district, $76 million; Fort  Bliss, over $50 million; $42 million at Fort Hood; Red River, $71.5  million; Galveston Naval Reserve, $8.4 million gone because the  President has decided--and this Congress will have submitted to his  will--to go around Congress and unilaterally build a border wall.    Even those who support a wall should agree with us that this is not  the way to do it. Congress funded over $1 billion, yet the President  has gone around them to do more.   Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will stand with us and override  this veto.
