 Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend from Louisiana  for his leadership.   Madam Speaker, as crisis after crisis emerges from this  administration, I would like to take a moment to discuss an issue that  has been on my mind and in the hearts of millions of Americans: the  crisis at our southern border.   It is a humanitarian, national security, and public health crisis  that must be addressed immediately. I have seen these horrific scenes  for myself down in McAllen, Texas, and further south through the Darien  Gap where families, women, and children endure a dangerous trek to  America.   For the past 9 months, the border has served as a hotbed for drug  smugglers, human traffickers, child trafficking, and illegal  immigration, and is a direct result of the disastrous and harmful open  border policy of President Biden and Vice President Harris.   These policies are enriching the cartels, smugglers, and human  traffickers who prey on and abuse women and children crossing the  border. Some report earnings as much as $14 million a day.   These are horrendous crimes and they have no place in our country.  Here is what we know: During the month of August, almost 19,000 of the  208,000 illegal immigrants to cross the border were unaccompanied  minors. With a record number of minors crossing the border alone, we  need to be actively taking steps to prevent predators from exploiting  these innocent children.   Another fact: The number of illegal immigrants taken into custody  along the southern border topped 1.2 million since February. This does  not count the hundreds of thousands of got-aways. This crisis is not  seasonal, is not inherited. It appears like a purposeful chaos by our  Democratic Party. We must restore security at the southern border, end  illegal immigration, and take immediate steps to prioritize the health  and safety of all Americans.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Gaetz).                           Threat of Assassination     Madam Speaker, Utah is, in the Fourth District, now paying  more for everything thanks to the Biden administration's disastrous  economic policies. It is throwing our country back to a 1970s economy,  and there is no end in sight.   The Democrats' solution? Pack far-left policies into their $5.5  trillion spending package and tell the American people that it cost  them nothing. It is a bogus talking point that couldn't be further from  the truth.   In reality, this tax and spending bill would perpetuate labor  shortages in Utah and across the country, which will harm economic  recovery and hurt families in my district; violate Americans' financial  privacy by increasing IRS access to our personal bank data;  [[Page H5721]]  and it will also mandate financial services providers to report  financial transactions of $200 per week or greater. The IRS has no  business tracking the checking accounts of Americans.   They will also reduce our country's energy independence, causing gas  prices to skyrocket nationwide, now, by the way, hitting record numbers  in Utah.   It will impose devastating taxes on small businesses as they attempt  to get back on their feet.   President Biden and Democrats in Congress want to use this trillion- dollar spending bill to fundamentally reimagine our country's economy,  and they are going to raise taxes on the middle class to make it  happen. That means higher prices for families at the gas pump, in the  grocery store, and everywhere in-between and the highest inflation  levels we have seen in over 30 years.   This fiscally irresponsible spending spree places a staggering debt  on the next generation of Americans and leaves our country's economy  worse off.                            Honoring Taylor Hoover     Madam Speaker, 31-year-old United States Marine Corps  Staff Sergeant Taylor Hoover from Utah was killed in the line of duty  on August 26 by a suicide bomber in Kabul, Afghanistan. He was taken  too soon, heroically assisting the evacuation efforts of U.S. citizens  and Afghan allies.   In his faithful service to others, Sergeant Hoover and the 12 other  servicemembers who were lost on that tragic day embodied the military's  core values: honor, courage, and commitment.   I pray that they find solace in his memory and healing in the love of  their family and friends. From Hillcrest High School and all the way to  Arlington National Cemetery, I know this tragic loss will be felt by  many.   We will never forget the sacrifice and service of Sergeant Taylor  Hoover. God bless the Hoover family and all of our Nation's Gold Star  families.   Honoring Todd Grossgebauer    I would like to honor a true public servant and a Utah  hero, Commander Todd Grossgebauer, who lost a hard-fought battle  against cancer over this last summer.   Todd was the second employee hired by the Riverton, Utah, police  department. He also served the Provo Police Department for 26 years. He  studied at the FBI National Academy. He was a patrol division watch  commander and instructor at UVU's Law Enforcement Academy.   Todd and all of our brave men and women in law enforcement put their  lives on the line every single day to protect our communities. They  truly are hometown heroes.   As we reflect on and honor the sacrifices of our law enforcement  officers, I pledge to always back the blue. I am thinking of Todd today  and praying for his wife, Brenda, and their entire family.                              Honoring Brent Jex     Mr. Brent Jex is a retired police detective of 20 years in  the West Jordan Police Department and served as president of the Utah  Fraternal Order of Police since 2012.   As a member of Utah's Joint Criminal Apprehension Team, Brent has  participated in the arrest of the most dangerous and notorious  criminals in the Intermountain West. But even more impressive is his  dedication to advocating for our men and women in uniforms' mental  health.   Right now, even more than ever, our officers are under scrutiny and  stress that none of us can imagine. They have a voice with Brent as the  president of FOP.   Referring to mental health treatment, Brent has said, ``Before I  thought it was a sign of weakness to have to go seek treatment.  Afterward, I realized that it is a sign of weakness not to.''    Brent represents the best of us. He is an invaluable member of the  law enforcement community and the State of Utah as a whole.   Brent, thank you for all you have done and all you do to keep our  community safe.                       Honoring Utah's Small Businesses     Madam Speaker, like many industries across the country,  the COVID-19 pandemic took an unyielding toll on small businesses. Over  the past several months, I have had the pleasure of visiting hundreds  of small businesses across my district to hear firsthand how they are  coping through economic recovery. One thing is for certain: Utahns are  innovative.   Owlet, located in Lehi, is saving countless lives across the country  with its in-home monitoring system for prenatal and newborn babies.   Greek House is a family-owned and -operated restaurant in  Taylorsville, currently celebrating its first birthday in Utah's Fourth  District.   Local advanced manufacturing companies like Hexcel Company, Rock West  Composites, Inc., and Advanced Composites Inc., are leading in the  defense, commercial, and aerospace industries.   Neuroxorx in Sandy is providing innovative long-term physical,  occupational, and speech therapy for adults and children affected by  paralysis.   Grifols in Salt Lake City is a small plasma donation center that  helps save and improve lives across the country.   These companies and everything in-between perfectly showcase the  innovative and service-oriented spirit of Utah's Fourth District. They  think big and bold in their pursuit of excellence.   To every small business in every corner of Utah's Fourth District,  thank you for all you do to save our State.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
