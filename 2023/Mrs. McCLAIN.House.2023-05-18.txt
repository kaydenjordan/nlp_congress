 Mr. Speaker, I stand here today in strong opposition to  the Chinese Communist Party's takeover of a town in my home State of  Michigan.   The CCP is using one of their state-controlled companies to implant  thousands of Chinese workers and billions worth of Chinese technology  just outside of Big Rapids.   The company is called Gotion, and their technology is EV batteries.  Now, Gotion likes to say that this is a good thing for Michigan and  maybe even a good thing for America.   Why?   It is because they claim it brings jobs and money to our economy--but  let's not forget the over $500 million worth of taxpayer dollars that  will be used to subsidize and build this facility. That is, quite  frankly, what I call BS.   Gotion is bought and paid for by the CCP, and let's be clear: the CCP  is not our friend.   So I am not standing idly by and going to let this happen. I am going  to stand with the people of the great State of Michigan to call this  out and continue to bring attention to this and do something about  this. That is why I am here today: to call out the CCP for this blatant  attempt to overtake our State.                            ____________________
