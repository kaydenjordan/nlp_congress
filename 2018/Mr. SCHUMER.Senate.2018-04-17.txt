 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, congratulations. This is the first  time, at least when I am speaking on the floor, that the Presiding  Officer is in the Chair.   Is this the first time the Presiding Officer is in the Chair?   The Presiding Officer cannot answer. Let the record show that she  nodded her head in an affirmative way.                            ____________________     Madam President, first, a brief comment on the Tribal  Labor Sovereignty Act, which failed to move forward in the Senate last  night. Indian Affairs has very rarely found its way to the floor of the  Senate, despite a number of very pressing issues in Indian Country,  including homelessness, educational disparities, language loss,  healthcare access, broadband access, and many more. For a number of  years, Democrats and Republicans on the Indian Affairs Committee have  pushed legislation that would alleviate these problems. On our side of  the aisle, Senators Udall, Tester, Smith, Baldwin, Heinrich, Heitkamp,  Cantwell, and Murray have worked very hard on bills that deal with  these very, very significant issues in Indian Country, but none of  these bills have reached the floor.   The leader has refused to put bills that would dramatically help  Indian Country on the floor. When, finally, a Tribal bill was brought  forward by the majority leader, it was closed to amendments and debate.  Senator Udall, our ranking member, wished to have amendments. Senator  Hoeven, the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, told me he wanted  amendments. But the way Leader McConnell brought it to the floor was  with no amendments, no debate, and no discussion. Even worse, it was a  bill to scrap labor rights at a time when we should be doing everything  we can to strengthen labor protections. The only bill the leader would  bring to the floor is one that was divisive and destined to fail--a  political act, not an act to help Indian Country.   The AFL-CIO said that passage of the measure ``would have amounted to  the most aggressive erosion of labor protection since the 1940s.''   After many years of waiting for Tribal issues to reach the floor, I  think many of us were sorely disappointed that the majority leader  opted for this incredibly divisive bill, done in such an incredibly  divisive way.   I hope, now that the measure has failed to advance, that the majority  leader will consent to putting other Tribal bills on the floor, so many  of which have broad bipartisan support and could pass at least the  Senate.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another issue, Russia and Mueller,  yesterday it was reported that President Trump overruled the decision  of his administration to implement new sanctions against Russia for its  support of the brutal Assad regime in Syria in the wake of a chemical  weapons attack that was devastating. Our hearts go out when we see  pictures like this.   It is only the latest action in a long pattern of behavior in which  President Trump opts to treat Russia and President Putin with kid  gloves. It took a very long time for President Trump to even utter a  negative word about Mr. Putin, and his administration has time and  again delayed the implementation of sanctions.   Reports in the press said that President Trump was unhappy with his  administration's decision to expel 60 Russian diplomats after British  citizens were victims of a Russian-linked attack. The decision to expel  those diplomats was correct, in my view, but apparently the President  wasn't happy with the decision by his own appointed national security  team.   The White House shouldn't have to drag the President kicking and  screaming to do the right thing when it comes to punishing Vladimir  Putin and Russia. His refusal to stand up to the Kremlin is troubling,  and it leaves many Americans wondering: Why and what does the President  have to hide? That is what 90 percent of all Americans are asking  themselves--Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative. His actions  with Putin have been so confounding and so contrary to American  interests that there is virtually no rational explanation for them.   At the same time, the President's rhetoric about the Russia probe  should concern all of us. Should he seek to shut down or impede the  investigation by firing the Deputy Attorney General or Special Counsel  Mueller, interfering with the chain of command, or issuing pardons, we  would--make no mistake about it--be in a full-fledged constitutional  crisis.   I urge my colleagues, all of my colleagues--Democrat, Republican,  Independent--to support the bipartisan legislation in the Judiciary  Committee that would protect the special counsel from a political  firing. The rule of law is not a partisan issue. It is one of the most  serious issues we face because that is what is at the core of being an  American. That is why the whole world admires us. That is why so many  families like mine have been able to climb the ladder, starting out in  poverty as my grandparents did, to a decent life. We cannot let the  rule of law become a partisan issue. Let us speak in one  [[Page S2193]]  loud, clear voice by passing this legislation through the Senate as  soon as possible.   Finally, as well, the contradictions, I might add, in the  administration are enormous. Nikki Haley must be so embarrassed today.  She forthrightly said that we are going to be tough on Russia and do  additional sanctions one day, and then the President contradicted her  the next. Do they talk to each other? Do they have a set plan? Or is it  just up to the President's whim, day by day, moment by moment? When it  comes to Russia, it is far too serious to rely on whim, changing  attitudes, and maybe an 800-pound gorilla in the room. There is  something the President is worried about.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, today is tax day. That is  probably America's least favorite holiday. It is appropriate today to  look back at what has happened since the Republicans passed their tax  bill last year. Since the beginning of the tax debate, Republicans have  insisted their bill is about cutting taxes for working Americans. Even  though the crux of their bill was a massive corporate tax cut, they  said that workers would benefit the most. Even though it would direct  83 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent, they said that the  bill would be a ``middle-class miracle.''   How many middle-class people today think that tax bill is a miracle?  Not many. The only way that could have been true was if corporations  had decided to invest a substantial amount of their newfound profits in  workers. That is what Republicans, after all, argued would happen.   We Democrats warned that if you gave the big corporations the lion's  share of the tax cuts, corporations would do what they always do when  they have higher profits and extra cash--distribute it amongst  themselves, have a nice little party. Unfortunately, the evidence is  mounting that our predictions, as much as we wish they hadn't come  true, were prescient.   Since the passage of the tax bill--listen to this--corporations have  spent over $250 billion on share buybacks. That is putting corporations  on track to spend between $800 billion and $1 trillion on share  buybacks this year alone, outstripping the previous pace.   People may ask: What is a share buyback? Here is what it is. A  corporation has a lot of money. Some things they can do are pay workers  more, give family leave, treat their employees better. Another thing  they could do is invest in new plants and equipment, new training to  make that corporation more efficient and to sell more of its goods.  Those are good things.   What is a bad thing? Buying back the stock. What is buying back the  stock? The corporation says: We have a million shares outstanding. If  we buy back 100,000 of them, the price of the remaining ones will go  up.   Who benefits? Above all, those who have a lot of the stock shares-- the CEOs of the corporations and the wealthiest heads of those  companies. Who else benefits? Shareholders. Eighty percent of all  shares in America, despite pensions and despite 401(k)s, are held by  the 10 percent--the richest people in America. And one-third of all  shares, totally, go to people overseas. That is who benefits from stock  buybacks: corporate CEOs, wealthy shareholders, people overseas--more  than the average American worker. That is what has happened.   Listen to this. According to a recent analysis by JUST Capital, only  6 percent of the capital allocated by companies from the tax bill's  savings has gone to employees, while nearly 60 percent has gone to  shareholders. That statistic gets to the very core of the debate. Who  benefited from the tax bill? It was mainly wealthy CEOs, a lot of  foreigners, and the wealthiest people in America--not the average  working person.   As USA Today put it last week:         The number of companies letting workers know they are       getting a bonus, raise or other form of financial       compensation has slowed to a trickle. Most of the extra cash       from tax savings is going into the pockets of stock       shareholders through dividend increases and companies buying       back their own stock in hopes of boosting its price.    The whole theory of the Republican tax bill can be summed up in two  words: ``trickle down.'' The whole theory was to lavish corporations  and the already wealthy with tax cuts and maybe the benefits might  trickle down to everyone else. We are already seeing the balloon burst  on that idea as corporations dedicate an enormous percentage of the tax  savings to stock buybacks and only a sliver to worker compensation.  That is why the Republican bill is not popular. A poll out from NBC  News/Wall Street Journal--Wall Street Journal, hardly a working man's  newspaper--showed that only 27 percent of Americans think the tax cuts  were a good idea. That is fitting news on tax day, one of the least  popular days of the year.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
