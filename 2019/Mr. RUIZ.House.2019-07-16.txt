 Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, we learned of two Facebook  groups in which CBP agents made hateful comments about the women,  children, and asylum-seekers under their custody and, therefore, their  responsibility.   This kind of racism, xenophobia, and violent misogyny is  unacceptable. CBP must be held accountable to end these shameful  comments and the cruel, inhumane treatment of children in their  custody.   We can't simply fund supplies and expect a behavior change. That is  why I am grateful to Homeland Security Committee Chairman Thompson and  to Chairman Nadler and Chair Lofgren of the Committee on the Judiciary  for holding a markup of my bill, the Humanitarian Standards for  Individuals in CPB Custody Act, to ensure our treatment of children,  women, and families is consistent with the principles of basic human  dignity.   My bill sets the basic standards we need to create a comprehensive  public health approach to the humanitarian challenges at our border.  Together, we are moving this bill forward to prevent children from  dying and restore humanity to our treatment of children under the  custody and responsibility of the Federal Government.                            ____________________
