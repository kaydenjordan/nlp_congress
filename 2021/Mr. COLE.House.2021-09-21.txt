 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Ross), my good friend, for yielding me the customary 30  minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin my remarks in a positive way by  discussing H.R. 4350, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2022. I am glad that this bill has not been poisoned by all the  partisanship that has plagued the House for the past year, and that, as  they have done for the past 61 years, the House Armed Services  Committee came together and produced a bill that both Republicans and  Democrats can support. We saw this in the overwhelming 57-2 vote to  report the bill out of committee.   This outcome wasn't always assured, Mr. Speaker. Unfortunately,  President Biden proposed a defense budget number that was woefully  inadequate for America's defense needs. At a time when we are facing  new and emerging threats around the globe, from the Middle East, to  Afghanistan, to the South China Sea, we cannot afford to underfund our  national defense.   Chronic underfunding of national defense was a hallmark of the Obama- Biden administration, and it appears that President Biden himself is  determined to continue down that path. Fortunately, both the House and  Senate Armed Services Committees disagreed, and the House now has  before it a bill that fully funds our defense needs for the coming  fiscal year.   The bill before us funds continued acquisition of ships to ensure the  U.S. Navy can meet its mission. It funds the procurement and  development of new weapons systems, which ensures that our military  will be well-prepared to meet any new and emerging challenges in the  coming years. And it provides our servicemembers with a 2.7 percent pay  raise.   And perhaps most important of all, it includes many provisions  designed to provide much-needed oversight of President Biden's bungled  withdrawal from Afghanistan. America deserves answers about the  decisions that were made and the resulting failures of leadership that  occurred at all levels. Thanks to this bill, they can be assured that  they will get them.   And while I do not support every provision in the NDAA, I want to  applaud the good work of the House Armed Services Committee. I think  their process should serve as a model for all committees in the House.  In an age when so much legislation is produced by one party behind  closed doors in leadership offices, the committee did the hard work and  produced a bill that both parties can support. Indeed, it is truly  refreshing to be considering this bill today, and I want to commend  Chairman Adam Smith and Ranking Member   Mike Rogers for their good  work and bipartisan working relationship.   Unfortunately, the next measure I will discuss isn't nearly so  positive. This bill is a continuing resolution to fund the government  through December 3, 2021. But rather than advancing a clean, negotiated  CR, the majority is using the bill as a vehicle to push through a  suspension of the national debt limit. This is a nonstarter with  Republicans, as the majority well knows and, as such, I expect all  Republicans will oppose it.   Since taking control of the Presidency and the Senate in January, the  majority has been on a spending spree unlike any other in our history.  Earlier this year, the Democrats rammed through a partisan $1.9  trillion reconciliation bill, ostensibly about COVID relief, but really  about pushing forward a laundry list of progressive policies.   Last week, 13 authorizing committees met on another partisan  reconciliation bill, this one larded up with a whopping $3.5 trillion  in progressive policies like those found in the Green New Deal. And  sadly, even that wasn't enough for some committees, who, according to  the CBO, spent more than double what the budget resolution told them  to. These bloated spending measures come on top of normal Federal  spending and on top of the large bipartisan COVID-19 relief packages  passed last year.   The last suspension of the debt limit covered all the spending that  was done in the past, along with the first 9 months of the Biden  administration. But since then, the majority has opened the national  checkbook. They have done so with only Democratic votes. That is their  prerogative. After all, they control the White House, the House of  Representatives, and the Senate.   But since the majority is spending this money over Republican  objections, and without Republican cooperation, it is up to the  majority to raise the debt limit. They should not expect Republican  votes to help them cover their out-of-control spending.   Mr. Speaker, it is a sad state of affairs that what should be a  relatively simple measure to fund the government is being used in this  manner. I urge my friends across the aisle to rethink this plan, and I  hope they will come to their senses before government funding runs out  nine days from now.   Our last bill covered by this rule is somehow even more partisan and  controversial than the CR. This is H.R. 3755, which the majority is  pitching as a simple codification of the Supreme Court decision of Roe  v. Wade. In reality, this measure goes far beyond that. It is the  greatest threat to the protection of innocent, unborn life that we have  seen in over 50 years.   The bill before us preempts any State law that seeks to protect life,  including policies that those who identify as pro-choice support.  Instead, every single State would be required to allow abortion on  demand at any time up to the point of birth.   No more would States be able to protect conscience rights; no more  would they be able to ban barbaric procedures like dismemberment  abortions; and no more would they be able to prevent abortions  targeting fetuses with Down  [[Page H4567]]  Syndrome, which 70 percent of the American people oppose.   I would call on all Members, Republicans and Democrats, to reject  this measure.   Protecting the unborn has always been one of my highest priorities as  a Member of Congress. We need only to look at the Declaration of  Independence for a reminder that the right to life is one of those  inalienable rights endowed upon all of us, even unborn children, by our  Creator. I urge this House to remember those words, remember the  unborn, and to reject this egregious attack on life.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule and two of the underlying  bills, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   If we defeat the previous question, Mr. Speaker, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 4828, the Border Security for  America Act, for immediate consideration.   The last couple of days have made it plainly obvious that the Federal  Government has lost control of our southern border. More than 15,000  migrants have set up camp under the Del Rio International Bridge.  Customs and Border Patrol have been completely overwhelmed, to the  point that Texas Governor Abbott had to take things into his own hands  and deploy both the National Guard and Texas Rangers to stop the flow.   Rather than allowing the President to simply fiddle, we must do  something in Congress to address this unprecedented crisis. H.R. 4828  will address the ongoing crisis in three ways. It would require the  immediate resumption of construction of the wall at the southern  border; it would provide for new investments in technology; and it  would ensure an appropriate level of Customs and Border Protection  officers to fulfill CBP's mandate at all ports of entry and along the  border.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous materials, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Pfluger), my good friend and a distinguished Member, to further  explain the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Biden administration's reckless and dangerous  policies have led to a crisis on the southern border, as the illegal  flow of drugs, weapons, and people continues to threaten American  communities.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs.  Spartz), my good friend and a distinguished Member, to speak more about  this crisis and solutions contained in H.R. 4828.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the crisis at the southern border is affecting  communities across the United States, but nowhere is that more apparent  than in those communities that are near the southern border.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Tony  Gonzales), my good friend and a distinguished fellow member of the  Appropriations Committee, to speak more about the need for the Border  Security for America Act.    Mr. Speaker, it should be easy to agree that securing our  southern border is vital for national security. Our next speaker will  talk more about H.R. 4828 and the need for vital security improvements  as part of an overall strategy to secure and protect the southern  border.   I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko),  the author of the bill, and the ranking Republican member on the  Homeland Security Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), my good friend, and a fellow member  of the Rules Committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, and a member  of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Jackson), my good friend, and a distinguished member of the House  Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Comer), my good friend and the distinguished ranking  member of the Oversight Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Obernolte), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Jacobs), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Smith), my very good friend and the distinguished  Republican ranking member of the Budget Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking my good friend from North  Carolina. We don't agree obviously on the rule, we don't agree on every  piece of legislation, but I appreciate the civility and the quality of  the debate.   Mr. Speaker, to me, as I look at both the rule and the underlying  legislation, the phrase that immediately comes to my mind is the good,  the bad, and the ugly.   Let's start with the good. There is no question that the National  Defense Authorization Act is a product of bipartisan cooperation of the  highest order on the House Armed Services Committee. Nobody got  everything they wanted, but there are a lot of things in there that  both sides worked together on to achieve. I particularly want to  commend Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers for the manner in  which they approached this bill. I want to commend them for the  additional $25 billion. I know that the chairman didn't support that,  but obviously many Democratic Members did. I think that was an  important sign that the country is united on the idea that we need to  spend more on defense in these very dangerous times.   Again, the quality of the compromise and some of the legislation that  is included in this is extraordinarily important. The gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Speier) mentioned the issue of sexual assault. It is  addressed in this bill in a bipartisan, thoughtful way. I thank her for  her tireless work on that very important subject.   I also thank those Members that worked hard to reposition our defense  where we focus on our emerging threats, our near-peer threats of China  and Russia while also dealing with North Korea, Iran, and the threat of  global terrorism.   It is a good bill. Not everybody will support it, but I think it will  get overwhelming support on both sides of the aisle, and I look forward  to voting for it.   To me, the bad is H.R. 3755. I make no bones about it, Mr. Speaker. I  am strongly pro-life. I have a 100 percent pro-life voting record. I  respect those with a different point of view, but this is not a  codification of Roe v. Wade. This is a radical abortion bill that would  allow abortion-on-demand in every State under almost any circumstances  that the provider of the abortion deems appropriate.   Quite frankly, it is an enormous overreach, and it will overturn  dozens of State laws in many States all around the country, laws that  have been constitutionally approved in the past. That is unfortunate,  and I think many on our side that certainly work on women's health are  not going to vote in support of abortion-on-demand.                                time  1715    Mr. Speaker, finally, to me, the continuing resolution unquestionably  is the ugly. It is not all ugly. There are actually some good things in  there. I actually commend my friends for voting to keep the government  open. I would normally do that as well. No partisan debate there, at  least not from me.   I also very much support the relief for those Americans who have been  the victims of natural disasters, which is contained in the bill. That,  too, was negotiated by the Committee on Appropriations. It is an  appropriate measure.   So, too, is the money set aside to help those fleeing from the  Taliban, those who worked with our forces in Afghanistan and who now  come to our country and to other countries seeking refuge and support.  We should honor the commitment and the sacrifice they made on our  behalf.   We could have passed a bill like that in a united, bipartisan  fashion. Indeed, the Committee on Appropriations had essentially  negotiated the deal. Then a decision was made by Democratic leadership  to interject a debt ceiling resolution without any discussion, any  negotiation, any way to lower that debt or offset it or slow it down or  reform the process. That is what many of my friends object to.   I voted for debt ceiling increases in the past under both Republican  and Democratic Presidents. I certainly would be prepared to do so  again, but not without addressing some of the drivers of the debt, and  certainly not as a sign off on a $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill that  is on top of our normal appropriations, on top of the bipartisan  release given and the coronavirus crisis thus far.   That is a stretch too far. My friends know that it won't work, yet we  are going to kick it over to the Senate, where we know the support is  not there.   Mr. Speaker, I suspect we will be back on this floor dealing with  this matter again, hopefully in a fashion where the two parties can  work together and keep the government open and operational.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question and ``no'' on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
