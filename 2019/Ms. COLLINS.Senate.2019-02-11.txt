 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  permitted to proceed as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.    Thank you.   (The remarks of Ms. Collins pertaining to the introduction of S. 433  are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills  and Joint Resolutions.'')  [[Page S1156]]         Madam President, the second bill that I have introduced  is the Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act. I have introduced  this bill with my friend and colleague from Maryland, Senator Cardin.  Our legislation will improve the access that Medicare beneficiaries  have to home healthcare by allowing physician assistants, nurse  practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and certified nurse midwives  to order home health services. All of these healthcare professionals  are playing increasingly important roles in the delivery of healthcare,  particularly in rural and underserved areas of our Nation, like those  represented by the Presiding Officer and the State of Maine.   I have learned of far too many cases of seniors experiencing  unnecessary delays in accessing home healthcare because a physician was  not available to order the care promptly. To avoid these needless  delays, it is common sense that other medical professionals who are  familiar with a patient's case should be able to order these services.  Under current law, however, only physicians are allowed to certify or  initiate home healthcare for Medicare patients, even though they may  not be as familiar with the patient's case as the nonphysician  provider. In some cases, the certifying physician may not even have a  relationship with the patient and must rely on the recommendation of  the nurse practitioner, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist,  or certified nurse midwife to order the medically necessary home  healthcare. That makes no sense whatsoever. In too many cases, these  requirements create obstacles, delays, and unnecessary paperwork before  home healthcare can be provided. The result can be an unnecessary  hospital readmission or other setback for the patient that would not  have occurred had the home healthcare been provided promptly.   The Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act removes the needless  delays in getting Medicare patients the home healthcare they need  simply because a physician is not available to sign the form required  by law. Again, I would make the point that this physician may not even  have a relationship with the senior or other patient who needs the home  healthcare. That primary care relationship may be between the patient  and a nurse practitioner or a physician assistant, and yet that  qualified healthcare professional is unable to order the home care that  the patient needs.   These two bills will help to ensure the viability and accessibility  of home health services now and in the future. By helping patients to  avoid much more costly hospital stays and nursing homes, we know that  home healthcare saves Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers'  programs millions of dollars each year. At a time when healthcare costs  are among our most pressing policy challenges, we should embrace cost- effective solutions like home healthcare.   Thank you, Madam President.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support two bills that I have introduced that will help to preserve and  to expand access to home healthcare.   I have been a strong supporter of home care since my very first home  visit early in my Senate service. This experience gave me the  opportunity to meet and to visit with home healthcare patients, where I  saw firsthand what a difference highly skilled, caring visiting nurses  and other healthcare professionals make in the lives of patients and  their families. I have been a passionate advocate of home healthcare  ever since.   The highly skilled and compassionate care that home health agencies  provide in the State of Maine and across the country have enabled  millions of our most frail and vulnerable individuals to avoid  hospitals and nursing homes and to stay just where they want to be--in  the comfort, privacy, and security of their own homes.   As we look to the future, home health services will continue to be in  high demand. The Census projects that by the year 2030, the proportion  of U.S. residents older than age 65 will have nearly doubled from 2010.   The Home Health Payment Innovation Act, which I have introduced with  Senator Stabenow, Senator Kennedy, Senator Jones, Senator Cassidy, and  Senator Paul, preserves access to existing home health services under  the Medicare Program, while also providing a pathway for innovative  approaches to using these vital services. This bipartisan legislation  is endorsed by the National Association of Home Care and Hospice, as  well as by the Partnership for Quality Home Healthcare.   Our bill would make two key adjustments in home health payment reform  provisions that were passed last year. First, it would prevent  unwarranted payment rate cuts by basing any behavioral adjustments on  actual evidence. Second, it would limit the risk of disruption in care  by providing a phase-in for any necessary rate increases or decreases.  This phase-in is critical for home health providers, as CMS has already  proposed cutting Medicare payment rates in 2020 by more than $1 billion  in the first year alone, based purely on assumptions of changes in  behavior.   Our bill also provides the pathway to expanded use of home healthcare  in the Medicare Program without increasing program spending   It provides flexibility on waiving what is called the ``homebound  requirement'' for home health services when a plan or innovative care  delivery model, such as an accountable care organization, determines  that providing care to the patient in the home would improve outcomes  and reduce spending on patient care.   As plans and providers continue to experiment with innovative ways to  deliver care and improve value in Medicare spending, allowing them the  flexibility to waive this limitation--the homebound limitation--will  help to advance the goals of ensuring that care is delivered at the  right time, in the right place, and at the right cost.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support two bills that I have introduced that will help to preserve and  to expand access to home healthcare.
