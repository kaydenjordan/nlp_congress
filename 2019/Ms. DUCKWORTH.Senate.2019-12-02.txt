 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the  outstanding career of Michael T. Carrigan. Mr. Carrigan is retiring as  president of the Illinois AFL-CIO following a long and distinguished  career in public service.   After growing up in Bradley, IL, Mr. Carrigan graduated from  MacMurray College in Jacksonville. He then completed a 4-year  apprenticeship program and became a wireman before serving as business  manager and financial secretary for International Brotherhood of  Electrical Workers Local 146.   In 1995, Mr. Carrigan was elected to the Decatur City Council. He was  appointed mayor of Decatur in 2008 to complete the term of another,  retiring mayor. In 2010, he became president of the Illinois AFL-CIO,  where he has spent the last 20 years advocating for workers and  families across my State.  [[Page S6788]]    Among the many victories Mr. Carrigan has secured for working  families, he recently helped successfully push for a minimum wage  increase in Illinois and a $45 billion State infrastructure package. He  has been lauded for his ``steady hand'' and leadership and will no  doubt be missed by his membership and everyone in Illinois that  supports the rights of working people.   I thank Mr. Carrigan for his service to the State of Illinois, and I  wish him all the best in retirement.                            ____________________
