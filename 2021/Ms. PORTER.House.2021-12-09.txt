 Madam Speaker, I introduced the Stop Foreign Interference  in Ballot Measures Act to ban foreign contributions to State and local  ballot initiatives and referenda. I am proud that my bill is part of  the Protecting Our Democracy Act.   Foreign interference in our politics ranges from social media  disinformation paid for by our adversaries to dictators bankrolling  lobbying on Capitol Hill. Current law permits billions of dollars of  foreign influence in ballot initiatives. Last year, over $750 million  was spent in California alone.   We prohibit foreign contributions to candidates because it protects  our national security. That same rationale should apply to foreign  contributions to ballot initiatives and referenda. That is why we must  pass my bill.   Money and politics distort the will of the American people. It  advantages special interests and limits the power of regular Americans.  When that money is supplied by foreign countries and adversaries, it  puts our democracy and our national security at risk.
