 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it is no secret that in parts of Texas  and in cities across the country, COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations  are on the rise. Dr. Angela Clendenin is an epidemiologist at Texas A&M  University's School of Public Health, and she attributes this increase  to what she calls pandemic fatigue.   After months of vigorous handwashing and mask wearing, it seems that  people are becoming less and less vigilant. She said, if we continue in  the behaviors that we are behaving in right now without regulatory  intervention, we are going to continue in the direction we are headed.  I guess that is one way of saying if we don't shape up, the present  spread of the virus will continue with, perhaps, in some instances,  dangerous, even fatal, consequences.   That is a path we should not head down and one that will put an even  greater strain on our healthcare workers. I guess, as I think about it,  there are two ways to approach this pandemic. One is to leave it to  government to tell us what we can and cannot do, to engage in more and  more lockdowns and deprivation of our individual liberty or we can take  personal responsibility. Speaking for myself, and I hope others, I hope  the personal responsibility route is the one we will take.   From staffing shortages due to the coronavirus exposure to short  supplies of personal protective equipment, to a lack of critical  equipment like ventilators, our frontline healthcare workers have  carried on this fight in the face of tremendous challenges. Now, with  cases climbing in parts of my State and around the country, these  heroes are in dire need of another line of defense.   The public--meaning Congress--on their behalf has the power to  provide that help. Through the same simple steps we heard about since  the beginning of the pandemic, we can stop or at least dramatically  slow the transmission of COVID-19.   Again, it gets back to the basics we have all been taught and I think  more or less most of us have been employing: washing your hands,  wearing a mask, practice social distancing, and don't let the pandemic  fatigue win.   We need to all remain vigilant and committed to these basic practices  until the experts tell us that COVID-19 is no longer a threat--likely,  a point after which the vaccine has been widely deployed. None of us  knows exactly when that might happen, but we have been getting some  great news this last week or so about scientific developments that have  been funded by the efforts that we in Congress have taken together on a  bipartisan basis.   On Friday, in my State, the Governor announced the Department of  Health and Human Services will distribute a new COVID-19 therapy to  hospitals across the State as early as this week. The antibody  treatment is produced by Eli Lilly and will be critical in reducing  hospitalizations. It is meant for those who are known to be at a higher  risk of developing severe symptoms, like the elderly or those with  underlying chronic illness. For those who are diagnosed with COVID-19,  this drug may be effective in preventing the onset of severe symptoms.  The antibody treatment received emergency use authorization from the  Food and Drug Administration last week, and I am hopeful it will help  stop or at least slow dramatically the alarming rise in  hospitalizations that we have seen across parts of my State.   So far, about 80,000 doses are ready for distribution nationwide, and  we should have that up to a million doses a day by the end of the year.  While the quantity is limited at this point, every single dose could  mean a life saved. This alone is cause for hope.   But the good news doesn't stop there. Last week, Pfizer announced its  COVID-19 vaccine has been more than 90 percent effective in clinical  trials. Just this morning, Moderna announced its vaccine candidate is  nearly 95 percent effective--just incredible results. This is exactly  why we invested billions of dollars in developing these lifesaving  drugs earlier this year. The funding that we have appropriated has  supported not only research and development but manufacturing of  vaccines and therapeutics. We wanted to be sure that distribution could  begin as soon as these drugs were approved as safe and effective, and  that is exactly the direction we are headed in.   We are on track to have tens of millions of doses of vaccine  available by the end of the year, likely from at least two different  drug makers. This historic investment has led to historic progress.   I could not be more proud of the men and women who have made this  possible. I am incredibly grateful to the  [[Page S6693]]  healthcare workers who are continuing to fight this serious infection  on the frontlines.   I want to thank the researchers and scientists and thousands of  volunteers who are supporting the development of vaccines and  therapeutics. Beyond the physical toll this virus has taken, it is also  having a profound impact on this country's mental health. This pandemic  has brought on a range of new stressors, including isolation, financial  struggles, health anxiety, and the stress of teaching children from  home.   In a Kaiser Family Foundation poll in March, roughly, one-third of  adults reported that their mental health was negatively affected by  pandemic-related stresses. By July, that number has risen to more than  half of the adults in the United States.   As we continue to discuss what future coronavirus legislation will  look like, we should not--we must not--ignore the mental health impact.   I have spoken at length about the need to support community mental  health centers and community behavioral health organizations, which are  vital mental health providers across much of my State and across the  Nation. These providers are a critical source of care and support for  those who battle mental health and substance abuse disorders, and the  need for their services has only risen during the pandemic.   The one group that is too often ignored in conversations about mental  health care is made up of those transitioning from the criminal justice  system as well. More than half of those in the criminal justice system  have experienced a mental health issue, and our criminal justice system  is ill-suited to provide the sort of treatment and support they need.  Yet, even when these individuals do receive treatment while they are  incarcerated, they are rarely given the tools they need to succeed upon  their release. Approximately 80 percent of these people are uninsured  after being released, making it nearly impossible for them to continue  their mental health treatment.   Earlier this year, I and Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut introduced  the Crisis Stabilization and Community Reentry Act to support those who  have become part of the criminal justice system and provide a stable  source of treatment for them after they leave incarceration.   Most prisoners who receive treatment for a mental health or substance  abuse disorder are released without their having plans to keep up with  their regimes. This leads to higher recidivism rates, which could be  avoided. It also means that law enforcement is too often left to be the  first responder to a mental health crisis, which can escalate those  scenarios and put both the officers and the individuals at risk.   Our bill creates grants to connect law enforcement officials to  State, Federal, and local resources to help individuals who are either  engaged in the criminal justice system or who are being released from  prison get access to the support they need. These grants connect those  services to make sure that people who are suffering acute episodes can  access treatment without there being the risk of unnecessary  incarceration. Many times, these people need help. They don't need to  go back to jail. It has the ability to strengthen our community-based  crisis response, reduce suicides during incarceration, and close the  revolving door that leads people back to prison.   I hope the Senate can pass this legislation soon and that our  colleagues in the House will follow suit. With the ongoing mental  health challenges that have been brought on by COVID-19, there could  not be a more critical time to strengthen our Nation's mental health  resources.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes.
