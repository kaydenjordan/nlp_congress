 Mr. President, as the Senator knows, Senator Shelby and I  have been working very hard on the appropriations bills. I commend his  staff and my staff for all the work they have done. It is not just the  bill's first page and the number at the end that counts. There is a  whole lot that goes in in between.   There are a number of policy considerations that are in there. There  are  [[Page S6233]]  things that Senators from both parties want that make a great deal of  sense and both parties are for it, and we are putting those together. I  would hope, having done all that, it means that within the next day or  so we can get at least four of these appropriations bills passed.   I remind everybody that the last time Senator Shelby and I went  through this exercise, we passed most of the bills, if not unanimously,  virtually unanimously. I think it helps the Senate. It shows that we  are doing our work and that we can set aside partisan differences and  do what is best for the country.   The other body has been working very hard in the House of  Representatives on their appropriations bills. Their Appropriations  Committee is led by two of the finest members I have served with: Nita  Lowey, the chair from New York, and Kay Granger, the ranking member  from Texas--one a Democrat and one a Republican--both of whom believe  in the Congress and have our support, and they worked hard. I say that  just because I have had so many Members ask me how it is going. I think  it is going better than anybody thought it might at this point earlier.  We will get it done.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
