 Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, three of the House  committees investigating President Trump's dealings with Ukraine  subpoenaed administration officials. They seek answers as to why  President Trump would purposely withhold critical military assistance  from Ukraine.   Such a request is well within the committee's constitutional  legislative powers. It is also central to establishing whether  President Trump knowingly withheld military assistance to coerce  Ukrainian Government officials into creating a false narrative on his  political rival, Vice President Joe Biden.   On October 15, the committees received a letter from the Vice  President, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Department of  Defense rejecting the House subpoena. One letter even indicated the  administration was ``unable to comply with your request for documents  at this time.''   Mr. Speaker, this is unconscionable. As co-chair of the bipartisan  Congressional Ukraine Caucus and a senior member on the House Defense  Appropriations Subcommittee, I am greatly disheartened that U.S.- Ukraine relations could be put at risk just to advance and cover up  President Trump's malfeasance.    America deserves transparency and truth, and the Trump administration  must work with Congress or face constitutional justice.
