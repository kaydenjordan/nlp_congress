 Mr. President, I would like to ask consent--I know we  have an order to vote at 1:45--to speak for about 5 minutes.    Madam President, this Saturday, March 18, will mark the  60th anniversary of the unanimous and landmark Supreme Court decision  in Gideon v. Wainwright, which held that every American has the  constitutional right in criminal cases, regardless of their wealth and  where they were born--they have a right, fundamentally, to the public  defense system that we know today.   Before Gideon was decided, people accused of crimes were left to fend  for themselves, having to navigate arraignments, plea bargains, jury  decisions, trials, cross-examination of witnesses--every part of the  criminal prosecution, they had to do it themselves while facing  government prosecutors who had the legal upper hand.   Clarence Earl Gideon was a 51-year-old with an eighth grade education  who ran away from home in middle school. History describes him as a  ``drifter'' who spent time in and out of prison for nonviolent crimes,  but history would also come to know him as someone who fundamentally  transformed our legal system so that any person without resources  accused of a crime has a due process right to a fair trial. You can't  have a fair trial without counsel.   In 1961, Gideon was arrested for stealing $5 in change and beer,  allegedly doing so from the Bay Harbor Poolroom in Panama City, FL. As  James Baldwin would write the same year as Gideon's arrest, ``Anyone  who has ever struggled with poverty knows how extremely expensive it is  to be poor.''   Gideon, who had spent much of his life in poverty, was too poor to  hire an attorney and asked the trial court to appoint one for him. The  court denied his request, saying that only indigent defenders facing  the death penalty are entitled to a lawyer.   Gideon assumed the burden of defending himself at trial, becoming his  own lawyer. He made an opening statement to the jury and cross-examined  the prosecution's witnesses. He presented witnesses in his own defense.  He declined to testify himself and made arguments emphasizing his  innocence.   Despite his valiant efforts, the jury found Gideon guilty of this $5  theft, and he was sentenced to 5 years' imprisonment. But Gideon felt  he had been fundamentally deprived of his due process rights.   Determined to prove his innocence, Gideon penciled a five-page,  handwritten petition asking the nine Justices of the Supreme Court to  consider his case. Against all odds, the Supreme Court granted Gideon's  petition.   Gideon would tell the Supreme Court:         It makes no difference how old I am or what color I am or       which church I belong to, if any. The question is I did not       get a fair trial. The question is very simple. I requested       the court to appoint me [an] attorney and the court refused.    In the Court's unanimous decision, they held that ``reason and  reflection require us to recognize that in our adversary system of  criminal justice, any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire  a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for  him.''   Gideon's case was sent back to the lower court, where he had a lawyer  to defend him. It took the jury only 1 hour to come to a verdict and  acquit him.   From that time on, the public defense system as we know it today came  into existence. Folks who couldn't afford a lawyer 60 years ago are now  guaranteed basic legal protection. Public defenders play a sacrosanct  role in our society. Every one of America's public defenders embarks on  the noble work that is the cornerstone of our legal system, ensuring  that every citizen has a right to a fair trial, that every citizen has  access to justice within the justice system.   Yet the promise of Gideon, the promise of this decision, still  remains unfulfilled. The public defense is under such strain that in  many places, it barely functions.   Justice Black declared that ``lawyers in criminal courts are  necessities, not luxuries.'' But too often across our country, adequate  legal representation is a luxury only afforded to those who are wealthy  enough to hire a lawyer.   Despite their important and essential work to the cause of justice,  public defenders carry crushing caseloads that strain their ability to  meet their legal and ethical obligations to provide effective  representation. According to a 2019 Brennan Center report, only 27  percent of county-based and 21 percent of State-based public defender  offices have enough attorneys to adequately handle their caseloads.  There are counties and States in America where public defenders are  responsible for more than 200 cases at one time.   The quality of public defenders also varies from State to State, town  to town, case to case. Compared to prosecutors and other attorneys,  public defenders are woefully underresourced and underpaid. That is why  today, with my friend and colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, I am  introducing the Providing a Quality Defense Act to provide funding to  local governments to hire more public defenders so that those accused  of crimes can receive adequate representation.   The bill will provide funding to increase salaries for public  defenders so that they can have pay parity with the prosecutors they  face. It will require  [[Page S830]]  the Department of Justice to conduct evidence-based studies and make  recommendations for appropriate caseloads for public defenders and for  adequate compensation.   Public defenders don't just represent their clients with zealous  advocacy; they get to know their clients and see the impact of  convictions on their families and loved ones. This experience is  invaluable and helps to inform sentencing should there be a conviction.  However, unlike the majority of State sentencing commissions, the U.S.  Sentencing Commission, an independent Agency tasked with establishing  sentencing policies and practices for the Federal court, lacks a  representative from a public defender background who would provide an  essential perspective on the criminal justice system.   Today, again, along with Senator Durbin, I am reintroducing the  Sentencing Commission Improvements Act to add a member to the U.S.  Sentencing Commission with a public defender background who will bring  a new and valuable perspective to the Commission.   I urge my colleagues to support both of these bills, which will bring  us one step closer to a justice system that is fairer, more humane, and  more just. Such a criminal justice system is part of the legacy of a  so-called drifter, a 51-year-old who spoke truth to power, who  challenged a system that seemed impossible to beat, who challenged the  very idea of what it means to have a just justice system. If the moral  arc of the universe bends towards justice, then Clarence Earl Gideon is  one of the arc benders.
