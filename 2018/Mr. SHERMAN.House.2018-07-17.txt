 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I want to applaud the chair and the ranking member for a  tour de force of bipartisanship: 32 bipartisan bills with near  unanimous support in our committee, all put together in one outstanding  package.   I want to thank them both for including in this the BUILD Act,  introduced by Mr. Loudermilk and me. This bill will help Habitat for  Humanity and similar organizations. It says that when they provide a  zero percent loan, they can use the old disclosure forms or the new  disclosure forms, whichever is easiest for them and whichever they have  the software to produce.   This bill is supported by Habitat for Humanity International and the  National Housing Conference. It passed our committee with a unanimous  53-0 recorded vote.   I want to thank both the chairman and the ranking member for  including this legislation in an excellent package, and I urge a  ``yes'' vote.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4819, the  DELTA Act, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr.  Fortenberry) for his initiative in putting forward this legislation to  help protect one of Africa's most important ecosystems. I am pleased to  cosponsor this measure. I also want to commend Chairman Royce and  Ranking Member Engel for their leadership on international conservation  issues, particularly the fight against wildlife trafficking.   The Okavango River Basin in Angola, Botswana, and Namibia supports an  amazing array of wildlife, including the largest remaining  concentration of elephants in Africa. It is also home to more than a  million people.   The DELTA Act requires the development of a strategy to encourage  sustainable management of natural resources in the river basin,  including the protection of wildlife. This strategy will require input  from a wide range of stakeholders, including national governments,  local communities, nongovernmental organizations, and the private  sector.   The goal is to support economic development for the residents of the  region while preserving unique ecosystems and protecting wildlife.   The DELTA Act has the support of key conservation organizations,  including the World Wildlife Fund and the Wildlife Conservation  Society.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this bipartisan legislation,  which passed our committee by unanimous voice vote, and I urge my  colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Cuellar).    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to reiterate the  importance of conservation in combating the scourge of wildlife  trafficking around the world. This bill reaffirms our commitment to  these goals and will result in a strategy to encourage sustainable  management of natural resources in the Okavango River Basin located in  Angola, Botswana, and Namibia.   I thank Mr. Fortenberry, Mr. Cuellar, and, of course, Chairman Royce  and Ranking Member Engel for their work. This bill passed our committee  by unanimous, bipartisan voice vote. I strongly support it, and I urge  my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I rise in support of this measure.   Mr. Speaker, this bill passed our committee by unanimous, bipartisan  voice vote. It is named for Elie Wiesel, the Holocaust survivor and  author who spent decades leading the fight to bring Nazis to justice.   First, I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri, Ambassador Wagner, and  the chairman of the Democratic Caucus, the gentleman from New York, Joe  Crowley, for their work in bringing forward this very important bill  that improves our capacity to prevent and respond to genocides and mass  atrocities. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this  legislation.   Millions of innocent civilians have died in mass atrocities and  genocides. I would like to take just a second to remind everyone of a  few of these tragedies:   The first genocide of the 20th century, the Armenian genocide, which  killed approximately 1.5 million people;   The Holocaust, from 1933 to 1945, more than 9 million people were  killed, including over 6 million Jews;   Cambodia in 1975, which saw the slaying of 2 million people;   Rwanda in 1990, which saw the deaths of 800,000 in just 100 days; and   Sudan, Darfur, and the tragedy there.   Tragedies and crises like this are not just in the past. Today, we  are witnessing mass killings of innocent people in many places around  the globe.   In Burma, the military has inflicted horrific violence against the  Rohingya people. Thousands have been killed. This is ethnic cleansing,  and it appears on the verge of genocide.   Now, 700,000 refugees have been pushed into Bangladesh, 80 percent of  them are women and children. And as I mentioned, in Darfur, some  300,000 are dead, 3 million displaced.   This measure gives us the tools to detect the warning signs of a mass  atrocity or genocide so that we can respond quickly and improves  interagency coordination. Overall, this measure will make our  government better equipped to handle the growing threats of genocide  and crimes against humanity.   This is a good bill. The prevention of genocide and mass atrocity  should be a core objective of our Nation's national security and  foreign policy missions. The bill passed, as I said before, our  committee by a unanimous bipartisan voice vote.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Crowley) an original cosponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).     Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of  this measure, and I thank Ambassador Wagner and Representative Crowley  for their work.   This bill will equip our government with the tools to better monitor  and, hopefully, prevent genocide. It passed our committee with an  unanimous bipartisan voice vote.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 4989, the Protecting Diplomats from  Surveillance Through Consumer Devices Act. This bill, again, passed our  committee by unanimous, bipartisan voice vote.   I want to begin by thanking Mr. Castro, and also others, for  introducing this legislation. I am pleased to be one of the cosponsors.   This bill aims to ensure the Department of State has policies in  place to prevent our adversaries from tracking the locations of our  Foreign Service officers through their electronic devices.   From fitness trackers, to smartwatches, to phones, most of us have at  least one device that could be used to track us with the right  technology that has GPS capacities. Many of us would literally be lost  without these devices, but they could pose a security risk. This is  especially true for our diplomats overseas whose locations and travels  can reveal sensitive information sources. Location information is a  potential gold mine to our adversaries.   This commonsense measure would make sure that the Secretary of State  has a policy in place on the safe use of consumer electronic devices by  our diplomatic and consular facilities and personnel. It would require  proper training for employees and contractors, and ensure that the  policy is coordinated across all parts of our government that use our  diplomatic and consular facilities.   This bill would also improve congressional oversight of this policy.   This bill will reduce the security risks associated with GPS devices  and other consumer electronic device.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Castro), the author of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 4989 is commonsense legislation that will improve the safety of  U.S. personnel overseas. I want to commend the chair and the ranking  member for bringing this through our committee, and commend Mr. Castro  of Texas and Mr. McCaul of Texas for their hard work in creating this  legislation.   This bill will ensure that the State Department is addressing the  risks associated with consumer devices that can be used, in some cases,  to track the locations of those who own them.   This bill passed with a unanimous, bipartisan voice vote in our  committee. I commend it to my colleagues. I will support this measure.  I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5105.   H.R. 5105, the BUILD Act, which stands for Better Utilization of  Investments Leading to Development Act, modernizes our international  development finance system. It does so by consolidating the existing  Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which has the most unfortunate  acronym in the Federal Government, since it is referred to as OPIC and  is often confused with OPEC. It consolidates that organization into the  new Development Finance Corporation.   I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this important measure.   I want to start by commending the lead sponsors of this bipartisan  bill, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), whom I am pleased to work  with on the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee, where he serves as  chairman and I serve as ranking member; and the second lead sponsor of  this legislation, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith), the  ranking member of the Armed Services Committee.   It has been more than a decade since Congress last updated OPIC's  charter. The landscape in development finance has changed  substantially, and we now need a new approach to the way our government  uses financial instruments to spur economic development and tackle  poverty in the developing world.   Mr. Speaker, I particularly want to thank the leadership of the  committee and the sponsors of the legislation for accepting four of my  amendments.   The first of these requires a certification from the new DFC, or  Development Finance Corporation, that the corporations that benefit  from their investment and their affiliates do not conduct any activity  which is the subject of U.S. sanctions. This is an important safeguard  to ensure that entities that engage in contact that violates U.S.  Government sanctions do not benefit from U.S. Government financing.   Simply prohibiting the support of sanctioned entities is not enough.  We need an affirmative statement from prospective beneficiaries of the  DFC that they and their affiliates are in compliance with American  sanctions law.   Second, the new agency will need to consider whether the benefiting  entity is participating in a foreign boycott that is at cross-purposes  with American foreign policy. The U.S. should not be in the business of  providing assistance to entities that participate in discriminatory  boycotts against foreign countries.   Since the 1970s, we have had on the books laws designed to prevent  our corporations from participating in the Arab League boycott of  Israel. It is common sense that the DFC, when it is selecting projects,  should take this into consideration. So my amendment will do just that.   I should point out that there is another amendment that I would have  offered, but, instead, we secured a letter from OPIC that will be  binding policy on the new DFC stating that the DFC will not finance  regional projects in the Caucasus that are designed to exclude Armenia.  If it doesn't make geographic sense that a regional railroad or road or  other activity excludes Armenia, then that is OPIC policy that will be  carried forward with the new agency that this will not be financed by  the DFC.   Mr. Speaker, I include the following letters from OPIC in the Record.                                                    Overseas Private                                          Investment Corporation,                                        Washington, DC, May 8, 2018.      Hon. Brad Sherman,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Sherman: Thank you for your continued       support of U.S. development finance, including your support       for H.R. 5105, the BUILD Act. Knowing of your long-standing       support for Armenia, I wanted to clarify an issue raised by       your office in writing.        The Overseas Private Investment Corporation will not       support regional projects in the Caucasus that deliberately,       by design or effect, exclude Armenia from participation or       benefit, unless such exclusion is necessitated by geographic       or economic impracticality. As you know, when the BUILD Act       legislation is enacted into law, the functions, personnel,       assets, liabilities and policies of OPIC will transfer to the       U.S. Development Finance Corporation. Accordingly, this will       become the policy of the DFC.        Again, thank you for your continued support.            Regards,                                                 Cameron S. Alford,      Deputy General Counsel, Projects.                                   ____                                                    Overseas Private                                          Investment Corporation,                                        Washington, DC, May 8, 2018.      Hon, Brad Sherman,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Sherman: Thank you for your continued       support of U.S. development finance, including your support       for H.R. 5105, the BUILD Act. I wanted to clarify an issue       raised by your office in writing.        The Overseas Private Investment Corporation's Environmental       and Social Policy Statement (ESPS) includes OPIC's greenhouse       gas policy developed pursuant to Section 7079(b) of division       F of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 (Public Law       111-117; 123 Stat. 3396). As a result of the inclusion of the       word ``policies'' in Section 606(a)(2) of the BUILD Act       Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute, OPIC's ESPS will be       transferred to the U.S. Development Finance Corporation.       Accordingly, this will become the policy of the DFC.        Again, thank you for your continued support.            Regards,                                                 Cameron S. Alford,                                  Deputy General Counsel, Projects.     Mr. Speaker, the third amendment that I thank the  sponsors for agreeing to requires an annual report from the new DFC on  its compliance with its own human rights, labor, environmental, and  social policies.   OPIC maintains robust environmental and social policies. This bill  carries those policies forward so the new DFC will follow them and will  now make an annual report so that Congress can see whether these  policies are actually being implemented.   The fourth such amendment states that, as to the four public  nongovernmental members of the DFC board, that we take into account  their experience in international environmental, developmental, and  labor organizations. There are a number of other factors that go into  selecting the public members of the board, but certainly experience in  the environment and labor ought to be taken into consideration.   The BUILD Act updates U.S. development finance and, I think, will  complement our foreign assistance efforts. With this bill, we can keep  the U.S. as a global leader in promoting economic prosperity around the  world while, at the same time, encouraging American jobs.   I support this measure and hope my colleagues will join me in doing  so. Once again, this bill had a unanimous, bipartisan voice vote in our  committee.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Smith), the ranking member of the Armed Services  Committee and the lead Democratic sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to commend the sponsors  of this legislation and the leadership of our committee. I urge an  ``aye'' vote,  [[Page H6333]]  and I point out that this bill received a unanimous bipartisan voice  vote in our committee, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this measure, H.R. 5480, the  Women's Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act. I want to thank  Mr. Royce and Ms. Lois Frankel for their work on this bill.   This is an important bill that expands U.S. development policy to  empower women entrepreneurs in developing countries. In 2016, the  McKinsey Global Institute estimated that achieving global gender parity  in economic activity could add as much as $28 trillion to the annual  gross domestic product by the year 2025.   This bill will help unlock the productive power of women, and  particularly women-owned small- and medium-sized enterprises. In the  interest of time, I won't go into the details because we have excellent  speakers on both sides of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this bill, which passed our  committee by a unanimous bipartisan voice vote, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Frankel), the lead Democratic sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Nevada (Ms. Titus).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I invite my colleagues to join me in  supporting this bill.   Women and girls around the world must be included in and empowered by  ongoing U.S. investments in diplomacy, development, and security. The  Women's Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act requires USAID to  address gender-specific challenges across the world, and it expands  support for small- and medium-sized enterprises that are owned,  managed, and controlled by women. It also explicitly establishes that  it is our national policy to support the empowerment of women  worldwide.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill, which passed our committee  by unanimous, bipartisan voice vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
