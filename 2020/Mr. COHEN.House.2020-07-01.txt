 Mr. Speaker, on Saturday we will celebrate the  Independence Day of our country. In our Chamber we have photographs of  Lafayette and George Washington. In the preamble of the Declaration of  Independence, it reads: ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that  all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with  certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness.''   Unfortunately, those words were not complete because African  Americans were not considered men, and they were not given the  unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We  are still pursuing that. We did it with the George Floyd Justice in  Policing Act, and we are doing it in other ways with opportunities for  African Americans.   And as we said in the founding of our country, that we are becoming a  more perfect union, and we continue to do that today; to see to it that  all men and women have certain inalienable rights, life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness.   Hopefully, we will remember that on Saturday, and remember that the  reason why we cut ourselves off from King George is because we wanted  to be a Nation of a rule of laws and not a Nation of a rule of man.  That was worth people signing the Declaration, putting their lives at  risk, and founding the United States of America.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2 that  Chairman DeFazio has helped craft and the en bloc amendment which is  being discussed now.   Transportation is Memphis. Memphis is blessed to be on the banks of  the greatest river in our country, the Mississippi, and fortunate to  have Fred Smith born there, which brought the greatest air cargo  company in the world to Memphis, Federal Express. That is our number  one employer.   This bill will help airports, investments in airports, and create  jobs, helping FedEx and helping Memphis. It will invest in harbors--we  have the fifth largest inland harbor in the country--with dredging.  That is important for the Port of Memphis.   We have five Class 1 railroads, and there are investments there, and  that produces jobs and moves goods and services.   We have two interstate systems and roads that need improvement. This  bill will put money into roads and bridges and create those jobs.   It will further put money into broadband, which it is very important  to reach into the inner cities to give an opportunity for young people,  African Americans in particular, to get access to the internet and all  the information that they need to have a good education and a good  livelihood later on.   This bill includes several priorities that I have had, including a  DUI law that is part of this en bloc amendment that will see to it that  there is a study on why DUI convictions aren't shared by States so that  people who have multiple DUIs will be punished accordingly and save  innocent potential victims from the carnage of a DUI accident.  [[Page H3009]]    It happened in Mississippi. A young Memphis girl was killed by a  multiple offender, but nobody knew they were a multiple offender  because their convictions were not submitted to a central base.   This also incorporates the Complete Streets Act that makes our  planning more in keeping with the 21st century for pedestrians and  bicyclers and others who use our roads in alternative ways.   This is an excellent bill. I am proud to support it. It creates jobs.  It is good for Memphis. It is good for America.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio. There is no more important  bill than this.
