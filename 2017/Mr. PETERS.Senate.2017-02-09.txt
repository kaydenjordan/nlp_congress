 Madam President, I rise in defense of Michigan seniors  and working families and to speak on the nomination of Representative  Tom Price to be Secretary of Health and Human Services. As a Member of  this body, it is my duty to only support a nominee for this position if  I trust that he or she will put the health and wellness of American  families first.   Representative Price has failed to convince me that he will do this.  As a doctor, he should be familiar with the Hippocratic Oath. Reciting  this oath is a rite of passage for our physicians and our Nation and  across the globe. While it is known most widely for its overarching  message of ``do no harm,'' I wish to recite a passage from the modern  version of the Hippocratic Oath that should resonate with all of us. It  reads:         I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart--a       cancerous growth--but a sick human being--whose illness may       affect the person's family and economic stability. My       responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to       care adequately for the sick.    We should all heed these words. Health care is deeply personal. Some  of the most important decisions Americans will ever make will be with  the advice of their loved ones and their doctor.   Health care affects our families and the economic stability of our  families. Quality, affordable health care can literally be the  difference between life and death. A Medicare system that works for  seniors can be the difference between a retirement with dignity and  having to spend their golden years in poverty.   When it comes to our Nation's seniors, Congressman Price has crafted  extremely dangerous proposals that would end Medicare as we know it. He  has introduced legislation that would turn Medicare into a voucher  system, increase the eligibility age for seniors to enroll in the  program, and lead to increased drug costs.   Our Nation's seniors worked hard their entire lives and they deserve  a dignified retirement--not higher drug costs or a voucher that could  be worth less each and every year, putting a significant strain on  their fixed budget. We must honor our promises to current and future  retirees by refusing to confirm any HHS nominee who is not fully  committed to protecting our seniors and ensuring they have the health  care they need. We need a Secretary who wakes up every morning thinking  about how to provide the best care possible to as many Americans as  possible and as affordably as possible.   I am concerned that Representative Price sees our health care system  as a profit center, a profit center for special interests and a profit  center for himself. He has proposed dangerous plans to end critical  investments that make our health care system better so he can give  large tax breaks to some of his wealthy friends.   The American people should be confident that the men and women  leading Federal agencies are thinking about the bottom line of  taxpayers and not themselves. We must be faithful stewards of taxpayer  dollars. I wish to remind my colleagues that Medicare and Medicaid  spend far less on overhead and operations than private insurance.   I would also like to remind my colleagues that the Republican budget  plan that includes repealing the Affordable Care Act would increase our  national debt by upward of $9 trillion over the next decade. Yes, that  is trillion with a ``t.'' We must continue efforts to cut waste and  inefficiencies across the Federal Government, especially in health  care. Increasing efficiencies allows us to invest in what works.   Medicare and Social Security are two of the most popular Federal  programs ever created, and they are popular for a reason. They work.  They work for seniors, they work for the disabled, they work for  orphans, and we should too.   When I hear from Representative Price that he wants to fundamentally  change Medicare and Medicaid and implement health care reforms that  will limit care for American families, this is something I cannot and  will never support.   Representative Price has introduced proposals to cut over $1 trillion  from Medicaid that will jeopardize care for millions of low-income  working Americans, senior citizens that require long-term care in  nursing homes and individuals with disabilities. This is not a vision  of America that I see, and it is not one I can possibly support.   We need to find a bipartisan path forward. We need to invest in  prevention, increased efficiencies, embrace technologies like  telemedicine, and capture the full potential of promising medical  research, like precision medicine, to yield better care and at lower  costs. We need to make it easier for small business owners who want to  do right by their employees to provide them with coverage. We can  strengthen our health care system without cutting the quality of care  by investing in commonsense changes to save money. For example,  Medicare spends $1 out of every $3 on diabetes treatment. While the  total economic cost of diabetes is estimated to be $245 billion per  year, I have  [[Page S991]]  introduced bipartisan legislation that allows Medicare to enroll  individuals at risk for developing diabetes into medical nutrition  therapy services proven to decrease the likelihood they will develop  diabetes.   I have also introduced bipartisan legislation that expands Medicare's  use of telemedicine, increasing access for patients in rural and  underserved communities, and bringing down future health care costs by  ensuring patients get the preventive care they need to stay healthy.   Instead of focusing on these critical challenges or sensible  solutions, Representative Price wants to move us backward and push  policies that could leave 30 million Americans without health  insurance.   We can't look at this as simple budgetary math, we are talking about  30 million of our friends, family members, and neighbors, including  over 800,000 Michiganders--Michiganders who could once again face  bankruptcy and loss of their economic security just because they get  sick.   We live in a nation where historically the No. 1 cause of personal  bankruptcy has been medical debt. That is simply unacceptable in this  great country of ours. Whether we are policymakers or physicians, we  should adhere to the central tenet of the Hippocratic Oath of ``do no  harm.''   Our Nation's seniors, children, and all hard-working Americans  deserve a Secretary of Health and Human Services who will, at the very  least, do no harm. Representative Price is not that person.   It is for this reason that I have decided I will vote against his  nomination for the Secretary of Health and Human Services. I urge all  of my colleagues to do the same.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.
