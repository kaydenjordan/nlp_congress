 Mr. Speaker, this weekend, I was  grateful to participate in the U.S. delegation to the NATO  Parliamentary Assembly Spring Session in Luxembourg led by Intelligence  Committee Chairman  Mike Turner with former Assembly President Gerry  Connolly.   U.S. Ambassador Tom Barrett and our Luxembourg hosts were incredible,  providing a heartfelt welcome by President of the Chamber of Deputies  Fernand Etgen with the enthusiastic Ambassador to the United States,  Nicole Bintner. The Minister of Defense Francois Bausch indicated that  the budget for defense is being doubled in the great country of  Luxembourg.   Prime Minister Xavier Bettel hosted breakfast today for the  delegation, and he cited the Luxembourg appreciation of America that  will never be forgotten for the thousands of Americans who died  fighting for their liberation in 1944.   The closing resolution approved today reaffirmed unwavering support  for Ukraine's democracy and territorial integrity and holds accountable  the Russian regime for its war crimes. He also denounced the ideology  and practice of ruscism, defining Putin fascism.   On our departure, we had the leadership of Congresswoman Ann Wagner,  former Ambassador to Luxembourg, to lay a wreath at the historic  Luxembourg American Cemetery.   Our sympathy to the family of the beloved Mary Dozier Lee Ellsworth  of Lexington.  [[Page H2485]]                                ____________________
