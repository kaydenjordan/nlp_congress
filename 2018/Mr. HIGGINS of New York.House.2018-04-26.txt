 Mr. Speaker, the House will vote tomorrow to  reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration.   In 2010, Congress approved landmark flight safety legislation after  flight 3407 crashed outside of Buffalo, New York, in 2009. The National  Transportation Safety Board concluded that pilot error was the cause of  that tragedy.   The bill the House will vote on tomorrow must uphold and reaffirm our  commitment to those safety standards. The Southwest Airlines emergency  landing 2 weeks ago is an urgent and inspiring reminder of the  importance of pilot training to keep the flying public safe.   The Southwest pilot, Tammie Jo Shults, piloted that plane to a safe  landing in a calm, controlled, and competent manner borne out of one  thing: excellent pilot training.                            ____________________
