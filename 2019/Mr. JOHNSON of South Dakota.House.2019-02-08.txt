 Mr. Speaker, in South Dakota, we take  great pride in our girls high school basketball, due to the incredible  hard work of so many players and coaches.   One of those hardworking coaches is Dawn Seiler, who has been  coaching the Aberdeen Central Golden Eagles for 20 years. Before that,  she coached the McIntosh Tigers for 15 years   Under Coach Seiler, the Golden Eagles of Aberdeen have made it to 18  State tournaments. And after her 596th career victory, she is the all- time winningest coach in girls high school basketball history in the  great State of South Dakota.   Coach Seiler has inspired generations of talented young women to do  their best, both on and, more importantly, off the court.   Aberdeen is proud of their coach, and they should be.   Coach Seiler, congratulations on your historic accomplishment.                            ____________________
