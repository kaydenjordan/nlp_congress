 Mr. Speaker, on December 21, 2019, the Galena  Park ISD's North Shore Senior High School football team became back-to- back State football champions.   It was a hard-fought win, but they won because they worked together  as a team displaying much heart and grit on the field. This win was the  culmination of an entire year's worth of practice and hard work under  the leadership of Coach Kay.   They took nothing for granted and showed the entire State that with  hard work and determination, anything is possible. The North Shore  Senior High School football team made all of the North Shore Mustangs  and the Galena Park ISD community very, very proud.   As their Congresswoman, I was not there, but I was watching from afar  cheering them on, and I am so happy to share their achievement with all  of Congress on this floor of the House of Representatives.   Congratulations for an amazing win. I know we can do it again, and we  will make it a three-peat.                            ____________________
