 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise in support of Judge Ketanji Brown  Jackson's confirmation to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court  of the United States and look forward to proudly voting for her  confirmation.   There are few constitutional duties more important in my role as a  U.S. Senator than providing the advice and consent on judicial  nominations, and this is especially true for the Supreme Court.   As we consider Judge Jackson's nomination before this body, we are on  the cusp of a historic, barrier-breaking moment and on the verge of  confirming the first African-American woman to serve on the Supreme  Court.   This is not only a significant milestone, but a moment to recognize  Judge Jackson, who is one of our Nation's brightest legal minds and an  incredibly impressive nominee.   Before I talk about Judge Jackson's exceptional experience, her  qualifications, and support from all across the legal spectrum, I think  it is important to reflect on the critical importance of our Nation's  highest Court.   Without question, Supreme Court rulings have a direct and a  consequential impact on the lives of Michiganders and all Americans.  Issues before the Court include healthcare, women's reproductive  rights, workers' rights, environmental protections, voting rights, and  many life-or-death decisions that shape the law of the land.   Simply put, the Supreme Court is often the last line of defense for  everyday Americans and an important guardian of the Constitution  itself.   There is no question that a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court  is a tremendous responsibility, and we must have qualified, committed  Justices who will exercise judicial independence--follow the facts--and  apply law and precedent fairly and impartially, without regard for  their own personal views, partisanship, or politics.   It is clear that on every single measure, Judge Jackson has the  credentials, the qualities, the work ethic, and character needed to  serve on the Supreme Court. And she will not only bring diversity but a  unique life perspective and passion for the law that she developed at a  very young age.   Judge Jackson's interest in the law actually started as a  preschooler, sitting next to her father while he studied cases for law  school, while she worked on her coloring book.   Despite being ambitious and a star student, growing up, Judge Jackson  faced resistance. When Judge Jackson told her high school guidance  counselor that she was interested in attending Harvard University, the  counselor told her that maybe she should set her sights lower than  that.   Judge Jackson was not going to be deterred, and she credits her high  school debate coach for introducing her to several colleges. And then  she went on to graduate magna cum laude from Harvard as an  undergraduate and cum laude from Harvard Law School.   This was the beginning of Judge Jackson's distinguished legal career.  She clerked for three Federal judges, including Supreme Court Justice  Breyer, worked in private practice at prestigious law firms, and has  served on the Federal bench on both the district court and the court of  appeals, a position she was confirmed to just last year by bipartisan  support by this very Senate.   Judge Jackson's experience has also been shaped by representing  everyday Americans and hearing their cases. She will be the first  Justice who previously served as a Federal public defender, and the  only Justice who has served as a member of the bipartisan U.S.  Sentencing Commission. She will also bring considerable criminal law  experience to the Court.   Her breadth of experience, her record, and temperament were on full  display during her Senate judiciary confirmation hearing. Over the  course of 24 hours and more than 600 questions, Judge Jackson not only  demonstrated why she is qualified to serve on the Supreme Court but  also why she was unflappable, even when she faced outrageous-- absolutely outrageous--false attacks on her record during the committee  hearings.   During this process, Judge Jackson has not only earned bipartisan  support for her confirmation but has the backing of diverse voices,  including from the American Bar Association, which unanimously gave her  its highest rating of ``well qualified.''   Lawyers across the political spectrum, civil rights organization, law  enforcement groups, and chambers of commerce have all offered not just  support but glowing support for her nomination.   Former George H. W. Bush's appointed Fourth Circuit Judge Michael  Luttig called Judge Jackson ``eminently qualified'' and ``as highly  credentialed and experienced in the law as any nominee in history.''   Two dozen conservative and former Republican-appointed officials  said:         We are united in our view that she is exceptionally well-      qualified, given her breadth of experience, her demonstrated       ability, and personal attributes of intellect and character.       We think that her confirmation on a consensus basis would       strengthen the court and the nation in important ways.    And the International Association of Chiefs of Police said:         During her time as judge, she has displayed her dedication       to ensuring that our communities are safe and that the       interest[s] of justice are served. [We believe that] Judge       Jackson's years of experience have shown [that] she has the       temperament and qualifications to serve as the next Associate       Justice of the United States Supreme Court.    After my one-on-one meeting with Judge Jackson last week, I was  convinced that she is extraordinarily qualified and prepared to serve  on the Supreme Court, particularly at this challenging moment.   This is, without question, a challenging time, not only for the  Supreme  [[Page S2012]]  Court but also for our democracy, and it is clear that Judge Jackson  has the extensive experience and qualifications and temperament and  impartiality and fidelity to the law that will undoubtedly serve our  Nation exceptionally well.   I am proud to support Judge Jackson as our next Supreme Court  Justice, and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in making history.   I yield the floor.
