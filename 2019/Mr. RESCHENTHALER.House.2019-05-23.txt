 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize the 100th  anniversary of the passing of the 19th Amendment in the U.S. House of  Representatives.   One hundred years ago this week, right here on the House floor,  Members began the process to recognize women's right to vote.   Pennsylvania, my home State, became the seventh State to ratify the  Amendment, only 20 days after it passed the U.S. Senate.   One hundred years later, we honor the idea that our democracy works  best when everyone participates.   One hundred years later, we recognize those who devoted their lives  to  [[Page H4150]]  this worthy cause, such as Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton,  and Ida B. Wells.   We all have different perspectives, and by engaging with each other,  we can develop the best policies to benefit all Americans and all  freedom-loving people around the world.                            ____________________
