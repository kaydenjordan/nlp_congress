 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.J. Res. 39.   We are here today because the Biden administration is hell-bent on  making the United States energy dependent upon China. They are hell- bent on signing this Nation's death warrant. In pursuit of everything  green, the Biden administration has given a free pass for Chinese solar  imports to flow into this country by all means, using an emergency  proclamation.   The last time a President used an emergency proclamation was for  lumber in 1946 when American World War II veterans were returning home  and needed homes.   Today, Mr. Biden, or whoever is running the White House, is using it  to waive tariffs on Chinese solar panels coming through Cambodia,  Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam for 2 years.   Helping war heroes is an emergency, but speeding up total dependence  on our greatest adversary is another. It is an absolute abuse of  executive power. It is helping our greatest adversary take control of  this country.   Why on God's green Earth are we handing this Nation's keys to the  nation of China?   Chinese producers and the CCP are taking advantage of this system to  circumnavigate the tariffs. They are cheating. Don't just take my word.  Take the President's own Department of Commerce who determined that  this would happen, even before President Biden did his emergency  proclamation.   This is simply un-American and a crystal clear abuse of emergency  power by this American President.   We need to prioritize American manufacturing, not Chinese  manufacturing. We need to produce the energy here in the United States,  not handing this to China, our greatest adversary.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, H.J. Res. 39.
