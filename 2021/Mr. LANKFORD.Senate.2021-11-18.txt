 Mr. President, on September 9, President Biden told the  American people that he was losing patience with them and they needed  to get vaccinated right now. He laid down a series of Executive orders  on Federal employees, on Federal contractors, on companies that had-- individuals that had 100 employees or more, on individuals that worked  in any healthcare-related, anything that dealt with Medicare or  Medicaid. It reached out to millions of people.   He set a date that was within 3 months, knowing full well it would  take months to actually write the rule and it would create chaos across  the country as everyone tried to figure out how to do this mandate.   I fully believe that was the purpose of setting a close deadline; it  was because it would have that much chaos in the country dealing with  the vaccine mandates. Well, mission accomplished. It has created chaos  across our economy and across lots of families.   What is the situation right now in America dealing with COVID?   We are on the backside of our second peak. We have seen hundreds of  thousands of people lose their lives to COVID. We have seen hospitals  fill, get back to order; fill again, get back to order.   But in the meantime, three vaccines have been developed, multiple  different treatments have been developed, a multitude of tests have  been developed, which has been the primary issue that we have every  year with the flu.   We don't panic every year on the flu because we have testing. We have  treatment. We have vaccines. We now have, for COVID, testing,  treatments, and vaccines. It becomes much more manageable.   In the meantime, right at 80 percent of all Americans who are 12  years old or over have already had at least one dose of one of the  vaccines.   Let me run that past you again: 80 percent of Americans have had at  least one dose of one of the three vaccines, of those 12 years old or  older.   About 45 million Americans have recovered from COVID; had it, tested  positive, and have recovered. The vast majority of Americans, by far-- like, not even close--the vast majority of Americans have been  vaccinated or have recovered from COVID or both.   But is the administration OK with that?   No, they are not. The administration has laid down their own law to  say, if Americans do not get the vaccine--those 20 percent left that  haven't gotten the vaccine that are 12 years old or older, if they  don't get the vaccine, this administration is going to find some way  for them to lose their job; which, for many people, will also mean lose  their insurance; lose their pension; and, sometimes, lose their home.   But the President's response is: I don't care. Go get the shot. That  is what I want you to do.   Well, Mr. President, mission accomplished.   Let me tell you a story of an individual that works in the eastern  part of my State, who works for one of those companies that is 100  people or more. He didn't want to have the vaccine. The reason is not  even important, but he said he didn't want to take the vaccine. So what  happened in his company of 100 or more? They fired him a couple of  weeks ago.   You are welcome, Mr. President. Thanks for firing him.   Oh, it gets better. He lost his house because he couldn't pay the  mortgage, and this adult man has now moved in with his family while he  tries to figure out what happens next for him.   Do you know why?   Because the President said he was losing patience and he didn't care  if this guy lost his house, lost his job, lost his insurance. The  President was just saying, go get it, or else.   Well, thanks. Right before Thanksgiving, he is experiencing the ``or  else.''   One of my constituent's husband is facing termination. He is from  another one of those large companies. He has worked for them for 30  years. He has a  [[Page S8427]]  secret clearance from the DOD. And his doctor gave him an exemption  because his cardiac numbers fluctuate so much. And he is one of those  high-risk individuals for blood clots, which can be a side effect of  the vaccines. So his doctor has encouraged him not to take the vaccine.   So he went into his job. He asked for the medical exemption, and he  was given two forms to sign. The first of the forms said he had to  agree to take the vaccination or he would lose his job. The second form  agreed that, if he took the vaccination, he would not sue the company  if he had a negative reaction.   So here is a man who has to choose between taking the vaccine,  knowing that his doctor has told him not to do it, and if he does take  it, if he has a negative reaction, the company wants to be held  harmless for it. And he has to sign a document saying the company will  be held harmless for it or lose his job.   Do you know why?   Because President Biden said he was losing patience.   So this family gets to sit around over Thanksgiving not talking about  football but talking about whether he is going to lose his job or  possibly have a blood clot in the hospital.   Which would you like to have that conversation on over Thanksgiving?   There is a company that does electrical engineering that also has one  of those Federal contracts they talk about. Some of the employees don't  do the Federal contracting. They work for other issues. Fifty people of  the 250 in the company have said they don't want to take the vaccine,  and so they are in the process of losing their jobs. And that company  will not be able to fulfill its Federal contract because hiring 50 more  electricians is not that simple right now with the economy that we are  currently in.   A constituent told us that her employer is going to lay her off on  December 8 because she hasn't had the vaccine yet. So she will spend  Thanksgiving discussing this with her family as she approaches the time  where she is about to be laid off. She works in one of those companies  that has a Federal contract. She reached out to her primary care  doctor, who is at the VA, by the way, and the VA instructed her that  they are not writing exemptions for medical exemptions.   She is on her own.   Why?   Because the President is losing patience, and he has decided he is  going to throw all of these families in chaos or they are going to lose  their job, because he said so.   Why have I been fighting this mandate since September 9 when the  President actually announced it?   Because it was obvious to me what was coming. It was this.   Everyone could see it, apparently, but the White House. Americans are  stubborn people. That is what has made us the most prosperous, freest  people in the world. We are entrepreneurs. We take risks. We understand  the consequences for our risks. But we also go do because we can; we  are Americans.   And now the President of the United States has announced: I don't  care; you are going to get this, or else.   So what is the real effect of this? All of this chaos?   Oh, this is just part of it. There is a whole lot more.   How about the EMS folks that are in rural Oklahoma, that are having a  hard time actually keeping some of their drivers and folks in because  they have chosen not to take the vaccine?   What happens in 3 weeks from now when people get sick at their house  or have a heart attack and EMS can't respond because those folks got  fired from their jobs because the President said, I am losing patience?  What happens?   I will tell you what happens. People die. Other families are going to  struggle through this process as they are figuring out where they are  going to go to work because they lost their career, because the  President said: I have lost patience with you.   Tell me this: For the person that is the JAG officer in the military,  works in the National Guard, and for whatever reason--whether it is a  religious accommodation, medical accommodation, or whatever it might  be--they chose not to take this vaccine, when they get a dishonorable  discharge, what happens to them?   They lose their law license is what happens to them. They are  disbarred, and they are no longer practicing their profession.   What happens to the State trooper in Oklahoma that also serves on our  National Guard?   When they get dishonorably discharged, they don't just lose their  military career; they lose their civilian career.   What happens to the nurse or doctor that serves with the National  Guard? When they get drummed out, what happens?   They lose their military career and their civilian career. That is  what happens.   Do you know why?   Because the President decided he was losing patience with the  American people and they have to do what he says to do, not what they  want to do. That is why all this chaos is happening.   I heard from a constituent, 28 years of Federal service--28 years of  Federal service. I am not going to give the administration that they  work in, but they work behind the scenes in an exceptionally important,  exceptionally difficult task--serving their neighbors as a Federal  employee. She doesn't want to retire, but she doesn't want to take this  vaccine either.   So do you know what she is doing?   She is retiring.   And what is going to happen in this agency in Oklahoma when they lose  this cornerstone person at this Agency?   They will struggle to figure out what she did, how she did it. And  people in Oklahoma will get less help in that Agency because a long- term, vital civil servant is about to get run out of civil service  because President Biden decided he lost patience with her.   That wasn't in her civil service contract. That was never negotiated  with any other collective bargaining rights agreements, never. There is  no addition in any collective bargaining rights agreements for Federal  employees that they have to get a vaccine mandate if the President  decides that they do, but he decided--that is, President Biden  decided--he was going to take this on.   And so she is going to be discussing over Thanksgiving what she is  going to do post-retirement, wishing that she could stay a little  longer to be able to build up a few more years, and thought she was  going to be able to, but, instead, she got ran out because she and the  President had a difference of opinion about a brandnew vaccine.   Now, I have said to this group before several times--and I will say  it again--I have had the vaccine. I encourage others to take the  vaccine. Eighty percent of Americans who are 12 years old or older have  had the vaccine.   There are plenty of Americans who have had the vaccine who support  the vaccine but do not want their next door neighbor to get fired  because they disagree on the vaccine. In fact, I don't know a lot of  people who do, though I have met some that are just that heartless to  be able to say: I don't care what you think. I want to feel better  forcing you to go get the vaccine.   I have met some of those folks, but I don't meet many of them. Most  of them say: I freely made the decision; they should be able to freely  make the decision, as well.   But apparently that is not where the President is and, unfortunately,  that is not where some of my Democratic colleagues are because multiple  times we have brought an end to the vaccine mandates to multiple  committees in multiple places over the last several months and it gets  knocked down every time.   Just this week, we filed a Congressional Review Act dealing with just  the OSHA piece. We have another one coming dealing with all those on  CMS to make a simple statement: We have got to stop this vaccine  mandate. It is causing chaos in our families. It is causing chaos in  our economy, and anyone who doesn't think it is is not talking to  people at home.   So we will bring this in the next 18 days to the floor of this  Senate, and we will force a vote on it and put everyone on record: Do  you stand with the American people, who strongly affirm the vaccine but  strongly oppose the mandate, or will you be one to say: I don't care. I  stand with the President. I am losing patience with people, this 20  percent that haven't done the vaccine. I  [[Page S8428]]  am losing patience with them, and I am just going to force them to do  it, as well--because that decision is coming to every single person in  this body.   This could be turned off right now, and one section of it already is  turned off. The Fifth Circuit Court reached in on the issue of private  employers and said that this was way overly broad of the President. No  kidding. It was unconstitutional for the President to reach into  companies and to say: I don't care who it is, how important they are to  the company. If you don't make them do the vaccine, you have to fire  them.   The Fifth Circuit said you cannot do that. Thank you, Fifth Circuit,  for finally joining in on that.   OSHA has now said that they are not going to enforce that, but there  are lots of other companies that have done it anyway. And, I will tell  you, for this individual in Eastern Oklahoma who has already been fired  and lost his house, it is too late for him for suddenly the Biden team  to say: Just kidding. We are going to pull that back. His life has  already been wrecked by you.   What else is happening? I have reached out to multiple different  Agencies to be able to talk this through. It has been fascinating to  me, when I have talked to different Agencies. By the way, the Federal  Agency mandate for all Federal employees is next week to be able to  have that done. But when I talk to leaders of Agencies of multiple  different Departments across this town, none of them seem to know how  many of their employees have actually been vaccinated yet--none of  them. They all say: Well, we think it is quite a few.   I say: How many folks have not been vaccinated?   We have x number of folks who have been reported to us, but they  don't seem to know. It has become chaotic.   For Federal workers, their unions have finally stepped in--finally. I  have been shocked at how slow the Federal unions were to this. They  finally stepped up and asked for an extension of the President to say:  Don't put the mandate down for next week. Give people more time  because, literally, people are sitting around over Thanksgiving  deciding whether they are going to keep their job or not.   And if 10 to 20 percent of the workforce across the Federal workforce  leaves, we are in such chaos that there is no way we will be able to  finish serving people as we desperately need to be able to do across  the Federal Government.   What would I recommend? I had some very frank conversations with the  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or the EEOC. It was  interesting to me, when I visited with the EEOC. That is the group that  protects workers--Federal workers or private--from discrimination and  protects workers from inappropriate termination. When I talk to the  EEOC, what I hear from them is that they weren't consulted through the  process of developing this new vaccine mandate and all the exemptions  that should be in place.   Can I just tell the workers of my State and the workers across the  country a simple thing? If your employer will not accept your religious  accommodation that you put in or your medical exemption that you put  in--if they do not accept those--you need to go to the EEOC and file a  complaint because the EEOC has rules about terminations that are  inappropriate terminations. If individuals are being terminated from  private companies, even if they are Federal contractors or Federal  employees, I encourage you to go to the EEOC and file a complaint if  they are not hearing your medical accommodation or your religious  accommodation. That is your right as an American.   When the President of the United States is running over your rights,  you have every right to be able to appeal that personally. You don't  have to hire an attorney. You can file that complaint on your own to be  able to make sure that your employer knows that you are filing an EEOC  complaint against them for inappropriate termination, for not accepting  your medical exemption and your religious accommodation.   Interestingly enough, when I approached the Office of Management and  Budget a month ago about how they are going to handle religious  accommodation, they said: It is not the business of Federal workers to  decide and individuals' faith. We are just going to accept that.   But when the document came out, there was a six-part test of whether  you are religious enough to be able to turn down the vaccine. They  literally created a six-part test that every supervisor can go through  and check to determine if you are religious enough to be able to turn  this down.   This would be the first time that I know of that the Federal  Government has actually reached into an entity, to individuals, and  said: We are going to decide for you how religious you are.   That is how crazy this has become.   I encourage you, again, if individuals have said that you are not  religious enough to be able to ask for this accommodation, go to the  EEOC, file a complaint against your employer--whether that be a Federal  Agency, whether that be a private entity--and make sure that they are  well aware of what is going on.   If you work in a Federal Agency and you have an initial appeals  process that actually goes through, go through that. Go through that  process. But if you are denied or not heard, you do have rights as an  American, and I would encourage you to be able to stand up for your  rights as an American against unjust hiring and unjust firing in this  process.   Let me read this last letter to you. As we have fought through this  process and find every leverage point I can find for the people in my  State to be able to make their own decisions, it has been difficult to  be able to talk to people in the struggles that they have.   Let me read one. This gentleman wrote to me:         I retired after 20 years of Active-Duty service in the       military to enjoy time with my family and the supreme       blessings of freedom and peace our country has secured at the       expense beyond human measure. Now, many of our undaunted       servicemembers and veterans alike face possible unemployment       because we refuse to take a vaccine. Some are being coerced       into taking it because they can't support their families       while unemployed. The very people who risked their lives and       the well-being of their children face persecution for a       personal medical choice.    His comment to me: This is not American.   I agree. That is why we are fighting this. That is why we are  continuing to push this. That is why we are bringing a Congressional  Review Act up to put every single person in this body on record: Do you  support forcing people to take a vaccine or be fired, or not?   I do not, and I hope that 99 other of my colleagues also do not.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I object.    Madam President, in reserving the right to object, this  is an astounding thing. This is a conversation that has happened today  about amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act.   Now, I haven't been here very long, but, typically, an NDAA takes  about 2 weeks on the floor to be able to process, and there is a lot of  conversation about different amendments. There are managers' packages;  there are big groupings of packages that come together that are  noncontroversial; and there will be a series of votes that are side by  side with other votes. It has already been set up for 20 votes. That is  terrific. That is a great start.   Then there is a request for some other things that are pretty  typical, actually. There have been requests just in the last couple of  minutes on military contractors and the vaccine mandate that will  certainly affect our military readiness. That is certainly defense  related.   There is human trafficking in China and whether products are coming  through. That is pretty straightforward. In fact, that passed  unanimously through this body. That doesn't seem that controversial to  be able to be in here.   There are conversations about fentanyl and the origin of fentanyl,  where that is coming from. That shouldn't be controversial to try to  protect the country, but, suddenly, that amendment has been blocked.   Nord Stream 2--Ukraine and Russia--has not been a controversial issue  for us. This body has laid down sanctions multiple times on the NDAA on  this exact issue, and now it is being blocked. You can't even debate  it.   Myself and Senator Daines both brought up things tonight dealing with  border security, which is certainly national security: 1.7 million  people we know of have illegally crossed our southwest border this  year. It is the highest number of illegal crossings in the history of  our country--1.7 million. But, on January 20 of this year, President  Biden stopped construction on the border wall--in many places,  literally where they only had to hang the gates and install the  electronic infrastructure there. That was all that was left, but it  stopped.   Why is this connected to national security?   Well, certainly, border security is national security. Also, part of  this funding did come out of defense funding. It is being done by the  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in many places.   On top of that, this year, so far--just so far this year--we have  paid contractors $2 billion not to build the wall. These were contracts  that had already been let out to do the construction. We are continuing  to pay about $3 million a day to contractors not to complete the wall  in sections, by the way, that career individuals had selected--that  section and that design--and then had to prove that that was the right  place and the right design to both Republican and Democrats in this  body, which they did. Now we are wasting $2 billion to not do national  security.   My amendment is very straightforward. We take the contracts that are  already out there, and we complete those sections of the wall that have  been approved by career individuals. Let's complete those sections and  not just throw the money away and waste two billion of American  taxpayer dollars, but actually use it for national security.   So, in saying that, I ask that the request be modified to include my  amendment No. 4100.    I object.
