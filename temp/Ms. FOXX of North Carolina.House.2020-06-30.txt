 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Dr.  Donald Moore of Madison, North Carolina. For over 40 years, Dr. Moore  has served as a physician at Western Rockingham Family Medicine.   Dr. Moore understands that God humbly uses him as an instrument to  care for those who are entrusted to him, and he believes each patient  is an extension of his own family. That mindset, Mr. Speaker,  encapsulates the true essence of a servant's heart.   After graduating from Madison-Mayodan High School with the title of  valedictorian, Dr. Moore attended the University of North Carolina at  Chapel Hill where he majored in biology. Dr. Moore was then accepted at  Bowman Gray Wake Forest School of Medicine.   Upon graduation, Dr. Moore had many opportunities presented to him  that might have awarded him more comfort and stability in life, but for  him, this was not the primary goal.   Instead, he turned his gaze to returning home to care for the  teachers, family members, and friends who had loved him and equipped  him with the necessary tools to pursue medicine.   Mr. Speaker, it is clear to see that Dr. Moore not only possesses a  servant's heart, but he also understands that service to a community is  intrinsic to bettering the lives of those around us. His daughter  Lindsay describes him as: ``A man who knows that he's made in the image  of God, and he understood at a young age what it meant to be a servant  leader in the community he so loves.''   Dr. Moore's wife, Sue, and three daughters believe that he is more  than just a father; he is a healer, a teacher, and a hero to the  countless people he has cared for.   Mr. Speaker, may God continue to bless Dr. Moore and his family as he  enters retirement. I have no doubt that Dr. Moore's legacy, as well as  his future service, will continue to impact the lives of those in the  community.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from  Missouri for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 2.   The Democrats' school construction provisions in H.R. 2 will result  in increased costs to taxpayers, increased costs to States and school  districts, and crushing new requirements for the entire education  community, all in exchange for limited grants to a handful of school  districts.   What is worse, Democrats have inserted provisions of their radical  Green New Deal in this bill to appease their far-left Members. Schools  will be forced to comply with burdensome green requirements. The costs  to comply with these requirements could exceed the funding schools are  being offered.   This ill-advised bill also unnecessarily limits access to funds by  charter schools, continuing Democrats' relentless assault on any  educational option that provides families a lifeline out of a failing  school.   H.R. 2 spends taxpayer dollars recklessly to advance bad ideas. This  partisan bill is the wrong answer for students, teachers, and their  communities.
