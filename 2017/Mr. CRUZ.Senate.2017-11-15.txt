 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for the vote on  confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 463, Mark T. Esper, of Virginia,  to be Secretary of the Army, due to having to chair a Judiciary  Committee hearing on judicial nominations for the U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Fifth Circuit, the Eastern and Western Districts of Kentucky,  and the District of Kansas. Had I been present, I would have voted yea.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
