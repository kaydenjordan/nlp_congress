 Mr. President, after careful consideration, I have  decided to oppose the confirmation of Andrew Wheeler, the nominee for  Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.   While Mr. Wheeler is certainly qualified for this position, I have  too many concerns with the actions he has taken during his tenure as  Acting Administrator to be able to support his promotion. I believe  that Mr. Wheeler, unlike Scott Pruitt, understands the mission of the  EPA and acts in accordance with ethical standards; however, the  policies he has supported as Acting Administrator are not in the best  interest of our environment and public health, particularly given the  threat of climate change to our Nation.   I met at length with Mr. Wheeler, and we discussed many important  environmental issues about which I care  [[Page S1510]]  deeply, from EPA's enforcement of landmark environmental laws to  greenhouse gas emissions and mercury pollution. Since last August, the  EPA has proposed to roll back environmental protections, including  determining it is no longer ``appropriate and necessary'' to regulate  mercury emissions from power plants, halting efforts to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks, and replacing the Clean  Power Plan.   These efforts are of great importance to the State of Maine, which is  located at the end of our Nation's ``air pollution tailpipe'' and is on  the receiving end of pollution generated by coal-fired power plants in  other States. Moreover, there is no doubt that the greenhouse gas  emissions driving climate change pose a significant threat to our  State's economy and our natural resources, from our working forests,  fishing, and agricultural industries, to tourism, and recreation.   Reducing harmful air pollutants is critical for public health,  particularly for Maine, which has among the highest rates of asthma in  the country. In Maine, cars, trucks, and other vehicles produce more  than 50 percent of our State's greenhouse gas emissions. Controls for  mercury, one of the most persistent and dangerous pollutants, are  especially important for children and pregnant women. The Agency's  recent efforts to halt progress in these critical areas takes us in the  wrong direction.   In keeping with my past practice, I will vote to allow the full  Senate to consider Mr. Wheeler's nomination so that every Senator can  have a clear up or down vote on this important nomination of a member  of the President's Cabinet.   However, due to the actions Mr. Wheeler has taken during his tenure  at the EPA, I will vote against his confirmation.    Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Aging  Committee, I rise today to introduce, with the Committee's Ranking  Member, Senator Bob Casey, the ``Guardianship Accountability Act of  2019,'' a bill that would assist States in improving guardianship  oversight and data collection.   Protecting older Americans from financial fraud and exploitation has  long been one of my top priorities as Chairman of the Aging Committee.  According to the National Center for State  [[Page S1542]]  Courts, an estimated 1.3 million adults are under the care of  guardians--family members or professionals--who control approximately  $50 billion of their assets. Guardianship is a legal relationship  created by a court that is designed to protect those with diminished or  lost capacity. We found, however, that in some cases, the system lacks  basic protections against inappropriate use of guardianship and abuse  by those in power, leaving the most vulnerable Americans at risk of  exploitation.   In November 2018, the Aging Committee released a bipartisan report  following a year-long investigation into State guardianship programs.  Titled, ``Ensuring Trust: Strengthening State Efforts to Overhaul the  Guardianship Process and Protect Older Americans,'' the report included  a number of recommendations intended to help stem the wave of  guardianship abuse, encourage reforms to State systems and restore  trust in guardianship arrangements.   Throughout the course of our investigation, we heard harrowing tales  from families around the Nation who have struggled with abusive  guardians, unscrupulous individuals exploiting vulnerable Americans for  their personal profit. Yet we also spoke with families who had  heartening stories to share--of dedicated and faithful guardians  stepping up to protect the assets of seniors with dementia and other  conditions affecting their capacity. A good guardian can provide years  of support for a protected individual, ensuring a full life directed,  wherever possible, by the person's own choices and preferences. Once a  guardianship is imposed, however, the individual's rights are removed,  and oversight to protect the individual from abuse, neglect and  exploitation becomes critical.   Our Committee gathered information, analysis and recommendations from  States, courts, and organizations representing older Americans and  those with disabilities around the country. We found signs of progress  in a number of jurisdictions. For example, in 2017, Maine was the first  state to enact the Uniform Law Commission's Uniform Guardianship,  Conservatorship, and Other Protective Arrangements Act. Among the  reforms made to Maine's guardianship system, this legislation  highlighted the importance of exploring all options to limit or  preclude the need for guardianship when appropriate, including the use  of supported decision making. Maine's law also mandates the regular  review of reports filed by guardians to determine, among other things,  whether the guardianship should continue and whether the guardian has  complied with his or her duties.   Yet stories in the news continue to call our attention to this  important issue. Appalling stories, such as that of a guardian from  Nevada who allegedly used the guardianship process to financially  exploit more than 150 individuals, and that of another guardian from  North Carolina who, along with an attorney, an advocate, and a  professor, took advantage of two men under guardianship and allegedly  stole hundreds of thousands of dollars, remind us of the  vulnerabilities created by these relationships and the need for  diligent oversight.   In the course of the Committee's investigation, we received more than  100 comments identifying gaps in the system and, most important,  offering solutions. The Committee found a pattern of barriers to proper  oversight and a need for greater use of alternatives to guardianship.  We found persistent and widespread challenges that require a nationwide  focus in order to ensure the guardianship system works on behalf of the  individuals it is intended to protect. The Committee's report outlines  policy recommendations at local, state and federal levels that would  improve outcomes for Americans subject to guardianship.   The Guardianship Accountability Act, which we are introducing today,  addresses many of the report's recommendations. The bill would direct  the Elder Justice Coordinating Council to establish a National Online  Resource Center on Guardianship to collect and publish information  relevant to guardianship for use by guardians, individuals subject to  guardianship, as well as courts, states, local governments, and  community organizations. The resource center would also publish model  legislation and best practices developed pursuant to the Elder Abuse  Prevention and Prosecution Act, compile and publish training materials  for guardians, share research related to guardianship, and maintain a  database on state laws regarding guardianship and the use of less  restrictive alternatives. In addition, our legislation would also  expand the availability of federal demonstration grants established by  the Elder Justice Act, so funds can be used for developing state  guardianship databases, for training for court visitors, and for  sharing information on guardian background checks.   Combating financial abuse and exploitation of seniors requires law  enforcement and social service agencies at all levels of government to  work together, and the bipartisan Guardianship Accountability Act  promotes this kind of collaboration. I urge my colleagues to support  this bipartisan legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Aging  Committee, I rise today to introduce, with the Committee's Ranking  Member, Senator Bob Casey, the ``Guardianship Accountability Act of  2019,'' a bill that would assist States in improving guardianship  oversight and data collection.
