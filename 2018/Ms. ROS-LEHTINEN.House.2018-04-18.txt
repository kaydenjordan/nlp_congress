 Mr. Speaker, today, many around the world might  herald what they call a transition of power in my native homeland of  Cuba, but that couldn't be further from the truth.   This sham transition is more smoke and mirrors--another ploy out of  the Castro playbook. The reality is that Raul Castro will continue to  maintain his grip on power. The reality is that the Cuban people will  be no closer to freedom today than they were yesterday--no closer to  democracy today than they were yesterday.   The reality is that the murderous regime in Cuba will continue to  oppress and will continue to abuse the people of Cuba.   We are not fooled, Mr. Speaker, and U.S. law dictates that we do not  recognize this so-called transition government or any successor  government until certain conditions are met, conditions such as: all  political prisoners be released; until free, fair, and transparent  elections monitored by international observers are held; and until the  Cuban people's human rights are respected.   Until then, and only then, Mr. Speaker, we must continue to oppose  this farce orchestrated by Castro and, instead, we must stand with the  people of Cuba in their fight for freedom, democracy, and human rights.                            ____________________
