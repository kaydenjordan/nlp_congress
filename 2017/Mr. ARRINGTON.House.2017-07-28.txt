 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 114, which will  continue funding the Choice Program, an important reform to make sure  that our veterans have access to quality care.   For too long, our veterans, Mr. Speaker, have been trapped in a  system that has failed them. They are in a single-payer system. We put  them in a system that the Members of Congress wouldn't sign up for. For  years, we haven't give them the same choice that we have given Medicaid  patients and Medicare patients.   The Choice Program isn't just common sense, it is common decency. We  have asked these men and women to serve and to sacrifice for our  freedom. They deserve the very best care. The only way they are going  to get the best care is to have choice when they have geographic  challenges or are waiting in line.   We have all read the reports about how our veterans have waited in  line, have gotten sicker, and some even died. It is unconscionable and  unacceptable.   I am so grateful that, in an institution that has a reputation of  gridlock and dysfunction, we have a committee with leaders like  Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz who will come together and put  America first. So I am heartened by this and I applaud their  leadership.   I support this continuation of funding and the improved access to  care for our heroes. I thank the chairman for the privilege of serving  under the leadership of his committee.
