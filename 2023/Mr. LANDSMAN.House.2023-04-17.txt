 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call for a bipartisan  House and Senate select committee to address gun violence. Later this  week, the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force will meet, and I pray that  substantive work will emerge.   The Second Amendment provides Americans the right to have a gun to  protect themselves and their families and rifles to hunt.   Weapons of war are different. To be clear, we are talking about the  weapons that spray hundreds of bullets in seconds, tearing bodies to  shreds.   The folks in my district, whether they are Republicans or Democrats  or Independents, are on the same page. They want us to double or triple  the number of mental health professionals, pass red flag laws, safe  storage laws, and have commonsense, comprehensive background checks to  keep these guns and rifles away from people who want to hurt others.  Most agree that these weapons of war have no place in our communities  or anywhere near our children.   We need both parties to be about public safety. This bipartisan group  of both House and Senate Members can make it happen, and we have to act  fast.                            ____________________
