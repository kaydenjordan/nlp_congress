 Mr. Speaker, today, Congress will have an opportunity to  vote on legislation that will bolster protections for whistleblowing  patriots, while vastly improving care for veterans at the VA.   The Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act is the product  of hundreds of hours of Congressional hearings, meetings with  stakeholders, and hard work by dozens of lawmakers here in Washington,  to make sure that the tragic abuse that Dr. Kirkpatrick faced will  never happen again.   As some of you may know, Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick was a clinical  psychologist at the VA in Tomah, WI. He was a veteran, a graduate of  Northwestern University, and a caring individual who dedicated his  career to providing innovative treatments for veterans suffering from  PTSD. Most notably, he created a yoga program to help vets at the VA in  Chicago. He was known to be very well-liked by the patients he served.   In 2009, Dr. Kirkpatrick expressed concerns that his patients were  being heavily overmedicated. It became so bad, he said, that he was  unable to properly do his job. He wanted to do what was right for  veterans, and as a veteran himself, he couldn't stand to see how  careless some of the VA staff were being with high levels of dangerous  medications.   Unfortunately, instead of looking into Dr. Kirkpatrick's claims, the  facility's chief of staff told him to mind his own business, and to  instead focus on his own work. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Kirkpatrick was  called to a disciplinary meeting and given a written reprimand.   This type of retaliation went on for months.   Then, in July, Dr. Kirkpatrick complained again that a dangerous  veteran had not been properly discharged, despite recommendations from  a treatment team. A week after making the complaint, Dr. Kirkpatrick  was fired from the VA.   He was devastated. He begged for an opportunity to stay, and  expressed concerns that he had been given too many complex cases, and  that the emotional toll was too high. Again, his concerns were ignored.   That night, Dr. Kirkpatrick wrote a note to his girlfriend in  Chicago, another to the kennel he wanted to take care of his dog, and  one final note for the mailman. It read: ``Please call 911--tell them  to go to red barn building.''   He had taken his own life. He was 38 years old.   Dr. Kirkpatrick's death was the product of a broken system--a system  that encourages retaliation against whistleblowers, while ignoring the  underlying causes of their concerns.   If Dr. Kirkpatrick's death wasn't tragic enough, a subsequent  investigation at the VA found that a patient had died from ``mixed drug  toxicity'', and that Dr. Kirkpatrick's concerns were completely  warranted.   Not only did whistleblower retaliation cost Dr. Kirkpatrick his life,  it cost the life of a patient as well.   That's why I urge you all to vote yes on the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick  Whistleblower Protection Act.   A yes vote means that VA personnel will no longer be able to access a  whistleblower's medical records as means of discrediting them, which a  separate investigation found happens far too often.   A yes vote means that federal agencies have to notify the Office of  Special Counsel when a suicide takes place.   A yes means clear disciplinary actions for supervisors who retaliate  against whistleblowers, training for supervisors on how to properly  respond, and a requirement that employees are made aware of the mental  health services at their disposal.   A yes vote also means keeping upholding normal burdens of proof to  strengthen protections for employees. This legislation calls for the  Inspector General, Office of Special Counsel, or a Merit Systems  Protection Board Administrative Judge to ``determine'' that a  supervisor has committed a prohibited personnel action, meaning through  the normal preponderance of the evidence for any other disciplinary  action under Chapter 75 of title 5. This does not mean some arbitrary  process for some bureaucrat to create later on.   I want to be clear: this legislation strengthens protections for  patriots--for those who are trying to do the right thing. For those who  care about veterans and their safety. And for folks like Dr.  Kirkpatrick, so that no one ever has to go through what he went  through.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 562, the previous question is ordered on  the bill.   The question is on the third reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be read a third time, and was read the third  time.                              Motion to Recommit    Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?   Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, I am opposed in its current form.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Mr. O'Halleran moves to recommit the bill S. 585 to the       Committee on Oversight and Government Reform with       instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith       with the following amendment:        At the end of title I the bill, add the following new       section:       SEC. __. DISCLOSURE OF VIOLATIONS RELATING TO AIR                     TRANSPORTATION.         This Act, and any amendments made by this Act, shall apply       to any employee who makes a protected disclosure of       information relating to a violation by the head of an agency,       or other political appointee, of any law, rule, or regulation       concerning travel, including the improper use of air       transportation.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion.   Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill,  which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted,  the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, increasing accountability and transparency across our  government is a shared principle we can all agree on among this body.  Whether at the VA or other Federal agencies, the American people  deserve to know that Federal officials from the top down are being held  to the standards we expect of them.   We owe it to our veterans, to our seniors, and to the hardworking  American taxpayers to ensure that their tax dollars are utilized  appropriately and efficiently, as intended. Waste, fraud, and abuse,  have no place at our agencies, and those who help uncover it deserve  our admiration and our protection.   I am proud that we are coming together to increase protections for  whistleblowers of Federal agencies, a long overdue effort. But, Mr.  Speaker, in light of recent reports and events that have revealed a  disturbing pattern of improper use of tax dollars on air travel by  senior Federal officials, I believe we must go further.   The reports of Cabinet officials abusing the rules for air travel  that applied to them are not isolated. Not one, not two, not three, but  at least four Cabinet officials are facing scrutiny for irregular and  irresponsible use of agency resources for official and nonofficial air  travel. In light of Secretary Price's recent resignation, it is clear  that Congress must conduct greater oversight.                                time  1345    That is why I am offering this final amendment on the underlying  bill.  [[Page H8004]]    My amendment simply extends whistleblower protections that are  created under the bill to Federal employees who disclose information  about travel, including improper use of aircraft.   Not only would this make clear to agencies that any violation of  laws, rules, or regulations concerning travel or government aircraft is  unacceptable, it will also ensure those who come forward to expose any  wrongdoing will have appropriate protection from retaliation.   Regardless of party, those who serve the American public must be held  to the highest ethical standards. Our ability to hold government  officials accountable to taxpayers is a hallmark of our democracy, and  we must work to uphold that principle. The resources invested to  agencies to fulfill their missions of serving Americans should not be  abused or frivolously flaunted for personal gain or convenience.   This is not about Republicans or Democrats. We must come together to  stand up for accountability and transparency. The moment we begin  treating disregard for the rules by our elected and appointed officials  as partisan politics, we risk ceding the very values that make our  democracy great and unique in the world.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting my  commonsense amendment on behalf of American taxpayers, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
