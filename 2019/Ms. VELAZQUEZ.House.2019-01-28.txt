 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 624, the  Promoting Transparent Standards for Corporate Insiders Act, bipartisan  legislation sponsored by Chairwoman Waters and Ranking Member McHenry.   Mr. Speaker, our Nation's financial markets are safer and more  efficient when they are transparent.                                time  1700    Unfortunately, those that participate in insider trading damage the  structure and integrity of our financial markets by engaging in  practices outside of the public's view, profiting on information that  is only known to a select few.   This nefarious practice damages ordinary, hardworking Americans who  invest in pension funds, 401(k)s, mutual funds, and other retirement  vehicles. As lawmakers, we must remain ever vigilant and seek to root  out this illegal practice before it starts.   Currently, SEC regulations permit corporate insiders to evade insider  trading rules by allowing them to adopt multiple trading plans and make  select changes to their predetermined trading plans.   H.R. 624 closes this loophole by requiring the SEC to study and  analyze the effectiveness of its current insider trading rules while  also considering any rule change's impact on capital formation and a  company's willingness to go public. Further, the bill requires the SEC  report to Congress on its finding and draft rules consistent with the  results.   This carefully crafted piece of legislation is an important step to  closing a loophole in our Nation's insider trading laws.   Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to commend Chair Waters  and Ranking Member McHenry for working in a bipartisan manner on this  bill. I hope it is the first of many bipartisan bills we can bring to  the floor from the Financial Services Committee in the 116th Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the speedy adoption of this important measure.
