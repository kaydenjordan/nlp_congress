 Mr. Speaker, my dear friend that just spoke with  reference to acting, let me tell you what action was undertaken with  reference to CHIP.   Prevention money was used as the pay-for. So, somehow or another,  that action doesn't rub some of us in the right way.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Congressional  Black Caucus to Speaker Paul Ryan.                                     Congressional Black Caucus,                                                  December 21, 2017.      Paul Ryan,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan: On behalf of the Congressional Black       Caucus (CBC), I write today to strongly urge you to provide a       more permanent solution for close to 9 million children       enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)       and more than 27 million people that visit Community Health       Centers (CHC's) for critically needed health care. It is       completely irresponsible for Congressional Leaders to have       created this crisis. Moreover, it is now unconscionable for       Congress to head home for the holidays without taking action       to right this wrong.        The holidays are a time to reflect on how fortunate we are       and help those in need. In that vein, the CBC will not       support a Continuing Resolution unless CHIP is reauthorized       and fully funded for five years and Community Health Centers       are reauthorized and fully funded for two years. Moreover,       the offsets for these programs must not harm other vulnerable       communities by reducing funding for other programs, such as       the Prevention Fund. For this to be the state of play one day       after giving away $1.5 trillion to huge corporations and the       wealthy is absurd and offensive.        Close to 2 million children across this country are in       danger of losing CHIP coverage in January, with another 1       million set to lose coverage in February. A short term       approach to providing these children and their families with       certainty is absolutely irresponsible. Without swift       reauthorization and fully funded coverage, young lives hang       in the balance. Congress' failure to act will set off a chain       of dire-consequences for children, as well as their families,       communities, and states. A family without insurance is a       family more likely to fall victim to financial crisis related       to medical costs, such as bankruptcy.        Similarly, Community Health Centers play an essential role       in low-income communities as they protect and expand access       to critical and affordable care. The Community Health Centers       Fund (CHCF) provides mandatory funding for federal health       centers, which provide primary, dental, and other supportive       care in medically underserved areas. Robust and reliable       support for Community Health Centers results in more health       centers, an increased number of patient visit, and more       available services. These services save lives, especially in       communities struggling to provide affordable care to poor,       largely minority communities.        The CHCF is even more essential to the more than 27 million       people it helps support in light of recent efforts to the       dismantle our nation's health insurance market. As you well       know, the elimination of the Affordable Care Act's individual       mandate will add 13 million uninsured Americans, increase       premiums by 10 percent, and make it harder for sick people to       get insurance.        The Congressional Black Caucus has been the conscience of       this Congress since its inception in 1971. We have provided       moral leadership and courageous advocacy for our constituents       and for all Americans that have felt disenfranchised or left       behind. At the time of year when we are supposed to be most       charitable, it is urgent that Congress act to reauthorize       CHIP and Community Health Centers and provide robust funding       for both. Children and families do not need to spend the       holidays worrying about their health. It is time for Congress       to do what it is responsible and moral. Accordingly, the CBC       will not support any legislation to prevent a shutdown unless       these critical programs are addressed.            Sincerely,                                                   Cedric Richmond,                                                             Chair.     Mr. Speaker, I lift from it one paragraph that says:         The holidays are a time to reflect on how fortunate we are       and help those in need. In that vein, the Congressional Black       Caucus will not support a continuing resolution unless CHIP       is reauthorized and fully funded  [[Page H10353]]       for 5 years and community health centers are reauthorized and       fully funded for 2 years.    Mr. Speaker, this morning in the Rules Committee, beginning at 8--I  might add, we were noticed that we were going to meet last night at 10,  but we did not meet, and then we came in early this morning--the  distinguished minority leader and the minority whip, along with the  leader of the Hispanic Caucus, appeared and stayed for 2\1/2\ hours  discussing the fact that we are leaving things on the table, but, more  specifically, addressing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals  program.   But let's talk about the things that we are leaving on the table:   We are doing nothing about long-term flood insurance.   We are doing nothing about Perkins loans that have expired.   We are not funding or addressing the opioid epidemic.   We are not offering legislation to help save failing pensions in this  country.   I talked with some teamsters from Michigan the other day with tears  in their eyes concerned about their pensions.   We are doing nothing with reference to long-term, bipartisan  reauthorizing for CHIP and community health centers.   We are doing nothing about the FISA reauthorization.   We are not raising the defense and non-defense spending caps.   We are leaving Medicare extension on the table.   And that is just a to-do list that is partial that we are not  addressing.   But let me get in the weeds on something that the public doesn't  quite understand.   196 people appeared right over here and signed what is called a  discharge petition to bring DACA to the floor; 34 Members of the House  of Representatives sent a letter to the Speaker. If you combine those  numbers, you have 218.   My distinguished Rules Committee chair and I had a colloquy this  morning where we discussed that matter.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hultgren). The time of the gentleman has  expired.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Florida an  additional 30 seconds.    And the fact of the matter is I believe that it would  pass if it were put on the floor.   But do you know what is more important? We had 58 closed rules in  this Congress, completely closed. And to put that into context, we  averaged 25 closed rules a year in the 4 years the Democrats were in  charge.   The Dream Act is a perfect example of this. As Members are well  aware, we have tried time and time again to get a floor vote on the  Dream Act.   Mr. Speaker, we all know that this CR is the last train leaving town.  You have given millionaires and billionaires help. Let's give the  DREAMers a Merry Christmas.
