 Mr. Chair, the amount of teleworking in Washington is  astronomical. We all know post-pandemic it is nearly impossible to get  an employee of a Federal agency on the phone because they are still  working in their homes and not in the office.   Perhaps some of the worst offenders are those at the Department of  Housing and Urban Development, HUD. According to a GAO study from July  of this year, the occupancy rate of HUD's headquarters, the Robert C.  Weaver Federal building, is roughly 9 percent occupancy. The building  is just a stone's throw from here where we are sitting right now, and  it is sitting basically empty.   Why, then, I ask, are we proposing to spend $4.68 million to  modernize a building that very few are using?   I propose we do something else with that money. At the same time many  of our Nation's veterans are living in untenable conditions, and they  have lived with physical disabilities as a result of war. I am here  today to argue that a better use of that $4.68 million is to support  low-income veterans via the Veterans Housing Rehabilitation and  Modification Pilot Program.   This program provides awards through competitive grants to nonprofit  organizations that provide nationwide or State programs that primarily  serve low-income veterans. Once the grant is received, the veterans'  homes receive modifications such as wheelchair ramps, widening door  thresholds to accommodate mobility needs, shower bars, and things  related to that.   It is estimated that with the money that would be transferred there,  they would be able to modify hundreds of more homes for these veterans.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman, and I thank the ranking member  for making my amendment as a part of the en bloc package. I urge my  colleagues to support the adoption of the en bloc package.
