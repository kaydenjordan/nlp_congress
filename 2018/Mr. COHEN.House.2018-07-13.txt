 Madam Speaker, I want to commend our United States  Department of Justice for reopening the Emmet Till murder case.   Emmet Till was a young man who was brutally murdered in Mississippi  in 1955. The case that was brought to trial in Mississippi charged two  White men who were identified by a Black one, one of Mr. Till's 14- year-old relatives. The all-White jury found them not guilty. Both men,  looking back afterwards, said they did it, and nothing happened.   There have been lots of investigations about this, lots of reports,  and the Justice Department has seized some ``new evidence'' to reopen  the case. I commend our Justice Department.   While justice delayed is justice denied, justice, whenever it can be  found in these civil rights cases, is appropriate and proper.   I thank the Department of Justice.                            ____________________
