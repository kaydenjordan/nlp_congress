 And still I rise, Mr. Speaker. I rise to announce  that I will vote for this legislation, and I will do so because I know  that there are 19 babies who were murdered at Robb Elementary School in  Texas who will never have the right to vote.   I rise to vote for it because there are two teachers who were  murdered who will never have the opportunity to seek the future that  was theirs.   I rise because we have a Governor in the State of Texas who could  have saved all of those lives if he had but only, after the shooting at  Walmart that took 23 lives, passed legislation such as what we are  passing today.   I rise because I don't want the blood of the next person murdered  with an AR-15-type weapon on my hands.
