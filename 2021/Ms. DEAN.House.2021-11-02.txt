 Mr. Speaker, our negotiations have been long, but today we  are closer than ever to passing Build Back Better. We have heard enough  about the process. Let's talk about the impact, the transformative  investments we are making in our children, our seniors, and our planet.   And let me say this loudly and clearly: It is paid for; paid for with  the taxes ensuring that corporations and the mega-rich pay their fair  share, and IRS investments closing the multi-trillion dollar tax gap.   Paid-for, historic investments in our future: In Pennsylvania alone,  more than 200,000 children will have access to high-quality pre-K, and  more than 730,000 children will gain access to childcare.   Childcare and extended child tax credits will ease the financial  burdens that our parents face. They are not the only ones, 122,000  uninsured Pennsylvanians will have healthcare. Bold climate action will  help our districts that have seen an increase in climate disasters.   My Commonwealth is ready for both Build Back Better and the  bipartisan infrastructure bill. The process will be forgotten, the  investments will not.                            ____________________
