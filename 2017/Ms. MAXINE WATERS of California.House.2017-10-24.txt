 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3972 would expand the definition of ``accredited  investor'' to organizations known as family offices and their family  clients.   Family offices manage the financial interests of wealthy families.  Deeming family offices and family clients to be accredited investors  would allow them to more easily invest in private, unregistered  security offerings.   Today, each family client, family member, and associated employees  and entities must independently meet the accredited investor  definition. This would require, for example, that each individual in a  family independently meet certain income or net worth thresholds.   As I understand it, this process can be cumbersome for private funds  that may lose their private, unregistered status if they fail to  appropriately verify their investors as accredited or otherwise  qualified to invest in private offerings. If there is any doubt, a  private fund could deny a family office or family client the  opportunity to invest.   This bill seeks to remedy that problem by recognizing that family  offices and family clients are financially sophisticated in their own  right. Thanks to an amendment by Representative Maloney that was  unanimously accepted during the committee markup, the bill ensures that  these family offices and family clients have the financial wherewithal  and knowledge to invest as accredited investors in typically risky,  illiquid private security offerings.   Specifically, the bill would apply the same standards currently in  place for trusts so that, number one, the family office must have more  than $5 million in assets; two, the family office and family clients  must not be formed for the specific purpose of acquiring the securities  offered; and, three, the family office and family client must be  dedicated--or directed, rather, by a sophisticated person.   These restrictions limit the potential unintended consequences of the  bill so that, for example, someone who could not otherwise meet the  accredited investor test alone could not circumvent the rules by  investing with another family member as a ``family office.''   They would also prevent estranged family members, who could be up to  10 generations removed, from investing as an accredited investor  without receiving any services of or otherwise being affiliated with  the family office.   I support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as  she may consume to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B.  Maloney), the author of the bill and the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the  balance of my time.  [[Page H8099]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   First, allow me to say that I am very pleased that, by naming this  legislation after Otto Warmbier, we are able to honor him and let his  family know that we will not forget him. Nor will we forget the brutal,  lethal treatment of this young, decent American student by the  Government of North Korea.   There is simply no justification for the fury with which the Kim  regime turned the massive power of the state on this young American  man, who is alleged to have done nothing more than take a poster from a  hotel. It is this kind of brutality--and the ongoing fundamental  depravity of the North Korean regime--that will keep it from being a  member of the global community of nations.   This is also why the rapid acceleration in the scale and range of  North Korea's nuclear and missile programs is so alarming, including  the launch of two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July, one of  which experts believe could have had the capacity to reach the  continental United States. Then, in September, the regime tested its  sixth nuclear explosive device, and, according to U.S. and  international estimates, this thermonuclear test was significantly  higher in magnitude and yield than any previous test.   This has led to a bipartisan consensus in the Financial Services  Committee that a new policy towards North Korea involving a maximum  pressure campaign of financial isolation is the best chance we have to  resolve this situation peacefully.   Such a strategy must entail a dramatically greater level of pressure  than North Korea has faced to date, one strong enough to change Kim  Jong-un's calculus about whether he is safer with or without his  nuclear program.   The legislation before us today, H.R. 3898, calls for just such a  U.S. strategy towards North Korea--and it is one that has the advantage  of presenting an option other than a military-first response. As many  experts have called for, this legislation takes a page from the Iran  sanctions playbook by mandating the use of secondary sanctions, which  were widely credited with forcing Iran to the negotiating table.   In the context of North Korea, an American program of secondary  sanctions wouldn't just ban U.S. companies from doing business with  North Korea, it would also force companies, individuals, banks, and  governments to make a choice: stop doing business with North Korea and  its enablers or be cut off from the global financial system.   Although we saw in the Iran context just how powerful this approach  can be when carefully fashioned as part of a broad coalition, we must  remember that sanctions alone are not a strategy. Sanctions are a tool,  and in order for them to work, they must be linked to a broader  strategic effort, with the high level of skill in their design and  implementation, and with a clear understanding of the policy goals we  are trying to achieve.   According to Adam Szubin, who formerly served as the Under Secretary  of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Crimes, when Congress  adopted a series of secondary sanction measures in 2010, aimed at  containing Iran's nuclear program, the administration was already  staffed, well-resourced, and ready to immediately deploy senior  officials around the world.   Specifically, senior Treasury, White House, and State Department  officials traveled around the world to explain the new U.S. sanctions  regime and pressure governments, bankers, traders, and companies to  enforce these sanctions in a tough and meaningful way.   Today, there is widespread recognition that a successful strategy to  isolate and pressure North Korea must not only entail the effective  implementation of sanctions, but also arguably an even more complex and  sophisticated degree of statecraft in order to coordinate with our  allies, and, in particular, to convince China that we have shared  objectives when it comes to addressing the increasing destabilizing  North Korean threat.    It is extremely concerning, therefore, that President Trump has shown  virtually no capacity or willingness for the hard work necessary to  secure concessions from North Korea, or enlist China and other key  players to do their part to isolate the Kim regime. In fact, President  Trump's reckless threats, his vow to destroy the Kim regime, his  [[Page H8102]]  name-calling, warmongering, and rejection of diplomacy contradict key  administration officials, and leading experts, who continue to stress  the importance of imposing pressure on the Kim regime. It also  demonstrates a Commander in Chief who lacks the discipline and quality  of leadership it takes to convince our allies to join us in dealing  with the North Korean threat.   Given the high-stakes objectives; the lack of a unified, coherent  policy from the executive branch; and concern about U.S. credibility on  the global stage, I am pleased that, on this critical issue, Members  from both sides of the aisle were able to come together behind a  concrete strategic objective to force Pyongyang into nuclear diplomacy  with the goal of permanently and verifiably limiting North Korea's WMD  and ballistic missile programs.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   To my colleague on the opposite side of the aisle who was responding  to part of my statement, of course there are many in this country who  worry about President Trump's reckless threats, his promise of fire and  fury, his vow to destroy the Kim regime, his name-calling,  warmongering, and rejection of diplomacy.   It directly contradicts his leading Cabinet officials who continue to  stress the importance of imposing pressure on the Kim regime. It also  demonstrates a Commander in Chief who lacks the discipline and the  capacity to convince our allies to join us in dealing with the North  Korean threat.    The gentlewoman will happily not  engage in personalities except to say that the rhetoric to call Kim  Jong-un the little rocket man is not productive and it does not do us  well.   We have a situation in which nearly every high-level official in the  U.S. Government believes the threats posed by the North Korean nuclear  and missile programs must be front and center in U.S. national security  decisionmaking.   This is a time for U.S. diplomatic and foreign policy efforts to be  aggressively focused on intensifying economic and diplomatic  coordination with our allies and China in a strategy that would entail  sophisticated policymaking capacity and coordination across the U.S.  Government. Instead, a week ago, in a move that I believe history will  strongly condemn, President Trump refused to recertify the Iran nuclear  deal, throwing into question continued U.S. support for the landmark  nuclear accord.   Whether you support or hate the Iran nuclear deal, it is widely  viewed, at least so far, as successfully containing Iran's nuclear  ambitions, and will for many years.   There can be no question that President Trump's threat to walk away  from the international nuclear accord will have a direct and profoundly  negative effect on our ability to convince Kim Jong-un or our allies  that America will honor any commitment to integrate North Korea into  the global community if it gives up its nuclear and missile programs.    In short, the President's threat to withdraw from the Iran nuclear  deal undermines our credibility as a negotiating partner and throws  into question the prospect of any effective nuclear diplomacy with  North Korea. At a time when we are facing a nuclear crisis with North  Korea, raising questions about our commitment to the Iran nuclear deal  not only defies strategic logic, but it also undermines our national  security.   On that issue, I would welcome, as I do with the legislation before  us today, a stronger, more unified, bipartisan front.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the  balance of my time.
