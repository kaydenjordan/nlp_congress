 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.J.  Res. 42. This resolution is the latest effort in the House to undo the  wave of bureaucratic overreach from the Obama administration.   Five years ago, Congress passed a bipartisan law that included a  commonsense provision giving the States flexibility to drug test some  applicants for unemployment insurance.   Instead of following the law Congress passed and allowing--not  requiring--States to implement the policies right for their citizens,  the Obama administration decided to tie States' hands. It issued a  regulation that left no flexibility for States, the opposite of the  bipartisan law Congress passed.   Mr. Speaker, frankly, it is sad that we are even here today. This all  could have been avoided if the Obama administration had simply followed  the congressional intent, but yet here we are.   I support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin), former chairman of this committee  and, certainly, a former ranking member on this side.   (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)
