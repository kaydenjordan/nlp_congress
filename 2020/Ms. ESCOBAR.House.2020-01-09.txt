 Madam Speaker, as a Member of Congress, I take my duty  to protect and defend our Nation's interests very seriously. The  President's reckless and irresponsible actions toward Iran have  endangered our servicemembers, diplomats, and allies, and they have  worked counter to American security interests. Those include dangerous  decisions to pull out of the successful Iran deal and kill Commander  Soleimani, drastically ratcheting up tensions in the region.   In the context of the administration's failure to demonstrate an  imminent threat to our Nation, there is no authority for such an action  without authorization from Congress. What makes this even more  dangerous is that the President has no clear strategy.   Under the Constitution, President Trump does not have the authority  to unilaterally wage war. That is why, today, I support this rule and  the underlying resolution, which directs the President to end  hostilities with Iran and to keep our troops in America safe.   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
