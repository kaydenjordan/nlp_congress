 Mr. Speaker, this past Sunday, we celebrated  International Women's Day, the unique stories women share, and their  power to shape our world.   Like many women in America, my story includes a struggle to get  pregnant. My son, Jordan, was a miracle for me and my family. But for  too many mothers in America, the miracle of pregnancy ends in tragedy.   The United States has the worst rate of maternal death in the  developed world. This is unacceptable. There is no reason that, in the  richest Nation on Earth, we cannot keep our mothers and our families  healthy and whole.   My bill, the Social Determinants for Moms Act, will invest in our  mothers and fund the access to services and critical research that we  need to help save the lives of our American women.   We can solve this crisis together if we work together, Republicans  and Democrats, fighting for a safer, more compassionate, and more  community-focused future.                            ____________________
