 Mr. President, alongside my esteemed colleagues Senator  Jim Risch and Representative  Mike Simpson, I rise today to honor the  formal turnover of the Naval Reactors A1W Prototype from Naval Reactors  Idaho Branch Office and Fluor Marine Propulsion, LLC, to the U.S.  Department of Energy Idaho Cleanup Project and Idaho Environmental  Coalition. This momentous occasion marks the early completion of the  turnover of the A1W Prototype, a defueled naval nuclear propulsion  plant, which holds significant historical and strategic importance in  the ongoing decommissioning efforts of this facility.   The goal in this endeavor is clear: to remove the three prototypes,  S1W, A1W and S5G, from the Naval Reactors Facility by 2030. This effort  aligns perfectly with the program's unwavering commitment to managing  radioactive and hazardous materials from cradle to grave, ensuring no  adverse effects on the environment or public health. Decommissioning  older, nonmission-critical facilities not only reduces workforce needs  but also allows us to allocate resources more efficiently towards our  core mission, while creating space for the workplace of the future.  [[Page S5313]]    The significance of this turnover lies in the remarkable  collaboration among various Agencies involved. Originally scheduled for  2027, achieving this turnover 4 years ahead of schedule is a monumental  achievement. It is a testament to the unwavering dedication of hundreds  of professionals from all four organizations involved. We express our  deepest gratitude to the entire team whose exceptional teamwork has  made this moment possible. Their remarkable efforts throughout this  endeavor have been truly extraordinary.   The A1W Prototype, born in 1956 and operational from October 1958 to  January 1994, stands as a technological marvel. It represents a pivotal  chapter in our Nation's scientific and engineering history. Over nearly  four decades, this remarkable prototype played a critical role in  training over 14,500 enlisted personnel, officers, and civilian  operators. As the second prototype built, the A1W's contributions to  science, technology, Cold War military applications, and the U.S. Naval  Nuclear Propulsion Program have earned it the esteemed recognition as  eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.  Moreover, the A1W Prototype paved the way for the construction and  commissioning of the world's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier,  USS Enterprise, CVN-65, which utilized the A1W design. Enterprise's 51- year journey serves as a testament to the dedication and strength of  our naval forces, as it stood as a guardian of freedom, protector of  our national interests and a symbol of American power worldwide.   While there is still more work ahead, it is important that we take a  moment to celebrate this milestone. It serves as a testament to the  incredible results that can be achieved when people and organizations  come together with a shared purpose. We extend our heartfelt gratitude  to each person involved for their unwavering dedication and hard work.  This turnover signifies a significant step toward ensuring that the  Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program continues to power maritime dominance  for the Navy and our Nation well into the future. It also reaffirms our  steadfast commitment to safeguarding our national defense, paying  homage to our history, and preserving our national treasures.                            ____________________
