 Mr. President, there is a French farmer by the name of  Hector St. John de Crevecoeur. He immigrated to the United States from  Normandy, France, in 1759, and he settled in the Hudson Valley. He  married an American woman. The astounding diversity of those who  settled around him, his fellow farmers, was shocking to him. He said:  It is ``a mixture of English, Scotch, Irish, French, Dutch, Germans,  and Swedes.''   There was one family he knew who had an English grandfather, a Dutch  grandmother, an Anglo-Saxon son who had a French wife, whose four sons  all married women who were from different places of different  nationalities. Hector said: ``From this promiscuous breed, that race  now called Americans has arisen.''   He asked: ``What then is the American, this new man?''   This farmer who came to America from Normandy in 1759 wrote this:         He is an American, who leaving behind him all his ancient       prejudices and manners, receives new ones from the new mode       of life he has embraced, the new government he obeys, and the       new rank he holds. The American is the new man who acts upon       new principles. . . . Here individuals of all nations are       melted into a new race of men.    George Washington told us that the bosom of America is open to the  oppressed and the persecuted of all nations and religions.   That great American philosopher, Alexis de Tocqueville, that observer  of American life, said in a letter:         Imagine, my dear friend, if you can, a society formed of       all the nations of the world . . . people having different       languages, beliefs, opinions: in a word, a society without       roots, without memories, without prejudices, without       routines, without common ideas, without a national character,       yet a hundred times happier than our own.    I am not sure if any of those are completely accurate descriptions of  what an American was or is or whether those are commensurate with our  understanding as to the foundations of this country, but they speak to  this founding ideal of America, this place where you could come from  any part of the world with any set of beliefs, with any religion, with  any skin color, and become something that is uniquely new.   There were people here before those who traveled from far-off lands,  but to be an American is in many ways an invention--an invention of the  amalgamation of faiths of peoples from all over the world.   Both Hector and de Tocqueville talk about the leaving behind of  prejudices when you come to this new country. Inherent in that idea is  this belief of new Americans that the discrimination they faced in  other places could be washed away upon coming to a country, a land at  that time in which everyone was equal, everyone started from the same  place. Of course, that has to be true because this country was founded  by individuals who were fleeing religious persecution, who thought that  America was a place in which they could practice their religion freely.  They could be who they knew themselves to be.   The reason why you hear such anxiety and anger and sadness from many  in this Chamber and from many people we represent is because what  happened on Friday is an abandonment of American originalism. It is a  walking back of the faith that we have held since the days in which  Scotch and Irish and French and Dutch and German and Swede came to this  country believing that they could leave behind prejudices. It feels as  if we are shrinking as a country before our eyes.   A young woman from Stamford, CT, wrote me this beautiful letter, and  I want to read some of it to you. She encapsulates in modern language  what Crevecoeur, Washington, and de Tocqueville were saying centuries  ago. She said:         I am the proud descendant of Syrian immigrants. My great-      grandparent's sacrifices to resettle in Rhode Island have       shaped my entire life. I've grown up very close to my       grandfather, the first generation of his family born in       America, and I know what my ancestors did to be here and       how far we've come from them being persecuted and       subjected to religious violence in Damascus. I was able to       grow up around Syrian culture and appreciate how great-      grandparents made it possible for my entire family to be       where they are now.        To give you an idea, my grandfather went on to receive a       master's degree and was a high school teacher and guidance       counselor. He is also heavily involved in the Roman Catholic       church and quietly serves communion in hospitals each Sunday.       My father, second generation, also received a master's,       serves on hospital boards, and has had a successful career in       human resources. With their encouragement, I have begun a       career as a journalist, one I have dreamed of since I was in       high school.        In 2012, on the 100-year anniversary of my family's arrival       in the United States, I was the third generation in my family       to graduate from high school and enroll in college. . . . I       tell you this because this moves me every day when I go to       work. How amazing it is that my family has gone from being       persecuted for their religion to being able to hold jobs       protected by the First Amendment? Surely, this is something       my great-grandparents never could've dreamed of when they       came here, and I embrace my career with the intention to       honor their sacrifices. . . . Recently, my heart broke at the       executive order to suspend the entry of refugees,       specifically from Syria. I have looked into this extensively       and recently worked on a story about the vetting process. . .       . Trump's order is nothing but xenophobic and racist. I was       preparing to report on a family that was supposed to be       coming to a community near me, but it seems that family won't       be coming now. How truly American it would've been for the       descendant of Syrian immigrants to welcome a new generation       of Syrians into this country.    This is for many cataclysmic because everything they thought about  this country seems to be disappearing in front of us. I understand that  President Trump tries to sell this as something less than it is; that  it isn't a ban on all Muslims entering the United States, it is just a  ban on Muslims from a select set of countries. But these are countries  that encapsulate over 230 million Muslims. That is almost two-thirds of  the population of the United States of America, including some of the  most populous Muslim nations in the world, and it is directly targeted  at people of Muslim faith.   It is simply not credible to say that this isn't a ban on members of  one religion from entering the United States because it selects  countries that are majority Muslim and then includes a caveat that if  you are not of the majority religion, if you are of any religion that  is not the majority religion, you can get around the ban and will be  given priority to come to the United States.   This is a Muslim ban--a Muslim ban that applies to over 200 million  Muslims around the world. It makes us smaller and weaker and less great  as a nation. It also makes us weaker from a national security  standpoint as well.   Let's step back for a second and understand the context here. This  country does face a threat, a serious threat. There are religious  extremists around the world who have perverted the religion of Islam  and tried to turn it into  [[Page S484]]  a doctrine of violence. They are attempting today to do great violence  in the Middle East and in other parts of the world, and they are trying  to recruit attackers here on U.S. soil. But you are not likely to be  killed in an act of terrorism in this country. In fact, on average,  there have been about three Americans killed every year by terrorism.   I am not trying to underplay the threat. People feel fearful. As a  body, we need to respond to that fear. They see these awful things  happening on TV, and they want us to make sure it will not happen to  them. You are more likely to be killed in this country by lightning or  by an elevator malfunction than you are by terrorism.   If you really want to talk about securing this Nation, about  protecting Americans, then the conversation has to be bigger than just  banning individuals from one country but recognizing the real threats  that are posed.   Let me guarantee you this: If this ban goes into effect, if President  Trump is successful, with the support from the Republican Congress, in  sending a message to the world that America is at war with Islam, then  that number of three Americans killed by terrorism every year will  jump, it will skyrocket. More Americans will be killed by terrorism.  Why? Because today ISIS is on its heels. It is in retreat. It has  substantially less territory than it ever has before, and that has  robbed from it one of its primary rationales for existence, one of its  primary arguments to those it is trying to recruit into its fold--the  idea that ISIS is forming a caliphate, an area of geographic control in  the Middle East.   That argument doesn't work any longer because the supposed caliphate  is shrinking. The amount of territory they control is getting smaller  and smaller. Most folks can see the writing on the wall, that it is  just a matter of time before the Islamic State as a state is gone. But  they have this second rationale for existence, this second argument  that they proffer to would-be recruits, and that is that there is a war  between East and West, that this is really about a long-term struggle  between Islam and Christianity. You need to sign up with us because  they--the West, America, the Christian world--are coming for us.    We know that is not true, and we have watched Presidents of both  parties make it very clear to the world that this is not the fight that  we seek to engage in. Famously, immediately following the 9/11 attacks,  President Bush said:         The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam.    He said:         That's not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace.    Yet the message that is being sent with this ban on Muslims from  these seven countries entering the United States is clear. The message  is that the United States is at war with this religion, that we are at  war with people of the Muslim faith.   As we speak, these recruitment bulletin boards are lighting up with  arguments being made as to the true nature of America's intent against  the Islamic people. One posting on one of these message boards said  that Trump's actions ``clearly revealed the truth and harsh reality  behind the American government and their hatred toward Muslims.''  Another posting on one of these extremist Web sites hailed Trump as the  ``best caller to Islam.'' Another message said that the leader of ISIS,  ``Al Baghdadi[,] has the right to come out and inform Trump that  banning Muslims from entering America is a blessed ban.'' That is a  phrase with very meaningful connotations. To the extent that these  messaging boards are calling this ban on Muslims entering from seven  countries a ``blessed ban,'' it is rooted in a different phrase,  something called the ``blessed invasion.''   The U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 became the starting point for the  very insurgency that we are fighting today. It was that invasion that  was called by Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda in Iraq, and the affiliated extremist  groups that were drawn into the fight the ``blessed invasion.'' Today  on extremist Web sites, the ban on Muslims entering the United States  is being called the ``blessed ban.''   This order is making this country less safe hour by hour. It is  giving a pathway to rebirth for the very terrorist organizations that  we had made such progress in pushing back and fighting back. In Iran  specifically, it will lead to this country and our allies in the Middle  East losing the fight against hardliners who pose a threat to the  United States, to stability in the Middle East, and to our sacred ally  of Israel. In Iran, there is a contest between moderates--and that is a  relative term within the Iranian political space--and hardliners who  chant ``Death to Israel'' who don't fear a world war or a conflict with  the United States.   With the signing of the Iran nuclear agreement and the lifting of a  handful of sanctions on Iran, the moderates won a victory. The  population of that country--which is surprisingly pro-American and  supported that nuclear agreement--was ascended, potentially  foreshadowing a day in which that country would no longer be a  provocateur in the region and instead could join in conversations about  how to bring stability to the Middle East. Now the hardliners have been  handed a gift, a gift which proves that America is an enemy, not just  of the Iranian state but of the Iranian people.   Remember, when we think of actions that we take against governments  that we don't like, we first try to start with actions that  specifically identify individuals in the government, so that we make it  clear that it is not about the people of that country but about their  leaders. If that isn't strong enough, then we go to sanctions against  commercial interests, against the economy writ large. Yes, those  sanctions do filter down and hurt real people, but the sanctions are  levied at the economy or against commercial actors.   When you enact a specific ban on the people of a country being able  to travel to the United States, you are levying that punishment  directly on those individuals, who, by and large, bear no ill will  toward the United States. You are telling them that it is their fault,  and the Iranian people will turn against the United States, will turn  toward the hardliners based upon this action.   This ban makes us less safe. It will allow for terrorist groups to  rebound. That is not just me saying it. Senators McCain and Graham have  said the same thing. National security experts of both stripes have  testified as such. Tonight I think back to the moment in which I first  heard that Candidate Donald Trump was proposing a ban on all Muslims  entering the United States. I remember the universal bipartisan  derision that met that announcement. It was almost laughable at that  point in time during the campaign. If you remember, Candidate Trump was  flailing. He was weak. He needed to reassert himself. He needed to make  news, and so he grabbed for the most controversial, most outlandish  proposal he could make. Republicans and Democrats here in Congress  condemned it.   Speaker Ryan tweeted this:         A religious test for entering our country is not reflective       of America's fundamental values. I reject it.    Governor Mike Pence said:         Calls to ban Muslims from entering the United States are       offensive and unconstitutional.        A religious test for entering this country is not       reflective of America's fundamental values. I reject it.        Calls to ban Muslims from entering the United States are       offensive and unconstitutional.    I give credit to a small handful of Republicans here in the Senate  and a small handful of Republicans in the House who have raised serious  concerns about this ban with respect to what it says about American  values or what it says about American national security. But there is  utter silence from Republican leadership. Republican leadership--who  only months ago claimed that if there were a religious test for  entering our country, they would reject it--today are quiet. The idea  that individuals could come to this country without regard to their  religion or their national origin or their set of beliefs has never  been a partisan issue. Of all the things that divide us, that idea has  been one that unifies us.   My hope is that there is still a chance that both parties can come  together and recapture the essence of American originalism, can put  this country on firmer national security footing, and can continue the  relentless drive against extremist groups like ISIS that now find  themselves at a point of potential rebirth.  [[Page S485]]    You have heard a lot of stories on the floor of the Senate today. It  is interesting. We have these incredibly compelling stories from real  people who are caught today in the middle of this reckless ill-thought- out ban. There are 67,000 refugees who are currently in the pipeline to  come to this country right now. This isn't about 100, 200, 300, or 400.  This is about tens of thousands of refugees who are fleeing  persecution, terror, and torture. This is about the 230 million Muslims  who live in those seven countries, who have been told that they are  lesser. Frankly, every other Muslim in the world believes the message  is being sent to them as well.   These stories that we tell you are--the tip of the iceberg isn't even  accurate. This is a pinprick. Fadi Kassar and his family--here are his  two girls. They left Syria in 2011 due to the epic levels of violence  that Fadi was sure would kill his two little girls if he didn't leave.  His family went to the UAE, or the United Arab Emirates. But the way in  which the UAE works is that if you have a job, you can stay, but if you  don't have a job, you leave. When he lost his job, they were kicked out  and that began an epic journey for Fadi and his family.   These girls actually were born in the UAE, as I understand. He was  fleeing Syria to protect his family and his future children, yet they  were kicked out of the country they went to. Fadi then began a journey  to try to find a home for him and his family. He tried to get to Europe  via Tunisia, but he was detained and sent back to Turkey. He eventually  flew to Brazil. He made his way to the United States by crossing the  border with Mexico. Upon entry, he was detained. He was transferred to  Miami. He was released and eventually found his way to Connecticut. He  applied for asylum that was granted in December of 2015.   Fadi's relatives in Syria were tortured and had been detained by the  regime. His neighborhood was dangerous and deadly. Fadi and his family  were exactly the kind of people whom this country historically has been  able to rescue from war-torn countries, from terror, and from torture.  His family had experienced torture. His children were later returned to  Syria and would face potential death.   He went through all of the processes that we asked him to go through.  He didn't go into the shadows. He didn't hide. He applied for asylum  status. It was granted in 2015. He filed forms that would allow for his  wife and two daughters to follow. Those visas were issued last Tuesday,  on January 24.   Originally, they had a flight that was scheduled to bring his wife  and these two little girls to the United States today, but last week,  when Fadi learned of the potential for this Executive order, he paid  $1,000 to move their flight up to Friday. His two little girls and his  wife got on a flight from Jordan to Kiev, Ukraine, and eventually to  the United States. But once in Kiev, their passports and their visas  were taken from them. They were sent to CBP. Their visas were rejected,  and they were returned to Jordan.   These two little girls are back in their old apartment, but they got  rid of all their furniture. They got rid of all their clothes. Their  neighbors have temporarily given them mattresses to sleep on. They  don't even know where their suitcases are. Their father, who is ready  to greet them at the airport here in the United States, may never see  them.   They are scared to death. I have two little boys who are the exact  same age. I have an 8-year-old. I have a 5-year-old. I think about what  these two little girls went through, getting ready to finally go see  their dad who had gone through an epic struggle to try to find  someplace in this world where his two little girls could be safe. He  found it. He found it in America. He found it in my State of  Connecticut.   He found it, just like hundreds of thousands of other people who fled  war-ravaged Europe, who fled the bombing in Vietnam, who left Albania  and Kosovo to come live a better life just like they found. He was  ready to go to the airport to welcome his two little girls, and they  were told that they are not leaving. You are not going to see your dad.  You are going to go back to Jordan and, potentially, eventually back to  Syria.   Imagine what those little girls went through. Imagine millions of  other little boys and girls like them who had in their mind this place  called America, a place that would welcome them, who would rescue them  from the disaster that had become their lives.   Imagine that dream that was literally hours away for these two little  girls extinguishing, and extinguishing for millions of others like them  all around this planet. It is up to us whether that light which  flickered off on Friday relights. It is up to us as to whether we  rekindle the American dream, that idea of America from our founding.  This is not irreversible. These two little girls, you could bring them  here. We could choose to bring them here. It is up to us.   There is legislation on the floor of the Senate right now as we speak  that would rescind this order. It is our decision, right? There are 100  of us. There are only 435 down the hall. There are only 535 of us. It  is our decision whether these two little girls come to the United  States or they go back to their war-ravaged home that their father  left. It is up to us. It is not up to the President of the United  States alone. He does not get to make these decisions by himself.   Democracy allows for us to make a different decision. It is up to us.  I believe we can do it. I believe we can bring these girls here. I  believe we can undo the damage that has been done to this country's  security. I believe we can get back on a path such that ISIS remains on  its heels. I believe we can recapture that idea of that farmer who came  to this country from a far-off land who looked in amazement at the  amalgam of cultures and peoples and religions that was America.   I know this sounds like hyperbole. I know there are a lot of people  out there who say: Wait a second. This is only temporary. It is only  for a few months. It is only for a few countries. But people are  listening and watching. Which direction are we heading? Do we really  care about the things we have always cared about? Millions upon  millions of people, all cross this country and all across this world  are watching. What do we do?   Is this a partisan issue or can we commit ourselves together to stand  up for those basic ideas of America's founding? There are two little  girls who are watching most closely, who are watching to see if we can  rise above partisanship and deliver to them the promise that has been  made real for millions and millions of Americans who call this place  home.   I yield the floor.
