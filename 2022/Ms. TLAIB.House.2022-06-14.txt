 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, during Pride Month, to honor  the phenomenal Ruth Ellis, a former Detroit resident who was the oldest  surviving open lesbian and an LGBTQ rights activist.   Born in 1899, and living until the age of 101, she came out as a  lesbian around 1915. She took in LGBTQ-plus youth experiencing  homelessness and displacement, and her home became known as ``the gay  spot.''   Not only did she give refuge to our youth, but she provided them  books, food, and even assistance with their college tuition. She was an  icon.   Still today, LGBTQ-plus youth experience homelessness at a  disproportionate rate. The Ruth Ellis Center in Highland Park was  created in the 13 District Strong and was named after and in honor of  Ms. Ellis. They provide safe, affordable, identity-affirming housing  for marginalized Black and Brown Detroiters, especially our LGBTQ-plus  youth. Join me today in honoring and recognizing Ruth Ellis and the  incredible advocacy of the Ruth Ellis Center and their incredible team.                      Celebrating the Life of Greg Mudge     Mr. Speaker, today, I celebrate the memory of Greg Mudge,  a longtime community advocate and businessowner in Detroit, who we  tragically lost last year. Greg was a beloved member of our community,  and his sudden death was a shock to us all.   When he first opened Mudgie's Deli back in 2008, Greg was already  considered a member of our community. A food service veteran himself,  he built and managed his own business with the heart and soul of  family. His approach was ``all hands on deck,'' and he never shied away  from any task and was always ready to give a helping hand.   Greg's commitment to serving homemade food, including incorporating  family recipes, made Mudgie's Deli a neighborhood standout. More than  that, Greg's enthusiasm and passion for his work shined through in all  that he did. Greg Mudge embodied the spirit of our beautiful southwest  Detroit community and our Corktown neighborhood. Please join me in  honoring his memory.                            ____________________
