 Madam Speaker, our country is still battling the opioid  epidemic, and every day we hear heartbreaking stories of those lost to  overdoses during this crisis. Congress must remain vigilant in the  fight against opioids, especially synthetic fentanyl from China.   China is the heart of the global fentanyl supply chain, and most  fentanyl trafficked into the United States is produced in China.  Sometimes Chinese fentanyl is shipped directly into our country, and  other times it is brought across our northern and southern borders by  smugglers working with Chinese drug dealers.   It only takes a small amount of fentanyl to overdose, and  unsuspecting drug users often purchase drugs cut with fentanyl. More  and more Americans are dying from synthetic opioid overdoses. There  were an estimated 31,000 deaths in 2018.   The Chinese Government needs to go after the massive fentanyl  operation in their country and should execute the dirtbag fentanyl drug  dealers, smugglers, and producers.    I was a cosponsor of the Fentanyl Sanctions Act, which was included  in the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, which gives the  President the authority to impose sanctions against countries failing  to do their part to stop illegal opioid traffic. If the Chinese  Government wants to avoid sanctions, they must bring the lowlifes  running this massive fentanyl operation to justice.                            ____________________
