 Mr. President, it is Thursday. I know the pages know  this, and many people watching know this, but it is that time of the  day in the Senate when I come down on the Senate floor and talk about  somebody who makes my State a very unique and special place--and it is  an opportunity for me to talk a little bit about what is going on in  Alaska right now, particularly before the holidays--somebody we refer  to in Alaska and here in the Senate as the Alaskan of the Week.   Before I get into this very special Alaskan, I will give you a little  weather update. A lot of people like to understand what is going on.  Winter has come. It is coming to Alaska. Snow has arrived throughout  much of the State. In Southcentral Alaska it has come. Anchorage is  covered in snow. A lot of people are getting ready to undertake winter.  Sports and activities on Monday in Utqiagvik, the northernmost point in  North America--it used to be called Point Barrow--the Sun rose and set  for the last time until January 23. So it is going to be dark up there,  but they are used to that. They are great people. The community has now  officially settled in for a bit of a dark Arctic winter, but they have  been doing that for a millennium.   It is a winter wonderland right now throughout Alaska. So I always  encourage people watching, watching on TV, to come on up. Summer,  winter, fall, spring, come on up and visit. You will love it. It will  be the trip of a lifetime.   As I mentioned before, I think I come from the most beautiful State  in the country, but it is also a place made up of the most important,  caring, wonderful, generous, and supportive people anywhere. Some of  these people have had ancestors living in Alaska for thousands and  thousands of years. Others arrived more recently but immediately found  a home in a community that they were supportive of and was supportive  of them.   Let me introduce you to Rosemary Habeich. Her friends call her Rosie.  She is an extraordinary Alaskan who has done extraordinary things for  our people. She is our Alaskan of the Week.   What has she done? What is extraordinary about Rosie?   Let me just mention one off the top, which is pretty remarkable-- fostering over 50 Alaskan children with her husband, Eben Hobson, Jr. I  should add here that Eben is the son of the first mayor of Alaska's  North Slope Borough and someone who has also fought for the rights of  Alaska Natives throughout his life. He deserves mention, as well as his  wife, as a legendary Alaskan.   Not only did Rosie and Eben foster all these children, they adopted  three, and raised five of their own children. That is a crowded  household but a kind, loving, supportive and warm household--a place of  love.   I can say here that the recommendation for Rosie to be our Alaskan of  the Week comes from our First Alaskans Institute fellow, Elizabeth  Ahkivgak, who is right here with me and who has done a great job in my  office.   Elizabeth is one of dozens and dozens of children Rosie and Eben took  into their bright home and loved them so much so they could love  themselves.   Let me tell you a little bit about Rosie, our Alaskan of the Week.  She was born in Idaho. Like too many Americans, unfortunately, she  actually came from a broken home. Her mother was battling an illness  and sometimes was too sick to handle Rosie and her siblings.   It was during one of those bouts of illness that Rosie herself  briefly became a foster child. That experience, the experience of  visiting her mother in an institution, and the kindness of neighbors  who stepped up and helped during those very difficult years would form  the basis of Rosie's steadfast belief that helping others in your  community throughout your State is a higher calling.   Eventually, Rosie moved with her family to Fairbanks when she was  just a young girl. Those were good years for her and her family. She  thrived in Alaska, went to college, and became a social worker for the  State. Eventually, her work took her to Utqiagvik--as I mentioned,  formerly Barrow, AK--where she fell in love both with her husband,  Eben, and with the community.   She found in Utqiagvik that if you had a good idea and were willing  to do the work and see it through, you could succeed with the help of  others, and she did succeed.   At various points during her time in the North Slope Borough of our  great State, she worked as the director of the city's rec department,  director of the health department, and executive director of the Alaska  Eskimo Whaling Commission. She also sat on the board for the Rural  Alaska Community Action Plan. She was a public health nurse and was  appointed director of the North Slope Borough Health Department by two  different mayors. That is an impressive resume, as you see.   She now spends much of her time in Anchorage, where she volunteers  for a group called Friends in Serving Humanity, or F.I.S.H.--a church  network that feeds the hungry. On many days, you can find her in  different communities handing out meals and food boxes often paid for  out of her own pocket.   Rosie gives her all to everything she does, but one of her truly  lasting contributions to Alaska and to her community is how she has  taken in so many children across the State who need a home, who need  support, and who need love. She took in siblings. She took in infants.  She took in teenagers. She took them from all backgrounds, from all  across the State, and she loved them. She was patient with them. She  intuitively understood what they needed and when they needed it. Some  of the children she took in were horribly abused, most others were  homesick, and some were confused.   In Alaska, getting running water to households across the State has  long been a major challenge, one we are still working on today. If you  can believe this--this is certainly one of my passions in the Senate-- we have over 30 communities in Alaska with no flush toilets, no water  and sewer--in America. Many of the children who came to Rosie were from  these kinds of households and these kinds of communities. Many had  never flushed a toilet in their lives.    She was sensitive to all this. One of the first things she did when a  child came to her was to teach her how a faucet and a bathroom and a  toilet worked. Then she fed them. Rosie's cooking is renowned. She  listened to them and loved them.  [[Page S6746]]    This is how one of her former foster children described the  experience of walking into Rosie's home:         Imagine coming from a place with nothing--absolutely       nothing, [poverty]--and you walk into a normal house, filled       with normal things that people and the rest of America take       for granted--a warm house, a flush toilet, food on the stove,       adults who speak to you [kindly]. It was like visiting a toy       store for the first time. It was like visiting a different       planet. It showed us what [a good] life could be like.    Not all of Rosie's kids made it out of a life of challenges and  dysfunction and abuse, but many of them have. Many have broken the  cycle of violence in their families for the first time. Some of them,  along with their biological children and the ones she has adopted, are  now doing great things for our State and our country. They are  successfully running businesses. They have joined the military. They  have worked at high levels of government. One of them, who is sitting  right here next to me on the Senate floor, works in my office. We are  lucky to have Elizabeth.   All of them, regardless of where they are now ``have a place in my  heart,'' says Rosie. Why does she do it? Why has this woman given  herself to so many others and changed so many lives?   She tells a story about a time when her mother was sick and had to go  back into the institution, leaving her to take care of her four younger  siblings. It was Christmastime, and Rosie literally had nothing. So the  neighbors got together, left boxes of presents at the door of their  house, and brought over Christmas dinner when she was young and needed  help. ``That's the way life is supposed to be,'' Rosie said. ``You're  supposed to recognize when people have less than you, and you are  supposed to help them out. It doesn't matter if you're looking at it  through a biblical lens, or through karma, or through Buddha. Giving is  fundamental.'' That is her quote: ``Giving is fundamental.''   All the Senators here today are heading home and heading back to the  great States they represent for Thanksgiving, which we will be  celebrating next week--a uniquely American holiday that all of us love  and cherish so much. I know I certainly do. Rosie and Eben's story and  commitment to others are exactly the kinds of things we as Americans  should be thankful for as we are celebrating Thanksgiving next week.  Giving is fundamental. I know I am thankful for what they have done.   Their household will be full this holiday season--friends, family,  children. At some point this season, she will make her famous apple  sausage stuffing, a recipe she learned from her own foster mother and  one she has passed down to foster kids all across the great State of  Alaska. It is made with love and with kindness and with thanksgiving.   Rosie, thank you for all you have done. From the bottom of my heart,  thanks for your spirit, your generosity, and your example as we head  into Thanksgiving weekend, for touching so many lives across Alaska.  Congratulations on being our Alaskan of the Week and happy  Thanksgiving.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Elizabeth  Ahkivgak, an intern in my office, be granted floor privileges for the  remainder of the day.
