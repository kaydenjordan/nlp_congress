 Mr. President, will the Senator yield?    Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding.   Mr. President, deciding whether to confirm a President's nominee for  the highest Court in the land is a responsibility I take very  seriously. Over the past few weeks, I have met with Judge Gorsuch,  listened to the Judiciary Committee's hearings, and reviewed his record  with an open mind. I have real concerns with his thinking on protecting  the right to vote and allowing unlimited money in political campaigns.  In addition, I am concerned that the judge will not protect the rights  of the everyday average citizen when they come up against large  corporate interests. Judge Gorsuch has consistently sided with  corporations over employees, as in the case of a freezing truck driver  who, contrary to common sense, Judge Gorsuch would have allowed to be  fired for abandoning his disabled rig during extreme weather  conditions.   I will vote no on the motion to invoke cloture and, if that succeeds,  I will vote no on his confirmation.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have already cast my ``no'' vote with  regard to the judge and will so again whenever we get to final passage,  but I want to take this opportunity to talk about the chaos that is  going on in Venezuela.   As if there weren't already enough chaos, last week Venezuela's  supreme court stripped its legislative branch of its powers--just  stripped them of powers. Only because the court had gotten such  significant criticism did it reverse its decision. Apparently even the  very shaky President of Venezuela, Maduro, weighed in to get them to  reverse their decision. Now, isn't that something? This is supposed to  be a democracy. Yet it is being run as a dictatorship, where even the  judicial branch goes and does something crazy and the President of the  country gets up and tells them: You had better reverse yourself; there  is too much criticism.   This is the nonsense that is going on in Venezuela. Of course, what  went on last week further undermines Venezuela's so-called democracy,  and it is only the latest in President Maduro's creeping dictatorship.  That is what it is.   He has repeatedly and violently suppressed protesters and jailed his  political opponents in violation of any understanding of human rights.  He has used that same Supreme Court to block members of the National  Assembly from taking office, and he has used that Supreme Court as a  rubberstamp to overturn the laws that the National Assembly does that  he doesn't like. Isn't it a sad state that Venezuela has reached?   The President has also thwarted opposition efforts to recall him,  President Maduro, in a national referendum. In so doing, he was able to  appoint a Vice President with ties to Hezbollah, and now a Vice  President it appears that he has sanctioned for drug trafficking.   Meanwhile, the poor Venezuelan people suffer the consequences of the  political, humanitarian, and economic  [[Page S2405]]  crisis. Venezuelans are dying because of severe shortages of food and  medicine and other products. The economy is in freefall, and crime and  corruption are rampant.   Last year, 18,000 Venezuelans sought asylum in the United States-- more than any other nationality. The United States stands clearly on  the side of the Venezuelan people in calling on President Maduro to  cease undermining democracy, release all political prisoners, respect  the rule of law, and respect human rights.   There obviously is no sign that he is going to be doing this. What  should we do? First of all, we ought to get our Secretary of State to  work with the international community, including the Organization of  American States, to help resolve this crisis and alleviate the  suffering of the Venezuelan people.   That is the first order of business, to try to eliminate the  suffering of people. It is all so true; whenever a dictator takes  control, as has happened in Venezuela, it is the people who suffer  first.   Additionally, I am suggesting and I am calling on the administration  to fully enforce and, where appropriate, expand the sanctions on those  responsible for continued violence and human rights violations that are  perpetrated against the people.   It is very interesting. A lot of these so-called big guys in  Venezuela love to travel. They love to have bank accounts. They love to  come to Miami. They love to have U.S. bank accounts. Let's slap some  severe economic sanctions on these guys. The situation is increasingly  dire, and we must stand with the Venezuelan people in their struggle  for democracy and human rights.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, while we have a lull in the debate, I want  to take an opportunity to talk about healthcare. Since we had an utter  inability of the House of Representatives to come together on any kind  of healthcare bill, this Senator would suggest that instead of the  mantra ``repeal and replace,'' since now that seems to be dead, why  don't we take the existing law that has provided a lot of things for  the average citizen? For the average person in my State of Florida, it  means a great deal to have the availability of health insurance, which  they never had and can now afford.   There need to be fixes to the law known as the Affordable Care Act  that was passed several years ago. Indeed, one of those fixes could be  a kind of ``smoothing fund,'' that as the insurance companies vie for  this business on the State exchanges, they would be able to have this  fund as a resource for them to get over some of the humps--also,  certainly for some of the insureds.   Just because you are at 400 percent of poverty and therefore no  longer eligible for some of the subsidies to enable you to buy health  insurance--and, by the way, for a single individual, that is only about  $47,000 a year of income--the person who makes $47,000, $50,000 a year  can't afford to go out and spend $8,000, $10,000, $11,000 on a health  insurance policy.   We need to adjust that--in other words, fix that as well. There needs  to be an additional fix of a subsidy for the people who are just over  400 percent of poverty. To translate that another way, for a family of  four, that is only about $95,000 a year. On a tight budget like that,  they simply can't afford health insurance. They need some help.   With a few little fixes like that to the existing law--the Affordable  Care Act--we could get this thing tuned up and, indeed, continue to  provide what we need in order for people to have healthcare.   One other fix: There are about 4 million people in the country who,  if their State legislatures and their Governor would expand Medicaid-- and some of those Governors are now expressing interest in doing this-- under the Federal law up to 138 percent of poverty, 4 million more  people would be covered with healthcare. In my State of Florida alone,  there are 900,000 people who otherwise would be getting healthcare who  do not because the government in the State of Florida has refused to  expand Medicaid coverage up to 138 percent of poverty.   How much is that? For a single individual, that is someone making  about $16,000 a year. A person like that can't afford health insurance.  A person like that can't afford any kind of paying for any healthcare.   What happens to them? When they get sick, they wait and wait to try  to cure themselves because they can't pay a doctor. When the sickness  turns into an emergency, they end up in the emergency room and then, of  course, it is uncompensated care and the hospital eats it. The  hospital, of course, passes that uncompensated care on to all the rest  of us who are paying our premiums on health insurance.   It makes sense to do this. With a few fixes, we would be able to tune  up the existing law to provide the healthcare that most of us want to  provide. It seems to me that it is common sense, and it is common sense  that can be done in a bipartisan way. It is my hope and my prayer that  the Senate and the House will come together and ultimately do this.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
