 Madam President, I rise this afternoon to supplement some  remarks I made on the floor last evening about the Affordable Care Act.  Last night, I talked about my own experience as a young staff member in  the U.S. Senate 43 years ago when, because I had an insurance policy  provided by my employer--that policy had preventive care as part of the  policy, just as Affordable Care Act policies do today--I had a routine  physical checkup. It was the first I had in a number of years, which  caught malignant melanoma, a particularly virulent form of cancer.  Because it was caught early and because I was treated, here I am today.   As I mentioned last night, it has always haunted me that someone who  didn't have insurance, a young man or a young woman somewhere in the  country who was in exactly my situation, because they didn't have  insurance, they didn't have preventive care, didn't get the checkup,  the disease wasn't caught, and they are gone.   I find it very hard to justify that, to understand that. It doesn't  seem fair. It doesn't seem ethical. It doesn't seem moral. Today I  wanted to also bring to the attention of the Senate some stories from  today about the effect of the Affordable Care Act in Maine, where we  have over 80,000 people enrolled, many of whom had never been able to  have insurance before.   A young woman, Whitney, who graduated from college in 2013, said:         I graduated . . . with a degree in wildlife ecology, [but       it was very difficult to find a job.]        Thanks to the ACA, I was able to stay on my family health       insurance plan through this period of unemployment. I did       finally get employed in my field, but permanent, year-round       jobs with benefits are the equivalent of winning the lottery.   [[Page S194]]     Many young people are in that situation. It even has a name. It is  called the gig economy, people who work gigs, who work short periods of  time, several months here, several months there, but there are no  benefits attached to those jobs. She said:         Many of us work seasonal jobs, building trails on the       Appalachian Trail, rescuing lost hikers, managing volunteers,       and running programs for veterans to reconnect with Maine's       woods. We do good work in this state. Before the ACA we       worked dangerous outdoor jobs that only provided minimum       worker's comp. . . . But with the ACA and the tax credit, I       could afford a silver plan, I could get dental for my teeth,       could go to the doctor again, get flu shots and get my joints       looked at.    It is important to realize that without the ACA, this young woman  would have literally no options. A health savings account is  unrealistic for somebody who is making $15,000 to $20,000 a year.  Buying insurance across State lines isn't going to help this young  woman.   She said getting the ACA coverage ``was life changing. I know it is  not perfect but I am terrified of going back to [where we were] before,  where health and financial ruin was one wrong step away.''   Another letter from an older adult:         My wife is sixty-three years old she is no longer able to       work full time. She has had major back surgery and has       arthritis in her neck. Because of these health issues she had       to reduce her work hours.    Here is the catch-22. She had to reduce her work hours. Therefore,  her employer dropped her from her health care coverage.         We were fortunate [enough] to obtain coverage for her       through the Affordable Care Act. It is expensive and is not       the best coverage--    Nobody in this body says it is best possible result and that the law  is perfect. We all agree it needs to be repaired and fixed and  modified. The writer goes on to say--       but it is good enough for us to know that a major health       issue will not bankrupt us.        We are appealing to you as our representative to insure       that a reasonable replacement will be put in place when the       Affordable Care Act is ended. Better yet, improve it, don't       destroy it.    I couldn't have said it better myself. Donald, in his letter to me,  says: ``Better yet, improve it, don't destroy it.'' That is what we  ought to be talking about.   This letter is from a fellow named Ryan in North Central Maine. He  also makes an important point about the Affordable Care Act. The term  that I refer to is ``job lock.'' There are hundreds of thousands, if  not millions, of people in this country who are locked into the jobs  they have that they don't really like, that isn't giving them the  satisfaction they want because they can't afford to leave their health  care.   One of the hidden benefits of the Affordable Care Act is it has  allowed those people to follow their dreams, to start a business and  not have to worry about having health insurance. This is an  entrepreneur in Maine, a small business person. He said:         Affordable healthcare is a major roadblock to those       calculating whether they can take the leap to become self-      employed. As we prepare for next year's ice cream season, I       am about to leave my benefit-providing job in order to commit       to making the volume of ice cream we need. This is a scary       and questionable decision given our financial situation and       the fact that we are raising our two small children of four       and seven years old. The first comment I hear from everyone       who finds out I am leaving my job is, ``Are you sure? What       are you going to do about health insurance??''    The answer is, the Affordable Care Act. It enables this young man,  this gentleman, to follow his dream, to start his business, to commit  to his business, and this is good for the country. This is a hidden  benefit that is rarely discussed about the Affordable Care Act to allow  people to give vent to their dreams and their innovation and their  contribution to the economy.   Here is how he ends his letter. He says:         Please don't let me down. Please don't let my family down.       Please don't let down the millions of families who really are       on the bottom of this country and are the very ones that all       of you from every party claim to support. I don't care about       the details of how it gets done, whether the ACA is thrown       out, or just revised, or what compromises have to be made by       either party, but please make sure there is a health care       option available and that it is at an affordable price for       those of us with the guts to take a stab at our own small       business. The key is ``Affordable Care.'' It matters.    As in my own case, health insurance also saves lives. There was a  study done by the Journal of Public Health in 2009, which basically  concluded that for every million people without health insurance, there  are a thousand premature deaths. It is pretty easy math. Before the  Affordable Care Act, we had 45 million people without health insurance  in this country. The calculation in this extensive study was that  46,000 deaths were attributable to not having health insurance. I am  living proof of that. If I hadn't had health insurance, I would be  gone. With the disease that I had, either you catch it in time or you  are a goner. That is why I am so passionate about this.   We would not let people die in our front yards. If we saw somebody  who was in danger of losing their life, we wouldn't stand by. Nobody in  this body would stand by and say: Sorry, we can't help you. But not  providing health insurance to people is a death sentence to 10, 20, 30,  40,000 people.   The Affordable Care Act is now covering something like 25 million  people. That is 25,000 lives saved. If we take it away, it will be  25,000 lives lost.   Here's the letter:         I am a Maine woman in my late 30s, who works 2 part-time       jobs and also run my own business.        Because we were on [ACA] health insurance that had an       affordable deductible, after not feeling well for a while, my       husband went to a doctor and had a CT scan of his lungs. . .       . It turned out he had a very rare form of an illness, even       though he was only 38 at the time. Had we not had this       insurance and such an affordable premium and deductible, he       would never have gotten that CT scan done. This insurance       saved his life and covered every expense we've had over the       last 2 years with multiple stays at MidCoast Hospital and       Maine Med, 2 surgeries, pick-lines, medications, therapies,       the list goes on. There is no cure for what he has but he's       doing better now, thanks to the ACA.    Another person from Maine:         My sisters and I watched my mom die. We were physically in       the room when it happened. We cried for probably half an hour       straight.        Before the Affordable Care Act, most of her illnesses were       considered pre-existing conditions. She survived cancer three       times . . . but had to pay exorbitant monthly premiums just       to have to pay most of her treatment out of pocket.    He said:         I don't care about the ACA because of some theory or       ideology. I watched my mom die, sooner than she needed to,       because she couldn't afford to get preventative care early       enough. I watched my mom die because market solutions refused       to solve her problems. An open insurance market actively       refused to compete to cover my mom. The insurance market       before the ACA is one of a number of factors that led to my       mom's death.        This is a real, physical, immediate memory for me whenever       someone talks about healthcare, and it always comes to mind       when people talk about it in vague terms and market forces. I       am crying even as I write this, and it has been years.    He writes to me:         I am begging you, as a son who watched his mom who was       younger than you--    Than me--       die in a hospital because she couldn't afford the care she       needed, please protect the Affordable Care Act. Protect it as       a legislator, protect it by recognizing how appointments you       choose to confirm or deny will affect my family's ability to       stay healthy and alive. Through grants and research, you've       worked to improve access to health care. Please, protect the       ACA.    Another one--one more. This is a letter I received just back in the  fall, a little before Christmas:         I have an incurable, generally non-lethal form of bone       cancer and have been under treatment for over 12 years. The       multiple surgeries [and costs] . . . I cannot afford to pay       for ongoing treatment without insurance. I am very pleased       the current ACA does not allow for ``preexisting       disqualification'' and I would hate to see that removed.       Having this condition is naturally stressful, debilitating       and undesired. I do not want or need the added stress of       having to worry about the details of coverage.        Additionally I have two boys, aged 23 and 26, both of whom       have benefited from remaining on our family insurance policy.       That is a great policy and my boys are healthier as a result.        Finally, access to quality health care is and must be a       right as it benefits both the individual and society. Health       is key to happiness and success and happy successful people       pay taxes, support the government, [and] give back to the       community.    I understand the debate that surrounded this. I understand the  emotion. I understand the pressure that people feel in order to  maintain a campaign promise or to meet promises  [[Page S195]]  made over the last several years. But we are not talking about maybe  what will happen; we are talking about real cases, real people. I am  talking about real people in Maine, in small towns and cities. I am  talking about rural hospitals that are on the verge of being rendered  financially incapacitated because if this law is repealed, it will take  away a significant part of their support. I am talking about seniors  having to pay more for drugs. But mostly, I am talking about people's  lives.   These cases are people who can give specific examples. There are  thousands, tens of thousands, and millions that we can't articulate-- people who are saved who don't even know it because they went in to get  that checkup, who are saved the stress of wondering how they are going  to pay for some kind of treatment.   As a parent, I remember having to stress about whether to take my  child to a doctor because I didn't know whether I could afford to pay  that bill. Yet we all know that is the proper course. We shouldn't have  to make those kinds of choices. We have a vehicle, imperfect as it is.  Imperfect as it is, we have a vehicle for providing that care.   Let's slow down. Let's take a breath and say: OK. We talked about  repeal, but it isn't really practical. We can't harm that many people.  Let's talk about what we are going to replace it with. The idea that we  are going to repeal it today and replace it 3 years from now is just  cruel. That is what I am hearing from people: Don't put us through  that. People who finally got insurance after preexisting conditions,  who have insurance and have a condition now--they depend upon that  insurance. Let's not make them go through that pressure, the financial  anxiety added to the health anxiety. We have an opportunity to rise  above politics. This really shouldn't be political or a policy or  something that divides us.   There is nobody in this body who wants to see people suffer, who  wants to unnecessarily put people through the pressure of both health  problems and financial problems. We ought to be able to find a  solution. Every other industrialized country in the world has found a  solution. It is not like this is some impenetrable box.   I realize that part of the solution has to involve controlling costs  and facing the fact that we pay twice as much for health care per  capita as anyone else in the world. That is an issue the Affordable  Care Act does not sufficiently address, in my view, and we have to talk  about that.   In the meantime, let us remember those people who are counting on us  for their very lives. That is a commitment I believe we can respect and  should meet.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.
