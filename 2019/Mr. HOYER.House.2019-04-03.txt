 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I want to thank all of those who have been involved in  getting this to the floor. This bill is a critically important bill  and, unfortunately, its authorization expired last year. It is timely  that we bring it to the floor. I am hopeful that it passes.   Mr. Chairman, I was proud to be a cosponsor of the original Violence  Against Women Act in 1994. It passed on a bipartisan vote in the House.  It was reauthorized in 2000 with a vote--and everybody ought to note  this--that passed 371-1. And in 2005, it was reauthorized and passed  415-4 and signed, of course, by President Bush.   Democrats fought hard to expand the law's protections to immigrant  women, Native Americans, and LGBT people, and we did so in 2013 with  bipartisan support once more. We want to protect all of our women,  whatever their particular difference.   I was disappointed that the law's authorization expired at the end of  fiscal year 2018. It is critical that we enact a long-term  reauthorization of the law without further delay in order to provide  that certainty that another short-term extension cannot.   This legislation was introduced by Representative Karen Bass. It is a  5-year reauthorization. The gentlewoman from Texas, who just spoke, Ms.  Jackson Lee, did a lot of work on this bill in the Judiciary Committee  as well. I thank her for her leadership in this effort.   Her bill--and I speak of Congresswoman Bass--would improve on current  law by expanding existing grants that make communities safer and  protect vulnerable populations, including Native American women.   Why wouldn't we do that? I can't think of a reason.   It would also improve economic assistance and security for survivors  struggling with unemployment or financial hardship due to an abusive  relationship to which they had been exposed.   It would also ensure that the Department of Justice's Office on  Violence Against Women remains open and is not merged into another  office or de-emphasized.   And, very importantly, the bill closes loopholes in gun laws to help  prevent intimate partner homicides, an all too frequent happening.   According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, on  average, nearly 20 people every minute are physically abused by an  intimate partner in the United States. That is a tragedy and a crisis.   One in four women experience severe intimate partner physical  violence. And one in seven have been stalked by an intimate partner to  the point at which she felt very fearful or believed that she, or  someone close to her, would be harmed or killed.   The presence of a gun in a domestic violence situation increases the  risk of homicide by 500 percent. That is why we aim to close gun  loopholes by expanding the definition of intimate partners to include  dating or former dating partners.   It is also why this bill has language preventing anybody convicted of  a misdemeanor crime of stalking from obtaining a gun.   I am deeply disappointed that some Republican Members of this House  are using the NRA as cover to vote against this reauthorization which  has been overwhelmingly, in a bipartisan fashion, reauthorized over and  over again.   These are commonsense protections that prevent domestic abusers from  obtaining the guns that have, sadly, been used so frequently to harm or  kill their partners.   Mr Chairman, I urge every Member to vote for this reauthorization.  Let's make this renewal of the Violence Against Women Act as strongly  bipartisan as the House's support for the law used to be. Let's send a  resounding message that the House stands with the victims and survivors  and law enforcement and will do its job to help them and to prevent  domestic violence and abuse, which have no place in our society, but  are, tragically, too often, perpetrated in our country.   Mr. Chairman, let's make it safer for women, for families, and for  the children they care for. Let's pass this bill. Let's reauthorize the  Violence Against Women Act.                                time  1515
