 Mr. President, by now we have all had the chance to read  the report in the Washington Post that alleges stunning behavior on the  part of the President in a meeting with the Russian Ambassador and  Russian Foreign Minister.   According to the report, the President revealed classified  information about a terrorist threat to officials of a foreign  government. The President didn't share it with just any government; the  report states he shared it with the Russian Government, a global  adversary that has violated the sovereignty of peaceful nations,  propped  [[Page S2940]]  up dictators and human rights abusers, including Iran and Syria, and  has been widely proven to have interfered in our elections and the  elections of our allies in Europe.   If this report is indeed true, it would mean that the President may  have badly damaged our national security, nothing less, and in several  ways. First, the act of a disclosure of this type could threaten the  United States' relationships with allies that provide us with vital  intelligence and could result in the loss of this specific intelligence  source.   We rely on intelligence from our allies to keep America safe. America  can't have eyes and ears everywhere. If our allies abroad can't trust  us to keep sensitive information close to the vest, they may no longer  share it with us. That undermines key relationships and, even more  importantly, makes us less safe.   Second, if accurate, such a disclosure could damage our interests in  the Middle East. We do not collaborate with Russia in Syria or  elsewhere in the Middle East for the simple fact that we have diverging  interests. Russia, for example, has worked with Iran to prop up the  brutal Assad regime. Sharing vital intelligence with Russian officials  could allow the Russians to pursue or even possibly eliminate the  source or figure out how the ally conducts operations, including any  against Russia or Russia's allies in the region.   Third, if the report is true, the President's alleged carelessness  with classified information will further damage the relationship  between the White House and the intelligence community--an essential  relationship for the security of America. The intelligence community  needs to be able to trust the President and trust that he will treat  classified information with caution and with care. Our intelligence  professionals put their lives on the line every day to acquire  information that is critical to our national security and critical to  keeping Americans safe. They have done a very good job.   If the reporting is accurate, in one fell swoop, the President could  have unsettled our allies, emboldened our adversaries, endangered our  military and intelligence officers the world over, and exposed our  Nation to greater risk.   Given the gravity of the matter, we need to be able to quickly assess  whether this report is true and what exactly was said. So I am calling  on the White House to make the transcript of the meeting with the  Russian Foreign Minister and Ambassador available to the congressional  Intelligence Committees as soon as possible. The White House should  make the transcript of the meeting available immediately to the  congressional Intelligence Committees. If the President has nothing to  hide, he should direct that the transcript of the meeting be made  available.   The Members who sit on those committees have the necessary clearances  to review the transcript and any related summary of the President's  meeting with the Russians. I agree with the senior Senator from Maine  that this briefing should happen immediately. Those committees would be  able to help establish the facts before we grapple with the potential  consequences.   Last night, the administration issued several overlapping denials.  Some questioned the overall veracity of the account. Some took pains to  specifically deny certain accusations but not others. This morning, the  President tweeted a version of events that undercut his advisers'  carefully worded denials and seems to confirm the reports that he had  shared the information in question.   Following so closely after Mr. Comey's firing, which was rationalized  to the press and the American public in several different ways over the  course of a week, this administration now faces a crisis of  credibility. The President has told us that we cannot take at face  value the explanations of some of his key advisers, but the events of  the past week have taken this to an untenable extreme. The timelines  and rationales in the administration contradict one another. The truth,  as it were, sits atop shifting sands in this administration.   We need the transcripts to see exactly what the President said, given  the conflicting reports from the people in the room. Producing the  transcripts is the only way for this administration to categorically  prove the reports untrue.   Mr. President, there is a crisis of credibility in this  administration which will hurt us in ways almost too numerous to  elaborate. At the top of the list is an erosion of trust in the  Presidency and trust in America by our friends and allies. The  President owes the intelligence community, the American people, and the  Congress a full explanation. The transcripts, in my view, are a  necessary first step. Until the administration provides the unedited  transcript, until the administration fully explains the facts of this  case, the American people will rightly doubt if their President can  handle our Nation's most closely kept secrets.    I yield the floor.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority whip.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in a week full of revelation after  revelation, on a day when we thought things couldn't get any worse,  they have. I was shaken by the report in the New York Times that  alleged that the President tried to shut down an active FBI  investigation into a close political associate, and we are only 1 day  removed from stunning allegations that the President may have divulged  classified information to a known adversary.   Concerns about our national security, the rule of law, the  independence of our Nation's highest law enforcement agencies are  mounting. The country is being tested in unprecedented ways.   I say to all of my colleagues in the Senate: History is watching.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
