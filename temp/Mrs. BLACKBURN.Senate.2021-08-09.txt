 Madam President, recently, Francis Collins, who is  the current Director of the National Institutes of Health, said in an  interview:         We call on China to really open up, something they have not       done, and to be more transparent about what could be known       there.    He was, of course, talking about the origins of the COVID-19  pandemic.   I couldn't agree more with Dr. Collins. The world is entitled to know  what happened in Wuhan. However, we have a saying in Tennessee that I  think applies here: What is good for the goose is good for the gander.   Of course, my question to Dr. Collins is, When will we see  transparency from the NIH about its role in the origins of the  pandemic?   On June 28, along with my colleagues Senators Marshall and Grassley,  I wrote to Dr. Collins asking him to open up the books on the NIH's  relationship with Chinese researchers.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed  in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                       June 28, 2021      Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D.,      Director, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.        Dear Dr. Collins: On June 23, 2021, the Wall Street Journal       reported that Chinese researchers ``directed'' the National       Institutes of Health (NIH) ``to delete gene sequences of       early COVID-19 cases from a key scientific database,'' called       the NIH Sequence Read Archive. The article states that NIH       confirmed that it deleted the sequences. The article further       reports that the deleted data includes genomic sequences from       SARS-Co V-2 and that these sequences were from viral samples       collected in Wuhan ``in January and February 2020'' from       patients in the hospital.        This type of data may contain important and relevant       information that could help to better determine the virus's       origins. The efforts by Chinese researchers to delete the       data demands additional explanation. As you are aware, the       Chinese government has failed, from the beginning, to be open       and transparent with the world with respect to its role in       the pandemic.        The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 600,000       deaths, and Congress has spent trillions of dollars to       support the American people, businesses, and the economy       during these difficult times. Simply put, the American people       deserve to know what their government knows about the origins       of this global illness. As part of our continuing oversight       with respect to NIH's role during the COVID-19 pandemic, we       request additional information about the NIH Sequence Read       Archive and the actions taken by Chinese researchers to have       NIH delete SARS-CoV-2 related data. Accordingly, please       answer the following no later than July 12, 2021:        1. Please describe, in detail, how and under what       circumstances data can be provided to the NIH Sequence Read       Archive and how and under what circumstances data can be       deleted from the same.        2. With respect to deleting data from the NIH Sequence       Archive, please name all personnel that have the authority to       do so. In your answer, please provide the names and titles of       the personnel that were involved in the deletion of SARS-Co       V-2 data.        3. With respect to the Wall Street Journal report, which       Chinese researcher(s) requested that the data be deleted from       the NIH Sequence Read Archive? When was the request made and       when did the deletion occur?        4. After deletion, does the NIH Sequence Read Archive       maintain any accessible back-up of the deleted data? If so,       please provide all records to us.        5. Please list all collaborating partners to the NIH       Sequence Read Archive.        6. In the past five years, how many researchers and other       personnel associated with the communist Chinese government       have requested that data be deleted from the NIH Sequence       Read Archive? Please list by requestor, date, reason, and the       information to be deleted. Please also note whether and when       that material was in fact deleted.        7. More specifically, in the past five years, how many       researchers and other personnel associated with the communist       Chinese government have requested that data be deleted from       the NIH Sequence Read Archive relating to coronaviruses?       Please list by requestor, date, reason, and the information       to be deleted. Please also note whether and when that       material was in fact deleted.        Thank you for your attention to this important matter.            Sincerely,      Marsha Blackburn,        U.S. Senator.      Roger Marshall,        U.S. Senator.      Charles E. Grassley,        U.S. Senator.     Madam President, this letter asked Dr. Collins about  news reports that Chinese researchers were allowed to delete data from  a genetic database managed by the NIH. The data they removed included  information about the novel coronavirus that caused the COVID-19  pandemic.   Dr. Collins has not responded to the letter, but this isn't the sort  of allegation the NIH will be able to ignore into nonexistence. We need  a response. We need to know what happened. We need transparency from  the NIH, just as the NIH is asking for transparency from China.   Dr. Collins must reveal what definition of ``gain of function  research'' NIH used when it approved funding for the Wuhan Institute of  Virology back in 2016. We now know that the research we paid for helped  Chinese researchers engineer different versions of coronaviruses.   We also need to know why the Wuhan Institute of Virology was allowed  to do dangerous research with American taxpayer dollars in a  ``biosafety level 2'' lab. In case you are not familiar with this  designation, one scientist compared the safety and security levels of a  biosafety lab 2 to that of a dentist's office.   In 2017, NIH reversed the ban on gain of function research. Why was  NIH allowed to make such an important decision unilaterally?   I was relieved to hear Dr. Collins express support for transparency  from China, but getting answers out of Beijing won't end the  investigation. The American people have suffered for almost 2 years  under the threat of illness and economic collapse. It is not too much  to demand that their own government live up to the same standards we  all agree we should hold our research partners to.  [[Page S6073]]                                       H.R. 3684    Tennesseans want answers from the NIH. They are also still reeling  over the price tag of this infrastructure bill. Over the past few days,  I have gotten a lot of calls and text messages from people back home. I  stood right here and I have spoken about how Tennesseans are confused  about this process. I want to amplify something for those who may not  have caught my remarks.   Tennesseans aren't talking about process or pay-fors. They don't  follow the Senate rules. What they are confused about is why my  Democratic colleagues are in such a rush to spend money we do not have  on projects the American people never asked for.   I don't want my Democratic colleagues to make a mistake and accuse  Tennesseans of not caring about infrastructure. They couldn't be  further from the truth on that one. Tennessee is a logistics State. We  are roads, bridges, rivers, runways, railways. So believe me when I say  Tennesseans care about infrastructure. They are ready to invest in  infrastructure. Indeed, the surface transportation bill we passed out  of Commerce, Science, and Transportation--they like that. But cobbling  together a trillion-dollar vehicle for campaign promises and calling it  infrastructure is not something that passes muster with them.   Several of my Republican colleagues who were allowed to negotiate  this bill have emphasized that this is a bipartisan compromise. We  thank them for their efforts. They want us to understand that it is not  a perfect bill. No bill is ever perfect. All of that is true. We  understand that. We appreciate the efforts that have gone into this.  But, as my colleague from Kansas said, it is not the compromise that is  the problem. It is not the efforts; we appreciate those. It is the fact  that this is a bill that is too expensive to afford.   The minority leader said it best a few months ago when he compared  this bill to a Trojan horse. It looks like one thing, but it is hiding  something you don't want getting past the front door.   For months, the Democratic Party has been very public about their  intentions for the bill. The word ``infrastructure'' no longer has any  meaning when it comes out of their mouths because everything has been  infrastructure at some point--childcare for a while until it took a  back seat to court-packing. Now climate action is infrastructure.   Back home, we deal in truth and consequences. Tennesseans have spent  the past few days looking at everything hunkered down inside this  package, and they know it is not all about infrastructure investment. I  am talking to county mayors. I am talking to State reps. I am talking  to State senators. They are concerned about 5 percent of the bill for  infrastructure and the rest, other projects.   I have spoken numerous times about the ways President Biden and his  faithful lieutenants in Congress have tried to diminish freedom in the  name of progress, but I am compelled to remind my colleagues once again  that the decision to increase government spending is a decision to  increase government involvement and eventually government control. You  cannot have the one without getting the other too.    This isn't investing in the future. If anything, this pattern of  reckless spending will ensure that the version of the American dream so  many of us have enjoyed disappears before our youngest generations are  old enough to sign the dotted line on their driver's license  application. Our Democratic colleagues aren't paving the way to  prosperity for our children and grandchildren with this type of  spending; they are building the gateway to socialism, and this bill can  be seen as a down payment.   Later this week, if all goes according to plan for my colleague from  New York, we will take a vote on a budget that is going to make the  American people think they got a discount on the infrastructure  package. It is another day, another fight over a multitrillion-dollar  spending spree that defies common sense and rejects all notions of  accountability.   If the infrastructure bill was the down payment for that gateway to  socialism, this budget rips the gates off the hinges and invites the  big spenders and central planners to roll right on through. For the low  price of $3.5 trillion, they will have it all: a laundry list of  incentives for government dependency, a foot in the door to our homes  and families, and an excuse to seize power and centralize it right here  in Washington.   My Democratic colleagues really enjoy using the words ``free'' and  ``universal'' to describe their government handouts. We have universal  pre-K, tuition-free community college, universal healthcare, and even a  free path to citizenship for illegal immigrants.   The American people see this for what it is, though. It is bait. In  exchange for your freedom and your autonomy and all your hopes and  dreams, you, too, can become a client of the State. You, too, can live  ``The Life of Julia,'' as depicted in the roundly panned cartoon the  Obama administration created. The left always signals where they are  headed, and, for them, this is their goal, their utopia--total control  from daylight to dark, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for the rest of  your life.   Our public debt is set to hit $45 trillion by 2031--$45 trillion.  Deficits are on track to hit $1.8 trillion--yes, indeed, that is every  year--and no budget gimmick on the books can change that. President  Reagan's warning about the fragile nature of freedom rings especially  true after hearing those numbers.   Here is what he said:         [F]reedom is never more than one generation away from       extinction . . . It [has to] be fought for and defended by       each generation.    What does that mean?   It means we--each of us, individually, collectively, together--has a  duty to future generations to pull out of this skid before we tip the  scales away from freedom and toward levels of government dependency and  control you can't unravel after fixing a 4-year mistake.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, if the past year has taught  us anything, it is that we should cherish the moments of joy and unity  many Americans experienced while watching this year's belated Summer  Olympics. The athletes who earned a spot on Team U.S.A. have also won a  very special place in our history. While many sports fans watch the  Games for the pageantry and spectacle, it is our champions who forge  connections with their countrymen and cultivate a sense of pride and  patriotism.   It is my honor to recognize the following Tennesseans who did their  country proud at the 2021 Tokyo Summer Olympics: Erica Bougard, of  Memphis; Wes Kitts, of Knoxville; Tennys Sandgren, of Gallatin; Alex  Walsh, of Nashville; and Alex Young, of La Vergne.   On behalf of all Tennesseans, I thank these Olympians for their  passion, their perseverance, and their stunning displays of  athleticism.                            ____________________
