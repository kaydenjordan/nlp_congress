 Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a great  education leader in my district, Dr. Patricia Skinner of Gaston  College. She has been president of Gaston College for 25 years, nearly  half of the college's existence.   Over the last two decades, the college has seen tremendous progress.  Dr. Skinner facilitated the opening of two new campuses in addition to  the construction of 11 new academic and administrative buildings and  recently opened the Center for Advanced Manufacturing at the Dallas  campus.   She has done a fantastic and phenomenal job, and we wish her great  success in her retirement. Spending more time with her two daughters  and her grandchildren will put her through the paces as we well know.   We wish Dr. Skinner well in her retirement.                            ____________________     Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for his  support, and I want to thank the chairwoman of the House Financial  Services Committee for her support as well. I am grateful for the work  of Chairwoman Waters and her Financial Services Committee staff for the  hard work they have put in to protect investors and help small  businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I will include in the Record a letter from Republic in  support of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I include the remainder of my statement in  the Record.   I am pleased the House is taking up my legislation and I would like  to thank the gentlewoman from California, the Chairwoman of the  Financial Services Committee, for her co-sponsorship of this bill.   We have worked together on this bill for three Congresses now.   I appreciate all the hard work that she and her staff have done to  make this a bill that works to protect investors and promote small  businesses, particularly in communities that are being left behind.   We all agree small businesses and entrepreneurs are America's true  job creators.   This is especially true in communities I represent in western North  Carolina.   But today, America's small businesses are still struggling to find  capital. Small business lending from traditional banks continues to  decline, and small business loans in America's small towns are less  than half it was merely fifteen years ago.   Investment crowdfunding is one way we can reverse this concerning  trend.   In 2012, I wrote the original bill to legalize investment-based  crowdfunding, making it easier for businesses to raise capital.   That bill became part of the JOBS Act. Unfortunately, the SEC's final  rule contained serious structural flaws that require Congress's  immediate attention.   In particular, crowdfunding is suffering from the so-called ``12-g  problem.'' The ``12 g problem'' refers to a section of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, which subjects crowdfunded companies to  requirements similar to a public company, but at a very low asset  threshold.   Our proposed amendment fixes the ``12-g problem'' by raising the  asset threshold for both small businesses that already have revenue,  and for those startups that do not. This makes it more likely that  high-growth companies will consider crowdfunding as an option for  raising capital.   Another significant problem for crowdfunding is that, under the SEC  rule, single purpose funds are not permitted.   Single purpose funds allow Main street investors to invest along with  more sophisticated lead investors who have an obligation to advocate  for their best interests.   That means better terms and greater transparency for the investors.   A single purpose fund also improves the capitalization table for  companies that hope to attract venture capital in the future.   Although the bill does not include everything I would have hoped, we  worked hard to find a compromise that addresses the most urgent  problems with investment crowdfunding that need correcting now.   To that end, I want to thank Chairwoman Waters again for her  continued support on this important, bipartisan compromise.   This bill shows that we can work together in a bipartisan way to help  American small businesses in seeking to raise capital by connecting  folks not just in their local communities, but across America.   I am pleased that this legislation enjoys support from my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle.   I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
