 Madam Speaker, it is a fundamental ideal of our  republic that every American receives justice under the law. As a  Member of this body, we are required to uphold that ideal, and as a  former judge, I was tasked with the same responsibility. What I have  seen throughout this impeachment process is far from justice.   In fact, this process has lacked impartiality, respect for the United  States Constitution, and fairness. When I was on the bench, I  instructed every jury the same way. I told them that ``what someone  heard from another source other than what they directly observed is not  evidence.'' Rumors and hearsay are not evidence under our laws, and it  certainly shouldn't qualify as evidence in this chamber. The evidence  presented by the Majority in this case is entirely hearsay and  therefore, should be inadmissible. In fact, the only direct evidence  presented to this body is the transcript of President Trump's telephone  call with the Ukraine President.   The Constitution is clear--treason, bribery, high crimes and  misdemeanors are impeachable offenses, and the evidence presented does  not meet those standards. Impeachment is one of the most serious acts  that Congress will undertake. It is not to be taken lightly or to be  used as a political weapon against those you disagree with, but  unfortunately, that is where we find ourselves today. For that reason,  I will not support the articles of impeachment and I also ask my  colleagues to reflect on one thing: in light of what you have observed  about the process used to charge the President, are we upholding  justice?   I think not.
