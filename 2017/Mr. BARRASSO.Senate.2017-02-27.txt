 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, since Inauguration Day, the Senate has  been slow making its way through confirming Cabinet Secretaries.  Democrats, it seems, have used just about every trick in the book to  try to slow down the process. There are Democrats in the Senate who are  delaying things even when other Democrats in the Senate support the  person who has actually been nominated by the President.   (Mr. YOUNG assumed the Chair.)   Remember when President Obama took office, Republicans were far more  willing to let the President have the team he wanted. He had won the  election and was entitled to his Cabinet.   We are now 39 days into President Trump's term, and the Senate has  confirmed now 17 of his nominees--17 over 39 days. President Obama got  20 of his people confirmed in the first 9 days. It does seem the more  the Democrats delay, the more the American people will see the  Democrats are just being childish and spiteful.
