 Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Karthik and  Rahul Chalumuri of Keene as January 2020's Granite Staters of the Month  for their efforts to organize donation drives at their school to  support patients at a local cancer center.   Karthik and Rahul, fraternal twins attending Keene High School, have  been involved in their local community from a young age. When they were  5 years old, their parents brought them to volunteer at their local  soup kitchen, and helped instill in them the importance of giving back  to their community.   As they headed into their senior year at Keene High School, these two  young men decided that they wanted to give back in a big way before  they headed off to college. They founded a club at their school,  Students for Hope, to organize donation drives with the intent  [[Page S274]]  of sending care packages to Cheshire Medical Center's Norris Cotton  Cancer Center-Kingsbury Pavilion, which would distribute the care  packages to their patients. Rahul, who plans to study computer science  in college, designed the group's website from scratch to provide  resources on how to donate.   The group began their first donation drive in August. The brothers  had low expectations for turnout and were shocked when local businesses  and individuals in their community came together to donate a  substantial amount of items for these care packages.   Since then, they have organized two more donation drives around both  Thanksgiving and Christmas and plan to hold another one in February  around Valentine's Day. Although Rahul and Karthik are heading to  college in the fall, they have tapped younger students to lead the  organization next year.   I want to commend Rahul and Karthik for their dedication to improving  the lives of people who are less fortunate and recruiting others to do  the same. I know I join the rest of the Keene community and all Granite  Staters in thanking Rahul and Karthik for exemplifying the all-hands- on-deck spirit of New Hampshire.                            ____________________
