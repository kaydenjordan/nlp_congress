 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor The Salvation Army for  helping the residents of Newark, New Jersey, get through hard times for  the last 138 years.   Today, The Salvation Army operates five locations throughout Newark,  serving each of the city's five wards. The organization serves more  than 5,000 people in the city of Newark, helping them with their  education, food, housing, and life skills.   The Salvation Army's important work is boosted by the Federal  Government's AmeriCorps program. AmeriCorps members, with The Salvation  Army in Newark, provide after-school programs for young people as well.  They work to develop the social and emotional health of Newark's young  people, and they help strengthen children's education.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring the  Salvation Army and AmeriCorps for their work and service to the city of  Newark and the State of New Jersey and the United States of America.                            ____________________
