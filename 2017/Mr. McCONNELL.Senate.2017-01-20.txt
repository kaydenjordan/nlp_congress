 Mr. President, in November's election, the people  called for a new direction, a change from the last 8 years. Today, we  took a meaningful step toward that new direction as we inaugurated a  new President of the United States.   I think it is important for all Americans--regardless of party--to  remember the significance of inauguration day. As we celebrate our  Nation's rich electoral tradition, we can begin to move our country  forward together.   It is always an honor to participate in the historical transition of  power and the ceremonies surrounding it. Today was certainly no  exception. On behalf of the Senate, I wish to express our gratitude to  each individual, from law enforcement personnel to Inaugural Committee  staff, to congressional staff of volunteers whose efforts made this  event a success.   I wish to again congratulate President Trump and Vice President Pence  on today's inauguration. We are eager to work with you and the  administration in advancing policies that can improve the lives of the  American people.   Today marks a new beginning. We are faced with many new  opportunities. We are faced with some new challenges too. I will have  more to say on that in the coming days. For now, the Senate remains  hard at work as we move forward with the confirmation process on  President Trump's nominees. We will have an opportunity to confirm some  today.   It is imperative to proceed with confirmations without delay,  especially when it comes to key national and economic security needs. I  urge colleagues to remember that we worked with the administration of  former President Obama after he was first inaugurated. We confirmed  seven--seven--members of his Cabinet on the day he took office and  nearly the entire Cabinet was filled within 2 weeks.   I wish to say, parenthetically, there is a lot the minority can do at  the very beginning by refusing to give consent to drag this out, and  that is what apparently is occurring here. The nominations we are not  doing are not even controversial.   I would hope the feeling around here would be at least on day one to  have some level of cooperation. We should work in the same spirit with  the current administration and put the rest of President Trump's team  in place as soon as possible. Specifically, it is important that we  confirm General Mattis and General Kelly to their crucial positions as  the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security.   That is not enough. We live in dangerous times. As the Democratic  leader noted earlier just today, ``We face threats foreign and  domestic.'' It is critical for the President to have a full national  security team today, day one. That includes, in particular, the  Director of the CIA. It makes no sense to  [[Page S348]]  leave the post open, not for another week, not for another day, not for  another hour. America's enemies will not pause in plotting, planning,  and training simply because the Democrats refuse to vote. The American  people expect more.   Earlier today, the Director and Deputy Director of the CIA resigned.  They left. They are gone. The Director's job is open and unfilled. We  need to confirm a new Director today. We need to confirm the rest of  the Cabinet as quickly as we can.   Republicans treated a newly inaugurated President Obama's nominees  fairly, and our Democratic friends should do so now. Our country is  counting on it. I am told we want to have some debate about this. We  will have as much debate time, starting right now, as our Democratic  colleagues would like, but at the end of the debate, today--not  Monday--we should install a new CIA Director.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I wish to offer a few words regarding  our outgoing President. I had a chance, as some others did yesterday,  to receive a call from him, which I appreciated. I want to say farewell  to President Obama. I think it is worth, once again, reflecting on the  significance of his election and the historic achievement it  represented in terms of our country's past. That is something both he  and our country should be very proud of.   It is no secret that the President and I and other Members of my  party have not always seen eye to eye. Over the years, we have pursued  totally different legislative priorities. Everybody around here knows  that. The American people know that too. It is a big country. We have  different views about what ought to be done.   Let me say this. I think I speak for all Americans when I thank our  former President for his tremendous service to our Nation. As can be  said of all First Families, he and his family have made many personal  sacrifices over the past 8 years. Through it all, they have done so  with dignity and with grace.   To our 44th President, I wish to say, for your leadership, we are  grateful. We wish you, Michelle, Malia, and Sasha all the best as you  embark on this new chapter of your lives.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session for the en bloc consideration of the  following nominations received today: James N. Mattis to be Secretary  of Defense; and John F. Kelly to be Secretary of Homeland Security. I  ask consent that there be 20 minutes of debate on the nominations,  equally divided in the usual form, and that following the use or  yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the nominations in the order  listed with no intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table en  bloc; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action; that no further motions be in order; and that any statements  relating to the nominations be printed in the Record.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I renew my unanimous consent request  that I previously stated.    Madam President, I think under the circumstances the  Democratic leader and I have come up with a solution that I think at  least moves the ball in the right direction. First, I want to implore  our colleagues on the other side to give us a vote on Pompeo today.    Madam President, it is pretty obvious the Senator from  Oregon is not interested in approving this CIA nomination today. I  would remind everyone the previous Director is gone. The Deputy, the  No. 2 person, is gone. I don't think it is a great idea for Senate  Democrats to be holding this vacant over the weekend.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 16, submitted earlier today.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         A resolution (S. Res. 16) to constitute the majority       party's membership on certain committees for the One Hundred       Fifteenth Congress, or until their successors are chosen.    There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolution.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 3 p.m., Monday,  January 23; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day; finally, that following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to  executive session to resume consideration of the nomination of Mike  Pompeo to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:41 p.m., adjourned until  Monday, January 23, 2017, at 3 p.m.                            ____________________
