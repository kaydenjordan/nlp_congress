 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize National Small  Business Week.   There are over 30 million small businesses across the country, and  over half of the American workforce is either employed by a small  business or operates one.   With April's strong jobs report and the unemployment rate reaching  the lowest in 50 years--a truly unprecedented level of 3.6 percent--it  is clear American small businesses are thriving.   There is no bigger job creator. Small businesses are the mainstay of  our economy, a big reason why it is booming.   Two out of three jobs created in the U.S. are within a small  business. Last month, there were 263,000 nonfarm jobs created,  surpassing most predictions.   Indeed, our economy is doing quite well and, as a result, so are our  small business owners. I believe the progrowth policies of the last  Congress and this administration, such as tax reform and regulatory  reform, have quite a lot to do with it.   I will always be a strong supporter of small business, and I hope  this body will as well and continue to support the policies that will  help them succeed.   I thank those who are hanging in there in the small business  community--keep going, and keep creating.                            ____________________
