 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Lofgren and Vice  Chair Cheney for their distinguished leadership on this incredibly  important issue.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Presidential  Election Reform Act.   Our democracy is fragile. Democracy is not a spectator sport.  Democracy is not a self-executing proposition. Democracy does not  simply run on autopilot.   It requires all of us to remain engaged, particularly because we are  confronting a diabolical adversary who is determined to undermine the  principle of free and fair elections, undermine the rule of law, and  undermine the peaceful transfer of power.   Certainly, our democracy is not perfect, but it is worth saving. That  is why it is so critically important that we act with the fierce  urgency of now to defend the Republic against tyranny, protect the  principle of free and fair elections, and continue America's long,  necessary, and majestic march toward a more perfect Union.
