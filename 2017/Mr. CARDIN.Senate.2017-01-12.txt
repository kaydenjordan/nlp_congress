 Mr. President, civilian control of our military is one of  the bedrock principles of American self-government. The National  Security Act of 1947, U.S.C. Title 10 Section 113(a), stipulates that  an individual ``may not be appointed as Secretary of Defense within  seven years after relief from active duty as a commissioned officer of  a regular component of an armed force.'' President-Elect Donald Trump's  choice of retired U.S. Marine Corps General James N. Mattis violates  that provision since he has only been out of the uniform for 3 years;  thus, Congress will need to pass a waiver so that he can serve if  confirmed.   I have considered this issue carefully, and I have listened to Gen.  Mattis's testimony earlier today before the Senate Armed Services  Committee. I believe Gen. Mattis is committed to the principle of  civilian control of the military. I was reassured by his testimony this  morning, and I will vote to grant the waiver. There is a precedent: in  1950, the Senate voted to confirm General George C. Marshall's as  Secretary of Defense, despite the fact that he had been retired for  only 5 years. Former Secretaries of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, Robert  M. Gates, and Leon E. Panetta have expressed bipartisan support for  Gen. Mattis. I am willing to vote for the waiver, as long as one  nomination does not turn into a trend. There are particular times and  circumstances in which granting the waiver may be appropriate, but the  bedrock principle of civilian control of our military must not be  eroded.
