 Mr. Speaker, as we close out 2023, I want to talk about  the results my team and I have delivered for New Jersey's Eighth  Congressional District during my first year in office.   Our team has solved over 1,100 constituent cases, which have ranged  from getting evacuees out of Afghanistan, to resolving passport issues  so constituents can visit their loved ones, to returning over $270,000  to our constituents. We have sent over 26,000 letters communicating  directly with our residents about the issues they care about.   We have also secured over $11 billion in Federal grants for projects  in our district. That includes over $6.9 billion for the Gateway  Program, the largest critical infrastructure project in the country. We  also secured over $4 billion to overhaul the Northeast Corridor,  drastically improving the commuter experience on the busiest passenger  rail line in the country.   We secured millions for additional priorities such as community  policing, environmental justice, and tackling climate change, all in  less than a year.   I have also introduced six bills and cosponsored over 100 bills that  address affordability, improve the quality of life for residents in our  district, and fight for our Democratic values and priorities.   The first bill I introduced was the Working Families Task Force Act,  which would establish a whole-of-government approach to improve the  standard of living for working families in our district and across the  country, including access to childcare and healthcare and creating  good-paying jobs.   I made quality-of-life issues a priority, introducing legislation to  battle helicopter noise in our communities. I am proud to have  cosponsored legislation to protect reproductive rights, support our  LGBTQ community, and fight gun violence.   As a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee,  I have worked hard every day to improve critical infrastructure across  our district. This includes strongly advocating for commuting  alternatives for you and your family, such as extending New York City's  7 line to New Jersey.   Serving on the House Committee on Homeland Security, I have  prioritized our work to keep our country safe while following our  American and Democratic values.    I have tackled the work of reforming our broken immigration system  head-on as co-chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Immigration  Task Force. I have fought to close the privately run Elizabeth  Detention Center, which has had a decades-long record of abuse and  neglect of migrant detainees.   I have stood alongside my colleagues to call for relief for cities  that are handling an influx of asylum-seekers. I have led efforts to  oppose harmful Republican targeting of migrants.   This year, alongside House Democrats, my team and I have delivered  significant and meaningful results for every single resident of New  Jersey's Eighth Congressional District despite the House Republicans'  dysfunction and division. We are just getting started.   My top priority is and has always been serving you. I love this  district and every community I have the honor of representing.  Delivering real, tangible results is what motivates me every day.   I look forward to working for you in Washington and in the district.  My team and I are available to help you and your family with any issues  you may be having with the Federal Government. We are here to serve  you. I thank you for this incredible opportunity, and I look forward to  continuing to deliver for all of you in 2024.                            ____________________
