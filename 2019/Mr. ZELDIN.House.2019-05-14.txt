 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, and I thank the  chairman for bringing this bill to the entire committee in a bipartisan  fashion again. This is the second time that the House has taken action  to pass this legislation. It is incredibly important for the Senate to  do their part to help make this actually become law. I am looking  forward to that bill signing, and it is decades overdue.   I rise today in support of H.R. 299, the Blue Water Navy Vietnam  Veterans Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor. This bill expands  treatment coverage for those affected by Agent Orange from not only  those who served on the ground, but to those servicemembers who are  known as blue water Navy vets who were affected while serving our  Nation at sea.   I live in a county called Suffolk in the State of New York. We have  the largest veterans population of any county in the entire State.  Thousands of Vietnam veterans and their families would now be able to  receive benefits that they have earned. These brave servicemembers have  put their lives on the line for our great Nation, and they have earned  nothing less than the highest quality care.   Additionally, this legislation includes my bill, the Flexible VA Loan  Guarantee Act, which expands veterans' opportunity for homeownership by  eliminating the loan limit the VA can guarantee. This is especially  critical in districts like mine.   I thank Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Roe for bringing this bill  to the floor, and I urge all my colleagues in the Chamber to vote for  it.   As I mentioned, this is the second time this legislation is passing  the House. It is incredibly important that  [[Page H3750]]  all those in the Capitol on the other side in the Senate do the same. I  urge them to immediately take up the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans  Act and care for all of our Nation's servicemembers.    Mr. Speaker, today I rise with a growing number of  Americans in celebrating National Decency Day, a call to action to  engage in civil discussion in the midst of bitter divisiveness.   As Americans, we cherish our freedom to dissent, but we must always  bear in mind that these debates should be productive and substantive.   Lisa Cholnoky, a part-time resident of my district, has championed  this belief in founding her Campaign for Decency. This campaign, which  began on Shelter Island in my district, has now spread as far as Hawaii  and Alaska.   This campaign sets an example for all of us to abide by across our  country and here in Congress as we strive to reach across the aisle in  a bipartisan fashion.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Cholnoky for championing this issue and  empowering so many Americans to do the same.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   To start off tonight, I just want to recognize that today is the 1- year anniversary of the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. I was  honored to be there in person last year for this very special moment.  Jerusalem should be recognized as the undivided, unquestionable capital  of the Jewish state.   This was a bold move by this President not just to fulfill promises  of Presidents past and to fulfill U.S. law; most importantly, it was  the right thing to do.   In addition to its religious importance, Jerusalem is also the  capital, the home, the location of the Israeli Knesset and offices and  residences of the Israeli Prime Minister and President.   Moving our Embassy set an important precedent for other nations to  follow as well.   I commend the President. I thank him for following through on his  support and commitment. I thought it was important tonight to highlight  that today is the 1-year anniversary of that important opening of the  Embassy in Jerusalem.
