 Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget  scorekeeping report for January 2019. The report compares current-law  levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to  in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, BBA18. This information is  necessary for the Senate Budget Committee to determine whether  budgetary points of order lie against pending legislation. The  Republican staff of the Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget  Office, CBO prepared this report pursuant to section 308(b) of the  Congressional Budget Act, CBA.   This is my first scorekeeping report this year. My last filing can be  found in the Congressional Record for November 15, 2018. That report  included final budgetary levels for fiscal year 2018. The information  included in this report is current through January 7, 2019.   Several bills have cleared Congress since my last filing. The three  with the largest direct spending and revenue effects were the Frank  LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018, P.L. 115-282; the  Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, P.L. 115-334; and the First Step  Act, P.L. 115-391.   Budget Committee Republican staff prepared Tables 1-3.   Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee  exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays  under the most recently adopted budget resolution and the fiscal year  2019 enforceable levels filing. This information is used for enforcing  committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the CBA. For this  reporting period, 8 of the 16 authorizing committees are not in  compliance with their allocations. Over the current 10-year enforceable  window, authorizing committees have increased outlays by a combined  $3.4 billion.   Tables 2 provides the amount by which the Senate Committee on  Appropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This  information is used to determine points of order related to the  spending caps found in sections 312 and 314 of the CBA. Appropriations  for fiscal year 2019, displayed in this table, show that the  Appropriations Committee is currently compliant with spending limits  for fiscal year  [[Page S136]]  2019. As of this filing, 7 of the 12 annual appropriations bills have  not been enacted with full-year spending.   The fiscal year 2018 budget resolution contained points of order  limiting the use of changes in mandatory programs in appropriations  bills, CHIMPS. Table 3, which tracks the CHIMP limit of $15 billion for  fiscal year 2019, shows the Appropriations Committee has enacted $7.7  billion worth of full-year CHIMPs for fiscal year 2019. The fiscal year  2019 CHIMPs were contained in the Labor, Health and Human Services,  Education and Related Agencies division of P.L. 115-245. This  information is used for determining the point of order under section  4102, overall limit, of H. Con. Res. 71, 115th Congress.   In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican  staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget  totals approved by Congress.   For fiscal year 2019, CBO annualizes the effects of the last  continuing resolution, P.L. 115245, which provided funding through  December 21, 2018. For the enforcement of budgetary aggregates, the  Budget Committee historically excludes temporary funding. As such, the  current-law levels are $305.5 billion and $196.7 billion below  enforceable levels for budget authority and outlays, respectively.  Revenues are $302 million below the level assumed in the budget  resolution. Further, Social Security revenues are at the levels assumed  for fiscal year 2019, while Social Security outlays are $4 million  above assumed levels for the budget year.   CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate  pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. The PAYGO scorecard shows deficit increases  in FY 2019 of $1,797 million--$302 million revenue loss, $1,495 million  outlay increase--over the fiscal year 2018-2023 period of $3,045  million--$665 million revenue loss, $2,380 million outlay increase--and  over the fiscal year 2018-2028 period of $416 million--$625 million  revenue loss, $209 million outlay decrease. The Senate's PAYGO rule is  enforced by section 4106 of H. Con. Res. 71, 115th Congress.   This submission also includes a table tracking the Senate's budget  enforcement activity on the floor since the May 7, 2018, enforcement  filing. Since my last report, no new budgetary points of order were  raised.   All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   TABLE 1.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE                    (+) OR BELOW (-) BUDGET RESOLUTIONS                         [In millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                             2019    2019-2023  2019-2028 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry     Budget Authority....................     2,414      4,249      3,123     Outlays.............................     1,406      1,820         70 Armed Services     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs     Budget Authority....................        21        285        382     Outlays.............................        20        285        382 Commerce, Science, and Transportation     Budget Authority....................        41         77         91     Outlays.............................        11         74         90 Energy and Natural Resources     Budget Authority....................         0          0        -14     Outlays.............................         0          0        -14 Environment and Public Works     Budget Authority....................         2          4       -333     Outlays.............................         2          4       -333 Finance     Budget Authority....................       206        991       -919     Outlays.............................       119        988       -919 Foreign Relations     Budget Authority....................         0         -5        -20     Outlays.............................         0         -5        -20 Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs     Budget Authority....................         0          2          4     Outlays.............................        43         48         49 Judiciary     Budget Authority....................        11        194        467     Outlays.............................        11        190        462 Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions     Budget Authority....................         0        -36        -84     Outlays.............................         0        -36        -84 Rules and Administration     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Intelligence     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Veterans' Affairs     Budget Authority....................         4          3       -729     Outlays.............................     4,402      4,400      3,668 Indian Affairs     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Small Business     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0                                          -------------------------------     Total         Budget Authority................     2,699      5,764      1,968         Outlays.........................     6,014      7,768      3,351 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   TABLE 2.--SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE--ENACTED REGULAR DISCRETIONARY                            APPROPRIATIONS \1\                [Budget authority, in millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                       2019                                        ---------------------------------                                           Security \2\   Nonsecurity \2\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Statutory Discretionary Limits........          647,000          597,000             Amount Provided by Senate Appropriations Subcommittee   Agriculture, Rural Development, and                   0                9  Related Agencies.....................

Hon. Mike Enzi,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of       Congressional action on the fiscal year 2019 budget and is       current through January 7, 2019. This report is submitted       under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the       Congressional Budget Act, as amended.        The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues       are consistent with the allocations, aggregates, and other       budgetary levels printed in the Congressional Record on May       7, 2018, pursuant to section 30103 of the Bipartisan Budget       Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-123).        Since our last letter dated November 15, 2018, the Congress       has cleared and the President has signed the following       legislation that has significant effects on budget authority,       outlays, and revenues in fiscal year 2019:        Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2018       (Public Law 115-282),        Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-334);       and        First Step Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-391).

Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include $771   million in budget authority, and $767 million in estimated outlays. b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act   in the Senate, the resolution, as approved by the Senate, does not   include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts.   As a result, current level does not include those items. c Public Law 115-298 amended the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019   (Division C of P.L. 115-254), to continue the appropriations and   authorities contained in Divisions A, B, E-G, and K-M of the   Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, through December 21, 2018. As   of January 7, 2019, those appropriations and authorities have not been   further extended. This report includes the annualized levels of   estimated budget authority and outlays that were provided by P.L. 115-   298, as it was in effect on December 21, 2018. d Pursuant to section 232(b) of H.C. Res. 290 (106th Congress), the   Concurrent Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2001, the budgetary   effects related to the Federal Reserve's surplus funds are excluded.   As a result, the amounts shown do not include estimated increases in   revenues of $655 million in fiscal year 2019, $570 million over the   2019-2023 period, and $454 million over the 2019-2028 period. e Division I of P.L. 115-254 provided $1.68 billion in supplemental   appropriations for fiscal year 2019, and designated those amounts as   being for emergency requirements pursuant to section 251 of the   Deficit Control Act. In general, the budgetary effects of authorizing   legislation are recorded as direct spending or revenue. However,   consistent with the language in Division I, and at the direction of   the Senate Committee on the Budget, those budgetary effects are   classified as discretionary spending. f Section 30103 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 required--in the   absence of a concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2019--   that the Chair of the Senate Committee on the Budget publish the   aggregate spending and revenue levels for fiscal year 2019; those   aggregate levels were first published in the Congressional Record on   May 7, 2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also allows the Chair   of the Senate Committee on the Budget to revise the budgetary   aggregates:   ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                        Budget                                      Authority     Outlays     Revenues ------------------------------------------------------------------------     Original Aggregates Printed on    3,547,094    3,508,052   2,590,496      May 7, 2018:.................
