 Madam Speaker, today I rise to celebrate August 4 as Coast  Guard Day, marking the service's founding by Alexander Hamilton in  1790. We are very grateful for the brave men and women of the United  States Coast Guard who selflessly serve America, both at home and  abroad.   My congressional district of Pinellas County, Florida, is proud to be  home to numerous Coast Guard commands, both ashore and afloat. We have  the largest and busiest air station in the country, Air Station  Clearwater, and a robust maritime operation at Sector St. Petersburg.   Coast Guard families serve as well, providing the Coasties themselves  with the support and resilience they depend on to stand watch, day in  and day out.   So, Madam Speaker, I would like to wish a happy 229th birthday to the  United States Coast Guard.                            ____________________
