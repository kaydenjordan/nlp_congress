 Madam Speaker, just a few minutes ago, I heard  Professor Meachum indicate that the American people voted some years  ago on one of the most significant moments of the 20th century, and  that was a civil rights moment, a civil rights movement.   We now have a significant moment in history to combine all the work  that we need to do to change America's attitudes on race. We know that  we have lost two amazing heroes of this Nation, C.T. Vivian and  Congressman John Lewis, whom we will pay tribute to in just a few days.   But I wanted to say today that I am very grateful that, in this  recent NDAA, the Armed Services bill, we passed an amendment that would  direct the Secretary of Defense to assess the heroes, African-American  heroes, like General Benjamin O. Davis, General Chappie James, as well  as Tuskegee Airmen, after which bases and other defense properties  would be named.   It is now long overdue to honor these brave heroes who fought for  this Nation, from the Revolutionary War until now. I believe we will do  that, and I am looking forward to that being a piece of the civil  rights moment, along with H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and Develop  Reparation Proposals for African-Americans Act.                            ____________________
