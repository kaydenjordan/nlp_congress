 Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``nay'' on rollcall No. 401.                             personal explanation     Madam Speaker, I think after next week we are going to  spend about 3 weeks back in the district. It would be nice if people  would go down to the southern border, as I did, and look at the path  into Yuma, Texas, in which all the photo IDs are being thrown aside by  the people who want to forget their past and start a new life in  America.   I also hope when people go back home, they spend some time with the  farmers and with the manufacturers that make our country run. They will  find that the cost of metals used in manufacturing--and I have a big  manufacturing district--are sometimes going up five or six times. Not 5  or 6 percent, five or six times.   They will find that mucking around with the free market of trucking  in California has resulted in huge shortages of various different  things that we need, including chemicals needed for agriculture, for  things like planting soybeans and corn. Some farmers are afraid that  sometime in the next year we are going to have a food shortage.   They will find out that the goal of taking away fossil fuels is going  to result in significant increases in heating oil, which is  particularly a problem in northern Wisconsin.                            ____________________
