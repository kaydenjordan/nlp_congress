 Mr. Speaker, in the House we have a procedure that  if words are untoward and not becoming of our stature as Members of the  United States Congress, by any Member those words can be asked to be  taken down.  [[Page H766]]    It is unfortunate that in a tweet this morning the Commander in Chief  said, of a Member of Congress who is a Federal official, he ``must be  stopped,'' words to that effect.   I left my hometown early this morning and had hoped there would have  been some decent response from the Chief of Staff or other staff  members of the White House to be able to say that that is an  inappropriate attack on any Member of Congress or Federal official. I  have yet to hear a clarification or apology that indicates that  providing provocative words to take a Member down, or he must be taken  down, is an inappropriate action or words for any Federal official.   I hope that we can establish decorum not only in this body, but I  hope we can establish decorum in the White House. It is sorely missing.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, thank you Congressman Evans for  yielding and for anchoring this very important special order on the  state of economic inequality in the United States, especially regarding  its citizens of color.   The President would have us believe he is bringing the country  together and growing the economy for all Americans but this could not  be further from the truth.   First and foremost, Trump has nothing to do with the African-American  unemployment rate being at its current level.   The President inherited a strong and rescued economy, including the  downward trend in black unemployment from President Obama.   The African-American unemployment rate was cut in half during the  Obama Administration.   The African-American unemployment rate actually jumped nearly one  percentage point in January 2018, right after President Trump took  credit for it being the lowest on record.   During the Obama era, the economy added 15 million new jobs, the  black unemployment rate dropped and the high school graduation rate for  African Americans soared.   The members of the CBC are here to tell the American people: ``Stay  Woke, Don't Be Fooled.''   The racial wealth gap is much larger than the wage or income gap by  race.   Average wealth for white families is seven times higher than average  wealth for black families.   Worse still, median wealth (wealth for the family in the exact middle  of the overall distribution--wealthier than half of all families and  less-wealthy than half) for white households is twelve times higher  than median African-American wealth.   Black-white wage gaps are larger today than they were in 1979.   Young African-American women have been hardest hit since 2000.   The wage gap for African-American men was 22.2 percent in 1979; in  2015 it was 31 percent.   Wage gaps are growing primarily because of discrimination and racial  differences in skills and worker characteristics.   Declining unionization has also had a role in the growing African- American-white wage gap, particularly for men newly joining the  workforce.   African Americans have been disproportionately affected by the  growing gap between pay and productivity.   Not only are the President's policies divisive along racial and  cultural lines, they also serve to further increase economic inequality  due to their clear design in favor of the wealthiest among us at the  expense of everyone else.   Trump's billionaire tax heist robs the U.S. Treasury of $1.5 trillion  in resources that could be invested in economic growth in underserved  communities.   Trump has proposed eliminating programs that help minority businesses  and that help minority communities access bank lending.   Trump has opposed increasing the minimum wage and eliminating labor  protections for middle and lower income workers in the black community   Trump has proposed doubling down on mass incarceration and the war on  drugs, which drains the African-American labor pool.   Trump has taken every opportunity to harm health care for African- Americans from sabotaging the ACA to ending Medicaid as we know it.   Donald Trump is no friend to African-Americans' pocket book.   Trump also wants you to believe that he wants a bipartisan  infrastructure plan.   ``Stay Woke; don't be fooled.''   Trump's proposal is yet another giveaway to his wealthy friends.   Instead of providing a robust federal investment in our  infrastructure, including roads, bridges, mass transit, schools and  broadband, Trump wants to give tax incentives to wealthy firms and  individuals to build infrastructure that will cost the middle and lower  income Americans money to use.   Instead of making it easier for state and local governments to invest  in needed projects, he will make it more expensive for them to do so by  reducing the federal cost share.   A recent National Urban League report titled ``Protect Our Progress''  gives a detailed look at the conditions of African Americans today.   The report suggested that the nation should invest in a ``Main Street  Marshall Plan'' that would ensure that the gains made by African- Americans during the Obama administration aren't lost.   The plan includes expanding pre-K, increasing the number of college  students receiving Pell grants, increasing the minimum wage and summer  youth employment programs and incentivizing more doctors to accept  Medicaid.   But we are in a climate where the current administration is looking  to make cuts in many of these areas.   As it has for more than a decade, the Urban League used its Equality  Index to track how close black America has gotten to white America in  five major areas: education, health, social justice, economics and  civic engagement.   There was not much change between 2015 and 2016 in the five areas the  Urban League measures.   For this reason, the overall 2017 Equality Index of Black America was  72.3 percent, compared to 72.2 percent the year before.   An index of 100 percent would mean full equality in the particular  measure between African-Americans and whites.   The biggest increase came in the area of education, which rose from  77.4 percent in 2015 to 78.2 percent in 2016.  [[Page H774]]    In economics, African-Americans went from an equality index rate of  56.2 percent in 2015 to 56.5 percent in 2016.   In healthcare, the equality index between African-American and white  Americans went from 79.4 to 80 percent between 2015 and 2016.   The only decrease came in social justice, from 60.9 to 57.4 percent.   In the category of civic engagement, African Americans actually  surpass whites, according to the Urban League, with the number between  2015 and 2016 remaining at 100.6 percent.   As for Hispanics, there was a bigger increase in the overall Equality  Index, from 77.9 percent in 2015 to 78.4 percent in 2016.   The Urban League also ranked the 70 metropolitan areas from the  smallest gap in unemployment between African Americans and whites (and  Hispanics and whites) to the largest gap.   For African Americans, the area with the smallest black-white  unemployment gap was San Antonio-New Braunfels, TX, where the African  Americans unemployment rate was 6.4 percent (down 1.9 percentage points  from the previous year)   The white rate was 4.5 percent (down 0.4 percentage points).   The area with the largest gap was Milwaukee-Waukesha-West Allis, WI,  where the unemployment rate for African Americans was 13.8 percent,  while just 2.7 percent for whites.   In income inequality, Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, CA for the  third consecutive year had the smallest difference between African  Americans median household income and white median household income   The city with the biggest income gap was Minneapolis-St. Paul- Bloomington, MN-WI, where the chasm was 41 cents for African Americans  for every dollar earned by a white person.   For both African Americans and Hispanics, the area with the highest  median household income was Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD- WV, at $68,054 for blacks and $69,481 for Hispanics.   It also had the highest white household income at $112,177.   Mr. Speaker, our nation still has a long way to go before we achieve  economic equality for all its citizens.                            ____________________
