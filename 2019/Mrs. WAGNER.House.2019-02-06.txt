 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of babies  who survive abortions and are born alive.   The Constitution clearly states that all persons born in this country  are entitled to life, liberty, and equal protection under the law.   Our Founding Fathers did not put age limits on who is entitled to  life, but over the past month, I have been astounded and horrified to  watch radical legislators upend the Constitution and argue that babies  who survive abortions should not be given the same level of medical  care that all other newborn babies receive.   New York legislators repealed a law mandating medical care for any  baby born alive during an abortion. A law proposed in Virginia would  allow abortions up to the very moment of full delivery.   Congress must act to protect those who cannot protect themselves.  This week, I introduced the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection  Act, H.R. 962, which merely ensures that babies who survive abortions  receive immediate lifesaving care, which is very simple. We choose life  or we choose death.                            ____________________
