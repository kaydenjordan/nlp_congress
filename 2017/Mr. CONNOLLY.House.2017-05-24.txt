 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to demand that Congress get  serious about the Russia investigation.  [[Page H4518]]    In December, along with Mr. Engel of New York, I introduced the  SECURE Our Democracy Act that would sanction any foreign individual or  entity found to have unlawfully interfered with our election process.  That shouldn't be a partisan issue, yet all of the bill's 88 cosponsors  are Democrats.   I am also a cosponsor of the Protecting Our Democracy Act to  establish an independent commission to get to the bottom of the Russia  investigation.   A recent NBC-Wall Street Journal poll conducted in April found that  73 percent of our fellow Americans want such an independent commission.  They want to get at the truth. So do I. So should all of us. I have  signed a discharge petition to get that bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support these two measures, and  to bring them to the floor for consideration. It is our constitutional  duty to provide oversight of any executive in any executive branch.   The American people demand answers and accountability, not  obstruction and intimidation. Appointing a special counsel, independent  of the White House and the Attorney General, was one way to begin to  restore credibility that has been badly tarnished. I urge us to proceed  with the Russia investigation with all dispatch.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I must say, Mr. Speaker, I originally rose in support of what I  thought was a simple reporting bill. In listening to my friend from  Florida, this is part and parcel of the negative narrative that is sent  in all too frequently on the other side of the aisle about hardworking  civil servants and Federal employees. They are not all somehow  committing crime on official time. Official time, in fact, has been  used to the benefit of the workforce and to the benefit of management.   If this bill, H.R. 1293, is nothing but a precursor to further  encroachment on the rights of Federal workers, then I will oppose this  bill, and I will urge my Members on this side of the aisle to oppose  this bill because, by voting for it, we are enabling something much  worse to follow and have this thrown in our faces.   So, Mr. Speaker, I regret that, under the circumstances, and with the  message I have just heard, I can no longer support this bill. I can no  longer urge my colleagues to support this bill, and we will, in fact,  urge a negative vote on this bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, my friend from Florida is my friend and he  knows I respect him, but when you give an opening statement on a bill  that goes far beyond a reporting requirement that we thought we were  supporting and you use the occasion to disparage Federal workers and to  characterize them in a decidedly negative way as if that somehow really  described the average civil servant and what they are up to, then on  this side of the aisle, we take exception. Then it is no longer a  simple reporting bill; it is a precursor of bad things to come, and we  are not going to be party to it. We are not going to enable that. That  is why, reluctantly, I must now oppose this bill and urge my Democratic  colleagues and those on the other side of the aisle who want to protect  Federal employees and honor them and give them the dignity and respect  they deserve also to oppose this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I now am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), my dear friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from the District of Columbia.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from the District of Columbia.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend because I am going to  run out of time. I must say to my friend, my prepared remarks were  designed to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I must say, the gentleman from Florida,  who is an honorable man and a friend, and we have collaborated, but his  own words transformed what this really was. They persuaded us that by  voting for this, we are not voting for a reporting bill. That is just  the beginning.   My friend from Florida is the one who characterized criminal activity  on official time, and unsavory things going on on official time, and  allows that to dangle out there as if that characterizes Federal  employees generally.   I say to any friend--and I thank him for yielding--that has  transformed our perception of this bill. This is no longer a simple  reporting bill--although technically that is what it is. It is a  precursor, apparently, to an assault of Federal employees--and on  official time, specifically--and we cannot be partners to that. We  cannot be enablers to that.   Mr. Speaker, therefore, we must oppose this bill, in light of the  context my friend from Florida himself said.    Mr. Speaker, I am certainly gratified for the  clarification of my friend.   It now gives me great pleasure to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from  [[Page H4531]]  Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch), my good friend and a senior member of the  Oversight and Government Reform Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to my  friend from Massachusetts.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence), my dear friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman), my friend.   Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the  opportunity to discuss this bill, and I want to thank the colleague  from across the aisle here who has illuminated the future as it relates  to undertaking this whole issue.   It is with that in mind that I want to speak to the value of the use  of official time.  [[Page H4532]]                                     time  1430    While I am not concerned so much about the collection of the  information as to what is happening, I am concerned with how it is  being translated and will be used in the future.   For decades, both Republicans and Democrats alike have strongly  supported the use of official time because it streamlines the  efficiency and quality of government. We should be thanking our union  representatives who use official time to address workplace problems and  operational issues within our government.   Within our Federal Government, official time leads to swift conflict  resolutions that would otherwise require costly litigation, improves  the relationship between labor and management, and protects  whistleblowers who have exposed government waste and abuse. In some  cases, it has even saved lives, as in the issue of AFGE local president  Kathleen Dahl, when there was a breakout of Legionnaires' disease.   Furthermore, official time costs one-tenth of 1 percent of the cost  of salaries and benefits for all Federal employees. That is a fraction  of employee compensation. Ultimately, it saves taxpayers dollars and  ensures transparency.   So while we may be discussing today simply a bill that will record  the time that is spent in such a noble and important function, it is  simply a precursor to the disparaging of union workers and Federal  workers as we move forward. Mr. Speaker, I oppose any movement in that  direction.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).    Mr. Speaker, I agree with my friend from Maryland.  Official time is a very useful tool in the Federal workplace, both for  management and for labor, and has proved its worth over the years.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Takano).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.    In attempting to summarize, Mr. Speaker, I do want to reiterate that  my friend from Florida is an honorable man. When he says this is about  one thing, I believe him. Perhaps in the introduction to this bill  there was a characterization that was not intended, and I accept that  explanation.   Federal workers are hardworking civil servants. They serve the  American people. I know my friend from Florida agrees. The overwhelming  majority of them are dedicated. They seize a mission every day, whether  it be at the VA, the Social Security Administration, or our Nation's  parks. They are dedicated to the proposition that they are there to  serve the American people. It is important to honor their service, to  respect their service, to not allow even the inference to be drawn that  a negative example somehow could be construed as characteristic of the  whole, for that is false.   That is the narrative we Democrats and, hopefully, a number of  Republicans want to change, because it is not true. We want to honor  those civil servants.   All too often, our civil servants have become pin cushions. Again, I  know my friend from Florida does not intend that, but there are others  who have intended that. That sparks something, certainly, on this side  of the aisle and with this Member, who represents a lot of Federal  employees and cherishes their service. For us, it is a very personal  matter.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 624, the Social Security  Number Fraud Prevention Act of 2017, as amended.   Introduced by our colleague, Mr. Valadao from California, this bill  is a commonsense step to addressing an enormously growing problem of  identity theft and protecting the personal information of every  American.   Each year, 18 million Americans become victims of identity theft.  That is 18 million. A leading cause of this problem is the unauthorized  acquisition of Social Security numbers by criminals.   H.R. 624 would address this issue by restricting the instances in  which agencies may include the full Social Security numbers on  documents sent through the mail. The bill would prohibit agencies from  including those numbers on mailed correspondence unless the head of an  agency himself or herself determines that inclusion is absolutely  essential.   Agencies would be required to issue regulations delineating the  situations in which Social Security numbers are necessary, and would be  instructed to partially redact numbers wherever feasible.                                time  1445    Agencies would also be expressly prohibited from making Social  Security numbers visible on the outside of any mailed packages.  [[Page H4534]]    In recent years, many agencies have taken steps to reduce their use  of Social Security numbers, and this bill would simply codify some of  those practices agencies have already adopted. For instance, the Social  Security Administration itself no longer prints Social Security numbers  on its annual cost-of-living adjustment notices or benefit checks, and  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is in the process of  removing Social Security numbers from the Medicare cards issued to  beneficiaries.   These steps are critical to ensuring that the Federal Government  adequately safeguards the personally identifiable information of  individuals and does everything it can to protect Americans from  identity theft.   Although this bill helps provide a lot of protection, reducing the  threat of identity theft by removing Social Security numbers from  mailed items is not always as easy as it seems. Many agencies confront  high costs when reprogramming outdated legacy information technology  systems to allow mailings to be printed differently.   Agencies across the Federal Government have been reluctant to retire  those legacy IT systems because of funding constraints that limit IT  investments, slow modernization, and force agencies to defer needed IT  upgrades in favor of some more pressing, urgent problems.   I would be remiss if I did not mention the important responsibility  Congress has to fund these IT modernization efforts as it considers  this bill.   Mr. Speaker, the Social Security Number Fraud Prevention Act is a  good, bipartisan bill that is necessary to protect the American public.  I urge my colleagues to support its passage, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from California an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from California an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I think this is an important piece of legislation. This  is one of the fastest growing crimes in our country: the diversion of  Social Security checks and rebates. It is almost without any kind of  corrective action. There are few prosecutions and even fewer  convictions. So, if you are a criminal and you are looking for  something that is relatively cost-free for you, this is the way to do  it.   This bill would provide some important protections to the American  public. I would hope that we build on this.   My friend from Florida and I serve on the Oversight and Government  Reform Committee, and we have heard testimony about this crime as it  has grown exponentially over the last 5 or 6 years. It is my hope that  U.S. attorneys all across America will put more emphasis on this crime  and use their resources to go after people who are predators of  American taxpayers, especially many of our seniors who rely on these  checks or these rebates to augment and supplement their income. So  there are victims of this crime, and they are the American taxpayer.   I think it is an important first step. I support the legislation, and  I urge my colleagues to support it as well.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
