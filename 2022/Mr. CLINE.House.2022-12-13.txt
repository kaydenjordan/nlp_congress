 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Fincastle  Volunteer Fire Department for 75 years of service.   Since its beginning in 1947, the Fincastle Volunteer Fire Department  has been a 100 percent volunteer organization and remains strong with  30 volunteers currently.   These brave men and women play a crucial role in working alongside  Botetourt County Fire and EMS services, offering critical localized  emergency fire prevention and mitigation support for the people of  Fincastle.   The volunteers who serve as firefighters and EMTs within the  department go through extensive training, giving up their time, energy,  and safety to help others.   Working alongside the firefighters and EMTs are support personnel who  perform the vital administrative work and fundraising that keeps the  station functioning.   They are led by current officers Chief Dustin Ware, Deputy Chief Ben  Campbell, Captain Matthew Webster, Lieutenant Kyle Setliff, Lieutenant  Frank Schermer, and Lieutenant Jordan Campbell.   The Fincastle Volunteer Fire Department's longevity stands as a  testament to the civic spirit of the town and an example we should all  follow.   I thank the Fincastle Volunteer Fire Department for their selfless  service and wish them another 75 years of success.                 Recognizing Stuarts Draft Cheerleading Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Stuarts Draft Cougars  cheer team for winning this year's Class 1 and 2 Virginia State  cheerleading championship. This victory marks the program's fifth State  title in 6 years.   The Cougars faced numerous hurdles to reach this victory, placing  second behind Fort Defiance during the first round. However, before the  second round began, Coach Tammy Carter told the team to be ``the  athletes they trained to be,'' and they did just that.   By focusing on what they needed to improve, the Cougars left it all  on the mat and increased their score by 30\1/2\ points, earning the  State title.   These talented athletes include Lexi Almarode, Addison Colvin, Jenna  Comer, Sofia Coppola, Taylor Huffman, Zoe Mader, Zane Marshall, Abby  Mikolay, Caydence Morris, Tarynn Morris, Baleigh Painter, Eiko Puckett,  Olivia Puckett, Alyssa Sanner, Holly Stevens, A'mya Swats, and Natalie  Thompson.   For six seniors on the team, Sofia, Zoe, Zane, Abby, Caydence, and  Baleigh, this was their memory of cheering together, an outpouring of  emotion hoisting the State championship trophy one final time.   Senior Zane Marshall said of his class' historic reign: ``To have  three [State championships], I don't even know how to feel. It is  crazy,'' he said.   The seniors will leave their high school cheerleading careers with  their heads held high, knowing their leadership and performance have  left a lasting legacy on the team.   Congratulations to all the talented athletes and dedicated coaches on  this incredible victory. They have earned it.                            ____________________
