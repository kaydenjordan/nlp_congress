 Mr. President, today I am honored to  congratulate the dedicated staff at Clear Channel Outdoor, in Las  Vegas, NV, for earning the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI,  Director's Community Leadership Award. On April 20, 2018,  representatives from Clear Channel Outdoor will join the Federal Bureau  of Investigation in Washington, DC, to formally accept this much- deserved recognition.   The FBI's special agents in 56 field offices work closely with the  community to conduct investigations and to protect the American people  from crimes and acts of extremism. In appreciation, special agents in  FBI field offices nominate community leaders and organizations that  exemplify their values and those who work tirelessly to assist them in  their work to keep the community safe. The Director's Community  Leadership Award honors these individuals and organizations for their  leadership in combating crime, terrorism, drugs, and violence in  America. Earning this award is no easy feat.   This award recognizes Clear Channel Outdoor-Las Vegas for their  steadfast efforts to provide digital billboard services that assisted  law enforcement in generating thousands of leads and tips, following  the tragic and senseless loss of life at the Route 91 Festival on  October 1, 2017, in Las Vegas. Clear Channel Outdoor-Las Vegas donated  billboard space on digital signs around the city of Las Vegas to expand  law enforcement's reach, telling the community, ``If you see something,  say something.''   In Las Vegas, the October 1 tragedy shocked our community but also  spurred us to action. During that dark time, Las Vegans came together  to drop off food and water at the Family Reunification Center, donate  blood, and build beautiful memorials to honor those killed. I am proud  of how our community came together, of how law enforcement acted to  protect lives and ensure that residents and visitors felt protected  following such a tragic incident. I am also proud of the Clear Channel  Outdoor-Las Vegas staff, who joined as part of our community effort,  answering the call to assist local law enforcement and educate our  community at large. Clear Channel Outdoor-Las Vegas's actions helped  rebuild and strengthen the bonds that make Las Vegas the beautiful  place we call home.   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Clear Channel Outdoor- Las Vegas for their generosity, their eagerness, and their empathy in  helping their fellow citizens and for their endeavors to help our home  heal from this senseless tragedy. I celebrate the FBI's recognition of  Clear Channel Outdoor-Las Vegas, and I am proud of their work on behalf  of law enforcement and the State of Nevada.                            ____________________
