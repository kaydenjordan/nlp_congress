 Mr. Speaker, this week, the Senate is taking action to  address  [[Page H1135]]  our illegal immigration problem, so I rise today to share some feedback  from the people I represent in Alabama's Second Congressional District.   I recently held two telephone townhall events to hear directly from  some of my constituents. Let me start by thanking every person who took  the time to participate and ask questions.   During both townhalls, I asked everyone what their top priority was  regarding our country's illegal immigration issue, and the vast  majority of participants said they are most concerned about securing  our border.   I couldn't agree more. I have always said that, in order to truly fix  our immigration system, we absolutely have to start by securing our  border. If I had a leak in my house, I wouldn't start by replacing the  damaged drywall. I would fix the leak first.   Mr. Speaker, the same idea applies for our illegal immigration  problem. We will only be able to make real progress towards fixing the  issue once we secure our border once and for all.   I am proud to support these efforts in the House, and I stand ready  to continue to work to tackle this problem where it starts: at the  border.                            ____________________
