 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2, the  Moving Forward Act.   Our Nation's public schools are in desperate need of repair, school  facilities across the country. I come from the city of Philadelphia,  where our average public school buildings are more than 70 years old.   I am proud to say that H.R. 158, the Rehabilitation of Historical  Schools Act, which I am the sponsor of, is in this. H.R. 158 allows the  historic tax credit to be used for rehabilitation of public school  buildings.   President Trump used the historical tax credit to transform an old  public building, a post office, into a hotel. I believe that should be  made available to fix our schools. Our children all deserve an equal  shot at the future, regardless of their ZIP Code.   I stand proudly supporting H.R. 2, because I commend the leadership  of my chairman here, who is demonstrating that we need to work this all  together.
