 Madam Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 1309,  the Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service  Workers Act.   I also rise today to share Tina Suckow's story with the House of  Representatives.   Tina is my constituent, and she is a proud Iowan, wife, mother,  grandmother, and AFSCME member. She is also a dedicated nurse who spent  15 years caring for those living with mental health conditions.   Tragically, this tough and thick-skinned woman, with a great sense of  humor and a natural gift for helping people, can now no longer  physically work.   More than a year ago, Tina was horribly injured at the State of  Iowa's Independence Mental Health Institute in my district.   An aggressive patient triggered a call for additional assistance.  Although Tina was working in a different section of the campus at the  time, she made her way over to help, with about a dozen other  coworkers.   For roughly 45 minutes, the patient was erratic and repeatedly  threatened to hurt the first person who tried to get close to him. When  nothing worked to calm him, a supervisor grabbed a padded shield, but  nobody knew that the facility even had this equipment, and they weren't  trained to use it.   As her coworker approached with the shield, Tina became trapped  between it and the patient. He hit Tina in the head so many times that  she lost consciousness.   After dedicating her career and her life to caring for others, Tina  was now the one in need. Since then, she has been in and out of  surgeries, and the emotional damage remains. That day was the worst day  of Tina's life.   Sadly, the State has made it worse by denying her unpaid time off  requests and kicking her off the payroll.   Tina wants her story shared today so that employees like her are  protected.   I am personally upset that it is hard to do in States like Iowa. You  see, in 2017, I was a State representative in Iowa who spent 2 days  fighting back against the gutting of collective bargaining in my State,  where they went after our teachers, our corrections officers, our bus  drivers, and folks like Tina. I stood on that floor and voted ``no.''   Unfortunately, we didn't have the votes. That bill passed, and they  gutted the rights of folks like Tina all across my State. Iowa's  working families are continuing to pay the price for those politically  motivated attacks.   Nearly 1,000 jobs in our State have been eliminated since 2011. These  staffing shortages, because of this and the failure to train employees  on vital safety measures, have put lives like Tina's on the line.   In that same facility, several other employees have been attacked in  the last year.    Madam Chair, in other facilities across the State,  they have been attacked in the last year. It is unconscionable. This  isn't how you treat people.   The law also created a system that was rigged against working people,  forcing employees to go through costly recertification processes and  trying to stop them from being able to collectively bargain and being  able to fight for their rights.   Luckily for us in Iowa, our public employees are strong. They banded  together and were recertified, and I am proud to represent them.   Today, I will be casting this vote for Tina Suckow, who I know is  watching at home today.   This bill will require places like the State of Iowa to stop failing  their employees, by requiring workplace protections. It is a first step  in protecting Iowans on the front lines.   I am standing with our hardworking men and women today who ask for a  safe workplace, and now I am standing with them on the floor of the  U.S. House, proudly voting ``yes'' for them and folks all across my  State.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record a letter from AFSCME in support  of H.R. 1309.           American Federation of State, County and Municipal             Employees, AFL-CIO,                                 Washington, DC, November 19, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the members of the       American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees       (AFSCME), I urge you to support the ``Workplace Violence       Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act''       (H.R. 1309), which protects workers and their right to be       safe from violence at their workplace. H.R. 1309 requires the       Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to issue       a standard on workplace violence prevention in health care       and social service assistance settings.        Enactment of H.R. 1309 is needed because:        The current OSHA guidance is voluntary. It does not require       employers to address the high risk of violence on the job for       health care workers and social service workers. Some 70       percent of all nonfatal workplace assaults typically occur in       these two sectors and has increased over the years.        It challenges the myth that workplace violence is random,       unpreventable and just part of the job. There is a degree of       uncertainty, but workplace violence has clear patterns and       detectable risk factors in health care and social service       settings. Actions can be taken to reduce the risk of       workplace violence.        The cost of inaction is high. It is calculated in the pain,       loss, suffering and the disruption to lives, workplaces and       communities caused by these incidents to workers and their       families.        We ask that you send a clear message that Congress will not       ignore the harm and suffering caused to health care,       behavioral health and social service workers by workplace       violence. Please vote in support of H.R. 1309.            Sincerely,                                                        Scott Frey,                            Director of Federal Government Affairs.
