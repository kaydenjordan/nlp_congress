 Mr. Speaker, President Donald Trump was  extraordinarily successful in South Carolina, overcoming the biased  fake news to have a tremendous victory.   The voters appreciated record job growth for African Americans,  Hispanics, and Asian Americans, along with record job growth for women  and youth, along with a restored military with peace through strength,  protecting our allies like Israel, as he stood for law enforcement to  protect American families.   There is true love and affection for Donald Trump in South Carolina.   Democrats wasted the largest onslaught ever of cash, with over $200  million from out-of-State, to pathetically spend money to the point  where their votes were $120 per vote to lose.   Democrats unintentionally exposed their socialist agenda of  everything free for everybody, resulting in citizens with no freedom,  but the political and media elites have all the power.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was correct that socialism will work  until it has run out of spending other people's money, always failing.   In South Carolina, female Republicans were especially targeted by the  failing Democrats. South Carolina has elected the first female  Republican Congresswoman ever, Congresswoman-elect Nancy Mace. The  South Carolina State Senate has elected, with Penry Gustafson of  Camden, the first Republican ever to be elected to the State Senate  from Kershaw County, joining Senators Katrina Shealy of Lexington and  Sandy Senn of Charleston.   Despite Democrat dirty tricks, a smeared Senator Lindsey Graham swept  to victory, with Republican gains at all levels--Federal, State, and  local--with the largest number of Republican elected officials in 140  years.   State Party Chairman Drew McKissick and Executive Director Hope  Walker have been dynamic leaders for successfully leading the victory  party with Governor Henry McMaster, Lieutenant Governor Pamela Evette,  and Attorney General Alan Wilson.   I am humbled to have lived the modern Republican revolution,  attending the swearing-in of State Representative Charlie Boineau in  August 1961 as the first elected Republican in the 20th century, with  State Representative Floyd Spence being the first to courageously  switch parties in 1962, leading today to super Republican majorities  with all statewide officials now Republicans, along with eight out of  nine Federal legislators being Republicans.   I credit my mother, Wray Wilson, for my political involvement, as she  was a pioneering activist in South Carolina for President Dwight  Eisenhower in 1952.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September 11th in the global war on terrorism.

Operation Warp Speed is America's commonsense path toward a historic  effort to safely bring the virus testing, treatments, and vaccines to  the American people in record time.   Extraordinary scientists, doctors, and manufacturers from around the  Nation are working tirelessly through Operation Warp Speed to develop  safe and effective vaccines. A safe, effective vaccine is the key to  restoring our normal way of life and restoring jobs.   Just this week, Moderna announced vaccine success and, thanks to  President Trump, vaccine production is underway.   This is great news for our families and for the restoration of jobs,  and I am grateful that we are closer than ever to defeating the  pandemic.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
