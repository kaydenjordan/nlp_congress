 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life of William  Allen Pullum.   Navarre is a community in my district in Florida that is one of the  fastest growing. It is vibrant, full of warfighters, workers, and  lovely people. Bill Pullum is the father of Navarre.   He was born in 1947 and lived most of his life in this community. He  joined the Army in 1967 as an Army helicopter  [[Page H2915]]  pilot and earned the Silver and Bronze Stars, as well as two  Distinguished Flying Crosses in Vietnam before being honorably  discharged in 1970.   He was involved in every aspect of life from real estate to business  development, chambers of commerce, Kiwanis Clubs. There was hardly a  cause in Navarre that Bill Pullum and his family did not support.   He was dedicated as a family member, a husband, a father, and was  instrumental in mission work in Honduras throughout his life.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring the late Bill Pullum for his  life of service to our country and to the community in my district.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to commemorate the life of  Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Lombardo.   Sam and his family legally immigrated to the United States from  Italy. He enlisted to serve in the Army National Guard's 28th Infantry  Division just 1 month following the start of World War II.   After training, he was deployed to Europe where he would serve as  platoon leader and executive officer of I Company, 394th Infantry  Regiment, 99th Division, and he would always remind constituents in  northwest Florida that he fought in the Battle of the Bulge.   During this time, Lieutenant Colonel Lombardo and his platoon created  their own makeshift flag out of scraps of red and blue cloth. For the  white, they used German surrender flags. They used this as their battle  flag in victorious campaigns across the Rhine and Danube Rivers.   Following World War II, Lieutenant Colonel Lombardo continued his  service to our country in Korea and Vietnam.   Throughout his service, Lieutenant Colonel Lombardo earned the Silver  Star, the Bronze Star with ``V'' for Valor, as well as an Oak Leaf  Cluster with Meritorious Achievement among 10 other medals.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring the late Lieutenant Colonel  Samuel Lombardo.   I asked Sam how he was able to be so healthy after more than 100  years living on the planet Earth. He said that his secret was red wine  and almonds at night. I think I will have a little of both in his honor  this evening.
