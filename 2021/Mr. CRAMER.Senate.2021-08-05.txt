 Mr. President, I rise today in support of North Dakota  Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem filing a lawsuit against the Biden  administration's continued cancelation of oil and gas leases on Federal  lands and its impact on State and private mineral owners.   In addition to being a foolish idea, I believe President Biden's  moratorium is illegal. It increases Federal and State budget  shortfalls, hampers State and private mineral owners' rights, and makes  the United States less energy independent and more reliant on foreign  producers.   My State of North Dakota is uniquely harmed by this action, given  what is commonly referred to as the split estate issue. For roughly 100  years, the Federal Government has retained Federal mineral rights on  land near where State and/or private entities also hold surface and  mineral rights. About 30 percent of the spacing units in North Dakota  have interspersed federal mineral interests and therefore must go  through the leasing process of the Bureau of Land Management--BLM-- regardless of its size.   Accordingly, since the moratorium, it is estimated our State has lost  $4.77 billion in tax revenues and $1.2 billion in private royalties. We  are grateful the Louisiana Federal District Court Order agreed the  Biden administration's actions are illegal, but unfortunately, we are  being given no reason to think the near of this harmful policy is near.   On a recent call between the leadership of the BLM Montana/Dakotas  office and constituents from the region, BLM officials stated that they  are canceling quarterly lease sales at least through the end of  calendar year 2021. Citing the administration's plans to appeal the  district court ruling, State Director John Mehloff said, ``We'll  probably, at earliest, would be able to hold an oil and gas lease sale  late first quarter of 2022.''   That is disappointing, to say the least. Thankfully, North Dakota is  taking action to protect our producers and America's energy security. I  support the State's efforts in court and hope they are successful.                            ____________________
