 Madam Speaker, this morning, 40 million  Americans will begin their day without access to broadband internet.  These high-speed broadband connections, which were once a luxury, have  now become essential tools for students, businessowners, farmers, and  patients.   Last year, historic BEAD funding was disbursed to the States. Today,  it is critical that these funds are used efficiently, not to gold-plate  the infrastructure in our cities, but to finally connect our rural  communities to fast, reliable, high-speed internet.   Recently, I was proud to introduce the 5G SALE Act to require the FCC  to release previously auctioned spectrum in order to expand access to  5G internet for communities across central and western Pennsylvania.   Bridging the digital divide has never been more important as we fight  to ensure that our students can learn from home, that small businesses  can operate from home, and that patients can heal from home.                 Enacting Republicans' Commitment to America     Madam Speaker, in the past 10 months since  retaking the majority, House Republicans have fought to enact our  Commitment to America, working each day to forge an economy that is  strong, to build a nation that is safe, to create a future that is  built on freedom, and to once again have a government that is  accountable to the American people.   We fought to reopen the people's House. We passed H.R. 1, the Lower  Energy Costs Act, 225-204, because Americans are paying too high a  price for gas. We passed H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act, 219-213,  because President Biden's border crisis has made each and every State a  border State. We passed H.R. 5, the Parents Bill of Rights Act, 213- 208, because parents deserve to be involved in their children's  education.   These legislative victories have only been possible because House  Republicans have remained united and willing to stand up to President  Biden's radical agenda. It must be a top priority to fight President  Biden's out-of-control spending, his Green New Deal initiatives, and  his threats to strip away our constitutional rights.   Madam Speaker, it is time for House Republicans to renew our  commitment to the American people and to our shared conservative  values. The work that is still ahead is too great to waste any  additional time.                            ____________________
