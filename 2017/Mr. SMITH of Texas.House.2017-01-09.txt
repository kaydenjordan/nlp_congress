 Mr. Speaker, a good example of fake news appeared  in Sunday's New York Times. It is a column headlined, ``As Trump Denies  Climate Change, These Kids Die.'' This may be a new high--or maybe a  new low--for climate alarmists and their exaggerations.   Two facts: first, most severe and persistent droughts occurred  decades ago, not recently; and second, there is little connection  between climate change and extreme weather, in general, according to  numerous studies.   Climate alarmists tend to ignore scientific evidence and encourage  media hype, and, of course, the liberal media is all too willing to go  along. Climate discussions should be based on good science, not  politically correct science.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, first of all, I thank the gentleman  from Oklahoma and the vice chairman of the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee for yielding, and I thank both him and Mr.  Bridenstine, another gentleman from Oklahoma and a member of the  Science, Space, and Technology Committee, for taking the initiative and  introducing this legislation.   H.R. 353, Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017,  will transform our Nation's weather-gathering efforts and help save  lives and property.   Severe weather routinely affects large portions of the United States.  Nearly every year, we witness the devastating effects of tornadoes  across our country. The deaths and the damage from these events  underscore the need for a world-class weather prediction system.   H.R. 353 improves weather observation systems by the use of observing  system simulation experiments and next generation computing and  modeling capabilities. This bill strengthens the underlying atmospheric  science, while advancing innovative technology and reforming operations  to provide better weather data, models, and forecasts. It prompts NOAA  to actively employ new commercial data and solutions through a  multiyear commercial weather data pilot program.   Further, it directs NOAA to consider commercial data options rather  than rely on slow, costly, and continually delayed government-owned  satellites.   For far too long, our government has relied on these massive,  multibillion-dollar government satellites. The Science, Space, and  Technology Committee has jurisdiction over NOAA's satellite office and  has conducted ongoing oversight of the agency's satellite program. Our  conclusion is that it is in real need of reform.   Over the years, events at NOAA have revealed mismanagement, cost  overruns, and delays of its weather satellites. This detracts from our  ability to accurately predict our weather, which unnecessarily  endangers Americans.   This bill will right the ship and allow NOAA the flexibility to buy  new, affordable, and potentially better sources of data from the  private sector, which has the power to make real improvements to our  weather forecasting capabilities.   It also creates a much-needed technology transfer fund in NOAA's  Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research to help push technologies  developed through NOAA's weather research into operation. This will  ensure that the technologies that are developed are effectively  employed and do not idle on the lab bench.   Again, I thank Mr. Lucas and Mr. Bridenstine for their initiative on  this issue. Americans from coast to coast will now be better prepared  for severe weather with the passage of this bill.   I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
