 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about the growing threat  of the use of a nuclear weapon in armed conflict and the threat of a  new nuclear arms race. Such threats should scare every single Member of  this House. I know it worries my constituents.   The world has not been in such an unstable nuclear situation since  the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Since that time, the risk of nuclear war  has not been high, but it has never been zero.   A web of nuclear arms control agreements was created over decades  that reduced the number of nuclear warheads and set limits on nuclear  testing. Over 50 years of such agreements, the number of nuclear  warheads was reduced by 86 percent.   However, Mr. Speaker, after decades of progress in nuclear arms  control and disarmament, in a very short period, we have seen much of  the architecture of these agreements undermined. While not quite  dismantled, they are significantly weakened as both the Russian  Federation and the United States have withdrawn from some, and Russia  has unilaterally withdrawn from others.   We have seen the nuclear weapons agreement with Iran, the Joint  Comprehensive Plan of Action, erode following the U.S. withdrawal by  President Donald Trump in 2018. As a result, every day, the Iranian  Government increases its capacity to build a nuclear weapon.   Throughout Russia's unprovoked and unlawful invasion of Ukraine, we  have frequently heard Russia threaten to use nuclear weapons against  Ukraine. In late November, President Putin's mouthpiece, Vladimir  Solovyov, who hosts a show on Russian state TV, warned that nuclear war  is ``unavoidable.''   Each of these actions--let alone taken together--exposes the  unbearable truth about nuclear weapons: Nuclear weapons do not prevent  wars. To the contrary, they are used to threaten, coerce, and  facilitate war.   Mr. Speaker, we need an urgent call to action. There is leadership in  this House seeking to renew and reinvigorate the urgent need for  nuclear arms control.   Congressmen  Don Beyer and   John Garamendi lead a working group on  nuclear weapons and arms control.   Congressman Ted Lieu has introduced H.R. 669 to restrict the first  use of nuclear weapons and H.R. 2894 that would block a nuclear launch  by artificial intelligence.   Along with Congressman Blumenauer, I introduced H. Res. 77 that calls  on the United States Government to work toward the goals and  aspirations of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the  TPNW.   Along with Senator Markey, I have also introduced H.R. 3154, the HALT  Act, to freeze nuclear weapons production and urgently return to  negotiations.   Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton has introduced H.R. 2775 to  direct the U.S. to sign the TPNW and convert the funds that maintain  and sustain our nuclear arsenal to address urgent domestic needs.   At the end of November, I was privileged to attend a meeting of  parliamentarians at the United Nations to discuss these urgent  questions. The meeting was coordinated by a Nobel Peace Prize  recipient, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. Each  of us was from a nation that has not yet joined the Treaty on the  Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. We discussed what needs to happen in  our countries and our parliaments to accelerate the debate on ending  the threat of nuclear weapons.   We were at the U.N. because the 93 nations that have joined the TPNW  were meeting to discuss concrete steps to implement the treaty's  provision. Such leadership should be recognized and supported, Mr.  Speaker, but it is not enough. It is simply not enough.   I wish the United States would be bold. I wish the United States  would join the TPNW and abolish nuclear weapons once and for all. At a  minimum, we need a path back to dialogue in arms control negotiations.   If we are going to move the major nuclear powers to action, including  the United States, we need a massive outpouring of grassroots action in  support of ending the threat of nuclear weapons. Without large-scale  citizen movements, I fear that the nuclear powers will continue to move  in the wrong direction, and we will see the unraveling of all nuclear  agreements, a renewed nuclear arms race, and even the actual use of  nuclear weapons in current and future conflicts.   We cannot wait to change direction, Mr. Speaker. We live at a time  when the world as we know it can be destroyed in one terrible nuclear  flash. The time to act is now.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the record the ``Parliamentarian Statement  to the 2MSP.''                   Parliamentarian Statement to the 2MSP      (Delivered by Guillaume Defosse, Parliamentarians for the TPNW)         As a delegation of 23 parliamentarians from 14 countries,       we are honoured to address this second Meeting of States       Parties to the TPNW. This meeting represents a pivotal moment       in our collective journey toward a world free of these       devastating weapons. We extend our appreciation to the       governments, organisations, and civil society representatives       who have tirelessly championed this cause. The TPNW remains a       bright and powerful reason for hope when many other       international developments point in the wrong direction.        We congratulate the state parties and signatories of the       TPNW for their unwavering leadership on the global abolition       of nuclear weapons since the last meeting of states parties.       Your dedication showcases the immeasurable value of the TPNW       within the international legal regime that prohibits weapons       of mass destruction, offering a clear pathway to their global       eradication.        We applaud our colleagues who have worked tirelessly to       convey the significance of this Treaty to their respective       governments and advance the process of ratification. Our       commitment remains resolute, grounded in the belief that the       citizens we represent, along with all citizens, should never       have to bear the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of       nuclear weapons use or testing. We pledge to redouble our       efforts in expanding the membership of this Treaty and       supporting its effective implementation. We will tirelessly       strive to garner support among parliamentarians for this       Treaty and call on all governments to sign and ratify it as a       matter of international urgency.        We stand united in denouncing any and all nuclear threats,       regardless of their form and irrespective of the       circumstances. As recalled by TPNW, and in accordance with       the UN Charter, all States must refrain from the threat or       use of force. Leaders around the world must confront the       reality that nuclear threats now being voiced by certain       policymakers reveal the folly of continued legitimization of       nuclear weapons including through promoting so-called nuclear       deterrence. It is encouraging to see that many leaders, even       from nations not yet party to this Treaty, have adopted a       similar stance, firmly rejecting the unacceptable rhetoric       surrounding so-called tactical nuclear weapons and loose       discussions of their use.        However, despite repeated assurances and commitments to       disarm, nuclear-armed states collectively maintain over       12,000 nuclear weapons and continue to allocate vast       resources for the modernization and expansion of their       arsenals. In 2022, $82.9 billion were spent on nuclear       weapons. Money that would be better invested in a       sustainable, just, and peaceful future. We deplore the       reliance on the perilous doctrine of nuclear deterrence and       the renewed emphasis on the nuclear dimension of military       alliances, which obstructs progress toward nuclear       disarmament, elevates nuclear risks, and undermines non-      proliferation efforts. We also vehemently object to the       deployment of nuclear weapons on the territory of other       states, a direct contradiction to the objectives of the       Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and a violation of Article 1       of the TPNW.        In striking contrast to the reckless rhetoric of certain       nuclear-armed states and their allies, we commend the state       parties to this Treaty for their unwavering dedication to       implementing the TPNW. We, too, are committed to taking every       conceivable action to advance the prohibitions of the Treaty.       The regrettable decision of Russia to de-ratify the       Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty  [[Page H6865]]       reminds us of the importance of upholding the unequivocal       prohibitions on nuclear testing as stipulated in the TPNW and       the CTBT. We call on all states to refrain from actions that       undermine the integrity of either treaty.        We join the states parties in emphasising the       complementarity of the TPNW with the Nuclear Non-      Proliferation Treaty and remain unwavering in our support of       all measures contributing to nuclear disarmament and non-      proliferation. Through constructive engagement with       policymakers in nuclear-armed states and their allies, we aim       to enhance international security and make substantial       strides toward the shared goal of universalizing the TPNW.        We recognize the importance of not confining discussions on       nuclear disarmament solely to designated diplomatic fora. The       threats posed by nuclear weapons extend far beyond national       security concerns; they encompass the well-being of our       planet and humanity as a whole. The environmental       consequences of nuclear weapons devastate the health and       livelihoods of our communities. It is our duty to recognize       the multifaceted nature of this issue and actively work       towards integrating nuclear disarmament into all policy       areas.        More than 1000 sitting parliamentarians have signed ICAN's       parliamentary pledge. We are from 27 countries that have not       yet ratified the TPNW. We span the political spectrum, and       might not see eye to eye on other issues, but we are united       in our commitment to work for our countries' ratification of       the TPNW, as we consider the abolition of nuclear weapons to       be a global public good of the highest order and an essential       step to promote the security and well-being of all peoples.        In fulfilling our pledge, we have instigated parliamentary       debates on the TPNW; we have tabled resolutions in support of       it; we have questioned governments on our national positions;       and we have engaged with our constituents in a public       conversation about the urgent need for disarmament. To repeat       the promise of the TPNW states parties in the Vienna       declaration: ``We will not rest until the last state has       joined the treaty, the last warhead has been dismantled and       destroyed, and nuclear weapons have been totally eliminated       from the Earth.''        In conclusion, we echo the collective sentiment that many       pressing challenges underscore the urgency and relevance of       the mission embodied by the TPNW. Let us persist in our       collaborative efforts for a future where humanity thrives in       a world free from the ominous shadow of nuclear weapons.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we are here for one reason and one reason alone: Donald  Trump demanded that Republicans impeach, so they are going to impeach.   These Republicans don't work for you, the American people. They work  for Donald Trump. He says, ``Jump.'' They respond, ``How high?''                                time  1245    This whole thing is an extreme political stunt. It has no  credibility, no legitimacy, and no integrity. It is a sideshow and a  distraction from the fact that Republicans have done nothing.   They have the wrong priorities. The American people think they are  failing miserably, and Republicans need a diversion. So they are  weaponizing and abusing impeachment--one of the most somber and serious  things that Congress can do--to attack President Joe Biden.   I get it. They are upset Donald Trump lost. Some of them still don't  believe he lost. Many of them are upset that his violent insurrection  did not succeed on January 6, and today they want to finish the job.  This is a continuation of their crusade to overturn the election.   They have spent a year dredging up every conspiracy you can imagine,  Mr. Speaker, against Joe Biden, and still their own investigation,  their own Members, their own witnesses, and their own internal  documents all say that President Joe Biden is a man of integrity who  follows the law. Every single one of their crazy claims has been  exhaustively debunked, and, yet, here we are.   The only thing they have uncovered is that Joe Biden is a good dad  and that he loves his family. His son Hunter lost his mom and sister in  a terrible car accident and lost his brother to cancer. He experienced  a lot of traumas, and, sadly, he got caught up with drugs. Republicans  are weaponizing this addiction and using it to attack President Biden,  a man of decency and integrity.   Frankly, it is one of, if not the most, despicable thing I have seen  in my whole career here in Congress.   Republicans talk about an open and transparent process. Give me a  break.   Yesterday, Rules Committee Republicans blocked Democrats from adding  the words ``open and transparent'' to this resolution. They voted  against requiring a single open hearing. They didn't even put our  amendment in the official committee report. I have never seen anything  like that. They are so afraid of openness and transparency that they  are literally trying to hide our amendments from the public record.   They don't want an open and transparent process. They are allergic to  transparency. They want no transparency, so they can go on FOX News,  distort the facts, and keep this whole ridiculous charade going. Their  whole investigation is built on lies. It is an extreme political stunt  designed to distract from how incompetent Republicans are and how  obsessed they are with Donald Trump, a twice impeached ex-President who  has been indicted more times than he has been elected. How pathetic.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would need a map to get out of the  rabbit hole Mr. Comer just took us down.   Nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, if you want to know what an impeachable  offense looks like, here it is: When that man, the wannabe dictator,  told that angry, violent mob to attack this Capitol Building where we  all are right now to overturn a free and fair election. That is what a  smoking gun looks like.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Raskin), who is the distinguished ranking member on the Committee on  Oversight and Accountability.    Mr. Speaker, I need to get a decoder ring.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from New  Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez), who is a distinguished member of Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I remind the gentlewoman that Hunter Biden was here today. He wants to  testify in public, but Republicans said no because they want to do it  behind closed doors so they can go on FOX News and cherry-pick facts  and figures and distort the truth.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans aren't interested in transparency in this  investigation, and apparently the Rules Committee isn't either. In our  markup yesterday, Democrats offered nine amendments. They were all  voted down by Republicans, but in the official Rules Committee report,  contrary to years of committee practice and tradition, the majority  left out descriptions of those amendments.   Instead of reading, for example, that Republicans defeated an  amendment to add ``open and transparent'' to investigative proceedings,  members of the public will only see that Republicans voted down  ``amendment No. 4.''   Instead of defeating an amendment requiring committees to hold an  open hearing as part of the investigation, the Record will show that  the majority simply voted down ``amendment No. 5.''   Republicans are literally hiding Democratic amendments about  transparency. You cannot make this stuff up, Mr. Speaker, and this is  especially shocking to me because it is so out of line with the way  this committee has run historically under this chairman. I am deeply  disappointed, and I hope that this isn't an indication of how the  majority intends to operate in the future.   Further, to make sure that these amendments show up somewhere in this  historical Record, I am going to put the summaries in the Congressional  Record.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the summaries of our nine  amendments, which Republicans intentionally left out of the Rules  Committee report.                     Democratic Amendments to H. Res. 918         1. Offered by Rep. McGovern--adds a preamble describing       President Joe Biden's career of honorable public service and       former President Trump's multiple impeachments and 91 pending       felony charges.        2. Offered by Rep. Leger Fernandez--Adds a preamble stating       that the months-long Republican-led investigation into       President Joe Biden has yielded no evidence of wrongdoing by       the President.        3. Offered by Rep. Scanlon--Adds a preamble describing the       tens of thousands of pages of records provided by the       Administration and dozens of hours of testimony heard as part       of the investigation.        4. Offered by Rep. Neguse--Adds ``Open and Transparent'' to       investigative proceedings by the committees on Oversight and       Accountability, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary.        5. Offered by Rep. Leger Fernandez--Requires the committees       on Oversight and Accountability, Ways and Means, and the       Judiciary to each hold at least one open hearing as part of       the investigation.        6. Offered by Rep. Scanlon--Provides that a chair or       ranking member cannot issue a subpoena in furtherance of the       impeachment inquiry if they did not comply with a House,       committee, or select committee subpoena.        7. Offered by Rep. McGovern--Strikes the provision deeming       H. Res. 917 as adopted.        8. Offered by Rep. McGovern--Amends H. Res. 917 to exclude       access to grand jury material related to a pending criminal       prosecution, a prosecution arising from the January 6 attack       on the Capitol, or a case in which former President Trump is       a defendant.        9. Offered by Rep. Neguse--Adds a preamble stating that by       December 11 in the first session of the 117th and 116th       Congresses, 71 and 78 bills had been enacted, respectively,       versus 22 in the 118th Congress; and stating that the House       spent 26 days electing two Speakers in 2023.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, Members should be advised that Joe Biden,  not Hunter Biden, is President of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Nadler), the distinguished ranking member of the Committee on the  Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), the distinguished ranking member of the  Committee on Ways and Means.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from  Time magazine titled, `` `Absolutely Shocking': Impeachment Experts Say  Biden Inquiry May Be Weakest in U.S. History.''                        [From TIME, Sept. 12, 2023]    `Absolutely Shocking': Impeachment Experts Say Biden Inquiry May Be                          Weakest in U.S. History                              (By Mini Racker)         Speaker Kevin McCarthy took the rare step on Tuesday of       announcing the launch of an impeachment inquiry into       President Joe Biden over his son Hunter's foreign business       dealings.        The House has voted to impeach just three Presidents:       Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump, who was       impeached twice. But even the launch of an impeachment       inquiry against a President has only happened a handful of       times. Two impeachment experts tell TIME that there is less       evidence implicating Biden of wrongdoing than in any of those       previous inquiries.        ``This is very disturbing for people who study past       impeachments, because impeachment is really a very extreme       measure,'' says constitutional scholar Philip Bobbitt, a       professor at Columbia Law School and expert on the history of       impeachment who co-authored an updated edition of Charles       Black's classic legal text, Impeachment: A Handbook, in 2018.       ``I honestly don't know that there is any evidence tying the       president to corrupt activities when he was vice president or       now.''        Frank Bowman, professor emeritus at the University of       Missouri school of law and author of the book High Crimes and       Misdemeanors: A History of Impeachment for the Age of Trump,       said that McCarthy's decision did not appear to be based on       the evidence House Republicans have gathered thus far.        ``Biden's Republican pursuers have got exactly zero, zip,       bupkis, on any matter that might be impeachable,'' says       Bowman.        The Constitution gives Congress the right to impeach and       remove from office a president, vice president, or federal       civil officer for committing ``treason, bribery, or other       high crimes and misdemeanors.'' Historically, before the       House votes on impeachment itself--the misconduct charge       brought by a legislative body--it has usually launched an       impeachment inquiry, a formal mechanism that moves the       process along. However, an inquiry is not a legal requirement       for impeaching a president, and the rules around what       constitutes one are poorly defined.        According to Bowman, setting aside whether the five       previous presidents who faced impeachment proceedings ought       to have been impeached and convicted, there was at least some       evidence indicating that they committed misconduct. The       impeachment inquiry into President Richard Nixon, who       resigned before the House could formally impeach him, was       preceded by a special prosecutor investigation examining his       ties to the Watergate burglary, as well as a Senate Special       Committee inquiry into the break-in that stretched more than       a year and reporting by journalists suggesting that       responsibility for the incident and attempts to cover it up       stretched into the administration. Two decades later, nearly       a month before the House launched an impeachment inquiry into       President Bill Clinton, independent counsel Ken Starr       released a report outlining 11 possible grounds for       impeachment, including lying under oath and obstructing       justice.        ``In every single case, there was very significant evidence       of presidential wrongdoing before the formal inquiry was       begun,'' Bowman says, ``The House, and House leadership, took       the responsibility of formally opening such an inquiry       extremely seriously. Nancy Pelosi, in the first impeachment,       resisted calls for impeachment of Trump for two years.''        McCarthy's inquiry, Bowman suggests, lacks that discipline.        ``What they're doing here is absolutely shocking,'' says       Bowman, who added that House Republicans ``have no interest       at all in preserving the basic integrity of the process, or       indeed their own power as legislators in legitimate       opposition and tension with the executive branch.''        House Republicans have spent all year investigating Hunter       Biden in hopes of proving that Joe Biden profited off his       son's business dealings, particularly while Joe Biden was       Vice President. There has been no conclusive evidence       indicating Joe Biden did anything wrong.        McCarthy previously indicated that the full House would       hold a vote to open an impeachment inquiry into Biden. Such a       vote would need the support of nearly every Republican in the       narrowly-divided chamber. But nearly 20 House Republicans       have expressed resistance to voting for it, and a full House       vote could open them up to political liability.        The Speaker's decision to open the inquiry without a vote       has precedent; Pelosi did the same thing ahead of Trump's       first impeachment, holding a full House vote to formally       endorse the inquiry only weeks later. Trump's second       impeachment, following the January 6, 2021, attack on the       Capitol, was not preceded by any inquiry at all. Congress has       also voted to impeach federal judges without first opening       inquiries.        Back in 2019, when Democrats controlled the House, McCarthy       and his Republican allies slammed them for opening an       impeachment inquiry against Trump without a vote, suggesting       that doing so made the process illegitimate.        ``The fact that, for a period of time between September 24       and October 31 of that year, the impeachment inquiry for       Trump was going on without a full House vote, became an       excuse for Republicans, first in the House, and then in the       Senate, to vote against impeachment for Mr. Trump,'' Bowman       says.        There are no clear standards for launching an impeachment       inquiry, nor are there specific signifiers differentiating it       from other kinds of investigations. Ultimately, the decision       to initiate one is usually left up to House leadership.        ``To the extent they have a plausible end game here, other       than just to keep this in the news and to dirty up Biden       broadly speaking, presumably it will be to issue subpoenas       that that are sufficiently intrusive, either to Biden's       personal life or administration workings, that Biden will       resist, and then to try to impeach him for obstruction of       Congress,'' says Bowman.        There's some historical precedent for that theory; the       third article of impeachment ultimately issued against Nixon       centered on his refusal to comply with congressional       subpoenas brought as part of the impeachment inquiry into       him. Plus, McCarthy previously suggested that boosting       Congress' ability to subpoena Biden's financial documents was       a key motivation for the inquiry.        Both Bowman and Bobbitt suggested the current inquiry could       weaken the federal system of checks and balances by devaluing       the very concept of impeachment.        ``This is supposed to be the most extreme sanction in       American politics, and if you reach for it every time you       think it'll help you in the polls, I fear it will become       degraded,'' Bobbitt says. ``It just becomes one more very       divisive, poisonous event in a Congress that is already       deeply divided and alienated.''     Mr. Speaker, This article quotes Philip Bobbitt, a  constitutional scholar at Columbia Law saying impeachment ``is supposed  to be the most extreme sanction in American politics, and if you reach  for it every time you think it will help you in the polls, I fear it  will become degraded.''   Mr. Speaker, everything the gentleman just said has been debunked,  and it is just nuts.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff).    Mr. Speaker, I will tell the gentleman what is a  mockery: This is a mockery. We hear the same tired, old conspiracy  theories being recycled over and over again that have all been  debunked.   I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Goldman)  to further debunk them.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), the distinguished Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, it is amazing. A pattern is developing. If  you will notice, my Republican friends never talk about Joe Biden. It  is all Hunter Biden. They seem to be obsessed with him. I don't know.  They need to get some help.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Swalwell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries), the Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr.  Robert Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Neguse), a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will  offer an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 12, a bill that would  ensure every American has full access to essential reproductive  healthcare, including abortion care.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with any extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman from Oklahoma have any  other speakers?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, Republicans are saying the quiet part out  loud.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a  Rolling Stone article from today titled: ``GOP Rep. Explains  Impeachment Push: `Donald J. Trump 2024, Baby!'''                     [From RollingStone, Dec. 13, 2023]     GOP Rep. Explains Impeachment Push: `Donald J.

(By Nikki McCann Ramirez)         House Republicans will vote Wednesday on whether to       formalize their impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.       The party has struggled to gin up a legitimate rationale for       moving forward with the inquiry, which has yet to produce any       credible evidence of wrongdoing, but one Republican is saying       the quiet part out loud.        When Rep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas) was asked Tuesday on Capitol       Hill what he's hoping to gain from an impeachment inquiry,       Nehls responded: ``All I can say is: Donald J. Trump 2024,       baby!''        Video of the encounter was obtained exclusively by Rolling       Stone. When reached for additional comment on Wednesday,       Nehls said in a statement to Rolling Stone that Republicans       ``will follow the rule of law and go where the facts lead       us.''        Nehls is one of Trump's most ardent supporters in Congress,       and even floated the former president as a potential House       Speaker after Republicans booted Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.)       from the role in October. His comments are essentially an       admission of what has long been obvious to many, which is       that the GOP's fraught effort to dig up dirt on President       Biden and his family is nothing more than a ham-fisted       political stunt meant to hurt the president's reelection       chances and place Trump back in the White House.        Republicans for months have been trotting out flimsy bits       of evidence they say point to Biden's corruption. They've       produced nothing substantial, however, nor have they been       able to articulate exactly which high crimes and misdemeanors       the president may have committed. Hunter Biden, the       president's son whom Republicans believe worked with his       father on illegal financial dealings, bashed the       investigations while defying a GOP subpoena for closed-door       testimony on Wednesday.        ``I'm here today to make sure the House committee's       illegitimate investigations of my family do not proceed on       distortions, manipulated evidence, and lies,'' he told       reporters outside the Capitol. ``For six years MAGA       Republicans including members of the House committees who are       in a closed-door session right now, have imputed my       character, invaded my privacy, attacked my wife, my children,       my family, and my friends. They've ridiculed my struggle with       addiction, they've belittled my recovery, and they have tried       to dehumanize me, all to embarrass and damage my father.''        Meanwhile, Trump is embroiled in a sea of criminal and       civil legal trouble. Cases in Washington, D.C., and Georgia       relate directly to his effort to undermine the results of the       2020 election and his role in the Jan. 6 attack on the       Capitol. He's also been indicted in New York over a hush-      money scandal ahead of the 2016 election, and by the Justice       Department in Florida over his handling of classified       material after leaving the White House. A civil trial in New       York, where Trump has already been found liable for using       fraudulent financial statements for his business, is expected       to wrap up this week.        Trump is also the clear frontrunner for the Republican 2024       nomination, and a showdown with Biden in the general election       now seems inevitable. Republicans have tied themselves to       Trump's erratic trajectory, and an impeachment inquiry in an       election year is just the kind of circus they need to compete       with the vortex of trials, depositions, and court appearances       swirling around their all-but-official nominee.        The circus will continue with the vote on Wednesday to       formalize their impeachment inquiry, the push to hold Hunter       Biden in contempt of Congress over his defiance of their       subpoena, and a new round of Fox News appearances to try to       legitimize the party's never-ending fishing expedition.       Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-La.) won't be going       on one of the network's most popular anytime soon. He said on       Tuesday that he's boycotting Fox & Friends because one of its       hosts keeps asking him questions he can't answer about what       actual evidence the GOP has on Biden.        House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) also avoided giving       specifics in an op-ed announcing the vote to formalize the       inquiry on Tuesday, writing--sincerely, absurdly--that  [[Page H6887]]       ``impeachment is among the most solemn constitutional       authorities the U.S. Congress holds, particularly when it       comes to a president.''        If that's the public line Johnson wants House Republicans       to use, he'd better get them some additional media training.       At the very least, he should make sure they don't offer up       the real reason for the inquiry as easily as Nehls did on       Tuesday.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, this inquiry has nothing to do with Joe Biden. It is  about the Republican Party and how radicalized and extreme they have  become. They are allergic to truth and transparency.   Republicans say this is not about a preordained outcome. It is. They  are going to try to impeach President Biden despite the fact that there  is no evidence against him at all.   Trump sent a violent MAGA mob here to the Capitol to reverse the  election results and certify that he won, even though he lost.   What they couldn't do on January 6 they want to do with this extreme  political stunt. They have contempt for our democracy. They want to  finish the job.   Republicans say this is all about process, about how the House will  proceed. It is not. The truth is this process has already proceeded for  10 months. They have been investigating all year, obtaining tens of  thousands of documents and hours and hours of witness testimony. All of  it says there is no wrongdoing by President Biden.   Republicans say the White House is stonewalling their inquiry. Again,  that is not true. The White House has provided over 35,000 pages of  financial records, dozens of hours of testimony and interviews. Hunter  Biden is here to testify today, and Republicans won't let him because  they want to do it in secret so they can cherry-pick and distort his  testimony.   This whole inquiry has nothing to do with the integrity of President  Biden and everything to do with the lack of integrity in the Republican  Party.   No amount of evidence could convince Republicans that Joe Biden did  nothing wrong because they aren't looking for the truth. They are  looking for revenge.   Mr. Speaker, I would just say directly to the American people, that  the Republican Party works for Donald Trump; not for you, for Trump.   That is why they are pursuing this extreme political stunt. That is  why they are doing everything in secret. They want to hide the truth  from you because they know their whole impeachment inquiry is a sham,  and it will evaporate into thin air when people realize what a pathetic  joke it is.   This shameful process has no credibility. It has no legitimacy and no  integrity.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
