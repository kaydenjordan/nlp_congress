 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 415 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 415         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 6) to       authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment of       status of certain aliens, and for other purposes. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived. An       amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 116-16, modified by the       amendment printed in the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution, shall be considered as adopted.       The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points       of order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are       waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill, as amended, and on any further amendment       thereto, to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) two hours of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the       Judiciary; and (2) one motion to recommit with or without       instructions.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 415, providing for consideration of  H.R. 6, the American Dream and Promise Act, under a closed rule self- executing a manager's amendment. The rule provides 2 hours of debate,  equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the  Committee on the Judiciary.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the bill in this rule, H.R.  6, the American Dream and Promise Act. I rise as the granddaughter of  immigrants.   This is a historic day in which we begin to shape immigration policy  that reflects American values. H.R. 6 offers a path to lawful permanent  residence status for Dreamers, TPS holders, and DED beneficiaries.  These are our neighbors, our friends, our schoolmates, our workers, and  our family. They make our communities stronger and fuller. They are  Americans in every way except under the law. We intend to correct that  omission today.   These immigrants are longtime residents of our country with deep  roots in the communities where they reside. For many of them, the  United States is the only country they have ever called home. It is  cruel and un-American that we have left members of our communities to  suffer uncertainty in this way.   With this bill, we keep families together and ensure that these  women, men, and children can continue contributing to the communities  we share. In my district, Florida's 27th, there are 11,400 residents  who are eligible for protection under H.R. 6. Approximately 8,200 are  Dreamers, and 3,400 are TPS or DED holders.   As I have long said, in my south Florida community, it doesn't matter  the color of your skin, the language you speak, whom you hold hands  with, your religion, or your country of origin. You are a Miamian if  you call our city home. Today, the House of Representatives will make  clear that you have every right to call yourselves Americans, too.   Madam Speaker, I proudly support this historic step forward towards a  more just America. Let's pass this rule and H.R. 6.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), the distinguished chair of the Committee on  the Judiciary's Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 2 minutes.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Roybal-Allard).    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I wish to remind  them what the President said after terminating DACA and ending TPS for  hundreds of thousands of immigrants: ``It is now time for Congress to  act.'' And today, we are acting.   We are in the midst of the longest probationary period for  citizenship and  [[Page H4243]]  permanent status in American history. But today, we are finally  providing real solutions for Dreamers, TPS recipients, and DED  beneficiaries.   We are providing solutions for people like Maria Moreno, who came to  the United States as a child and is a constituent of mine. She is now a  22-year-old anthropology student at Florida International University  and currently working at HistoryMiami Museum.   She has spent her life focused on her education. Now, as she pursues  her career as an anthropologist, she continues to find ways to make  changes within her community. She is a tutor for local kids, empowering  them to find joy in learning.   To say that Maria is not worthy of permanent legal status is cruel  and unjust. She is just as American as you and I.   And Maria is just one of millions of Dreamers who cherishes the  American Dream. They work hard and believe in a country that has been  shamefully slow in recognizing their worth.   Despite all the hardship we have put them through, like the newcomers  before them, they still believe in our country's commitment to  opportunity and fairness.   Today, the Dreamers, Madam Speaker, are one step closer to getting  their dream. Today, the Dreamers, Madam Speaker, are one House closer  to getting their dream.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
