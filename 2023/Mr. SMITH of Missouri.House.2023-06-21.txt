 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous material on H.R. 3799.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, we are here today considering this legislation because we  have listened to the American people and are taking action on their  behalf.   The Ways and Means Committee has traveled over 5,000 miles to hear  directly from working Americans about the impact today's economy has  had on them and their communities. Whether it be in a lumber mill in  West Virginia or a cattle ranch in Oklahoma, workers, families,  farmers, and small businesses have told us the same thing: They need  relief from the Biden economy.   The legislation before us today will help make life a little bit  easier on small businesses. It allows them to provide more options to  their employees when it comes to health insurance benefits.   The CHOICE Arrangement Act gives small businesses more flexibility to  provide health insurance benefits to current and future workers.  Introduced by Representative Hern, this legislation codifies a Trump  administration rule allowing small businesses to reimburse employees  for buying their own health insurance on the individual market.   Washington should not stand in the way of workers getting the  healthcare coverage that is best for them and their families. Just as  important, workers should be able to take their insurance plan with  them if they leave their current job. This bill gives small businesses  the opportunity, if they so choose, to shed the administrative burden  of managing traditional insurance coverage. At the same time, it gives  workers more options for their own healthcare and makes the coverage  portable.   Also included in the underlying bill is a provision from  Representative Tenney that ensures small businesses are made aware of  the flexible, tax-advantaged insurance coverage options available to  them and their employees. We have heard that 70 percent of small  businesses are not aware of the various health insurance options out  there, such as CHOICE arrangements, qualified small employer health  reimbursement arrangements, or the small business healthcare tax  credit. This bill would make sure small businesses are notified about  the availability and tax benefits of these options so businesses can  make more informed decisions about how to support their employees'  healthcare choices.   This legislation also includes important provisions to increase  access to stop-loss insurance and expand association health plans,  which will create more choices for American small businesses to offer  health benefits to their workers at lower costs.   Mom-and-pop stores did not set out to be paper pushers and benefit  managers, and we should not force them into that role. I urge my  colleagues to support this bill to help small businesses support  their workforce and let them focus on what they do best: serving their  customers and employees.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, all CHOICE Arrangement Act plans  must cover preexisting conditions, cap out-of-pocket expenses, and  cover key health benefits.   CHOICE arrangements do not allow employers to discriminate against  any group of employees. They require equal contributions to all  employees with the same employment status, and only adjust contribution  amount for age and family size, to make the record straight.   I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Hern), the  sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentleman from Oklahoma.    Mr. Chairman, the CHOICE Arrangement Act will  expand coverage for more types of workers by allowing employers to  offer a CHOICE Arrangement to different groups of employees who may not  have been offered health insurance previously, such as part-time or  seasonal workers.   Under this policy, nearly 1 million workers will have health  insurance coverage for the very first time.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Tenney), who is an author of a piece of this legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Chairman, when Democrats expanded  ObamaCare subsidies in the Inflation Reduction Act, those billions of  dollars flow directly to large health insurers. CHOICE arrangements,  however, allows small businesses--small businesses--to reimburse their  own employees directly for them to shop and purchase their own health  insurance. This is how Washington should be empowering small  businesses, not bailing out large health insurers.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Mrs.  Chavez-DeRemer).   Mrs. CHAVEZ-DeREMER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the CHOICE  Arrangement Act.   Small business owners are being hamstrung by soaring healthcare  costs. I know firsthand because I am a small business owner, but you  don't have to take my word for it. The data speaks for itself.   In Deschutes County in my district, the average small business  premium for a family has increased by 111 percent from 2014 to 2022.   It is past time to provide small business owners with more options so  workers can access cheaper coverage. We can accomplish this by  expanding association health plans and providing more flexibility to  ensure employees can get the coverage that fits their needs best.   Mr. Chairman, I am proud to support small businesses, which create  jobs, foster innovation, and keep our economy running strong.   Let's get this done to ensure these employers can keep their doors  open.    Mr. Chairman, I remind the body that Build  Back Better was never signed into law because neither the Democrats in  the Senate nor the White House would even support it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Meuser).    Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman from Texas has  no further speakers, I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Congress has an opportunity to help small businesses by making it  easier for those who choose to provide health insurance for their  employees.   This bill is the best of both worlds for small businesses and  workers. It relieves many small businesses of the burden of  administering a complex health insurance plan by allowing them to  instead offer meaningful financial support to employees so that they  can buy their own insurance. It takes some of the guessing game out of  offering coverage by making sure small businesses are informed of the  various options they have. It gives workers the freedom to choose the  best possible coverage for themselves and their families.   By passing this legislation, we will allow small businesses to get  back to the basics, helping their customers, taking care of their  employees, and serving their communities.   I want to address the misleading claims we have heard from our  Democrat colleagues. At our markup, one of my Democrat colleagues  called the health plan options under this bill junk plans. That is  unequivocally false. These funds can only be used to purchase plans  that cover preexisting conditions. Regardless of what you hear on the  other side, this covers plans with preexisting conditions. It covers  plans that cap out-of-pocket expenses and guarantees coverage during  open enrollment.   They also claim that we are opening a backdoor for businesses to  discriminate in the health benefits offered to their employees. CHOICE  arrangements provide the opposite of discrimination. They provide equal  contributions to all employees with the same employment status, only  adjusting for age and family size.   In fact, many businesses today don't offer health benefits to any of  their part-time employees. Through CHOICE arrangements, these employees  may be seeing their first offer of meaningful health benefits.   Today, we are taking another step forward to cut the bureaucratic red  tape holding back small businesses. We should make it easier, not  harder, to give America's workers, families, farmers, and small  businesses access to flexible healthcare options.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when  the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow for  legislative business.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3801) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to  streamline and improve the employer reporting process relating to  health insurance coverage and to protect dependent privacy, as amended.

(b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section       shall apply with respect to returns which are due after       December 31, 2024.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words about the Employer  Reporting Improvement Act before us today, introduced by my good  friends, Ways and Means colleagues, Representatives Adrian Smith and    Mike Thompson. This is a straightforward and effective bipartisan  solution to provide small businesses with relief from cumbersome  Affordable Care Act reporting requirements.   Under current law, every year, to determine compliance with ACA  requirements, employers have to report to the IRS information about the  health insurance coverage they have provided for their employees.   As part of that process, employers are required to submit their  employee and their spouse or dependents' personal tax identification  numbers or Social Security numbers. However, here is the catch: If,  during this process, the employer unknowingly submits incorrect  information, or if the IRS believes that an employee is wrongfully  claiming a premium tax credit, the employer faces a significant  financial penalty.   Making matters worse, the window of opportunity that employer has to  appeal is short, while the statute of limitations on that violation is  limitless.   On average, the IRS takes anywhere between 18 to 24 months, 2 years,  to crunch the numbers on all this data they receive. That means the  small business is left in limbo waiting to hear whether the government  will find them in violation of the law.   The bill before us today gives employers flexibility about what  personal information they have to provide on behalf of their employees  and their families. It extends the appeal window for any potential  violation and establishes a statute of limitations so those small  businesses, who have limited resources to begin with, can navigate  these waters with less of a burden.   I thank my colleagues on both sides of this aisle for supporting this  measure to provide relief to our small business job creators.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith), one of the sponsors of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of  my time.   America's small businesses have had it pretty tough these past few  years. They are asking that Congress do its part to bring a measure of  relief.   The Employer Reporting Improvement Act is one step we can easily take  to shrink the burden Washington imposes on them and their employees.   The mom-and-pop shops that line America's Main Streets should not  have to operate under fear that Washington is going to come after them  for a clerical error. When they are faced with a potential penalty,  they ought to have the time to make their case. It is a simple matter  of fairness.   This measure has strong bipartisan support. It sailed out of the Ways  and Means Committee on a vote of 37-0.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3797) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to  provide an alternative manner of furnishing certain health insurance  coverage statements to individuals, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3797         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Paperwork Burden Reduction       Act''.       SEC. 2. ALTERNATIVE MANNER OF FURNISHING CERTAIN HEALTH                     INSURANCE COVERAGE STATEMENTS TO INDIVIDUALS.         (a) Reporting of Health Insurance Coverage.--Section       6055(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by       adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(3) Alternative manner of furnishing statements.--For       purposes of this subsection, any person required to make a       return under subsection (a) shall be treated as timely       furnishing the written statement required under paragraph (1)       if--        ``(A) such person provides clear, conspicuous, and       accessible notice (at such time and in such manner as the       Secretary may provide) that any individual to whom a       statement would otherwise be required to be furnished under       paragraph (1) may request a copy of such statement, and        ``(B) such person, on request of any such individual,       furnishes a copy of such statement to such individual not       later than the later of--        ``(i) January 31 of the year following the calendar year       for which the return under subsection (a) was required to be       made, or        ``(ii) 30 days after the date of such request.''.        (b) Certain Employers Required to Report on Health       Insurance Coverage.--Section 6056(c) of such Code is amended       by adding at the end the following new paragraph:        ``(3) Alternative manner of furnishing statements.--For       purposes of this subsection, any person required to make a       return under subsection (a) shall be treated as timely       furnishing the written statement required under paragraph (1)       if--        ``(A) such person provides clear, conspicuous, and       accessible notice (at such time and in such manner as the       Secretary may provide) that any individual to whom a       statement would otherwise be required to be furnished under       paragraph (1) may request a copy of such statement, and        ``(B) such person, on request of any such individual,       furnishes a copy of such statement to such individual not       later than the later of--        ``(i) January 31 of the year following the calendar year       for which the return under subsection (a) was required to be       made, or        ``(ii) 30 days after the date of such request.''.        (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section       shall apply to statements with respect to returns for       calendar years after 2023.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   If you visit any Main Street in America, you will see that small  businesses are struggling. Today's cost of living crisis has made  everything from supplies to labor more expensive for mom-and-pop stores  all across America.   Not only are small businesses struggling because of high prices, but  Washington mandates are forcing small businesses to waste precious time  processing paperwork instead of serving their workers and customers.   Right now, small businesses are forced to send millions of Americans  paper copies of health insurance reporting forms every year, when the  vast majority of individuals don't use this form.   Every taxpayer knows this form I am talking about. While it is known  as a Form 1095-C, it is one that you get in the mail and have  absolutely no idea what to do with. It looks like this, and you put it  in the pile with your other tax forms and then realize when it comes  time to file your taxes, you don't actually even need it.   In fact, only 1.4 percent of American workers and their families may  need to use this form. The Paperwork Burden Reduction Act is a  bipartisan bill, introduced by Representative Panetta and myself, that  will put an end to this wasteful practice.   This bill saves small business owners time and money by relieving  them of mailing outdated paperwork that only exists because Congress  mandates it.   This mandate doesn't even make sense anymore. The origins of this  paperwork were to prove compliance with the individual mandate of the  Affordable Care Act, a mandate whose enforcement was zeroed out years  ago.   Not only will small businesses have more time to focus on running a  business, but this bill also recognizes how Americans actually file  taxes. Now more than ever, Americans fill out their tax returns online.  There is no reason that American workers should not be able to access  this health insurance tax form online, as well.   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for supporting this  measure that will eliminate needless paperwork for working Americans  and small business job creators.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, back home in our districts, we have heard from workers  and small business owners about the struggles they face in today's  economy. Today, with this legislation before us, we finally have a  chance to give them a bit of a break.   The Paperwork Burden Reduction Act will get rid of a Washington  mandate that requires small businesses to waste time mailing  unnecessary paperwork instead of serving their employees and customers.  Not only will it save small business owners time, but it will also help  them modernize their operations by letting workers access their health  insurance tax forms online.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and help us  deliver relief to workers and small business owners across America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4004) to approve and implement the Agreement  between the American Institute in Taiwan and the Taipei Economic and  Cultural Representative Office in the United States regarding Trade  between the United States of America and Taiwan, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4004         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``United States-Taiwan       Initiative on 21st-Century Trade First Agreement       Implementation Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) As a leading democracy, Taiwan is a key partner of the       United States in the Indo-Pacific region.        (2) The United States and Taiwan share democratic values,       deep commercial and economic ties, and strong people-to-      people connections. Those links serve as the impetus for       expanding engagement by the United States with Taiwan.        (3) Taiwan is the eighth-largest trading partner of the       United States and the United States is the second-largest       trading partner of Taiwan.        (4) Since 2020, the United States and Taiwan, under the       auspices of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the       Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the       United States (TECRO), have held an economic prosperity       partnership dialogue to enhance economic and commercial ties       between the United States and Taiwan, including with respect       to supply chain security and resiliency, investment       screening, health, science, and technology, and the digital       economy.        (5) On June 1, 2022, the United States and Taiwan launched       the United States-Taiwan Initiative on 21st-Century Trade to       deepen our economic and trade relationship, advance mutual       trade priorities based on shared values, promote innovation,       and support inclusive economic growth for workers and       businesses.        (6) On August 17, 2022, the United States and Taiwan       announced the negotiating mandate for formal trade       negotiations under the United States-Taiwan Initiative on       21st-Century Trade and agreed to seek high-standard       commitments.        (7) Article I, section 8, clause 3 of the Constitution of       the United States grants Congress authority over       international trade. The President lacks the authority to       enter into binding trade agreements absent approval from       Congress.        (8) Congressional approval of the United States-Taiwan       Initiative on 21st-Century Trade First Agreement will ensure       that the agreement, and the trade relationship between the       United States and Taiwan more broadly, will be durable. A       durable trade agreement will foster sustained economic growth       and give workers, consumers, businesses, farmers, ranchers,       and other stakeholders assurance that commercial ties between       the United States and Taiwan will be long-lasting and       reliable.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, Congress is sending a bipartisan message to President  Biden today that we will not sit idly by as the administration ignores  our constitutional role in developing U.S. trade policy.   The relationship between the United States and Taiwan is vital to  U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific. This initial trade agreement  negotiated by the Biden administration is a good step. It builds on  successful provisions that were included in the USMCA that was  negotiated by President Trump, and it shows the world that the Chinese  Communist Party will not intimidate the United States from deepening  our relationship with Taiwan.   While Congress supports the early agreement that came from these  negotiations, we will not stand by passively as the Biden  administration, or any administration, attempts to bind the United  States in a trade agreement without approval from Congress. Congress  must be in the driver's seat on trade policy, not a passenger along for  the ride.   Trade impacts every American. When done right, trade can boost small  businesses, help American workers, and open up new markets for American  farmers. Bad trade policy, on the other hand, can kill American jobs  and give other nations unfair advantages over U.S. manufacturers,  workers, and agriculture.   Every American deserves a voice in the outcome of these negotiations  that impact their lives so much, which is why Congress, as their voice  in Washington, must be involved in the development and approval of  these agreements.   The Taiwan trade bill before us today restores congressional  authority on  [[Page H3053]]  trade policy. It celebrates this agreement, but it also makes it clear  that it cannot take effect unless this legislation is signed into law.  It forces the administration to consult with Congress in a meaningful  way moving forward, something that has not occurred to date. It  requires any future agreements with Taiwan to be subject to a vote in  Congress.   Without a vote on trade agreements, Congress can be ignored. This  will ensure trade agreements are in the best interest of American  workers, families, farmers, and small businesses. This bill has broad  bipartisan support in both the House and in the Senate. Democrats and  Republicans agree that U.S. trade policy must come through Congress,  and the President will no longer be allowed to sidestep our  constitutional authority.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand  up for the voice of the American people and vote to pass this bill. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers,  and I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   The legislation before us today is an important first step in pushing  back against executive overreach on trade. It also reinforces our  support for a stronger relationship with our close partner, Taiwan.   I appreciate that my colleagues across the aisle agree that  protecting Congress' constitutional powers is vital and that allowing  any administration to continue unchecked would only dilute the voices  of millions of Americans in Washington and embolden the executive  branch to step on more of our Article I powers.   I am especially appreciative of the strong partnership in this effort  of Ranking Member Neal in the House and Senators Wyden and Crapo in the  Senate.   U.S. trade policy must first and foremost protect American workers,  farmers, families, and small businesses. We have a duty today to ensure  the American people maintain a say in what those policies look like.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members of the House to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
