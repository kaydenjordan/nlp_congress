 Mr. Speaker, on February 15, thousands  of students from my alma mater, Penn State University, participated in  a 46-hour dance marathon called THON.   THON is the accumulation of a yearlong fundraising effort to raise  money for the fight against childhood cancer. Since the first THON took  place in the mid-1970s, students have raised more than $157 million.   All of the proceeds go to the Four Diamonds at Penn State University  Children's Hospital. Four Diamonds ensures that families who are  battling pediatric cancer are not faced with any costs, allowing them  to fully focus on the needs of their child.   During the THON event, participants stand and dance 46 hours  straight, without sleep. THON gives students the chance to stand in  solidarity with those affected by this terrible disease.   Mr. Speaker, every year, THON is the largest student-run philanthropy  in the world; and every year, I am in awe of the passion and  thoughtfulness that  [[Page H2050]]  our Penn State students have for this great cause.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 276. I thank my  colleagues across the aisle, the gentlewoman from Nevada, and also all  those who are original cosponsors in support of this bill.   It is not uncommon for a school employee to make a lasting impression  on a student or even on entire generations of students. Front office  attendants, school custodians, school safety personnel, food service  workers, and others all interface directly with countless students  every day. Many of these school employees make lifelong impacts on the  students who they serve.   Ask any student and they will probably tell you about a particular  school employee who may not have been their teacher, but, nevertheless,  imparted crucial life lessons upon them or inspired joy and confidence  in students who struggled to find either. Schools are made better by  these leaders, and students benefit from their kindness,  thoughtfulness, compassion, and respect that they show to others around  them.   Mr. Speaker, these employees truly go above and beyond the call of  duty to serve American students, and their steadfast devotion deserves  our appreciation and recognition.   H.R. 276, the Recognizing Achievement in Classified School Employees  Act, will direct the Secretary of Education to establish the  Recognizing Inspiring School Employees Award, otherwise known as the  RISE Award. The RISE Award will be presented each year to a classified  school employee in a nonteaching position in recognition of their  invaluable contribution to the lives of students at the schools that  they serve.   The award will be nonmonetary and will go to employees who  demonstrate excellent work performance, school and community  involvement, leadership, and commitment, and who exemplify the very  best of what it means to be a classified school employee.   H.R. 276 is just one small way to honor the men and women in our  communities who demonstrate to students what it means to be outstanding  citizens and civic leaders. Their tireless efforts deserve our  recognition and thanks. I urge my colleagues in the House to support  this commonsense legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the story that was shared about the woman  working in that school district. I think we all probably have those  stories as we think fondly back on our school experiences, whether it  was elementary or high school, about individuals who weren't  necessarily teachers but were still very influential in making an  impression and setting a great example to be followed in so many  different ways. That is why I am so pleased to be able to support this  piece of legislation.   I have had the privilege and honor to be in our schools that are  recognized as the Blue Ribbon Schools and Schools to Watch, and those  are wonderful. They are wonderful not just because of what has been  accomplished for those kids, but they do become an inspiration to other  schools to strive for and to achieve.   What this piece of legislation does, Mr. Speaker, is to take that  down to the staff level, because we know that the most valuable  resource and asset that we have in our schools are people--not  necessarily the classroom or anything that is physical like that, but  it is the teachers, the faculty, and the staff. Being able to recognize  the staff who work so hard each and every day there who are not  necessarily teachers is a great opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I certainly am very excited about supporting  this piece of legislation, H.R. 276. I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.
