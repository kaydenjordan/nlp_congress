 Madam Speaker, as our country recovers from this  devastating pandemic, it is critical we prioritize our families. All  working families deserve to thrive, and that starts with ensuring high- quality, affordable childcare.   This is a generational opportunity to invest in affordable, quality  care for all children, and I urge my colleagues not to let it go to  waste.   Right now, the average cost of childcare for children under 5 is  around $10,000 a year. This amount is even higher for infants. In my  home State of Minnesota, we have some of the highest childcare costs in  the Nation, ranking fourth in the country.   A minimum-wage worker working full-time in my district in Minneapolis  would have to work 30 weeks to cover the cost of childcare for one  infant. This is unconscionable.   As a mom, I know how difficult it can be to find affordable childcare  options and how a lack of childcare impacts all aspects of life,  including the ability to graduate from college while taking care of  young children or even the ability to find a job and thrive.   We need universal childcare and pre-K for all families, and we need  to pay our childcare workers a living wage.   Ensuring affordable, quality care for every child and family would  stimulate the economy and have a lasting benefit for children's  development and growth.   The American Families Plan moves us closer to this goal by investing  in universal preschool, ensuring childcare costs do not exceed 7  percent of income for working families, and guarantees childcare  workers make a $15 minimum wage.   I urge my colleagues to ensure that women and families are not left  behind in our recovery. Families across America are counting on us to  do the right thing.
