 Mr. President, I am happy to join my colleague from New  Hampshire and other colleagues tonight to talk about one of the most  serious threats to ever face this Nation or, in fact, this world.   A few years ago, Tom Brokaw, the television news anchor, wrote a  wonderful book called ``The Greatest Generation.'' He was writing about  the generation of our parents and grandparents who fought in World War  II, who paid off the debt from World War II, who built the Interstate  Highway System--who, by the way, paid for it--and who built the  greatest economy the world has ever seen. That was the ``greatest  generation.''   The characteristic of that generation was that of meeting their  responsibilities. It was not of avoiding problems but of meeting them  head-on and establishing for the world and for this country an example  of governance and of the responsible dealing with issues and problems  the likes of which we have not seen in our lifetimes.   If Tom Brokaw were writing another book today about us, it would be  called ``The Lousiest Generation.'' We are the ones who have built up  an unconscionable debt for our children. We cut taxes in the middle of  a war in 2005. It was the first time I had been able to find in world  history when that had ever happened. We have given ourselves tax cuts  and not paid the bill, and we are passing on this enormous $22 trillion  debt to our children.   None of us on our deathbed, when our children are standing around,  would lean up and say: Here is the credit card, kids. I have run it up  to the max. You can now pay for it. Yet that is exactly what we are  doing collectively--the lousiest generation, the one that hasn't paid  its bills.   Infrastructure. We have allowed our infrastructure to fall to pieces.  It is the infrastructure that was given to us by our parents, that was  paid for--the bridges, the roads, the railroads, and the airports. Now  we have one of the poorest infrastructure situations in the world. It  is embarrassing to go to a small country somewhere else in the world  and walk into an airport that makes ours look old and falling apart.   So we haven't kept up with the infrastructure, and that is a debt  that we are passing on to our children, just as real as the national  debt.   Finally, we are facing a known, real, unquestionable crisis in terms  of the effect on the climate, and this is something that we are  shamefully passing on to our children. They are the ones who are going  to have to deal with the consequences that we will not face. They are  the ones who are going to have to pay the bills, who are going to have  to shore up the infrastructure, who are going to have to respond to the  drastic changes in the climate not only here but around the world, and  we are doing nothing.   What will it take? What will it take for us to meet this  responsibility? What is it going to take?   Well, OK, let's go down a list. Maybe it will take scientific data  that demonstrates the level of CO2 that we have put into the  atmosphere.   I don't seem to have a chart. I don't need a chart. For millions of  years, CO2 has varied between 180 and 280 parts per million.  People say: Well, it varies over time. This is nothing new. No, between  180 and 280 is the variation until the  [[Page S4898]]  last 50 to 75 years, when it has become a hockey stick. We are now at  over 400 parts per million, the highest it has been in 3 million years,  and, by the way, the last time it was at 400 parts per million, the  oceans were 60 feet higher.   CO2 in the atmosphere is our responsibility. It didn't  come from volcanoes. It came from the consumption of fossil fuel, which  developed and built the wonderful economy that we have and the economy  around the world. Nobody can gainsay that.   The question is, Now that we are seeing the consequences, don't we  have a responsibility to do something about it? Has there been a  gigantic increase in CO2 in the atmosphere? Check. Yes.  Unquestionably.   No. 2, how about Arctic ice? Here we are. In the last 30 years, two- thirds of the Arctic ice has disappeared--two-thirds.   I was at a conference this morning on the Arctic. The Arctic Ocean is  open for the first time in human history. The conference was about  shipping and mineral exploration and Native peoples losing their  habitat and their way of life. Two-thirds of the Arctic ice is gone in  25 years. This is a place that has been covered with ice for thousands  of years--as long as we have any memory, but now the Arctic ice is  going.   Every time I see a prediction of where it is going to be in 10 years,  lo and behold, it is there in 2 or 3 years. It is opening up. That is  telling us something.   Is there an indication from the Arctic ice that something drastic is  happening to our climate? Yes. Check that box.   No. 3 is the increased intensity of fires. We have seen the most  intense wildfires in this country in the last 10 years that we have  ever seen--more acreage, more intensity, more lives lost, more property  lost. This is caused by drought and by changes in the climate, all  wrought by our activity.   Increase in fires and wildfires? Check.   Sea level rise. Here is the background on the sea level. We tend to  think of the sea level as being a fixed quantity. We walk out in the  ocean, and it always looks pretty much the way it is, whether it is off  the Maine coast or the New Hampshire coast.   Well, it turns out that back here, 24,000 years ago, when the  glaciers were covering most of North America, the sea was 390 feet  shallower than it is today. Chesapeake Bay was dry land. It was 390  feet shallower than it is today.   Then, the glaciers melted, and the sea level started to rise. This is  an interesting period about 14,000 years ago called the meltwater pulse  1A.   This drastic rise in sea level is about a foot a decade. That is what  is predicted for the next century.   Oh, it could never happen. A foot a decade? You must be crazy.   It happened. We know that it happened.   Now, here is why we aren't paying attention. The last 6,000 years, it  has been pretty flat. It has been pretty level. The sea level has  plateaued, in effect, and, therefore, that happens to be recorded human  history, that 6,000 years. So we think that is just where the ocean has  always been.   But do you know what? The last remnant of the glaciers are in  Greenland and Antarctica, and they are going. They are going. There is  20 feet of sea level rise in the Greenland ice sheet and 212 feet of  sea level rise stored in the Antarctic ice sheet, and they are going.   I have been to Greenland. You can see it. The Jakobshavn Glacier has  retreated as much in the last 10 years as it retreated in the prior 100  years.   The only thing slower than a glacier, by the way, is the U.S.  Congress. We make glaciers look like they are moving fast, and, in  fact, the Jakobshavn Glacier is moving fast.   Sea level rise is happening. In Norfolk, VA, they have seen a foot  and a half in the last decade. They are having sunny day floods. They  are having sunny day floods in Miami. They are spending millions of  dollars to build up their roads.   People say dealing with climate change is too expensive. Not dealing  with it is too expensive. In not dealing with it, the expense is going  to be astronomical.   By the way, if you talk about sea level in Norfolk, VA, it is a  national security risk. With the number of bases that we have around  the world that are at or near sea level, it is going to be an enormous  task and a very expensive one to protect those assets.   There is another national security issue involved in this that we are  ignoring, and that is the displacement of peoples. During the Syrian  civil war, there were 4 to 6 million Syrian refugees. A few came here,  not many. Most went to Western Europe, and, as we know, that refugee  flow turned the politics of Western Europe upside-down. Call it 5  million people.   The estimates for refugees from climate change over the next 100  years is between 200 and 400 million people. Imagine what that is going  to do to the geopolitics of this world--200 million people on the  march, looking for water, looking for a place that is habitable,  looking for relief from drought, from fires. This is a national  security threat.   Is it a national security threat? Yes. Check that box.   What is it going to take? What is it going to take?   Intense storms. We don't need to tell people about the intensity of  storms. We have seen them. We have lived through them. I once made a  joke in Maine that I am 300 years old, and somebody said: Why? I said:  Because according to the news, I have lived through three storms of the  century.   We keep having storms of the century or 500-year storms, and they are  happening more and more frequently.   The heat. Nine out of 10 of the hottest years on record occurred in  the last 15 years. This past June was the hottest June since records  were kept--the hottest June since records were kept.   Now, there is a difference between weather and climate. I understand  that, and I am not going to say that the heat wave that the Midwest is  suffering this weekend is a reflection of climate change. It may or may  not be. Weather is what happens day-to-day. Climate is what happens in  the long term, and we know that we have already increased global  climate by about 1.5 degrees Celsius. In many cases, it is causing  irreversible damage.   When we get to 2 degrees Celsius, which we are headed for, it is  going to be catastrophic for coral, for farms, for animals, and for  people.   Species are already on the move. Senator Shaheen mentioned the ocean.  There are the lobsters in Maine. There used to be a vigorous lobster  fishery in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. It is essentially gone now,  and the lobsters are in Maine, which is a mainstay of our economy. It  is a $1.5 billion a year business. The lobsters are moving north and  east. Why? Because the Gulf of Maine is heating faster than 99 percent  of the areas of the world. The only place heating faster than the Gulf  of Maine is the Arctic, and those lobsters are doing what any animal  does. They seek out more hospitable climate.   Climate. This isn't academic. These aren't predictions. This is  something you can see. The people on the water in Maine know it is  happening. The woodsmen know it is happening because they are seeing  different species of trees. Bugs are moving farther north. Ticks are a  huge problem in Northern New England and places where they weren't  before. This isn't something that is academic.   What is it going to take?   One of the things that the Senator from New Hampshire talked about  is--and I think it is important to emphasize because I hear this  sometimes--why should we do this? It is happening everywhere in the  world.   Yes, that is why the Paris climate accord was so important. It wasn't  mandatory, but it was a set of goals, and the entire world was engaged.  Now there is the entire world but one--us. We are out. We are outliers.  We have lost our voice. We have lost our influence. We have lost our  leadership position on one of the most important challenges faced by  this or any generation. Yes, we haven't met our responsibilities as our  parents and our grandparents did.   On December 1, 1862, Abraham Lincoln came to the House Chamber and  spoke about the crisis of the Civil War. The Congress didn't get it.  They were doing politics as usual, and President Lincoln was trying to  move them from the lethargy of the legislative process into the  emergency and the urgency of the Civil War.  [[Page S4899]]    He said two things toward the end of that speech that I think are  profoundly instructive for us today. The first is how to deal with this  change. And this is a change. This is new. I understand that, and  dealing with change is difficult.   Abraham Lincoln uttered what I think are the most profound words  about change that I have ever encountered. Here is what Abraham Lincoln  said:         The dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy       present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we       must rise--with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must       think anew, and act anew.    And here is the punch line:         We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our       country.    ``We must disenthrall ourselves,'' and that means to think in new and  different ways, to see reality as it is, ``and then we shall save our  country'' and, in this in case, the world.   The other admonition from Lincoln that day, which I think is very  important for us, puts the responsibility directly on us right here. He  was talking to Members of Congress.   He said:         Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this       Congress and this administration, will be remembered in spite       of ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance,       can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which       we pass----    Of course he was talking about the Civil War, and we are talking  about a fiery trial of our generation.         The fiery trial through which we pass, will light us down,       in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation.        The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down,       in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation.    I want to meet this responsibility. I want this Congress to be  remembered, as we will be, either way, but I want this Congress to be  remembered as people who met the fiery trial, who met our  responsibility, who thought about others more than ourselves and made a  difference in the life of this country and the world.   I yield the floor.
