 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I understand that there are three bills  at the desk due for a second reading en bloc.    In order to place the bills on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding en bloc.    Mr. President, now for my remarks.   Earlier this morning, it was an honor--a truly rare honor in my time  in public service--to meet with Judge Jackson for the first time since  her nomination to the Supreme Court. Before the meeting, I said Judge  Jackson was brilliant and beloved, but now that I have met her, I will  add another word: ``belongs.'' She is not only brilliant and beloved  but belongs on the Supreme Court.   I believe her nomination certainly merits a good number of votes from  both parties, and I hope we see that as we move forward in the process.  I am certain that when other Senators have a chance to meet with Judge  Jackson, they will understand why she is beyond qualified to replace  Justice Breyer on the Supreme Court.   For one, if confirmed, Judge Jackson would have one of the most  diverse professional backgrounds of any sitting Justice. Throughout her  career, she has been a Federal defender; worked in private practice;  sat on the U.S. Sentencing Commission; served as a district judge and  as a circuit court judge on the DC Circuit; and of course, she was a  clerk to Justice Breyer, the very same Justice whose seat she would now  fill.   As a district judge, Judge Jackson rendered more than 550 rulings and  was rarely reversed by higher courts, illustrating her evenhanded  application of the law and facts. Then, when you meet with her, you see  that she has brought that broad experience and adopted it into her  being. She empathizes with people. She emphasized to me that as a  judge, she should try to understand both sides. You could tell, when  you met her, that she really believed it and, since, has sort of  integrated all of her experiences into her being. She had an incredibly  phenomenal interview, as well as has an amazing record.   For all of these reasons, Judge Jackson's nomination has already won  support from individuals and organizations across the political  spectrum. She is supported by civil rights advocates; she is supported  by conservative judges and lawyers; she is supported by the Fraternal  Order of Police. Someone who was a public defender is now supported by  the Fraternal Order of Police? You can't get much better than that. And  she is supported by scores of  [[Page S922]]  men and women who had the honor of working with her over the years.   I have gone through her record. You can hardly find a single person  she has met, as she has walked through life and met people, who has  said a bad thing about her. And when you meet her, you can see why.  When you meet her, you can see why.   America will be much better off with someone like Judge Jackson on  the Supreme Court. Our country deserves someone deeply experienced,  broadly supported, and someone whose elevation as the first Black woman  Justice signifies a long overdue step toward perfecting our Union.   I am grateful to have had the chance to have met with the judge. I  thank her for her time this morning, and I look forward to working with  my colleagues to elevate this outstanding nominee to the Supreme Court  very soon.   In having met her and having studied her record, she deserves the  support of Members from the other side of the aisle, and I am hopeful  she will get a good number of them to support her.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on the State of the Union, last night,  before a joint session of Congress, President Biden made the case to  the Nation and to the world that in the face of immense challenges, the  United States remains strong and ready to meet the tests of our time.   In an hour-long speech delivered before a Chamber that was much  fuller than last year, President Biden demonstrated, yet again, the  kind of leader he has been all of his life: optimistic, unifying,  decent, and honest. He is honest about where we are today and where we  must go. I applaud President Biden for laying out a bold, strong, and  comprehensive vision that will resonate with the vast majority of  Americans.   In particular, I was glad the President focused on three important  things. First, he united the parties in supporting Ukraine and against  Putin. Second, he showed how under Democratic leadership America has  turned the corner on COVID. Third, he confronted the urgency of  lowering costs for American families, something our caucus has been  focusing on.   First, I was glad that President Biden united the room, the country,  and the world in opposing Vladimir Putin and his savage assaults on  Ukraine. It is obvious that the President has done an incredibly good  job in unifying the Europeans and the West as a united front against  Putin. That was felt by people on both sides of the aisle.   When the President called on the Chamber to stand up and applaud  Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian Ambassador, the feeling in the room  reminded me of the unity we all felt after 9/11. But just like on 9/11,  that unity comes with the sobering recognition that the scale of  Putin's brutality in Ukraine is worsening. Ukraine's State Emergency  Service reported this morning that more than 2,000 civilians--2,000  men, women, and children--children--have now been killed as a result of  Putin's savage brutality.   What is happening in Ukraine is carnage, and the blood of every one  of those innocent people falls on the hands of Vladimir Putin and on  his band of crony oligarchs. This evil man must be stopped.   As an important step, last night, the Senate unanimously passed  bipartisan legislation that will protect America, our government, and  our critical infrastructure from cyber attacks. Finally, the holds were  lifted from the other side of the aisle, and we passed unanimously this  cyber legislation. It is more important now than ever before because  Putin is brandishing a cyber weapon.   Cyber warfare is truly one of the dark arts perfected by Putin's  authoritarian regime. It is a weapon he is happy to employ around the  world. When our authorities in government know of these attacks, they  can prepare against future attacks. They will know who is attacking,  where they are attacking, how they are attacking, and that will allow  them to strengthen our defenses against future cyber attacks.   Many in the industry--at times, I believe even the Chamber of  Commerce--were not for this legislation, but with the urgency of the  moment--the need to protect ourselves from cyber attacks--finally, the  Senate rose to the occasion. So I thank Senators Peters and Portman for  getting this bill done.   The passage of this bill was little noticed because it came right  before Congress adjourned for the State of the Union, but it is a giant  step forward to protecting ourselves, and I am glad that we got it done  last night. But, of course, we must do more.   The Senate must keep working on a bipartisan basis to pass a robust  aid package in the upcoming omnibus so we can send an unmistakable  message to Ukraine that we stand with them and a message to Putin that  we stand against him. The quickest way we can assure that aid reaches  Ukraine is through the omnibus, which needs to get done next week; so I  am glad that we seem to be having bipartisan support to get that done.   Second, I was also glad President Biden showed how the country under  Democratic leadership is turning the corner in the fight against COVID- 19. By passing legislation last year to fund vaccines, expand testing,  and support our healthcare workers, we are beating this disease.   What the President said last night was absolutely correct in that we  cannot--we cannot--have COVID control our lives anymore, but neither  can we let our guard down. Right now, as cases are dropping across the  board, Congress must pass more funding for vaccines, testing, and  therapeutics.   ``Therapeutics'' is a word for medication that helps alleviate the  virulence of COVID. Very few people who take the therapeutics have to  be hospitalized. We also have to ensure that our doctors and nurses and  healthcare workers are prepared in case another variant comes this way  so that we can stay as close to normal as possible even if another  variant arrives. We have to have an ample supply of vaccines, of  therapeutics, and of testing ahead of time. We cannot wait. Some of our  Republican colleagues seem to be saying: Oh, we don't need this now.    We do need it now while we still have the chance. If Congress waits  until another variant arrives, it will be too late.   Let me say that again. Even as cases drop across the board, we cannot  be complacent against COVID. Congress must pass more COVID funding now  so we can be ready by funding vaccines, testing, therapeutics, and  supporting our healthcare workers. If Congress waits until another  variant arrives, it will be too late. So we need our Republican  colleagues to join us in a bipartisan way, just as they are joining us  on Ukraine.   Finally, I am glad that President Biden zeroed in on cutting costs  for American families. A year into the President's first year, the  economy is surging and creating an unprecedented number of jobs. But  people are struggling because costs are also going up. Your wages are  going up, but if the costs keep going up, it eats up those wage  increases.   Now, why are costs up? Costs are up because of supply chain  disruptions stemming from COVID and pent-up demand, as people during  COVID didn't buy a lot of things. All the while, Americans are watching  incredulously as some of our largest corporations are raising prices  despite growing profits. In some cases, executives are seeing lavish  pay increases, and in the end, Americans are footing the bill.   Senate Democrats will not stand for this, and we are working with the  President to lower costs and build upon the wage growth we have seen  over the past year. We are laser-focused on reducing America's costs,  from lowering the costs of insulin so no one pays more than $35 a  month, to lowering the cost of all prescription drugs, to lowering the  cost of meat at the grocery store, to fixing our ocean shipping lines  so the bottlenecks don't raise their costs. Shipping costs have gone  way up, as the President mentioned.   Do you know what else we can do to lower costs? We can innovate.  Congress should continue working to finalize our bipartisan, bicameral  jobs and supply chains bill so we can boost American manufacturing,  solve our chip crisis, and make our country less dependent on foreign  tech companies.   In short, despite everything the world faces, President Biden  reminded supporters and critics alike why the American people entrusted  him with  [[Page S923]]  the Presidency. He didn't shy away from our challenges but, rather,  advanced an optimistic and unifying plan for how to meet the moment.   Senate Democrats will continue working with the President to  precisely move our country forward on lowering costs, on addressing  COVID, and on defending our democracy in this hour of peril.   I thank the President for his leadership. Let us continue in our  work.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     I ask unanimous consent that at 11 a.m. on Thursday,  March 3, S.J. Res. 38 be discharged from the Committee on Finance and  the Senate proceed to its consideration; further, that there be 3 hours  for debate only, with the time equally divided between the Leaders, or  their designees, on the joint resolution; and that following the use or  yielding back of that time, the joint resolution be  [[Page S947]]  read a third time and the Senate vote on the resolution, with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I am about to file cloture on the postal  reform bill, so let me say a few words about that. So this week the  Senate has kept making progress toward our goal of passing and  ultimately enacting the largest bill to support the U.S. Postal Service  in a long, long time.   This is a bipartisan bill, long overdue and far-reaching in how it  will place our post office on secure footing for the future.   Democrats have spent the day working with Republicans on a list of  amendments that they want to hold with regard to this bill, and these  negotiations are ongoing.   So while we work on an agreement--and to keep the process moving--I  will be filing cloture so that we can take the next steps toward the  final passage.   It is my hope that we can arrive at an agreement tomorrow and finish  this bill before the weekend. There is every reason in the world to do  so.   At the end of the day, the vast majority of Democrats and Republicans  want to see this bill sent to the President's desk quickly.   I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their  continued work, especially Chairman Peters.   This postal reform bill has been a long time coming, and when passed  it will ensure that the tens of millions of Americans who rely on the  post office every single day for medicine, Social Security, checks,  other goods, they can be sure that the post office remains in good  hands and is strengthened.                                Cloture Motion     Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  for the cloture motion filed today, Wednesday, March 2, be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nominations en  bloc: Calendar Nos. 441, 445, 458; that the Senate vote on the  nominations en bloc without intervening action or debate; that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate; that any statements related to the  nominations be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate resume legislative  session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 224, S. 198.    Mr. President, I further ask that the bill be read a  third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate read  a third time.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 276, S. 3103.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  committee-reported amendments be agreed to, the bill, as amended be  considered read a third time and passed, and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged  [[Page S959]]  from further consideration and the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 527.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 530, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, finally, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.  on Thursday, March 3; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate resume consideration of Calendar No. 273,  H.R. 3076, Postal Service Reform.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:10 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, March 3, 2022, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
