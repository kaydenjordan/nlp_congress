 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with  thousands of my neighbors in New York's Fourth Congressional District  who are united in opposition to a proposed large-scale offshore energy  project that, if completed, would drastically alter the landscape of  several Nassau County communities.   The development being advanced by the Norwegian energy company,  Equinor, would see nearly 150 massive offshore wind turbines  constructed within view of land off the coast of Long Beach in my  congressional district.   This project would include a landing site in the city of Long Beach  where high-voltage cables would make landfall from the turbines and  wind through residential areas to connect with a substation in my  hometown, the village of Island Park.   Residents of these communities could play host to an environmental  disaster. New York officials are keen to see this project progress,  even in the face of local concern. In fact, Governor Hochul even went  so far as to enlist the assistance of Brooklyn lawmakers to ram through  State legislation to support the project, even as local neighbors  raised concerns.    My neighbors rightfully have questions related to the impacts. I will  stand with my neighbors and fight for the hardworking south shore  communities. We will stand tall in the face of this hostile takeover by  Equinor.   Mr. Speaker, Equinor is not welcome in our south shore communities.                            ____________________
