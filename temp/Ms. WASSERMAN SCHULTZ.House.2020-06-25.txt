 Mr. Speaker, today, we take a crucial step  toward racial justice. We do it in the name of George Floyd, Breonna  Taylor, Tony McDade, Corey Jones, and all of those lives unjustly taken  by law enforcement.   We mourn and say their names on the House floor because their lives  and all Black lives matter.   So let's move to end the policing culture that lacks real  transparency and accountability. Let us unite to ban barbaric  chokeholds and build the national misconduct registry so problematic  police don't just move to another town to keep a badge.   Let's outlaw racial profiling, qualified immunity for rights- violating police, and dangerous no-knock warrants.   This bill targets bad actors and practices and affirms the standards  professional law enforcement set for themselves, including a duty to  serve and protect.   Half-measures are not acceptable, not when men and women are killed  because of their skin color.   Let's seize this moment to dismantle the centuries of institutional  racism embedded in our justice system.   By the way, in response to what the gentleman on the other side of  the aisle said about an American solution for an American problem, it  doesn't get more American than making sure that justice is meted out  fairly and without regard to one's skin color.   Let us all bend the arc toward justice by voting for the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act.
