 Mr. President, last week Tuesday, I tested positive for  COVID-19 during weekly surveillance testing. As per the CDC's guidance,  I left the Capitol and began a period of isolation.   As a result of that isolation, I missed a number of votes. I take  seriously my duties in service to the people of Pennsylvania, including  voting on policies and nominations. Accordingly, I wish for the record  to show that, had I not been absent due to a COVID infection, I would  have voted yea on the following votes: yea on vote No. 98, on the  confirmation on the nomination of Ruth Bermudez Montenegro, of  California, to be U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of  California; yea on vote No. 99, on the confirmation on the nomination  of Victoria Marie Calvert, of Georgia, to be U.S. District Judge for  the Northern District of Georgia; yea on vote No. 100, on the motion to  proceed to H.R. 4521; yea on vote No. 101, on the confirmation on the  nomination of Julie Rebecca Rubin, of Maryland, to be U.S. District  Judge for the District of Maryland; yea on vote No. 102, on the  confirmation on the nomination of Hector Gonzalez, of New York, to be  U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of New York; yea on vote  No. 103, on the confirmation on the nomination of John H. Chun, of  Washington, to be U.S. District Judge for the Western District of  Washington; yea on vote No. 104, on the confirmation on the nomination  of Cristina D. Silva, of Nevada, to be U.S. District Judge for the  District of Nevada; yea on vote No. 105, on the confirmation on the  nomination of Anne Rachel Traum, of Nevada, to be U.S. District Judge  for the District of Nevada; yea on vote No. 106, on the confirmation on  the nomination of Alison J. Nathan, of New York, to be U.S. Circuit  Judge for the Second Circuit; and yea on vote No. 107, on the  confirmation on the nomination of Andrew M. Luger, of Minnesota, to be  U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota.   I am grateful to have only experienced mild symptoms of the virus as  a result of being fully vaccinated and boosted. I encourage anyone who  has yet to be vaccinated to do so and to get boosted if they are  eligible.                            ____________________
