 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H3265]]    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, the chair of the House  Administration Committee, for the opportunity to be here today.   I rise in opposition to H.R. 3005, but not because of the goals that  it attempts to achieve. Many of us have been fighting for those same  things. In fact, some of the comments that she made, you will find in  my remarks about some of the people whose statues are here that I do  not believe should be in this honored building, and I have fought for a  long time to remove those. But I am in opposition to the process of  which we are trying to impose to do this.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, as I stated earlier, you will find that many, if not  all, on this side of the aisle will agree with most of the comments, if  not all the comments, that are made by our colleagues on the other side  of the aisle.   I think we need to go back and look at where we have been as a nation  and where we are going. A lot of what we put into this building should  reflect not only our history but our values as a nation.   That is why I, in the past, have advocated very strongly for certain  statues to be removed. I think it is important now that we have both  parties looking at this.   As my colleague from North Carolina mentioned, Taney and the Dred  Scott decision, I think it was during a time period when Democratic  President Andrew Jackson nominated his bust to be put in the Capitol  here today.   Now, it can't be overstated how much this body and this country  condemn the institution of slavery. I believe, as a whole, this Nation  has done that and continues to do that.   In fact, when I was in the Georgia legislature, I realized that  Georgia was the sole State of the former Confederacy that had not  officially condemned the act of slavery nor had condemned its  participation in slavery  [[Page H3266]]  during these dark periods of our Nation. So, I introduced legislation  called the Freedom Resolution, which would formally acknowledge the  ills, the hatred, and this dark period of our Nation that our  government, our State government, the State that I love, was actually  engaged in.   That was a very painful time in our history, but we learned from that  history. I don't think anyone wants to forget that time period, else we  will repeat that in some shape, form, or fashion.   As I said, it is important that the statues that we have here reflect  the values of this Nation. In fact, I was very vocal many times in the  past over one of Georgia's two statues here, Alexander Stephens. To say  he was a racist was an understatement. As was mentioned, his  ``Cornerstone Address,'' as we read it today, is just wrought with the  idea that all men are not created equal.   In fact, he was very condemning of Thomas Jefferson and George  Washington. He even went as far as illustrating that they were insane  because of our founding documents being built upon a false premise, and  that false premise was the idea that God created all of us equal. He  went on to say that God didn't create us equal. He went on to say that  White people were superior and that that is why we have the institution  of slavery, and it should be preserved.   Those are not ideas that are commensurate with what we believe in  this Nation. But it was during a time period where many of the Old  South, Democrat-led houses and senates and statue commissions, were  trying to hold on to those old ideas and principles that our party--the  party of emancipation was brought up, Abraham Lincoln. We have been  opposed to these ideas. We totally wrapped our arms around this idea  that all men are created equal, that we are all given equal  opportunity, that all life is important, that everyone is created in  the eyes of God, and that this government exists to protect those  freedoms and those liberties.   But there were those in the Democrat-controlled Southern States who  wanted to hold on to the old ideas, those ideas that Alexander Stephens  espoused. That is why, in Georgia, the Democrat-led commission wanted  to poke their finger in the eyes of the Federal Government, and they  nominated or placed as statues these people who held ideas different  than what we hold as a party over here, what we hold as a nation today.   My opposition to this bill isn't because of the goal that we are  trying to achieve, but it is the way that the majority continues to  skirt procedure in this body for the second consecutive Congress. This  bill was rushed to the floor without a hearing or a markup in the  Committee on House Administration.   I am sure we will hear from my colleagues on the other side that  Republicans are insincere in our opposition to slavery and dragging our  feet when it comes to removing these statues. In fact, it was a  Republican, a good friend of mine in the State legislature, Scot  Turner, who in 2020 introduced legislation that he knew I supported,  and I came out publicly supporting, to remove Stephens' statue and  replace it with a statue of Martin Luther King, Jr.   The States have begun to take action. As we talked about, North  Carolina has already taken action to remove their statues and replace  them. But I am very concerned about this committee.   In fact, the Joint Committee on the Library, the committee  responsible for facilitating the removal of statues approved by State  legislatures, was only organized last week. Now, this is 6 months from  the start of the 117th Congress. I have been on the Joint Committee on  the Library, and I was very excited the first year I was appointed to  the Joint Committee on the Library because, as a fan of the Library of  Congress, I thought this would be a great opportunity to participate in  preserving the history and heritage of this Nation.   But of the three terms that I have been on the committee, from my  recollection, the committee has only met three times, and that was an  organizational meeting each time. It is hard to do your work when you  don't even get together to do the work.   The lack of urgency to organize the committee is reason for enough  concern. Even more disappointing is our failure to address several  approved statue replacement requests from State legislatures.   In October 2015, the State of North Carolina began the process of  switching out the statue of Charles Brantley Aycock with the Reverend  Billy Graham. Now, this passed the North Carolina House 71-28, a  bipartisan vote, and in the Senate, 44-0, a unanimous vote in the North  Carolina Senate. Yet, we still have not taken action on approving that  for a man who definitely had a very strong impact not only on civil  rights but on our Nation as a whole, who we so respect that his body  laid in the rotunda not too long ago. Yet, we still have not been able  to move on getting that done, as well as several other States.    I believe that we need to focus our efforts on changing this process  because I think it would mean a whole lot more, a whole lot more to  this body as well as to the American people if the States who  originally put those statues in here were the ones that now asked that  they would be removed. I think that would be much more appropriate than  this body taking action. If we reformed our process to make it where  the States could actually do it, it would mean a whole lot more to the  future of our Nation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), my good friend and the leader of the  Republicans here in the House.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the very passionate words  that we have heard here today. And as I said in the beginning, we on  this side of the aisle not only agree, but we have been advocating for  these very things for quite some time.   In fact, as far as Georgia's statue, I have advocated in times past  for the removal of Alexander Stephens' statue--it has been on several  occasions that I have spoken about this--and let me just share with you  this one idea, this principle, the criticism that he made of our  Founders, because he believed that our founding documents, the  Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were inherently  flawed. This is what Stephens said. ``The prevailing ideas entertained  by him,'' meaning Jefferson, ``and most of the leading statesmen at the  time of the formation of the old Constitution''--talking about the  Constitution we have today because he was advocating for the  Confederate Constitution--``were that the enslavement of the African  was in violation of the laws of nature; that it was wrong in principle,  socially, morally, and politically.'' And we agree with that.   What he is saying is the flaw of our Founders was that they believed  this idea that all men are created equal, and they put that in our  founding documents.   The reason I bring that up today is because of something that the  minority leader said, which is that under critical race theory they are  teaching that our founding documents were the opposite, and more that  they were what Alexander Stephens was saying they were, that they are  flawed, that they teach racism. But Alexander Stephens was taking the  opposite approach, and he says they weren't teaching racism, that is  why they are flawed.   This is why I have advocated a long time for the removal of Stephens'  statue. In fact, as I was speaking about this at one time, my family  and I received a threat from the Ku Klux Klan in Georgia, because I  adamantly believe that we are all created equal and we are all given  the same opportunities in this Nation.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Westerman).                                time  1545     Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman from Arkansas.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is  remaining?    Madam Speaker, prior to the organizing of the current  Joint Committee on the Library, Ranking Member Rodney Davis and I sent  a letter to the Joint Committee on the Library to demand immediate  action on North Carolina's pending request to replace the statue of  Charles Brantley Aycock with the statue of Reverend Billy Graham.   So far, the request has been ignored, but I can only assume it was  because it would impede the ability to do what we are doing here today.  But I am encouraged by the chair's commitment to act on that very  quickly.   I would also say that this isn't an isolated case. There are  currently eight States with pending requests, including Arkansas,  Florida, Missouri, Kansas, North Carolina, Nebraska, Utah, and  Virginia.   In fact, Georgia has just introduced in this last session a new piece  of legislation to remove Stephens' statue with that of the late  Representative  John Lewis, which is receiving bipartisan support. In  fact, the Republican Speaker of the House is the top cosponsor of that  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Grothman).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman from Wisconsin.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Madam Speaker, it is refreshing to know that there is  so much we actually do agree on in this Chamber, because the things  that my good friend from Texas just said, we agree on, and we have  agreed on since Abraham Lincoln was the President.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Rodney Davis), my good friend, who is also the ranking member of the  Committee on House Administration.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, to the gentlewoman from California, I am  prepared to close if she is. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the members of the  North Carolina delegation that was written to the Joint Committee on  the Library encouraging them to move quickly on their request to  replace the Aycock statue with that of Billy Graham.                                   Congress of the United States                                      Washington, DC, June 29, 2021.      Hon. Zoe Lofgren,      Chairperson,      Joint Committee of Congress on the Library.      Hon. Amy Klobuchar,      Ranking Member,      Joint Committee of Congress on the Library.        Chairperson Lofgren and Ranking Member Klobuchar: We write       today to encourage the Joint Committee of Congress on the       Library's (JCL) expeditious approval of the North Carolina       General Assembly's request to replace the State's current       statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection. Since 2015,       North Carolina has worked to replace one of its current       statues, which depicts Charles Brantley Aycock, an individual       associated with white supremacy, with one of the late       Reverend William Franklin ``Billy'' Graham, Jr. Despite North       Carolina's diligent efforts in coordination with the       Architect of the Capitol (AOC) and past Joint Committees on       the Library, the statue of Aycock remains.        On October 2, 2015, the North Carolina General Assembly       passed Session Law 2015-269; HB 540, ``An Act Requesting the       Joint Committee on the Library of Congress to Approve the       Replacement of the Statue of Charles Brantley Aycock in       National Statuary Hall with the Statue of the Reverend       William Franklin ``Billy'' Graham, Jr.'' This legislation       passed the North Carolina House with bipartisan support and       passed the North Carolina Senate unanimously.        In February 2018, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper and       Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest sent letters to the AOC in       support of the General Assembly's request.        On July 29, 2020, the North Carolina Legislature's Statuary       Hall Selection Committee unanimously approved the design of       the Rev. Graham statue.        According to the AOC, North Carolina's request continues to       await JCL approval to proceed to step five of the ten-step       replacement process. Now, over six months into the 117th       Congress, JCL's delayed organization continues to hinder       North Carolina's wishes to remove a white supremacist's       statue from the Capitol.        We implore the JCL to honor the will of the people of North       Carolina by moving immediately to complete its work on North       Carolina's request and to stand ready to assist as needed in       order to ensure the State's wishes are finally realized       without further delay.            Sincerely,      Patrick McHenry.      Virginia Foxx.      Richard Hudson.      Ted Budd.      David Rouzer.      Dan Bishop.      Gregory F. Murphy, M.D.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the official 10- step Architect of the Capitol statue removal and replacement process.   This process was established in the 2000 omnibus and further defined  in 2014 and requires coordination between the State, the Architect of  the Capitol, and the Joint Committee on the Library. All requests for  statue replacements begin in State legislatures and is then  communicated to the Architect of the Capitol who then manages the  communication of the request to the JCL for approval through the  process.                                         Architect of the Capitol                                                       January 2014.    Procedure and Guidelines for Replacement of Statues in the National                          Statuary Hall Collection         The creation of the National Statuary Hall Collection was       authorized by the United States Congress in 1864 to allow       each State to provide two statues of notable citizens for       display in the United States Capitol. The Joint Committee on       the Library of Congress has oversight of the collection, and,       under the committee's direction, the Architect of the Capitol       (AOC) is responsible for the reception, placement, and care       of the statues.        In accordance with legislation enacted in 2000, ``Any State       may request the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress to       approve the replacement of a statue the State has provided       for display in Statuary Hall'' under two conditions:        (A) the request has been approved by a resolution adopted       by the legislature of the State and the request has been       approved by the Governor of the State, and        (B) the statue to be replaced has been displayed in the       Capitol of the United States for at least 10 years as of the       time the request is made, except that the Joint Committee may       waive this requirement for cause at the request of a State.      Steps in the Procedure        1. Responsibilities of the State. The State legislature       enacts a resolution that identifies the statue to be       replaced, names the individual to be newly commemorated and       cites his or her qualifications, selects a committee or       commission to represent the State in selecting the sculptor,       and directs the method of obtaining the necessary funds to       carry the resolution into effect. Expenditures for which the       State is responsible include the cost of paying the sculptor       for designing and carving or casting the statue; designing       and fabricating the pedestal; transporting the statue and       pedestal to the United States Capitol; removing and       transporting the replaced statue; temporarily erecting the       new statue on its pedestal in the location approved for the       unveiling ceremony; certain  [[Page H3273]]       expenses related to the unveiling ceremony; and any other       expenses that the State commission may find it necessary to       incur.        2. Request to Replace a Statue. A duly authorized State       official, typically the governor, shall submit to the       Architect of the Capitol a written request to provide a new       statue, a description of the location in the State where the       replaced statue will be displayed after it is transferred,       and a copy of the applicable enacted State legislation       authorizing the replacement. The Architect of the Capitol       will review the request for completeness and will forward it       to the Joint Committee on the Library.        3. Joint Committee on the Library Action. The Joint       Committee on the Library will approve or deny the request.        4. Agreement Regarding Replacement. If the request is       approved by the Joint Committee on the Library, the Architect       of the Capitol will formalize an agreement with the State to       guide the process. The agreement consists of the State's       commitment to follow the guidelines for the design and       fabrication of statues (see below) and to take responsibility       for any cost related to the design, construction,       transportation, and placement of the new statue; the removal       and transportation of the statue being replaced; and any       unveiling ceremony. The agreement is between the Architect of       the Capitol and the State. If the State authorizes a       commission, foundation, or other entity to act upon its       behalf in subsequent parts of the process, the governor must       so notify the Architect of the Capitol in writing.        5. Approval of Maquette. The State or its representative       shall submit to the Architect of the Capitol, for review and       final approval by the Joint Committee on the Library,       photographs of the maquette from all four sides and the       proposed dimensions of the completed statue.        6. Approval of Full-Size Clay Model and Pedestal Design,       Including Proposed Inscription. The State shall submit to the       Architect of the Capitol, for review and final approval by       the Joint Committee on the Library, photographs of the model       from all four sides, dimensions, engineering drawings of the       pedestal, the anticipated weight of the completed statue and       pedestal, and the text of any proposed inscriptions. Any       structural, safety, and design concerns will need to be       addressed before final approval.        7. Approval of Completed Statue, Cast in Bronze or Carved       in Marble, and Completed Pedestal. The State shall submit to       the Architect of the Capitol, for review and final approval       by the Joint Committee on the Library, photographs of the       completed statue and pedestal from all four sides,       dimensions, the final weight, and the text of any       inscriptions.        8. Ceremony and Program. The holding of an unveiling       ceremony is optional. Permission to use the Rotunda or       Emancipation Hall must be granted by concurrent resolution of       the Congress, and legislation by the Congress is required to       authorize printing of the proceedings at government expense.       The State may contact its delegation in Congress for       assistance and for introduction of the required legislation.        Although no law requires the Congress to accept statues by       formal resolution, it is recommended that acceptance of the       statue by the Congress be included in the legislation       introduced for the use the Rotunda or Emancipation Hall for       the unveiling ceremony.        The State must arrange the program for the ceremony with       the Speaker of the House, who will ensure that congressional       participation is bipartisan and bicameral and that the       program concludes in a reasonable time. The Architect of the       Capitol provides support for any unveiling ceremony.        9. Statue Removal/Installation and Ownership Transfer. The       State must arrange for a rigger approved by the Architect of       the Capitol to remove the replaced statue and install the       replacement statue in the location of its unveiling. This       work must be coordinated with the Architect of the Capitol.        The replaced statue must be removed shortly before the new       statue is brought into the Capitol. Before the replaced       statue is removed, a document transferring ownership of that       statue from the federal government to the State will be       signed by the designated State official.        10. Permanent Location. The permanent location for the       replacement statue will be approved by the Joint Committee on       the Library. The National Statuary Hall collection is located       in several areas of the Capitol: National Statuary Hall (the       Old Hall of the House), the Rotunda, the second-floor House       and Senate corridors, the Hall of Columns, the Crypt, and the       Capitol Visitor Center.        The Architect of the Capitol will make recommendations for       placement of the new statue with the least possible       disruption to previously placed statues while maintaining a       harmonious arrangement. To assist in developing this       recommendation, the agency's structural engineer will       determine whether the floor in any proposed location can       safely support the weight of the statue. If the replacement       statue is suitable in weight and dimensions, it will normally       take the place of the replaced statue. If not, the Architect       of the Capitol will, upon the approval of the Joint Committee       on the Library and with the advice of the Commission of Fine       Arts as requested, relocate statues within the Capitol.        If necessary, after the statue has been unveiled, the       Architect of the Capitol will be responsible for moving it to       the permanent location approved by the Joint Committee on the       Library.      Guidelines for Replacement Statues        The guidelines below are provided for reference only; they       may be modified in particular cases by the Joint Committee on       the Library. Images of the one hundred statues now in the       collection are available at the Architect of the Capitol       website (www.aoc.gov).        Subject. The subject of the statue must be a deceased       person who was a citizen of the United States and is       illustrious for historic renown or for distinguished civic or       military services. Statues may represent only one individual       (ruling adopted by the Joint Committee on the Library at       meeting of March 13, 1950). Statues should represent the full       length.        Material. The statue must be made of marble or bronze.       Replacement statues made of the same material as the replaced       statue are preferred. Materials from domestic sources,       including, as applicable, sources in the territories and       possessions of the United States, are preferred.        Pedestal. To reduce weight, the Architect of the Capitol       recommends that the pedestal be made of a hollow steel frame       faced in granite or other stone or be made of bronze. It is       recommended that the pedestal be designed and constructed       with a removable panel (usually in the back) to allow       access to attachment bolts. The pedestal design,       dimensions, and weight must be submitted to the Architect       of the Capitol for review.        Inscriptions. Inscriptions on the pedestal should include       the name of the State and of the individual represented. The       preferred option is that inscriptions be carved.       Alternatively, they can be raised or cast on a bronze plaque.       It is traditional and preferred that inscriptions be simple       and that they appear only on the front of the pedestal. The       proposed inscription should be submitted for review and       approval by the Joint Committee on the Library as part of the       pedestal design.        Size and Weight. In general, the figure in the replacement       statue should be over life size, with a height between seven       and eight feet, and the total height, including the pedestal,       no greater than eleven feet. Within that size range, the       combined weight of a bronze statue and its pedestal should       not exceed 5,000 pounds; a marble statue and its pedestal       should weigh no more than 10,000 pounds.        Patina and Coating. For bronze statues, the selected patina       and coating must be easily maintained and repaired. Formulas       for the patinating and coating materials must be provided to       the Architect of the Capitol for use during future       maintenance.        Other Considerations. The statue and pedestal should not be       a potential source of safety hazards. They should not have       any protruding or sharp element that could cause harm or be       an obstacle for persons in the building.      Relevant Legislation        The law creating National Statuary Hall is the act of July       2, 1864 (2 U.S.C. Sec. 2131) (formerly 40 U.S.C. 187), which       established that each State had the right to donate       ``statues, in marble or bronze, not exceeding two in number       for each State, of deceased persons who have been citizens       thereof, and illustrious for their historic renown or for       distinguished civic or military services . . . .''        This law was modified in 2000 by Sec. 311 of H.R. 5657       (included by reference in H.R. 4577) and established as law       by P.L. 106-554, which provides that ``Any state may request       the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress to approve the       replacement of a statue the State has provided for display in       Statuary Hall in the Capitol of the United States . . . .'' 2       U.S.C. Sec. 2132.        Supervision and direction of the collection are assigned to       the Architect of the Capitol by the act of August 15, 1876       (19 Stat. 147), 2 U.S.C. Sec. 2131.        With the approval of the congressional Joint Committee on       the Library, the Architect of the Capitol is responsible for       the reception and location of the statues in this collection,       first established by H. Con. Res. 47, agreed to February 24,       1933, and included in P.L. 106-554. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 2132.      Excerpt From Public Law 106-554        Sec. 311. (a)(1) Any State may request the Joint Committee       on the Library of Congress to approve the replacement of a       statue the State has provided for display in Statuary Hall in       the Capitol of the United States under section 1814 of the       Revised Statutes (40 U.S.C. 187).

Madam Speaker, I have a document which is the chart  of every State's request that is currently in the process of getting a  statue replaced.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a timeline of the Joint  Committee on the Library's organization for this Congress, including  the minutes of the first JCL organizing meeting.                                          House of Representatives,                               Committee on House Administration,                                      Washington, DC, June 29, 2021.      Submission for the Record  Timeline of Joint Committee of Congress on the Library Organization for                  the 117th Congress of the United States         On January 3, 2021, the 117th Congress had its opening day.        On April 16, 2021, the House of Representatives passed H.       Res. 321, Electing Members to the Joint Committee of Congress       on the Library and the Joint Committee on Printing.

House of Representatives,                               Committee on House Administration,                                      Washington, DC, June 17, 2021.      Hon. Zoe Lofgren,      Chairperson, Committee on House Administration,      Washington, DC.        Chairperson Lofgren: More than six months have passed since       the start of the 117th Congress, and it is our understanding       that the Joint Committee of Congress on the Library (JCL)       will officially organize next week. We are looking forward to       the JCL's first official action this year as there are       pressing issues before the Joint Committee demanding our       immediate attention.        We encourage the following items be considered as some of       the JCL's first orders of business:        Reopening of the U.S. Botanic Garden (USBG). The Joint       Committee's delayed organization has directly affected the       public's access to one of the Capitol campus' main       attractions, the U.S. Botanic Garden, which to this day       remains closed awaiting permission from the JCL to re-welcome       visitors. We must take up this matter of business       immediately, as the USBG's reopening plans and executive       leadership team have informed oversight stakeholders of the       campus' readiness for safe and immediate reopening.        Consideration of the request by the State of North       Carolina. The State of North Carolina is anxiously awaiting       JCL's action on its request for the removal and replacement       of one of the state's contributions to the National Statuary       Hall Collection. Already years into this process, the request       is awaiting JCL approval and the Architect of the Capitol is       ready to partner with us to move the process along.        As members of the Joint Committee, we stand ready to get to       work, while upholding the long tradition of bipartisanship       and bicameralism. As the incoming Chairperson, we encourage       you to add the above items to the agenda of the JCL's first       organizing meeting so that we can begin to address these       pressing issues.            Sincerely,                                                   Rodney Davis,                                                     Ranking Member,                                 Committee on House Administration.                                               Barry Loudermilk,                                                             Member,                                 Committee on House Administration.     Madam Speaker, I have a readout from the House Rules  Committee meeting on H.R. 3005 recorded June 28, 2021, at which time  the Joint Committee on the Library chair, Zoe Lofgren, announced her  approval of the Kansas longstanding request to update their  contribution to be a statue of Amelia Earhart, and I thank the  Congresswoman Lofgren for taking that direction.   Madam Speaker, I have the official collection of correspondence from  the State of Kansas to the Architect of the Capitol that informs them  where Kansas is in the 10-step replacement process.   Madam Speaker, that process began 22 years ago in 1999, and I thank  you for your indulgence with that.   Madam Speaker, I just want to reiterate that there is much that was  said here today that we are in agreement with. Something that the  esteemed majority leader said I think needs to be reemphasized and is  again the reason why I have adamantly fought to replace the statue of  Stephens, the Georgia statue of Alexander Stephens, because of his  criticism of our Founders.   His criticism was that they truly believed those ideas that were  written in our Declaration of Independence that all men are created  equal. In fact, he said that that was the flaw of our Nation.   That is why they rebelled against this Nation; that we should go back  to those original principles and have people here that honor the idea  that God in His infinite ability, created all of us and He created us  all with value, equal value regardless of skin color, regardless of  age, regardless of any other factor; that we are all created in His  divine wisdom and given life, and life can be so abundant if we just  hold on to these ideas and principles. And those statues that we have  in this Capitol should reflect those values, and I can think of no one  that reflects those values more than the Reverend Billy Graham.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the General Assembly of North  Carolina bill requesting that the statues be replaced.              GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF NORTH CAROLINA SESSION 2015                        HOUSE BILL 540--RATIFIED BILL       An act requesting the Joint Committee on the Library of       Congress to approve the replacement of the statue of Charles       Brantley Aycock in National Statuary Hall with a statue of       the Reverend William Franklin ``Billy'' Graham, Jr.         Whereas, in 1864, Congress established National Statuary       Hall in the Old Hall of the House of Representatives in the       United States Capitol, and authorized each state to       contribute to the Hall two statues that represent important       historical figures of each state; and         Whereas, North Carolina currently has statues on display       in the National Statuary Hall Collection of former governors       Zebulon Vance and Charles Brantley Aycock given by the State       in 1916 and 1932, respectively; and        Whereas, in 2000, Congress enacted legislation authorizing       states the ability to request that the Joint Committee on the       Library of Congress approve the replacement of a statue the       state had provided for display in Statuary Hall; and        Whereas, William Franklin ``Billy'' Graham, Jr., was born       on November 7, 1918, to William Franklin Graham and Morrow       Coffey Graham, and was reared on a dairy farm in Charlotte,       North Carolina; and        Whereas, Billy Graham attended the Florida Bible Institute       from 1937 to 1940, graduating 1940, and was ordained to the       ministry in 1939; and        Whereas, Billy Graham served as pastor of The Village       Church in Western Springs, Illinois, from 1943 to 1945; as a       member of Youth for Christ International, where he ministered       to young people and military personnel from 1945 to 1950; and       as President of Northwestern Schools, a liberal arts college,       Bible school, and theological seminary, from 1947 to 1952;       and        Whereas, after World War II, Reverend Graham preached       throughout the United States and Europe and attained       international prominence as an evangelist through a series of       crusades that began in 1949; and        Whereas, since 1950, Reverend Graham has conducted his       ministry through the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association       (BGEA), reaching multitudes of people by means of a weekly       radio program, ``Hour of Decision''; a newspaper column, ``My       Answer''; televised crusades; articles published in       ``Decision'' magazine; and evangelistic films produced and       distributed by World Wide Pictures and now reaching millions       through the BGEA Web site and the Billy Graham Library in       Charlotte; and        Whereas, over the years, Reverend Graham has preached to       live audiences of nearly 215 million people in more than 185       countries and territories and has preached to an estimated       2.2 billion people through television and technology; and  [[Page H3275]]         Whereas, Reverend Graham has been a renowned humanitarian       and philanthropist, providing financial assistance to victims       of disasters, as well as collecting and distributing clothing       to those in need all around the world over the years; and        Whereas, Reverend Graham has counseled 12 Presidents and       has participated in nine presidential inaugurations; and        Whereas, Reverend Graham has also counseled world leaders       and has participated in many historic occasions, and has been       called upon as the ``nation's pastor'' during times of       national crisis. He spoke at the National Cathedral service       in Washington, D.C., three days after the 9/11 attack in       2001, as the nation and world watched and listened. Five       presidents, including George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George       H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, and Gerald Ford, and their wives       were in the audience; and        Whereas, in 2012, Reverend Graham was listed on the ``The       Ten Most Admired Men in the World List'' for the 56th time.       He was first selected in 1955. According to the latest list,       Reverend Graham was tied as Number 3 with Mitt Romney, George       W, Bush, and Pope Benedict XVI behind President Barack Obama       and Nelson Mandela; and        Whereas, admired and beloved by both Christians and non-      Christians, Reverend Graham continues to inspire the world       with his good works; and         Whereas, there have been many great North Carolinians, but       few have impacted the world more than Billy Graham; and .        Whereas, it is appropriate to honor Reverend Graham's life       and works by placing his likeness in the National Statuary       Hall Collection for display in the United States Capitol;       Now, therefore,        The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts:        Section 1. The General Assembly requests that the Joint       Committee on the Library of Congress approve the replacement       of the statue of Charles Brantley Aycock in the National       Statuary Hall Collection currently on display in the United       States Capitol with a statue of the Reverend William Franklin       ``Billy'' Graham, Jr.        Section 2.
