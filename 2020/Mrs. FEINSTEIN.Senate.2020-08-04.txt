 Mr. President, I rise today to speak about  coronavirus, now clearly the worst pandemic in a century.   I will also speak briefly about the need for a national response plan  that is guided by science and public health, not politics.   The first case of COVID-19 was reported in the United States on  January 20. In the intervening 6 months, we have seen cases climb, then  fall, and now surge once again.   More than 4 million Americans have been infected with coronavirus. So  far, more than 155,000 have died.   Every day for the last 4 months, I have received an update from my  staff on coronavirus numbers.   I have watched, day by day, the number of positive cases climb. In  California right now, 30 of our 58 counties have had more than 1,000  positive cases.   The numbers just go up and up and up. It becomes impossible to look  at the charts and graphs and not come to the conclusion that we have to  do more--and maybe significantly more.   Simply put, this is the worst pandemic in my lifetime. You have to go  back more than 100 years to the Spanish flu epidemic to find something  comparable.   But the unprecedented scale of this crisis is no excuse for our  failure to respond more forcefully and in a nationally coordinated  manner.   Once we realized the scale of the outbreak in the spring, both by the  increased cases at home, as well as monitoring stricken countries like  Italy, it became clear that we needed strong leadership from the top.   We didn't get that.   Instead, the White House and President Trump blamed states for the  lack of testing equipment, the hoarding of sanitizing supplies and the  absence of protective gear.   In March, President Trump said, ``I don't take responsibility at  all.''   That is a direct quote from the President of the United States, in  the midst of a global pandemic with body counts rising around the  country. We must do better.   More recently, during the renewed surge in cases, we have seen a  repeat of those problems. We know we need more testing supplies and  protective equipment, but rather than implement the Defense Production  Act and stock up on supplies, we saw little action from the White  House.   I have been thinking back to the early days of the pandemic. In  March, San Francisco's Bay Area imposed the first significant stay-at- home order in the country. California soon followed.   It was criticized at the time as an overreaction, but it succeeded in  slowing the rate of spread, and the death toll remained lower than many  other large States. Soon, much of the country had similar orders in  place.   In April and early May, there was a sense of shared sacrifice. People  stayed at home, schools closed, many lost their jobs. Our way of life  shifted in the most abrupt way since at least 9/11, if not World War  11.   But the understanding was that we made these sacrifices because they  would help control the virus. We would ``bend the curve,'' we would  produce sufficient protective gear, and we would make it safe for  people to return to their lives.   The idea was that, by the end of summer, life would return--if not  back to normal, at least back to some version of it.   It is now almost August. The number of new cases climbs each day. K- 12 schools have announced they will be closed in the fall. Many  colleges are following suit. Job losses continue, with more than 30  million still receiving unemployment benefits.   Simply put, America failed the test of reopening.   If we had responded like other countries, with comprehensive national  policies for mask use, avoiding crowds and increasing testing capacity,  we could have been returning to normal life right now.   Instead, many cities and States are rolling back their reopening  plans and may have to reinstitute stay-at-home orders to get the Nation  back to where we were before Memorial Day.   President Trump last week said the administration is ``in the process  of developing a strategy'' to fight coronavirus.   At some point, we will want to know why it took 7 months for him to  acknowledge a national plan was necessary. Right now, however, we need  to focus on what that plan will entail.   Just as importantly, we need to focus on who should have input into  the tenets of such a plan--in a word, ``experts.''   This is a challenge that requires the combined minds of our best and  brightest, particularly public health and infectious disease experts.  This is not an arena for politics, period.   So what do those public health experts propose? After reading  material and listening to a range of opinions, there are five areas  that appear to have broad consensus:   First, we need to ensure that masks are used everywhere.   Early on, we knew simple acts like talking and even breathing caused  airborne transmission of the virus, especially in confined areas like  office buildings.   We also knew individuals who weren't showing symptoms could spread  the virus to others because symptoms don't appear for 5 to 7 days.   And research continues to show masks are one of the best tools to  slow the spread of the virus. Scientific modeling is clear: Masks  prevent the spread of the virus.   Yet even with this knowledge, we still continue to see a patchwork of  policies around the country.   A national mask mandate would dramatically reduce the spread of the  virus, especially by those who don't yet show symptoms.   On July 14, the CDC called on all Americans to wear masks. CDC  Director Robert Redfield said if all Americans wore masks, the current  surge in cases could be brought under control within 2 months.   Masks work. We need a national mask mandate.   The second step is a national program for testing.   Months into this pandemic, we continue to hear stories of people not  able to receive a test. In some cases, my office has heard from people  with fevers and coughing but are still told to stay home and not get  tested.   Simply put, anyone who wants to be tested should be, and the results  should be returned within 24 hours, not a week later.   Studies have found that if we only test individuals who show  symptoms, it is too late to stop further transmission.   That means States and cities need sufficient supplies to dramatically  increase testing. At this time, that is not happening.   A national testing strategy would help coordinate action and prevent  States from having to compete against each other.   The third step, related to increased testing, is ensuring we have  enough testing supplies and safety equipment for frontline workers.   The President could quickly implement the Defense Production Act.  This law would allow the Federal Government to address supply chain  issues and increase production and distribution of testing supplies,  medical equipment and personal protective equipment.   This should have been done months ago, but so far, the President has  only selectively used this tool. He should broaden its use immediately.   It is unconscionable that 6 months after this virus appeared on our  shores, essential workers around the country still lack personal  protective equipment, not only doctors and nurses but grocery clerks,  agricultural workers, public transportation operators, educator; and  many others.   These individuals are putting themselves at risk to provide necessary  [[Page S4726]]  services to the public, and they should have access to masks and other  equipment to keep themselves safe.   The fourth step is expanding contact tracing, another area where we  see a patchwork of policies across the country rather than a cohesive  national effort.   To work, contact tracing must occur immediately after an individual  is found to be infected. A team determines everyone with whom an  infected individual had recent close contact and encourages them to get  tested, self-isolate, and monitor their health.   Right now, on average, everyone who gets COVID passes it to more than  one other person. In other words, the spread is increasing, often by  those who don't know they have been exposed. Contact tracing will help  solve that.   The logistics, however, often aren't feasible for local governments.  That is why a Federal contact tracing program, possibly using Peace  Corps and AmeriCorps volunteers as has been suggested, is so important.   Finally, the fifth area is the need for a plan to manufacture and  distribute a vaccine once it is developed.   A key component is determining priorities for vaccine distribution.  Should it go first to essential workers on the frontlines? Or should it  go to people most likely to get the virus, the vulnerable populations,  and those in hard-hit areas? These aren't easy questions, and we should  work on answers now.   We also need to handle the logistics involved to ensure rapid  distribution of the vaccine nationwide.   These are obvious challenges, but they are also complex, and we need  a plan in place now, ahead of vaccine development, rather than waiting  until a vaccine is developed.   In addition to those five health-related planks, I also believe we  need a coordinated plan to help the small businesses and workers  suffering during this time.   One example is the Paycheck Protection Program that helped many small  businesses. The program provides forgivable loans if businesses use  funds on employee salaries and other necessities to remain afloat,  which will allow them to quickly reopen when it is safe.   Another example is the additional $600 in unemployment benefits in  the CARES Act. This assistance allows millions of families to pay rent,  cover bills, buy food, and contribute to the economic recovery.  Unfortunately, that vital aid has lapsed.   Since mid-March, more than 60 million Americans have filed for  unemployment benefits. Today, more than 30 million people continue to  depend on these benefits.   We can't cut these lifelines until jobs are available for those out  of work. If the economy remains shuttered and we do nothing to help  families and businesses, we are telling millions of Americans that we  don't care they are hurting.   Moreover, we are hurting our own economic recovery by taking aid from  those who most need it, the very people who are most likely to spend it  to support the economy.   The Federal Government exists for a reason, and that is to help  Americans do things they can't do for themselves. The same goes for  States, which are responsible and powerful but can't do it on their  own.   A global pandemic calls for a robust Federal response, which must  entail a national response plan. And that plan has to be based on  science and on data, not politics.   Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President. I rise to speak in support of the  bipartisan Emergency Wildfire and Public Safety Act of 2020, a bill  that Senator Daines and I are introducing today to protect our  constituents from the increasing threat of catastrophic wildfires.   As a result of climate change, California and other Western States  are experiencing a growing crisis. Over my 27 years in the Senate, I  have witnessed dozens of massive wildfires. But the level of  destruction we have seen in recent years and the transformation of  wildfire from a seasonal phenomenon into a year-round threat require  bold, new action. Our bill would do just that by giving Federal, State,  and local governments new tools to better manage wildfires and protect  communities.   While California has always had dangerous wildfires, the particularly  devastating fires in 2017 and 2018 were a wake-up call and a harsh  example of the consequences of inaction on climate change. The latest  National Climate Assessment found that, over the past three decades,  the number of acres burned in the Western United States is double what  would have burned if the climate weren't changing. Nowhere is this  being felt more than in California.   The 2018 Camp Fire killed 86 people in town of Paradise and destroyed  15,000 homes. That fire spread as fast as 80 acres a minute according  to some estimates. After the 2017 Tubbs Fire, I visited the Coffey Park  subdivision of Santa Rosa, which was destroyed when wildfire swept  through Napa and Sonoma. The devastation was unlike anything I have  ever seen.   According to California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection  statistics, 10 of the 20 most destructive wildfires in California state  history have occurred in just the last 5 years and 2018 was the most  destructive wildfire season in recorded California history: nearly 2  million acres burned in our State, displacing hundreds of thousands and  leading to billions of dollars of damage.   These problems will only grow worse as temperatures continue to rise  as a result of climate change. But we can't simply wait for the world  to roll back emissions to address our wildfire problem. Preparing for  these challenges will require an all-of-the-above approach utilizing  the latest science, even if some solutions aren't politically popular.   There are more than 150 million dead trees in California's forests,  the result of both the historic drought and bark beetle populations  that are thriving as temperatures warm. A single spark in the middle of  those dead trees can lead to an inferno. And while 60 percent of the  forestland in California is owned by the Federal Government, fires  don't stop at the borders between federal, state, and private land, so  any action must be coordinated.   I have joined California leaders and environmentalists in opposing  the wholesale clearing of forests. There is a growing consensus around  what appropriate forest management actions consist of, and I am  encouraged by cooperative efforts such as the Tahoe-Central Sierra  Initiative.   We can and should increase the use of firebreaks to stop massive  wildfires from spreading into communities, and we can identify  landscapes that are overgrown and restore resilience to our forests.  But we must do it in a smart and sustainable way.   We should also continue to expand commercial markets for timber and  wood products. Biomass energy generation would not only help remove  overgrowth from the forests but would also provide energy for  California homes and businesses.   We should increase our use of advanced detection systems to identify  outbreaks sooner, and invest in safer power transmission lines and  other methods to harden infrastructure. While California has  requirements for defensible space around at-risk homes, incentives  should be provided for homeowners to use fire-safe building materials.  The Federal Government should also increase support for outreach  efforts, so that risks and mitigation strategies are communicated to  vulnerable individuals and communities.   This is why I am introducing The Emergency Wildfire and Public Safety  Act of 2020. Our bill would protect communities by reducing wildfire  risk in Federal forests, getting the private sector more involved in  addressing wildfire risk, improving best practices for addressing  wildfire, and creating more resilient communities and energy grids.   The bill would authorize the Forest Service to undertake three  priority wildfire mitigation projects that would be limited to 75,000  acres in size, would allow for expedited environmental reviews  regarding the installation of fuel breaks near existing roads, trails,  transmission lines and pipelines, and would include a technical fix to  ensure that the Forest Service consults with the Fish and Wildlife  Service when new public peer-reviewed research demonstrates potential  harm to threatened or endangered species. The bill would also codify an  existing administrative practice that allows the Forest Service to  expedite hazardous fuel removal projects in emergency situations where  it is immediately necessary to protect life, property, or natural and  cultural resources.   The bill also makes important changes to stimulate the private market  for low-value timber that poses a wildfire danger. The bill would  establish a new $100 million biomass infrastructure program to provide  grant funding to build biomass facilities near forests that are at risk  of wildfire and to offset the cost of transporting dead and dying trees  out of high-hazard fire zones. The bill would also lift the current  export ban on unprocessed timber from federal lands in the west for  trees that are dead, dying, or if there is no demand in the United  States. These measures are necessary to ensure that we can mitigate  wildfire in a commercially viable way, and not just through continued  government funding.   In terms of utilizing the latest science and techniques, the bill  would also expedite permitting for the installation of wildfire  detection equipment such as sensors, cameras, and other relevant  equipment and expand the use of satellite data to assist wildfire  response. The bill would also establish a new prescribed fire center to  coordinate research and training of foresters and forest managers in  the latest methods and innovations in prescribed fire practices to  reduce the likelihood of catastrophic fires and improve the health of  forests.   Given the generational shortage of workers in the forest management  field, the bill would authorize a new workforce development program to  assist in developing a career training pipeline for forestry workers.   Lastly, the bill would creating more resilient communities and energy  grids by expanding the Energy Department's weatherization program to  allow for the retrofit of homes to make them more resilient to wildfire  through the use of fire-resistant building materials and other methods,  and by establishing a new $100 million grant program to help critical  facilities like hospitals and police stations become more energy  efficient and better adapted to function during power shutoffs. The new  program would also provide funding for the expanded use of distributed  energy systems, including microgrids. Finally, the bill would allow  FEMA hazard mitigation funding to be used for the installation of fire- resistant wires and infrastructure as well as for the undergrounding of  wires.   It is important to be realistic about the threat we face. There have  always  [[Page S4734]]  been wildfires in the West, and there always will be. But we must face  the reality that climate change and rising temperatures will mean more  risk of wildfires. We can and should prepare for this future beginning  today. That is why we have introduced this new bill, and I urge my  colleagues to take it up and pass it as soon as possible.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Merkley,          Ms. Hirono, Mr. Markey, Mr. Van Hollen, and Mr. Blumenthal):   S.J.
