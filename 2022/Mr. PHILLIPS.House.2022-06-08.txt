 Madam Speaker, Jim Ramstad represented Minnesota's  Third District in Congress as a principled Republican from 1991 to  2009.   His widow, Kathryn, a remarkable woman in her own right, wrote me  last week and asked that I share her message with the country: ``Jim  voted for the 1994 crime bill and its gun control measures. He was one  of only six Republicans to cast what was clearly a difficult vote, but  he felt so strongly about the compelling need to act and believed it  was consistent with his bipartisan, pragmatic, and commonsense approach  to fighting crime.   ``After so many mass shootings, I cannot understand why Congress does  not at the very least,'' she wrote, ``ban semiautomatic weapons like  the AR-15 that have been used in so many recent mass shootings.''   She continued, ``I feel very strongly about this and ask sincerely,  what can we do to legislate reasonable legislation like in 1994?''   What can she do? She asks; she and the country ask, I might add.   We all know what we can do. And I say, let's do it.                            ____________________
