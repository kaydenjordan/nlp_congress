 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I  been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 9.   (By unanimous consent, Mr. McCARTHY was allowed to speak out of  order.)                            Recognizing Tim Berry    Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, when we as Members of Congress are first  elected, before we are sworn in, before we introduce our first bit of  legislation, the first thing we do is begin to hire, to form a team,  and much of the success that happens on this floor is a lot of work  that is done behind the scenes by our staff. They do a tremendous job  for this country in the public service they provide.   I personally count myself blessed to have had Tim Berry as my chief  of staff for the whole time I have been in leadership. Today is his  last day on our floor. Tim has had 18 years of service in this  institution. He has been in other leadership offices. He went into the  private sector, but when I got elected majority whip, I asked him if he  was willing to come back.   Tim has always demonstrated political wisdom, personal resolve,  dedication, but, most importantly, distinct moral clarity.   He has been here in some of the most difficult times in this  institution. He was in the office when people were actually shot when  an intruder came and took lives in this institution. He has worked on  legislation, he has worked on friendships, and he has worked across the  aisle. But if there were one thing I would define this man as, it is a  family man.   Today, we are lucky to have his wife, Lisa, and daughter, Maeve, in  the gallery with us. And to his other children, Ella and Chris, I want  to thank you for your sacrifice on loaning your father. For every  dinner he has missed, or every phone call he had to take, or maybe that  one or two lacrosse games he couldn't coach, I want to thank you.   But to Tim, I want to thank you for your dedication, I want to thank  you for your friendship, and I want to wish you the very best on behalf  of a very grateful nation and institution. Thank you.
