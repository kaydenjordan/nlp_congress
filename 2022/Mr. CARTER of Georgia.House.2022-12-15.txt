 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  life of Crowe Peele, an NCAA boxing champion at LSU.   Born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, in 1934, Crowe made a name for  himself in the Golden Gloves program where he was a four-time champion.  He boxed twice in the National Golden Gloves Tournament in New York  City and while in New York, Crowe lost two matches. Out of 64 pre- college bouts, these were his only two losses.   Crowe boxed for 2 years at LSU, winning Southeastern Conference and  Sugar Bowl titles as a freshman in 1954 before repeating as conference  champ in 1955.   During his sophomore year at LSU, Crowe won the top title in  collegiate boxing, the NCAA Championship. This made him college  boxing's premier heavyweight champion.   After winning the title, Crowe decided to leave amateur boxing and  enter the professional arena. As a professional, Crowe had a record of  16-5, with wins in his first 14 fights and knockouts in his first 10.  He fought on cards with Sugar Ray Robinson and Archie Moore.   After his retirement from boxing, Crowe settled in Baton Rouge with  his wife, Betty, and started a family while operating service stations  around the city.   He is survived by four children, including his daughter, Nancy, who  proudly continued her father's legacy of service, professionalism, and  dedication here in the House of Representatives.                            ____________________
