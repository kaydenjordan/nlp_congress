 Mr. President, I wanted to join my colleagues on the  floor today to support legislation that would address the needs that we  are hearing from State and local governments and that would support  bipartisan legislation to address this pandemic. That is what we have  had to date, and there is no reason why we can't get there this time.    As you know so well, last week the United States crossed a  devastating milestone. More than 150,000 Americans, including 417  Granite Staters, have died due to complications from COVID-19. Sadly,  as we all know, those numbers keep increasing. The coronavirus pandemic  has also wreaked havoc on our economy. The Commerce Department reported  on Friday that our gross domestic product had shrunk to nearly 33  percent--the sharpest economic decline in modern American history.   For months, my colleagues and I have been coming to the floor, week  after week, urging the majority to take up proposals that would provide  critical changes to our healthcare system and comprehensive relief for  our economy, but what we have gotten is a package that fails to address  many of the concerns I have heard from Granite Staters.   The bill that was presented to this Senate by the Republican majority  doesn't provide dedicated funding to help nursing homes and long-term  care facilities, which are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. In fact, in  New Hampshire, 80 percent of our deaths from coronavirus have been to  people in long-term care facilities--the highest percentage in the  country.   This package doesn't include housing assistance and eviction  protections. It inadequately funds testing, and it pressures schools to  reopen in order to receive assistance.   Importantly, the bill lacks any support for State and local  governments that are struggling to maintain essential services while  they are also on the frontlines battling this pandemic. Every day,  mayors and community leaders tell me about what they are facing--the  massive reduction in local tax revenues and increased costs due to  COVID-19 response efforts. These challenges have left our State and  municipal governments in dire straits.   I would like to read an excerpt from a letter I received from Mayor  Joyce Craig, the mayor of Manchester, New Hampshire's largest city. She  says:         Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Manchester was thriving.       Over the past two years, we saw over $250 million in new,       private investments in economic development; we expanded air       service from the Manchester-Boston Regional Airport; and we       were seeing a continual decrease in opioid overdoses. But due       to the COVID-19 pandemic, our bright path forward has grown       foggy, and I am concerned about what lays ahead for my city.    Mayor Craig goes on to say that since the pandemic began,  Manchester's revenue is down by over $3.5 million, including a $1.6  million decrease in property taxes that are collected. In total, the  State of New Hampshire expects to experience a budget shortfall of  nearly $540 million. That is about a 20-percent drop in State revenues.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter I quoted from  Mayor Craig of Manchester be printed in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   [[Page S4715]]                                                       July 27, 2020.      Senator Jeanne Shaheen,      Washington, DC.      Senator Maggie Hassan,      Washington, DC.      Congressman Chris Pappas,      Washington, DC.      Congresswoman Annie Kuster,      Washington, DC.        Dear Sen. Shaheen, Sen. Hassan, Rep. Kuster & Rep. Pappas:       Thank you for your leadership in the midst of this global       pandemic.        As you know, New Hampshire's cities and towns are on the       front lines of responding to COVID-19. Day in and day out, we       see the direct impact this pandemic is having on our       residents, businesses, and non-profits. It's a time of       disruption like we have never experienced before.        None of us know how long this crisis will last, but we are       thankful for your tireless efforts to advocate for Granite       Staters through the `Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic       Security (CARES) Act. I am writing you today to urge you to       support and advocate for sending additional relief directly       to municipalities like the City of Manchester in the `Health       and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions (HEROES)       Act.        Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Manchester was thriving.       Over the past two years, we saw over $250 million dollars in       new, private investments in economic development; we expanded       air service from the Manchester-Boston Regional Airport; and       we were seeing a continual decrease in opioid overdoses. But       due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our bright path forward has       grown foggy, and I am concerned about what lays ahead for my       city.        Just as many small businesses and corporations are       struggling, so are our municipalities. In an effort to reduce       the financial burden on our citizens and business, local       governments have absorbed many costs, which has resulted in a       significant reduction in revenue. Since the pandemic began,       our City's revenue is down by over $3.5 million to date,       including a $1.6 million decrease in property taxes       collected, and a $750,000 in parking revenue reduction.       Additionally, our partners, like the New Hampshire Fisher       Cats, are asking for financial help from the City to ensure       they make it through this difficult time.        While Manchester and other New Hampshire cities and towns       have received some additional funding through the CARES Act,       we are extremely limited in the way that we're able to use       these funds. We are often unable to be reimbursed for the       expenses that the City needs most at this time, like revenue       losses, property tax relief and affordable housing.        We have had to make hard decisions to keep our city afloat.       City departments have had to hold 28 vacancies, have put a       freeze on all non-essential spending, and have been forced to       reduce some City services, like parks and recreation       activities and facilities. Our city employees have gone above       and beyond to fill these gaps, but without additional       funding, our staffing and service reductions will continue to       grow.        Our citizens are fueling the burden of the COVID-19       pandemic. Many have had their hours cut back or have lost       their jobs. They have lost childcare, and some are on the       verge of losing their homes. At this difficult time, cities       need to be increasing the services that it offers to our       residents, not decreasing them. Manchester is facing an       affordable housing and homelessness crisis that has been       exasperated by COVID-19. As we inch closer to the moratorium       on evictions being lifted, it is more important than ever       that municipalities like Manchester receive federal funds       that can be used to prevent homelessness and alleviate our       housing crisis.        Just as financial assistance was sent directly to       individuals and small businesses impacted by COVID-19, the       cities and towns managing local responses to this pandemic       should be allocated the necessary resources to properly care       for our citizens.        I appreciate the work that you are all doing in Washington       to fight for the people of New Hampshire. When you are       fighting for the Granite State in Congress, I urge you to       keep the State's municipalities in mind.            Sincerely,                                                    Joyce Craig,                                                              Mayor,                                                City of Manchester.    Today, I also spoke to the mayor of Nashua, Jim  Donchess. The mayor told me that he expects to lose 10 percent to 20  percent of the revenue base in Nashua. That is $7 million to $15  million. That means that services would be affected and workers would  have to be laid off.   In fact, as he told me, if he had to take all of the savings that he  would need to achieve from the revenue losses from just one agency, it  would result in laying off half of the entire police department in the  city or laying off 150 to 200 teachers. Obviously, that is not tenable.   I also heard from the mayor of Berlin, Paul Grenier, the mayor of New  Hampshire's northernmost city. He told me because of the impacts of  COVID-19, the State of New Hampshire is also facing revenue shortfalls.  As I said, they are expecting about $540 million in revenue losses. As  he said, if the Federal Government doesn't provide some help to State  and local communities, his city of Berlin is expected to lose not just  any potential funding at the Federal level but State funds it had  budgeted for because it was anticipating that it would get State  funding as it usually does. So losing help from Congress in any COVID-4  package would have a double impact on the city of Berlin and other  cities and municipalities across New Hampshire.   I heard from mayors, town administrators, from local leaders, and  from our Republican Governor Kirsten Noonan. All of them are grappling  with whether they will be able to fund the services that they have  committed to, whether they will have to lay off first responders,  firefighters, police and teachers if Federal assistance doesn't arrive  soon.   New Hampshire is not alone. We just heard Senator Schatz talking  about the impact on Hawaii and Senators Cortez Masto and Rosen talking  about the impact on Nevada. Everyone who has been to the floor is  talking about what will happen in their States if we don't do something  to help.   No State could have anticipated the economic fallout from this  pandemic. That is why it is essential that Congress provide Federal  support to help State and local governments as they respond to this  crisis.   We have done that before in the bipartisan CARES Act. New Hampshire  was able to receive $1.25 billion to help reimburse the State for its  COVID-19 response. These funds have been used in New Hampshire to  create relief programs for county and municipal governments, small  businesses, nonprofits of all sizes, frontline workers, and for  healthcare providers. But of course, as we know, that money is running  out, and so more needs to be done.   We need State and local funds to provide additional support for  families who are experiencing housing insecurity or homelessness,  minority- and women-owned small businesses and individuals in recovery  or are in need of mental health services. New Hampshire has been  severely affected by the opioid epidemic, and people who have substance  use disorders are feeling the impact of this coronavirus perhaps more  than their neighbors and other people in our State.   In addition to providing dedicated funding for State and local  jurisdictions, the next relief package should remove bureaucratic  restrictions preventing these governments from using emergency relief  funds as they see fit. Congress should also provide dedicated funding  for counties, cities, and for municipalities with fewer than 500,000  residents. They need access to this funding because they are just as  much on the frontlines--the rural communities in my State--as the  biggest cities in this Nation. Communities of all sizes are facing  substantial loss of revenue due to COVID-19, and they need our help.   Local leaders are calling out for help. We can't just sit idly by and  let these governments go bankrupt, as the majority leader suggests.   This shouldn't be a partisan issue. We all have a common interest in  preserving as much of our economy as possible so that we are positioned  for a full and robust recovery once we get this coronavirus behind us.  So I would hope that all of my colleagues in the Senate would recognize  the urgency of this situation we are in and that we will take up and  pass legislation that will provide assistance to State and local  governments and provide the relief that Americans are calling for.   The House passed legislation more than 2 months ago. Too much time  has been lost, and it is time for Congress to act now.   I yield the floor.
