 Mr. Speaker, I have lost my voice from the allergies here  in Washington, D.C., but I am truly honored to be here.   Before I comment, I just wanted to introduce my family that is up in  the gallery: my husband, Joe Lesko--thank you, Joe--my son, Jared  Lesko; my daughter, Samantha Lesko; her fiance, Brandon Stealth; and my  brother, Roger Lorenz.   I am truly honored to be here to join you, and I look forward to  working with you.   I want to say to my constituents at home: Thank you so much for the  privilege of your vote and for sending me here to Congress. I am  thankful, and God bless you.                            ____________________
