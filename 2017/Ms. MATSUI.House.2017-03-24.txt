 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot of rhetoric about how this bill  would supposedly fix our healthcare system. President Trump said that  his plan would provide insurance for everybody. That is not the bill  before us today.   The last-minute backroom changes have only made a bad bill worse.  Republicans stuck in a provision to strip away essential health  benefits for American families.   The list of services in jeopardy is long, devastating, and cruel,  services like emergency services, hospitalization, prescription drugs,  preventive care, and many other guarantees.   These are basic health services that every person in the country  deserves, like my constituent Elizabeth, whose daughter is guaranteed  pediatric care to treat her type 1 diabetes because of these essential  benefits. Without coverage, out-of-pocket costs would add up to more  than her entire year's salary.   I can't stand here and allow my Republican colleagues to say they are  saving people from ObamaCare while they are stripping away essential  care for families like Elizabeth's. I urge my colleagues to oppose this  bill.
