 Mr. Speaker, last week President Biden  addressed Congress and the Nation and claimed that he was committed to  securing our southern border, but sadly his actions have not matched  his words.   According to Border Patrol reports, there were over 150,000 migrant  encounters at our southern border just during the month of January, a  96 percent increase from the previous year. As we stand here today,  more drugs like meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl are pouring into  our country through our southern border.   President Biden had a chance to offer solutions to this crisis at the  State of the Union, but instead he gave flippant remarks that belittled  the struggles that American families are currently facing.   We cannot afford to leave our southern border open any longer. We  cannot afford to let these drugs continue to kill the fathers, mothers,  sons, and daughters in our communities.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for President Biden to get serious about the  crisis at our southern border. It is time to give law enforcement the  tools that they need. It is time to keep our communities once again  safe.                            ____________________
