 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  [[Page H259]]  (H.R. 159) to implement merit-based reforms to the civil service hiring  system that replace degree-based hiring with skills- and competency- based hiring, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Congress is charged with overseeing the executive  branch. This includes overseeing the general management and operations  of government agencies.   For the success of our government's missions and Federal programs, we  must have a competent and skilled workforce to deliver services to the  American people, defend our Nation, and execute the laws passed by  Congress. However, agencies lack the tools to identify and hire the  best candidates to fill these positions.   The problem is that hiring for the Federal civil service has over- relied on the paper credentials and self-administered job proficiency  assessments of candidates. The reintroduced Chance to Compete Act of  2023 ensures agencies use objective, skills-based assessments to  evaluate job candidates.   The private sector already uses such structured interviews, knowledge  tests, and writing samples for the hiring process. It is time for the  Federal Government to do so as well.   Agencies should be able to hire professionals that can do the work,  and there are many ways to build the right kind of professional  expertise. H.R. 159 represents one of those rare bipartisan legislative  reforms that targets a specific problem, implements tested solutions,  and reflects private-sector best practices.   The bill codifies and improves upon the policy initiatives begun in  the Trump administration and which the Biden administration is  continuing to implement.   I thank the chairwoman of the Committee on Education and Workforce,  Dr. Virginia Foxx, who is also a senior member of the House Oversight  Committee, and Congressman Gerry Connolly for working quickly to ready  this bipartisan bill.   I also thank Representative Ro Khanna for, again, supporting this  bill that will help us modernize our government.   I hope that our Senate colleagues can swiftly advance this important  legislation so that it can be signed into law this year.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense bill aimed at hiring  applicants for Federal positions based on whether they have the  relevant skills to do the job. The American people deserve nothing less  from their Federal Government.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 300) to amend chapter 3 of title 5, United States Code, to  require the publication of settlement agreements, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 300         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

This Act shall be effective 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act and shall apply--        (1) with respect to any settlement agreement (as such term       is defined in section 307 of title 5, United States Code, as       added by section 2), entered into on or after the date of the       enactment of this Act; and        (2) to the extent practicable, any such settlement       agreement (as such term is defined in section 307 of title 5,       United States Code, as added by section 2) that remains in       effect on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 300, the Settlement Agreement  Information Database Act.   Transparency and public participation are vital to ensure the  public's continued trust in our government. Federal agencies frequently  use settlement agreements to resolve litigation without going through  lengthy public trials. However, it is impossible for Congress and the  public to determine the impact these settlement agreements have on  State and local governments and private-sector entities because they  must continue to follow the agency requirements these agreements  mandate.   Such secret negotiations and agreements essentially prevent the  public from participating in important policy decisions.   These Federal settlements agreements impose a tremendous burden. They  are often difficult to see and hard to understand.   Further, State and local governments, industry stakeholders, and  taxpayers can be directly affected by the settlements for years, yet  they can't provide input. This legislation seeks to correct that  problem.   The Settlement Agreement Information Database Act, or SAID Act,  requires Federal agencies to submit information regarding consent  decrees and settlement agreements to a public electronic database.   This public resource, to be overseen by the Office of Management and  Budget, will include dates, payments, attorney's fees awards, and a  list of State and local governments and other entities impacted by each  settlement.   Currently, agencies release information about settlements at their  discretion and will only publicize the facts that reflect favorably  upon the agency. Furthermore, the terms of the settlement agreements  are often deemed confidential.   Under the requirements of the SAID Act, if an agency believes that  information regarding an agreement should remain confidential, the  agency head must publish an explanation of why it is confidential. This  will increase transparency and shine a much-needed light on agency  settlement agreements.   I thank my Committee on Oversight and Accountability colleagues Gary  Palmer and Gerry Connolly for preparing this important legislation for  consideration today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this commonsense legislation, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Palmer).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am happy we could expedite the Settlement  Agreement Information Database Act's consideration today.   This Chamber has passed the SAID Act with broad support three  separate times, in the 115th, 116th, and 117th Congresses. It is time  the Senate acted on this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this necessary,  bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
