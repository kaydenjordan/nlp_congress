 Mr. Speaker, Democrats' leadership has protected our  hard-earned and historic economic recovery. That team secured an  agreement that prevents Republicans from forcing devastating default  and rejects their most extreme cuts in the GOP default on America bill.  President  [[Page H2703]]  Biden's agreement protected Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and  veterans' healthcare.   This was a negotiation with individuals whose top priority was  cutting food assistance and protecting the wealthy. That was their main  priority across the entire negotiation.   Fiscal responsibility? Their only responsibility was to protect their  tax cuts for the ultrawealthy that grew the debt by $7 trillion in the  first place.   The President successfully insisted that if this agreement was going  to include time limits on SNAP, it needed to include meaningful  improvements to SNAP.   Republicans protected the wealthy at the feet of the neediest  Americans.    Democrats understand the needs of the American people  and our most vulnerable Americans, as well as the full faith and credit  of the American people.
