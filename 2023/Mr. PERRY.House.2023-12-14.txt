 Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, I note the next order of business is the  conference report on H.R. 2670, and I wish to ask several points of  parliamentary inquiry and maybe points of order.    The rules of the House require that every bill must have a  stated single purpose to be filed. Was such a statement filed, and if  so, what is the single purpose of H.R. 2670?    The body can't ask a question as to what the stated single  purpose of this conference report is?   It is not a hypothetical.    The pending measure is on the suspension of the rules for  H.R. 2670.    Madam Speaker, we all know it is Christmas and you can  sure tell because here we go with the ornaments. We have got a  Christmas tree headed out, and we have got to put some ornaments on it.  That is what is happening right now.   Of course, we are going to violate our rules. You saw it here just a  few moment ago. This violates the single-subject rule because Americans  are literally sick of their Representatives coming home and saying to  them: Well, I didn't want to vote for that, but this was on it, and we  had to get this so I had to vote for that. That is how this town works.  That is how you end up $34 trillion in debt, and that is how you spy on  278,000 Americans under the Federal Government's authority.   It violates the germaneness rule. People say what does that matter?  Why does it matter if it is germane? Madam Speaker, the House passed a  bill, a pretty good bill, thanks to the chairman, a pretty good bill.  The Senate passed a bill. I don't think it was pretty good, but they  passed a bill. Either way, you know what wasn't in either of those  bills? The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act used to spy on  Americans. That wasn't in the bill, but at the last minute it was  airdropped into this bill.                                time  0945    In this House, we put in the rules that we need to know the single  purpose of a bill. When we asked, ``What is the single purpose of this  bill?'' this House said, ``We are not even going to tell the American  people. We are not going to tell them that.'' They are not going to  tell the American people that because they want to couple these two  things together and pass a terrible National Defense Authorization Act.   They are going to say the troops are not being paid when they are  being paid. They are going to allow the Federal Government, under the  guise of law, to spy on every American citizen.   It is unconscionable and unacceptable. My colleagues should vote  ``no.''
