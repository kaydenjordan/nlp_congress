DIRECT SPENDING.         (a) Means-tested Direct Spending.--        (1) For means-tested direct spending, the average rate of       growth in the total level of outlays during the 10-year       period preceding fiscal year 2018 is 6.8 percent.        (2) For means-tested direct spending, the estimated average       rate of growth in the total level of outlays during the 11-      year period beginning with fiscal year 2017 is 4.3 percent       under current law.        (3) The following reforms are proposed in this concurrent       resolution for means-tested direct spending:        (A) The People's Budget adopts former President Obama's       Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to expand eligibility,       including for childless workers. Continues enhanced credits       originally implemented under the American Recovery and       Reinvestment Act to target those most in need. This includes       extending the Child and Dependent Care Credit and the       American Opportunity Tax Credit through 2027.        (B) The People's Budget includes former President Obama's       proposal to boost the Child Tax Credit maximum deduction to       $3,000. It makes key expansions permanent to protect 50       million Americans who would otherwise be at jeopardy for       losing part or all of their EITC and CTC.        (C) The People's Budget creates a debt free college that       provides Federal matching program to support state efforts to       expand investment in higher education, bring down  [[Page H7821]]       costs for students, and increase aid to students to help them       cover the total cost of college attendance without taking on       debt. The program would encourage innovation by states and       colleges to improve efficiency and enable speedy and less-      costly degree completion. By treating higher education as a       public good worth investing in, we can once again make higher       education accessible to all.        (D) The People's Budget allows students to refinance their       student loans at low rates and allows private borrowers to       shift to more affordable government loans. Allowing student       borrowers to reduce the value of their debt will free up       income for purchases and will create a job-creating ripple       effect throughout the entire economy.        (E) The People's Budget restores cuts made to the       Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and       permanently adopts the enhanced levels established in the       American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The vast majority of       SNAP recipients are households with children, seniors and       individuals with disabilities, but recent cuts lowered       average benefits by $216 in 2014. Providing families with       basic food security through SNAP is one of the most effective       ways the Federal Government can stimulate the economy.        (F) The People's Budget provides an additional $10.8       billion for child nutrition programs including program       expansion and improvements for summer meals; essential       improvements and expansion funding for preschool nutrition       including increases in meal reimbursements to fulfill the new       meal pattern, an additional meal or snack for children in       long-term care, and expanded program eligibility; and       investments in school meals and school kitchens.        (G) The People's Budget replaces the 40 percent excise tax       with a public option to allow the Secretary of Health and       Human Services to offer a public insurance option within the       health insurance marketplaces. This ensures choice,       competition, and stability in coverage. The Congressional       Budget Office (CBO) estimates the premium costs for Americans       under the public option will be 7 to 8 percent lower than       costs in private exchange plans. The repeal of the excise tax       costs $132 billion while savings from the public option are       $176 billion.        (H) The People's Budget continues funding for the entire       CHIP program until 2020.        (I) The People's Budget protects States programs by fully       retaining maintenance of effort requirements and eliminating       any States ability to arbitrarily implement enrollment caps.       Without action, Federal funding for CHIP will expire       jeopardizing the health care coverage of more than 10 million       children and pregnant women.        (J) The People's Budget permits the Secretary of Health and       Human Services (HHS) to negotiate prescription drug prices       with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Giving HHS the ability to       negotiate prices, as the Department of Veterans Affairs       currently does, will save Medicare $429 billion and will       reduce costs for seniors.        (b) Nonmeans-tested Direct Spending.--        (1) For nonmeans-tested direct spending, the average rate       of growth in the total level of outlays during the 10-year       period preceding fiscal year 2018 is 4.8 percent.        (2) For nonmeans-tested direct spending, the estimated       average rate of growth in the total level of outlays during       the 11-year period beginning with fiscal year 2017 is 5.6       percent under current law.        (3) The following reforms are proposed in this concurrent       resolution for nonmeans-tested direct spending:        (A) The People's Budget allows those who have lost a job       through no fault of their own to claim up to 99 weeks of       unemployment benefits in high-unemployment states for up to       two years.        (B) The People's Budget also adopts former President       Obama's reforms to improve solvencies and incentivize job       training.        (C) The People's Budget improves the Affordable Care Act by       repealing the excise tax on high-priced health plans.       Proponents of the provision hoped that this tax would slow       the rate of growth of health costs, while raising revenue.       However, in an effort to avoid the tax, employers who       traditionally offer excellent benefits have started offering       less generous plans. This is an ineffective tool to bend the       cost curve. Since the tax is attached to premiums instead of       coverage it has the potential to hit plans it wasn't intended       to impact.        (D) The People's Budget establishes a representative       democracy that truly reflects the diversity and values of our       nation by providing funding for the public financing of       campaigns. This gives a voice to small donors that have been       drowned out by dark money. Public financing keeps politicians       accountable to the voters that elect them instead of to       special interest money. In the era of the devastating       Citizens United decision, big money has taken the reins of       our election process. It is now more important than ever to       provide candidates with effective alternatives to finance       their campaigns.        (E) The People's Budget uses the Experimental Price Index       for the Elderly (CPI-E) to calculate Cost of Living       Adjustments (COLA) for Federal retirement programs other than       Social Security. Affected programs include civil service       retirement, military retirement, Supplemental Security       Income, veteran's pensions and compensations. CPI-E is the       most sensible and accurate measure of the real costs that       seniors face in retirement, current underpricing of costs       amount to cutting benefits for those on fixed incomes.        (G) The People's Budget makes a down payment of $1.9       trillion to help close the nation's infrastructure deficit       while protecting against climate change and creating millions       of living wage jobs. The budget also helps boost private       financing for critical state and local projects by creating a       public-private infrastructure bank. The American Society of       Civil Engineers (ASCE) estimates that the United States will       need to invest upwards of $2 trillion above current levels       over the next decade just to make required repairs to roads,       bridges, water, and energy systems.                TITLE III--MISCELLANEOUS BUDGET ENFORCEMENT       SEC. 301. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST ADVANCE APPROPRIATIONS.         (a) In General.--In the House, except as provided in       subsection (b), any bill, joint resolution, amendment or       conference report making a general appropriations or       continuing appropriation may not provide for advance       appropriations.        (b) Exceptions.--Advance appropriations may be provided for       all programs administered by the Department of Veterans       Affairs.        (c) Definition.--In this section, the term ``advance       appropriation'' means any new discretionary budget authority       provided in a bill or joint resolution making general       appropriations or any new discretionary budget authority       provided in a bill or joint resolution making continuing       appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that first becomes       available for any fiscal year after 2018.       SEC. 302. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST FUNDING FOR CERTAIN                     IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS.         It shall not be in order in the House of Representatives or       the Senate to consider any bill or joint resolution, or       amendment thereto or conference report thereon, that       appropriates funds to implement Executive Order 13767,       entitled ``Border Security and Immigration Enforcement       Improvements''.       Amend the title so as to read: ``Concurrent resolution       setting forth the congressional budget for the United States       Government for fiscal year 2018 and including the appropriate       budgetary levels for fiscal year 2017 and fiscal years 2018-      2027''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 553, the gentleman  from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) and a Member opposed each will control 15  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise to offer this amendment to replace the reckless  Republican budget that is being considered before this House.   Instead of a doomsday budget that presents a future where everything  is bleak and opportunity is nonexistent, the Progressive Caucus is  offering a budget that can prove that the future can be bright and  prosperous.   The Republican budget sacrifices everything from public education to  Social Security to Medicare and Medicaid. It does this for one reason  and one reason only: to give the wealthiest few and the corporations  more tax breaks and increase their standing and concentration of power  and wealth in this country more than it is already.   It has been said over and over that the budget that we are presenting  we feel does deal with the values of this country. It deals very  directly with something that is important to this Nation, and that is  the American people, the greatest resource that we have as a nation,  and we see it day in and day out.   This budget invests in the American people. It invests in jobs, it  invests in solid education, and it invests in the greater good.   This budget is not narrow, tilted to a few: the wealthiest and the  corporations in this country. It deals with the totality of who the  American people are: those who are struggling and need opportunity,  those who are elderly and need the continued support of this Nation  through Medicare and Social Security, those who are poor who need  Medicaid and a good education system so their opportunity will be  better in the future.   Our budget speaks to the values of the American people. Our budget  speaks to the needs of the American people. Our budget speaks to a  future that returns the values, to the American people, of opportunity,  of hope, and of chance.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 15  minutes.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Mr. Chairman, even though I disagree heartily with the budgets  advanced by  [[Page H7822]]  the Progressive Caucus, they do us an invaluable service in the budget  debate by bringing into sharp relief the two very different visions of  governance advanced by the two parties.   The Progressive budget is a sincere and bold document. Unfortunately,  it is also wrong. It would hike taxes by $10.1 trillion over the next  10 years relative to the Republican budget.   Now, think of every trillion dollars that we throw around here as  $8,000 from an average family, because that is what it comes to. So  $10.1 trillion in new taxes ultimately translates as $81,000 from an  average family over the next decade taken either as direct taxes or as  tax-driven price increases or as lower wages or as lower earnings as  businesses pass on their burdens to consumers or employers or  investors. Remember, investors are largely your 401(k) or your pension  plan.   It also runs up $2.6 trillion more in debt than the Republican budget  over the next 10 years. That means another $21,000 of debt added to  that family's obligations that they will have to pay as future taxes  just as surely as if it appeared on their credit card statement this  month. And they have got to pay that back before they pay back their  credit card statement. The IRS can get very insistent that they do.   And don't believe for a moment that only the rich will pay these  taxes. It turns out that the so-called rich people aren't rich and they  aren't even people. Many are struggling small businesses filing under  subchapter S, small businesses that create two-thirds of the jobs in  our economy.   We are told: ``Don't worry. We are using that money to create wealth  and jobs.'' Well, the problem is government does not create jobs  because it cannot create wealth. Government cannot inject a dollar into  the economy until it has first taken that dollar out of the same  economy.   As Bastiat warned, we see the job that government creates when it  puts the dollar back in the economy. What we don't see as clearly is  the job that is lost when government first takes that dollar out of the  economy. We see those lost jobs as stagnating wages and workers giving  up and leaving the job market, or as it is also known, the Obama  economy.   Here is what government can do and what the Progressive and  Democratic budgets propose. It can transfer jobs from the private  sector to the public sector by taxing one and expanding the other. It  can transfer jobs from one sector of the private market to another by  taxing one and subsidizing the other. That is precisely the difference  between Apple Computer and Solyndra. It is the difference between FedEx  and the post office. It is the difference between the Reagan recovery  and the Obama recovery.   Reagan, like Coolidge and Kennedy before him, reduced the tax and  regulatory burdens on the economy and produced one of the longest  economic expansions in our country's history. It truly felt like  morning again in America. That is the Republican approach, and it  works.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan), the co-chair of the Congressional Progressive  Caucus, and I thank Mr. Pocan and his office staff for the fine work  and time that they put into working on this budget that we are  proposing today.    Mr. Chairman, what the Progressive Caucus budget does,  and does very clearly, is that we end the special treatment for Wall  Street buddies of the majority of this Congress.   Meanwhile, their budget has no problem hitting low- and middle-income  families with their tax plan. Under their plan, corporations get a $2  trillion cut, $2.4 trillion, and the richest 1 percent will get a tax  cut worth $130,000 next year; and many middle class families will have  to pay more.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington  (Ms. Jayapal), a valued member of the Progressive Caucus.    Mr. Chairman, the Progressive Caucus budget invests in  the American people, invests in America, and still reduces the deficit  by $4 trillion over 10 years.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Ted Lieu), my friend and a member of the Progressive Caucus.   Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Chairman, I thank Representative  Grijalva for his leadership.   Our Nation's infrastructure is crumbling. The American Society of  Civil Engineers estimates we have a $4.6 trillion infrastructure  deficit. That is why the People's Budget wisely invests $2 trillion to  fix our infrastructure.   Not only will this budget help repair roads, highways, and bridges,  but it will also put broadband all over America, including rural areas,  and create millions of good-paying jobs, over 2.5 million in its first  year.   We are presenting this plan. We are asking for support. Donald Trump  talks a big game on infrastructure, but he has yet to put out a plan.  So we urge the President to support our plan. If he doesn't want to,  then put out his plan so we can have a discussion on how to move  forward on fixing our infrastructure and creating high-paying jobs for  Americans.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Chairman, Americans in this Congress do have a  choice. Our budget is a contrast to what the Republicans are proposing.  We can either cut Medicare to pay for more tax breaks for millionaires  and billionaires as our Republican budget does, or we can close tax  loopholes to protect essential programs that invest in jobs. We chose  investment.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Espaillat).    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to the remaining time  each side has.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona has 4\3/4\ minutes  remaining, and the gentleman from California has 2 minutes remaining.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to the remaining time  each side has.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona has 4\3/4\ minutes  remaining, and the gentleman from California has 2 minutes remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), a leader in our caucus and a leader here in  Congress.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me thank the gentleman for his  leadership. It has been more than a pleasure to serve as the vice chair  of the Congressional Progressive Caucus for the number of years that we  have had to put forward the people's budget.   I simply want to say what a budget is, Mr. Chairman. A budget is a  roadmap for the American people. It is a question of whether America  cares about the most vulnerable and whether or not, in our caring, we  are prepared to do deeds to insist upon their success.   The Republican budget takes $2 trillion and provides a big, wealthy  tax cut for the rich, and it creates, in essence, a deep hole in  affordable care for healthcare. It does not provide justice and fair  elections. It takes away educational opportunity from students, and, of  course, it does not bring the most vulnerable out of poverty and  enhance the lives of the middle class.   The people's budget provides for supporting the Affordable Care Act.  It provides for giving fair working tax cuts for others, and it  provides fairness and justice.   I rise to support the people's budget. It invests in the American  people. I ask my colleagues to vote for the Congressional Progressive  Caucus' budget.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the top ten reasons to support the  Congressional Progressive Caucus' budget.               Top Ten Reasons To Support The People's Budget     (Supported by over 60 organizations including: AFT, NEA, Planned    Parenthood, Communications Workers of America, Sierra Club, AFSCME,               AFGE, Vote Vets, Social Security Works, NARAL)         (1) The People's Budget invests $2 trillion in America's       crumbling infrastructure while promoting job growth and       strengthening our commitment to sustainability. This is an       investment in America which will transform our fossil-fuel       energy system, overburdened mass transit, deteriorating       schools, lead-contaminated water systems, and crumbling roads       and bridges through local hiring and livable wages.        (2) The People's Budget enacts comprehensive immigration       reform which permanently protects Dreamers and their families       and opposes immigration bans on Muslims and refugees. Our       country needs an immigration system that honors our values of       inclusion, diversity, and equality. Our Budget prohibits       funding to Customs and Border Protection to implement       President Trump's discriminatory Muslim and refugee bans.        (3) Our budget takes bold action to fight climate change       and rebuild our local communities recently devastated by       hurricanes. The People's Budget requires polluters to pay for       their reckless behavior while eliminating tax breaks that       incentivize fossil fuel energy over cleaner energy. It       invests $200 billion to ensure families in Texas, Louisiana,       Puerto Rico, Florida and U.S. territories have the immediate       assistance they need to begin the stable road to recovery. It       also provides funding for climate change research, mitigation       and adaptation to protect those most at risk from future       environmental disasters.        (4) The CPC budget delivers on the promise of child care       for all and Pre-K for all. It ensures that families will not       have to pay more than 10 percent of their income for child       care, whether that care is at home or at a child care center.       Our budget also expands pre-k for children across the       country.        (5) We make debt free college a reality for all students by       overhauling the student loan system which currently leaves       college students saddled with unmanageable levels of debt.       The People's Budget creates a federal matching program that       supports state efforts to expand investments in higher       education, bring down costs for students, and increase aid to       students to help them cover the total cost of college       attendance without taking on debt.        (6) The People's Budget strengthens the Affordable Care       Act, while pushing towards a single payer system. It       prioritizes reforms to increase access, equity, and       affordability. Maintaining the positive reforms from the ACA       are critical as Republicans attempt to gut the health care       system and leave millions of Americans stranded without       access to critical insurance coverage. The People's Budget       protects Medicare's integrity and improves its long-term       solvency. It protects children and low-income Americans and       gives states the freedom to transition to a single payer       system. It also makes two significant policy changes to       reduce the costs of prescription drugs: allows Medicare Part       D to negotiate drug prices and ends ``Pay for Delay''       practice which keeps generics out of the market.        (7) The CPC Budget creates a fair tax system for working       Americans. In order to make these bold, necessary investments       in working families, we must rewrite the rules of a rigged       economy that favors billionaires and big corporations. The       People's Budget closes tax loopholes that corporations use to       ship jobs overseas, and stops CEOs from receiving millions in       tax-free bonuses. Our budget tackles inequality through fair       tax rates for all Americans, leveling the playing field for       working people.        (8) Our budget protects the right to vote and supports       criminal justice reforms which strengthen public safety and       avoid over-criminalization. Our budget calls for rebuilding       trust in the justice system by funding community oriented       policing reforms. It also strengthens Department of Justice       voter protection programs, protects voting rights by       increasing funding to voter protection agencies, and funds       public financing of campaigns to curb the influence of       special interests in politics. Additionally, the budget makes       key investments in America's electoral integrity by upgrading       our voting systems.        (9) The People's Budget creates pathways out of poverty by       expanding proven anti-poverty programs and initiatives and       restoring vital programs to our nation to provide prosperity       for all. These include a national strategy to reduce poverty       in half in ten years and $12.8 billion investment to end       family homelessness. The People's Budget restores cuts made       to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and       permanently adopts the enhanced levels established in the       American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. It also provides an       additional $10 billion for child nutrition programs and       allows those who have lost a job through no fault of their       own to claim up to 99 weeks of unemployment benefits for up       to two years.        (10) We make veterans a priority by increasing funding for       veterans supportive housing to eliminate veterans       homelessness and expanding access to mental health care for       all veteran and service members. Our budget also invests in       job training opportunities for transitioning service members       and veterans.     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   In the debate on the Republican budget and how it contrasts with the  Congressional Progressive Caucus budget, we heard a lot about needing  to control mandatory spending, that that was the real issue here,  runaway mandatory spending.   Make no mistake, when my Republican colleagues talk about cutting  mandatory spending, they mean they want to cut Medicare and Social  Security to pay for the trillion-dollar tax scam and creative numbers  that are part of their budget for the wealthy and for the corporations  in America.   The other issue that we heard a lot about is that, by making these  major cuts for the wealthiest and the rich, that somehow their net gain  and their profit and their break on taxes is going to trickle down to  the rest of us. Well, we have seen that movie before in this country.  That trickle-down theory doesn't work. The money doesn't trickle down,  and the American people won't be fooled about that again.   Our budget invests $2 trillion in infrastructure and jobs  immediately. Our budget takes bold action to fight climate change, and  our budget delivers on the promise for our children, their inheritance  of this country, the inheritance of the children that everybody is  worried about a deficit. We are worried about their future as well.   Our budget delivers on the promise of childcare for all, pre-K for  all, and a robust public education system to provide all kids with an  opportunity to succeed in this Nation.   Our budget is about the future, our budget is about emphasizing the  values that make this country special and great, and our budget is a  contrast. It offers a contrast about what this country can be if it  invests in its people.   The road that we have been on for far too long in which we have  disinvested in people, shifted wealth and burden onto the middle class  and the working class in this country, that time has ended. Our budget  represents that end.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the people's budget, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, have my friends on the left learned absolutely nothing  over these past 8 years? If massive government spending, higher and  higher  [[Page H7826]]  taxes, and deeper and deeper debt produced economic growth, the Obama  years should have been the golden age of our economy. Instead, we  suffered prolonged stagnation. We averaged 1.5 percent annual growth,  only half the average economic growth that our Nation has enjoyed in  the postwar era. The Progressive and Democratic budgets promise more of  the same.   We choose a different path, the Reagan path that produced an average  of 3.5 percent growth year after year, higher wages, better jobs. Not  just a Republican policy, John F. Kennedy did the same thing. He  reminded us that a rising tide lifts all boats. These are the policies  that create prosperity.   The government cannot create jobs because it cannot create wealth,  but what it can do is create the conditions where jobs multiply and  prosper or where they stagnate and disappear. That it can do very well.  We have very consistent experience with the policies that create these  conditions.   If you increase the burdens on the economy as the Democrats again  propose, the economy contracts. If you lighten the burdens on the  economy, it grows and prospers. No nation has ever taxed and spent its  way to prosperity, but many nations have taxed and spent their way to  economic ruin and bankruptcy.   We know what works and we know what doesn't work because we have  tried both paths many times before. The House Budget Committee's budget  follows principles that have, time and again, consistently and rapidly  produced economic expansion and prosperity.   The House Democrats' budget and the Progressive budget before us now  double down on policies that have impoverished and bankrupted nations  wherever they have been employed down through history.   That is the choice before us today. Let us choose wisely. Our future  depends on it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a  substitute offered by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will  be postponed.    Amendment No. 2 in the Nature of a Substitute Offered by Mr. Scott of                                  Virginia    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2  printed in House Report 115-339.
