 Madam President, today I wish to recognize David  Fitz-Gerald and congratulate him on his term as the chair of the ESOP  Association. David has been committed to advancing the employee  ownership model in Vermont and around the country. For the last 2  years, David served as chair of the association, working to promote the  interests of employee stock ownership plan, ESOP, companies across the  country.   In my State of Vermont, we have seen firsthand the many benefits that  employee ownership can bring to businesses and employees. Study after  study has shown that employee ownership has been proven to spur  employment, increase productivity, grow sales, and raise wages. During  the last two recessions, companies with ESOPs were twice as likely to  survive the downturn.   David has been a vital ally in the efforts to expand broad-based  employee ownership and bolster middle-class jobs in our communities. As  chair, David advocated for the ESOP business model and the benefits of  worker ownership all across the country. I know many in the employee  ownership community are so appreciative of David's energy, motivation,  and empowerment. Over the last 2 years, David dedicated much of his  time and energy to expanding broad-based employee ownership to help  create a sustainable economy that benefits all of us.   In addition to his work as chair of the ESOP Association, David  serves as a trustee for the Employee Ownership Foundation, working to  promote employee ownership. He is a leader in the Vermont employee  ownership community and has been a crucial ally in our fight to expand  employee ownership in our state and throughout the country. As we  continue to work together to help the employee ownership model realize  its true potential, I know David will continue to be an invaluable  partner.                            ____________________
