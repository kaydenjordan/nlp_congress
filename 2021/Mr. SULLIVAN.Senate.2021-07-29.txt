 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it is Thursday. It is my favorite time  of the week. I get to come down on the Senate floor and talk about  someone who has made an impact on their community, maybe the State,  maybe the country, and, occasionally--occasionally--the world. That is  what I call our Alaskan of the Week.   Now, this is going to be a little bit of a historic ``Alaskan of the  Week.'' I have been doing this, gosh, going on 6 years almost, and  while this is a historic moment, because we have never made someone an  Alaskan of the Week twice--it has never happened. We are making Senate  history right now. But you might know that we had a historic week in  the Olympics because our Alaskan of the Week a month ago, whom we  talked about here on the Senate floor, Lydia Jacoby, when she made the  Olympic team, she won Gold. And for anyone who saw that race, that 100- meter breaststroke race a couple of nights ago, you will probably never  forget it. We certainly are not going to forget it.   And I guarantee you, Lydia's hometown of Seward, AK--a beautiful,  incredible town of 3,000 people, wonderful people--they are not going  to forget it.   So history is right here on the Senate floor. Lydia Jacoby, gold  medalist--as the Washington Post called it in a headline, ``an Alaskan  Stunner''--is our Alaskan of the Week for the second time.   You know, I always talk a little bit about Alaska before I do my  ``Alaskan of the Week'' speech. A lot of people, particularly at this  point in the summer, when they are visiting, are curious about the  light: if the Sun ever sets in the summer, when it rises. So what I  always try to do is tell people: Come on up and see for yourself. We  would love to have you. We are having a beautiful summer.   I will give you a hint. Right now in Seward, AK--that is the home of  our Gold medal Olympian athlete, Lydia--the Sun will rise today at 5:32  a.m. and set around 10:35. We lost about 5 minutes from yesterday. But  if you are still thinking about coming up to Alaska for a summer trip,  come on and do it. There is still lots of Sun.    There is tons of excitement across my State, and there is tons of  excitement across Alaska, in Seward and everywhere else, because of  this incredible young 17-year-old. And if you saw it on TV, Seward, AK,  Monday night was probably the site of the best Olympic watch party  ever--I hope people saw that--ever.   So I talked about Lydia about a month ago when she cinched her spot  on the team, and she did that by actually swimming the second fastest  time in the world in the women's 100-meter breaststroke finals in the  Olympic trials for the United States. So we, in Alaska, knew she was  something.   I will mention this again: Alaskans, we punch above our weight in the  Winter Olympics. We do really well in the Winter Olympics, for reasons  that most people probably understand, and we have done pretty well in  the Summer Olympics, particularly in trapshooting, riflery. We have an  Olympic veteran  [[Page S5157]]  rugby player right now. Alev Kelter from Eagle River is also competing.  Her team made the Olympic quarterfinals. She might be on the field  later tonight, so good luck to her. We are going to be rooting for her  as well.   But Alaska has never sent a swimmer to the Olympics, ever, let alone  won a gold. As the NBC announcer said after the race, Alaska ``is not  exactly your hotbed of swimming in America.''   Someone else pointed out that Alaska is dead last in the United  States in terms of swimming pools per mile by far. We don't have a lot  of swimming pools. And, as a matter of fact, Lydia's story is even more  impressive because there is only one Olympic-sized pool in the whole  State of Alaska, and that is in Anchorage, a 2\1/2\-hour drive from  Seward, her hometown.   So I will just reiterate a little bit more about this remarkable  young woman and her dedicated mom and dad who raised her. Her parents,  Leslie and Richard, are both boat captains. Leslie is the educational  coordinator for the Marine Science Explorer Program at Kenai Fjords  Tours, and Rich is a maritime instructor at the Alaska Vocational  Technical Center--AVTEC, as we call it--and he also is a guide for  Arctic and Antarctic trips.   They raised their daughter Lydia in Seward, signed her up for swim  classes when she was a toddler. Good job, Mom and Dad. She joined the  swim club when she was just 6 years old. When she was 10, she was  selected for the Alaska Swimming Zone Team. State qualifying meets  allowed her to go on trips.   In between all of this, she was and continues to be a musician,  learning to play the guitar and upright bass. She sings. She plays at  folk festivals. Her band is the Snow River String Band. She was also in  theater and in track. She likes to write, take pictures, and explore  tidal basins. This is just a good, all-American teenager in Alaska.   And, of course, she excelled in swimming. Her parents continued to  be, in their words, surprised and amazed and, of course, so proud.   One of her coaches, Solomon D'Amico, described her as ``kind, quiet,  and yet confident'' and said that Lydia had an ``intense fire,'' one  that you might not see immediately in her. But neither her parents nor  her coach pushed her too hard. They wanted the drive to come from her,  and it certainly did.   On Monday night, when this historic race started, the NBC announcers  were focused mostly on the reigning Olympic champion and world record  holder, American Lilly King, as well as the newly minted Olympic record  holder, Tatjana Schoenmaker of South Africa. In the announcers' minds,  that is where the competition was.   But we knew better, especially in Seward, AK, where about 400 people  gathered for the race. All eyes were on Lydia. They knew all along she  could do it.   In Tokyo, the NBC announcers started to notice the underdog. And if  you haven't watched the race, go to YouTube. It is so exciting. And  they saw her starting to pull ahead in the final seconds. You could  hear the announcers getting excited. They said:         Then you've got Jacoby, lane 3, challenging Schoenmaker.       Watch Jacoby. Lydia Jacoby, the 17-year-old from Alaska, is       putting on the surge of her career.    Watch it. It is so exciting. And, of course, she did. Now, there is a  video of everybody watching in Seward, which quickly went viral, of  Lydia's friends and classmates and neighbors jumping up and down,  stomping the floor, when the announcer yelled, ``Alaska has an Olympic  Gold Medalist. Oh, my gosh.''   The place went nuts.   Anyone watching, if you want to get Olympic joy, go on the website  and look at the Twitter video that the Olympics put up. It is a split- screen shot of the race at the top and the great fans in Seward, AK,  cheering. And when she wins, watch what happens. It is priceless. It is  Olympic joy at its best.   Lydia's parents, Rich and Leslie, were in Florida, where NBC and the  Olympic Committee had set up a watch party for families of the  athletes. They, too, knew that she had it in her to win the gold. Her  dad said: ``When she hit the wall at the turn, we knew she was right in  there. She likes to run [people down]'' in her races.   On television, the joy and the pride of her parents was also  priceless. They are still filled with excitement and pride and, let's  face it, a little bit of shellshock. And they are so grateful for the  outpouring of support from Alaskans and, let's face it, Americans  across the country.   ``It's true,'' Rich said, ``about Alaska being the biggest small town  in the world.'' Rich said that Lydia is doing great; she is happy,  tired, a bit overwhelmed. We don't know yet. She might be competing in  an upcoming relay race, which she is super excited about. We will see  if that happens.   As for what is next, her dad said Lydia is going to continue her life  of being a normal teenager; participate in high school sports, no  doubt, continue to play music; and she is still planning on attending  the University of Texas in the fall, a normal teenager but who has  touched so many lives across Alaska, particularly Seward, but across  the country--really, across the globe.   As one Washington Post columnist put it on Lydia's win, ``There are  moments at [the] Olympics that redefine a town. And there are moments  at [the] Olympics that make you say: `That's why I watch [the  Olympics]. That's why I came. That's what [the Olympics is] all  about.'''   And I think we all saw that when we watched this race. We saw that,  including the two other competitors who won the silver and bronze,  Lilly King and Tatjana Schoenmaker, who came over to Lydia and were so  gracious, hugging her, joyful.   So I want to thank them. I want to thank Lydia's coaches, including  Solomon, who put so much training and dedicated so much time and effort  to her skills; and, of course, to her mom and dad for their very hard  work, early morning practices, raising an exceptional daughter; to the  competitors; really, everybody.   And, of course, to Lydia: Great job on your hard work, dedication,  grit, determination. Throughout the years, so many people--throughout  the decades, so many people have dreamed of finding gold in Alaska, and  you are an Alaskan who found gold in a way that has inspired and  overjoyed not just your community of Seward, not just our State, but  literally our country and the world.   So, Lydia, congrats on the gold medal; congratulations on your win;  and congratulations, for the first time in Senate history, on being the  only person ever to be our Alaskan of the Week two times. Great job   I yield the floor.
