 Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure today that I rise  in support of strong bipartisan passage of the Butch Lewis Act and this  rule. I thank Congresswoman Torres for yielding me this time and  Chairman Richard Neal of the Ways and Means Committee for moving this  legislation expeditiously.   The Butch Lewis Act will provide the economic security this body  ripped out from under millions of hardworking Americans in past  Congresses.   Across our country, 1.3 million workers--truck drivers, candymakers,  coal  [[Page H7261]]  miners--and retirees face serious and significant threats of cuts to  their hard-earned multiemployer pension plans through no fault of their  own.   Several of these plans are large enough to take down the entire  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, threatening the security of  another 10 million hardworking Americans.   I have heard the message time and again from retirees in our district  and across this Nation: They worked for decades to earn these pensions,  and they cannot sustain massive cuts. Now, they are too old or their  health too unstable to return to the workforce. The stress and anxiety  are sapping their will, and some have even taken their own lives.   The Butch Lewis Act will ensure they receive their much-needed and  long-overdue pensions, again, which they earned.   The Butch Lewis Act keeps the promises made to retirees, guaranteeing  their pensions into the future, and does so by allowing impacted  pension plans to borrow the money needed to remain solvent over a 30- year period of time, with low-interest loans that they must pay back.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Pensions have afforded millions of middle-class Americans the  opportunity to enjoy their golden years with economic peace of mind.  Let us restore this peace to 1.3 million Americans and retirees who  earned these benefits with the swift and, finally, just passage of the  Butch Lewis Act.
