Katrina finds it incredibly rewarding to see students motivated by  science experiments and researching on their own about careers in  science fields.

Devan's inspiration as an educator is to learn more about his  students. He does this because we typically do not know the realities  some students endure after leaving the classroom or how deeply those  negative experiences affect their mental health and personal well- being. His inspiration comes from his own personal experience as a  student.   Devan knows some students have it worse than what he experienced and  has realized the students he teaches today mimic the same front he put  on while in school. This thought process is what drives his every  decision to help those students who need it the most.   Devan is an English I teacher at Blountstown High School. He began  his teaching career in 2017 teaching English and reading at Wewahitchka  Jr./Sr. High School. Currently, Devan is developing a curriculum for  teaching freshman English courses that meet Florida standards, focusing  on informational text analyses, argumentative writing, and grammar  mechanics.   I extend my deepest gratitude to Devan for his commitment to teaching  and making a difference in the lives of his students. I look forward to  hearing of his good work in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize  Jerry Webb, the Taylor County Teacher of the Year from Taylor County  Elementary School in Perry, FL.

Previously, he worked as a  paraprofessional at the school before becoming a grade school teacher.

Heather believes there is no better way to spend her day than having  a classroom that is a creative outlet for students. She tries to get  them to stop questioning whether they can do something and, instead,  empowers them to be creative on their own.   I offer my sincere gratitude to Heather for the good work she does  for her students. I look forward to hearing of her continued success in  the years to come.                            ____________________
