 Mr. Speaker, have you ever had that deja vu all over  again? Haven't we been doing this one since, what, 2013, 2014?   I accept I have been off the committee now for 4 years; yet we are  talking past each other. I hear the gentlewoman and some of the others  say things. It is a 12-page bill. It hasn't changed that much in the  last couple Congresses.   How many of us would like to go back to the 2013 inspector general  report that basically suggested going this direction because of the  conflicts in these advisory committees?                                time  0945    If you really, once again--and this is sort of similar to yesterday's  discussion--if you really care about the environment, then you really  care about the data and the information and sort of the ethics and  honesty of those who are both reviewing the data and giving you advice.   So what happens when the inspector general of the EPA hands you a  report and says: These committees, these advisory councils are rife  with conflicts? People who are on these advisory boards are making  money.   Now, accept much of what we do here in Washington, D.C., if not  almost all of it, is about the cash, and it is one of the ugly secrets  that is not a secret, but we all pretend. It is always about the money.   Let's try something novel. Let's actually--this was an inspector  general's report under the Obama administration. Why wouldn't we step  up and respect it? It was very simple.   Hey, we need some more diversity on these advisory boards. And  wouldn't it be wonderful if we had people advising us on air quality  policy in non-attainment areas, or in regional interests that also  weren't selling products, selling reports, making money off data with  the EPA?   I mean, if it was reversed, if it was some other agency, if this same  set of ethical lapses was reversed, I believe the left would be  apoplectic. But the fact of the matter is that so many of these  individual organizations that are represented on these advisory boards,  that are making money from the EPA, even though they are advising in  their own behalf, happen to be friends of the left. That makes it okay.   The ethical standards are the ethical standards. I have no concept  how the left can oppose the concept of structured diversity.   Why shouldn't those of us from the Southwest, where substantial  portions  [[Page H2572]]  of my State are Native American, have a voice? Why should we allow  people on these advisory committees who, once again, are selling  products, selling data, making a living, making money, one step away  from the very work they are advising on?   It is a 12-page bill. It is not that complicated. I will make the  argument that it makes our air, our water, the things around us safer,  better, healthier, and it makes the way we get there sounder and more  ethical, and we remove conflicts that right now taint the very  decisions that are coming out of these advisory boards.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Let me thank the other side for their vigorous defense of this bill.   I must say that I am a nurse by profession, and I appreciate the  gains we have made for using scientific data to determine what is  unhealthy for the people; and it really does disturb me to see these  protections being torn apart.   It is really unfortunate that we have spent so much time putting  these protections of the people in place to see that, in this  administration, they will probably fly away. Only the people of this  Nation will be the losers, with more healthcare costs when they don't  even want health care; more people not able to get out of dirty areas.   I live in the State of Texas where we have seen the detriment of all  of the lack of these protections before they came about. Scientists are  in science because they believe in the theories that put forth the  procedures for us to follow for the safety and protection of human  beings.   I regret that we are at a point this time in history where we are  willing to throw all that away because of allowing the polluting  companies to have more to say about policy. I regret that I have to  stand against my colleagues that feel so strongly about getting rid of  these protections, but I cannot sit idly by without saying that our  Nation will not be in better shape when we take away all the  protections for the people and their health.   Everybody wants clean air and clean food and protections from the  damage that a bad environment brings, and all this is is taking away  those protections.   I ask everyone to vote ``no'' on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
