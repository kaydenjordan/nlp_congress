 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this USMCA  agreement. In my home State of Texas, trade with Mexico and Canada  accounts for billions of dollars and millions of jobs, many of them at  the Port of Houston and in the greater Houston area.   The USMCA modernizes the framework for our trade, strengthening  enforcement, labor, and environmental provisions in an updated  agreement that does not adversely impact our businesses, our workers,  or our environment.   It is also critical for our energy future, codifying a new zero- tariff policy and further encouraging U.S. energy exports across North  America for years to come.   The agreement represents a true bipartisan accomplishment that will  set the standard for future trade agreements.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Neal, the working group,  Ranking Member Brady, and Ambassador Lighthizer for their work. As  cochair of the New Democrat Coalition Trade Task Force, I have been  actively working with them to advance this agreement all year. I am so  glad to see it come to the floor of the House. I encourage my  colleagues to vote ``yes''.
