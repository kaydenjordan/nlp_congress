 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Danville Police Department officers who recently received the 2023  Valor Award. Each year, the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police  recognizes law enforcement officers who perform an act of extraordinary  heroism while engaged with an adversary at imminent personal risk in  the line of duty; presenting them the Valor Award, the highest award  offered by the association.   Corporal Todd J. Hawkins, Officer Lance I. Neighbors, Detective  Lieutenant John D. Dixon, Detective Sergeant Richard Wright, and  Detective Jordan T. Land were recognized with this reward.   These officers were responding to a robbery when the suspect began  firing at them. One officer returned fire, and the detectives chased  the suspect by car until he crashed and fled the scene on foot. After  finding the criminal as he was attempting to break into an occupied  residence, the detectives de-escalated the situation and convinced the  individual to surrender.   Displaying the utmost valor and courage, these members of the  Danville Police Department were rightfully selected to receive this  reward. They deserve our deepest gratitude for keeping our communities  safe.   I am honored to represent such an outstanding group of officers, and  I thank them for their continued service and sacrifice.                            ____________________
