 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize National Agriculture Week, which begins on March 20, a week  dedicated to honoring and acknowledging the efforts and hard work of  American farmers and farm families.   While farmers, ranchers, producers, foresters, and farmworkers should  be celebrated year-round, National Agriculture Week shines a bright  light on where our Nation's food, fiber, and fuel come from. I have  always said every American interacts with agriculture at least three  times a day, whether they realize it or not: breakfast, lunch, and  dinner. It is a fundamental part of our lives, and it is the backbone  of the American economy.   Celebrated during National Agriculture Week, National Agriculture Day  began in 1973 as a way to recognize the unique value that farmers,  ranchers, and foresters contribute to our society, contributions that  have only grown in importance over the past 2 years as the world faced  a pandemic, global supply chain disruptions, economic instability, and,  now, war in Europe.   Being a farmer has never been an easy job by any means. Feeding and  clothing our Nation and the entire world is a monumental task. Every  day, America's farm families dedicate their minds and bodies to  achieving that feat.   Unfortunately, many farmers today are facing rising input costs,  shrinking profit margins, and unrelenting supply chain issues, much of  which has been self-inflicted by leadership in Washington, yet they  continue to persevere.   As Republican leader of the House Agriculture Committee, I am honored  to represent farm families in rural America and serve as their reliable  voice in the Halls of Congress.   National Agriculture Week encourages every American to: understand  how food and fiber products are produced; appreciate the role  agriculture plays in providing a safe, abundant, and affordable food  supply; value the essential role of agriculture in our economy; and  acknowledge and consider successful career opportunities in the  agriculture industry.   As the Representative of Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District,  I have the great privilege of working firsthand with many farmers and  foresters. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, we are fortunate to  have more than 59,000 farms. These men and women work hard to feed and  clothe not just Pennsylvanians but our Nation and overseas. Their hard  work results in agriculture being Pennsylvania's number one industry.   Agriculture and its associated industries contribute more than $135  billion, or about 18 percent of Pennsylvania's economy. The industry  employs half a million workers, including 280,500 direct jobs.   I will end with one of my favorite quotes about agriculture from  President Jefferson: ``Agriculture . . . is our wisest pursuit, because  it will in the end contribute most to real wealth, good morals, and  happiness.''   This sentiment rings just as true today as it did in President  Jefferson's letter to George Washington in 1787. Our farm families  truly embody the best of the American spirit through their moral  integrity, hard work, and an unwavering dedication to their craft.  Everyone in this Chamber and around the world benefits from the ``wise  pursuit'' of agriculture, and we owe these patriots a resounding debt  of gratitude.   I want to applaud the farmers, ranchers, and foresters who continue  to devote their lives to American agriculture.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  March as National Red Cross Month. Since 1943, March has been  recognized as Red Cross Month. The Red Cross was founded by Clara  Barton in 1881 with the noble mission of preventing and easing human  suffering.   Since its creation, the Red Cross has grown to one of the largest  organizations in the country. Their efforts span from disaster relief,  lifesaving blood collections, international services, and assistance  with military families and veterans. In our current state of the world,  the Red Cross is actively assisting with humanitarian efforts in  Ukraine.   The Red Cross is able to carry out their mission because of their  vast and strong network of volunteers, donors, and partners. Whether  help is needed in big cities or the smallest towns, the Red Cross is  always ready to provide assistance.   Mr. Speaker, during American Red Cross Month, let's renew our  commitment to the timeless ideals of caring for one another.                            ____________________
