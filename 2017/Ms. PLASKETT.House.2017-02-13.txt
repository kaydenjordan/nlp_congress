 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Marc Veasey for  assisting me and for being a leader in this Special Order hour for the  Congressional Black Caucus. Of course, I thank the chair of the  Congressional Black Caucus, our friend and colleague, the Honorable  Cedric Richmond, for his continued leadership of both our caucus and on  issues impacting Black America and minority communities across this  Nation.   Mr. Speaker, Black History Month is a time to reflect on notable  African-American icons, their achievements as a people, and our  continued struggle for a more perfect Union. Not only does it serve as  a source of great pride and an anchor to the African descendants in the  African-American community, but it is also a vehicle to educate the  masses on the totality of the Black experience throughout the history  of this Nation.   As we gather this evening to celebrate the life, legacy, and  achievement of African descendants, it is important to remember the  journey told and employ the same resilient spirit in our continued push  for fair and equal access to life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness.   Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Black Caucus is a body of 49 members  in both houses of Congress representing millions of African Americans  and other minorities and majority people across this country. We are  alarmed by the recent actions of this administration and the threat  those actions pose to the hard-fought progress of African descendants  and minorities in this country.   The nomination of Jeff Sessions as Attorney General for many  minorities across this country was a direct affront to the legacy of  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Stokely Carmichael, our colleague John  Lewis, and the many others who sacrificed and dedicated their lives to  the civil rights movement and the right to vote. The concerns expressed  by the great Coretta Scott King 30 years ago about the dubious past of  Mr. Sessions with respect to enforcing civil rights laws remain the  same for many Americans today. Mr. Speaker, the American Dream was, in  fact, made possible by the plight of African descendants, and we must  remain vigilant and steadfast in the fight against racial, social, and  economic injustice.   Mr. Speaker, I want to raise another area of concern that African  Americans have, and that is for health care. My district of the U.S.  Virgin Islands, home to the first African-American female physician in  Congress, my esteemed predecessor, Donna Christensen, like many  underserved communities across the country, is adversely impacted by  disparate health outcomes. Diabetes, hypertension, along with funding  for disease such as sickle cell, may be adversely affected in this  administration. Programs for nutrition and preventative health, like  Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, and Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Programs, or SNAP, provide critical food to the  neediest in all of our communities, especially mine, the Virgin  Islands, and especially to our children.   Repeal of the Affordable Care Act would create unhealthy African- American communities. Since the Affordable Care Act was passed, nearly  half of the African-American adults who didn't have health insurance  now have health insurance. Under the Affordable Care Act, the number of  working-age African-American adults who are uninsured has been cut from  27 percent to 14 percent, the lowest rate ever. The number of African- American children without insurance also decreased to the lowest rate  ever, negative 5 percent. Repealing the Affordable Care Act would take  away coverage for more than 3.3 million African Americans. In my  district, we are looking for ways to expand coverage, not to remove or  repeal it.    Members of this caucus and members before us have offered policy  solutions and continue to push policies and initiatives that would help  African-American communities because we know the work that our  communities have done, the work of our forefathers to ensure that we  have a place at the table; individuals like Shirley Chisholm, as was  [[Page H1121]]  spoken about by my colleague Sheila Jackson Lee. People who have come  to America to be part of the experience of the African diaspora are  people from many parts of the Caribbean. Right now we have  Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, representing the Ninth District of New  York, of Jamaican descent. Other notable Jamaicans who have served this  country: General Colin Powell, the first Black U.S. Secretary of State;  Constance Baker Motley, the first Black woman appointed to the Federal  bench; our previous Attorney General, Eric Holder, whose family hails  from Barbados; Cicely Tyson, the Academy Award-nominated actress whose  family is from Nevis; Edward Blyden, from my own St. Thomas, who has  been known as the father of pan-Africanism; Hubert Harrison, a  prominent political activist, writer, and orator; and my own special  hero, Ruby Rouss of the island of St. Croix, who was the first Black  woman assigned as a permanent staff of the Supreme Headquarters Allied  Powers Europe. It is the work of these great African Americans and  those who are not heralded and those that we don't know.   Ms. Jackson Lee talked about her own family members. My own father,  LeRoy Plaskett, and my mother, who came from the Virgin Islands and  went to New York as older siblings to give back and to ensure that  their younger siblings could have the things needed back home in the  Virgin Islands. They have given a legacy for all of us, and we are so  grateful for the work they have all done. I spoke of Congresswoman  Yvette Clarke of New York.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Veasey.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from Michigan  (Mrs. Lawrence), who is my classmate and one of my very good dear  friends.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Lawrence so much for that  discussion and inspiration she has given us. We are not going to go  back.   We have heard from so many of our colleagues about the achievements  of African Americans. But not just the achievements--the struggles, and  the issues that we are facing today.   Mr. Speaker, we heard from Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, who  outlined not just the past struggles of African Americans and their  achievements, but also about the rising concerns throughout the African  diaspora when she talked about what is happening in Somalia and other  places, and the fact that African Americans have a duty to support  other diasporas and the work that they are doing and the struggles they  have.   We heard about the Affordable Care Act from our assistant leader, Mr.  Clyburn, the civil rights movement, the work that was done, and the  assault that is occurring now on some of those issues.   So we, as the Congressional Black Caucus, have a duty to present  those issues here before you all, our colleagues, here in Congress, Mr.  Speaker, to put those issues on the Record so that we can expound on  them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Mr. Veasey if there is anything else that he  wanted to discuss or that he reflected on in hearing some of the words  that our colleagues spoke about today.    So we don't forget.    So we don't forget.    So we don't forget.    So we don't forget.    So we don't forget.    So we don't forget.    So we don't forget.    Sure.    Sure.    Sure.    Sure.    Sure.    We did. There are some additional conversations that we  need to have, but I know that our time has drawn nigh.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 31 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, February 14, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
