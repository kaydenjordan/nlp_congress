 Will the gentleman yield?   Mr. McGOVERN. I am happy to yield to the gentleman.    Will the gentleman yield?   Mr. McGOVERN. I am happy to yield to the gentleman.    Will the gentleman yield?   Mr. McGOVERN. I am happy to yield to the gentleman.    I appreciate the gentleman yielding.   I was not here for opening statements. I imagine that all time was  yielded for the purpose of debate only.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, we just want to bring up the DREAM Act so  we can resolve this issue today, but I am hoping that the gentleman  would be more favorable than his predecessor.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn  B. Maloney) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding, and I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  3440, the DREAM Act, to protect young people like Isabelle, a DREAMer  who graduated from Baruch College in New York and now works to  help low-income veterans recuperate and get better. Thanks to DACA, she  was able to do this.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   Time will be deducted from the gentleman from Massachusetts.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Al Green) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring  up H.R. 3440, the DREAM Act, to protect DREAMers like Daniel, who  arrived at the age of 2 and graduated from the University of North  Texas.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Speier) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I don't think my colleague is confused about where he is  on this issue, and I don't think any amount of talking on the floor is  going to change his mind on this issue. I would say that the underlying  bill, which makes in order over 140 amendments so that we can have a  conversation about different ideas and different outcomes and lets the  people's voice be heard, is the right way to craft legislation. With  the support of this body and this bill, we will move on to that  underlying debate, and we will have that voice heard.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that the gentleman neglected to  mention that there were 227 amendments, Democratic and Republican  amendments, that were denied yesterday. The frustration that we have  over here is that we are going through an exercise with these  appropriations bills knowing that they are going nowhere and that we  are going to have to deal with a short-term continuing resolution,  [[Page H6687]]  and there will probably be a big omnibus that will be passed at the end  and which might not reflect any of the deliberations that we are doing  on the appropriations matters in the next couple of days.   It is a little bit frustrating because we have other things to do.  What we are saying is let's make this week a week of consequence, and  let us bring up the DREAM Act.   President Trump did something horrible yesterday. He basically pulled  the rug right from underneath 800,000 good, decent, and law-abiding  people, citizens in this country, good people who are American in every  way except they don't have a piece of paper. They were brought here, in  many instances, when they were infants. They now have businesses, are  leading relief efforts in Texas, and serve in our military. And he  pulled the rug right from underneath them all. It is a cruel, awful,  and nasty thing to do.   Listening to the rationale of this White House, this kind of  schizophrenic tirade that we have seen unfold where 1 minute he is  against the DREAMers, then he loves the DREAMers, then he is against  the DREAMers, then he loves them, all of this kind of rambling that we  have seen out of the White House hasn't changed the fact that he has  thrown 800,000 lives in turmoil. People now have to live in fear and in  uncertainty, and it is just a rotten thing to do. What we are saying is  let's fix it.   My friends say they didn't like what President Obama did through  executive order. We tried to legislate. We did, in 2010, pass the DREAM  Act here in the House. Republicans did their best to make sure we  couldn't bring it to the floor in the Senate, but we tried that way.  Then President Obama, thank goodness, stepped up to the plate and put  forward an executive order which has protected 800,000 people.   My friends say that they like the DREAMers and they want to help  them. Well, let's help them. You guys are in charge. You can do  anything you want. All we are asking for is a vote--that is it, a vote.  The way we can ensure a vote is to defeat the previous question so we  can bring up the DREAM Act.   If you don't have the courage to bring it up yourself, then vote to  defeat the previous question and we will bring it to the floor. We will  have the debate, and you can vote any way you want.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from  engaging in personalities toward the President, and to direct their  remarks to the Chair.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to thank you for that admonition.   Mr. Speaker, these are very serious issues that my friends on the  other side were trying to have a debate on the appropriations bills. My  friends have a very legitimate concern about an immigration issue,  characterized with terms like ``cruel'' and ``nasty'' and ``rotten''  and ``no courage.''   I would say to my friends we can try to belittle each other into a  compromise. I have not seen that work before. We can try to insult each  other into a solution. I have not seen that work before.   I have seen my colleagues coming down the other side of the aisle,  Mr. Speaker, one after the other to tell a compelling story about a man  or a woman they know who they believe would make an amazing United  States citizen, who they believe would add value to our communities,  and who they believe is serving admirably in our church and is working  admirably in our community. They have a story to tell, and they should  tell it.   Guess what? I have got a few of those stories to tell myself. But I  would say to my friends, I don't believe, Mr. Speaker, that the insults  and the acrimony are going to get us where any of us wants to be.   For my friends who believe differently, I would tell you I think we  have tried that path before, and it didn't take us where we want to go.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that my friend doesn't like words like  ``cruel'' when it comes to the President's actions with regard to the  DREAMers.   A man named Jesus Contreras, a Houston paramedic, helped rescue flood  victims after the storm, Harvey, hit Texas. Now he faces deportation if  stripped of his DACA protections. I don't know what you call that. I  call it cruel. I can't imagine why anybody would want to take away this  man's ability to be able to live his life in the only country he knows,  a man who is saving lives.   This is just one of many stories. We are telling these stories  because we are hoping that maybe it might move some of my friends on  the other side of the aisle. Maybe it might move the leadership to  allow us to schedule a vote and actually fix this and remove the level  of uncertainty and fear that, now, 800,000 people have to deal with  because of what the President did yesterday and because of the  inaction, over the years, of this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) for  the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I would say to my friend from Massachusetts  I am prepared to close when he is. I have no further speakers  remaining.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McGOVERN. May I inquire how much time I have remaining, Mr.  Speaker.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 7\1/2\  minutes remaining.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   First of all, with regard to the underlying bill that is being  brought before the House today, a whole bunch of appropriations bills  bunched together in an unprecedented way and, I would say, in an  undemocratic way as well--nobody has had a chance to read these bills,  over 1,300 pages--I don't think anybody in this Chamber has read them  all.   Close to 1,000 amendments were submitted. They were all asked to be  submitted before we came back into session while people were still on  work recess. I don't think Members have had a chance to review all of  the amendments. As I said, hundreds of good amendments have already  been rejected.   Last night in the Rules Committee, I invoked Senator John McCain's  name. He recently wrote a piece in which he called upon Congress to go  back to regular order. I agree with him. We ought to go back to regular  order. That is what the Speaker of the House promised when he took the  gavel, we would have regular order. This is not regular order. This is  not the way we should decide spending matters.   I will tell you right now that there will be lots of mistakes in this  legislation that is being rushed through--if it even goes anywhere-- because we are now being told we are going to have to do a continuing  resolution, and chances are we are going to end up having to do a long- term spending bill. But process matters, and when you bunch things  together and when you rush things like this, mistakes are made.   As I said in my opening, we are going to ask for people to vote  ``no'' on the previous question. If you vote ``no'' on the previous  question, I will offer an amendment to bring up Representative Roybal- Allard's bill, which is the DREAM Act, which would actually solve the  dilemma that we face. It would solve the dilemma that 800,000 good  people in this country are now facing as a result of President Trump's  cruel decision yesterday to repeal DACA, to end DACA.   These are people who, as you have heard from all my colleagues as  they have told their stories, are working in this country. They are  leading efforts to rescue people in hurricane-ravaged Texas. They are  paramedics and they serve in our military.                                time  1530    These are good people. This is their country. They were brought here  as infants. This is the only country they know. The fact that we are  treating these good people in such a terrible way, every one of us  should be ashamed. That is not who we are. We keep on saying that every  time the White House does something else that we find offensive. We  keep on saying: That is not who we are; that is not who we are.   Well, at some point, we have to prove it. We have to show it.   If we believe DREAMers are a valuable part of our community, then we  need to protect them. This is a way to do it today. There is no need  for compromise and more discussion. It is very simple: you either  support the DREAMers or you don't. That is it. That is the only  question at hand. If you want to load it up with all kinds of other  extraneous materials, that is not a fair thing to do. That is not what  these people deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are  hearing from their constituents. I know they are hearing from their  churches, synagogues, and mosques that we need to protect these people.  Well, let's do it. The DREAMers don't need your words. They don't need  your sympathies. They don't need your empathy. They need your vote.   We have an opportunity today, by voting ``no'' on the previous  question, to have a vote today on whether to protect the DREAMers. It  is that simple. Some of my colleagues on the Republican side have  spoken very eloquently about the DREAMers. If you mean it, then give us  your vote. If you mean it, do less talking and give us the vote. That  is what we are asking for today.   Vote ``no'' on the previous question. Let us help these great people.  Let us help these people who have been such a valuable part of our  community. Let us treat them with the dignity and respect that they  deserve. Let us recognize that they view this country as their home. We  should view this country as their home as well.   Vote ``no'' on the previous question. If that doesn't work, then vote  ``no'' on this lousy rule.  [[Page H6692]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from  engaging in personalities toward the President.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I fear you are going to have to use that admonition a  great deal in the coming days, and I regret that.   I regret that folks have begun to confuse civility with weakness. My  experience is, when you are strong, you don't have to insult the people  around you. When you are strong, you don't have to call folks around  you names. Civility and weakness are confused. In fact, more often than  not, there is a loss of civility when folks feel at their weakest.   My friends on the other side of the aisle right now, Mr. Speaker,  with good reason, feel very restricted. Being in the minority in the  House of Representatives is a hard place to be. For my friend from  Massachusetts, Mr. Speaker, being in the minority on the Rules  Committee is among one of the hardest places to be. So I don't fault  him for his frustration one little bit. If I was in his shoes, I would  be frustrated as well.   Let me be clear: we are in this position with DACA today for one  reason and one reason only, and that is because instead of leading the  Congress and leading the Nation, President Obama chose to act alone in  a way that he knew would not be permanent.   The instability that you see today is the result of folks acting in a  way that was not stable. The confusion that you see today is the result  of an administration that committed itself to that confusion instead of  committing itself to consensus.   I have been in this Congress for 7 years, Mr. Speaker. That is 7  years. For 4 of those 7 years, the United States Senate was led by the  Democratic Party. Not once in those 7 years has an immigration bill  come to my desk from the United States. Not once. I know, as we sit  here right now, the House Judiciary Committee has acted on immigration  bill after immigration bill after immigration bill.   Let's be clear, Mr. Speaker: the situation that the DREAMers find  themselves in today is the symptom of a Nation that does not have the  security of its borders. Had America had security for its borders, we  would not have allowed these families to put their children in these  positions.   Today, we have an amazing opportunity to have this debate. I tell you  that our President is in a unique position to lead us.   It frustrates me so much, Mr. Speaker, that folks want to assume the  worst about one another and that the media is all too anxious to report  the worst about one another. The President could have just canceled the  DACA program. He could have instructed DHS to start proceedings today.  He didn't. It wouldn't have been the right thing. It wouldn't have been  the prudent thing to do. He didn't do it.   What did he do?   He said: I have read this thing called the United States  Constitution. It turns out that only one group in the land has the  opportunity to write the laws. It is me and my friend from  Massachusetts. It is the majority leader from Kentucky and the minority  leader from New York across the way.   He said: Congress, there is only one way this should have even been  done. It should have been done in the Halls of Congress. That is not  the way President Obama chose to do it. He should have done better. He  didn't. We can do better. Let's do.   Now, to the sky-is-falling reports that came out one right after the  other almost with glee from the fourth estate, the President spoke  again to say: Listen, you know what? If Congress doesn't get it right,  I may have to act myself.   I hope he doesn't. I think that folks have too little confidence in  what we can do together when we set our minds to it, but we do have to  ask ourselves, watching the display here on the floor today, watching  the displays we have had here on the floor in the past: Do we have a  serious group of men and women here who want to work together on  solutions? Or do we have a group of men and women here who want to just  get the next headline, who want to just send out that next tweet, who  just want to just make that next front page story of hysteria?    I believe the former is true. I know the men and women on this floor,  Mr. Speaker, not the caricature of the men and women that you read in  the newspaper, but the real men and women on this floor, who each come  here every single day to diligently serve the almost 700,000 men and  women that they report to back home. And I am proud to do it.   I plea, Mr. Speaker, for you to use your leadership to not allow us  to devolve into the name calling and the acrimony that the fourth  estate would like to suggest characterizes this Chamber, but to lead us  to the sincere debate of caring about people, caring about the rule of  law, caring about families.   Let me just say, the best part of this job is the casework that each  one of us does back home. You all know it. People think the job happens  in Washington, D.C. It doesn't. It happens one family at a time back  home.   You have heard the comments on the floor of the House today, Mr.  Speaker. I have families in my district separated from one another. You  want to talk about uniting families? I have families separated from one  another standing in line to come to this country legally.   I ask you, Mr. Speaker: How many folks have you heard standing up for  my constituents whose families have been separated because they have  been standing in line to get here for more than a year? How many folks  have stood up for them? Not one.   What about those families standing in line 2 years, Mr. Speaker? I  have got them in my district, too.   What about those families who have been separated for 3 years and  standing in line trying to get to America the right way? Who is  standing up for them? I don't hear those calls on the floor of the  House. I have got them in my district, too.   What about 4 years, Mr. Speaker; 5 years, Mr. Speaker; 6 years, Mr.  Speaker? If you wanted to bring your adult child in from Mexico, you  had to file in the 1990s for their number to be coming up today. That  is crazy. It is crazy.   Where is the conversation about reforming the system that got us here  to begin with? I applaud my friend for trying to solve the symptom. I  beg my friend to work with me to cure the disease.   We have a President who can lead us in that direction, Mr. Speaker.  He has the credibility of being tough on borders and he has the heart  of someone who wants to keep families united. We have an opportunity,  Mr. Speaker. We can take it or we can reject it. I believe we are going  to take it.   But that is not for the business today. The business today is an  appropriations process. My friend from Massachusetts called it  unprecedented. He is right. I take no small amount of pleasure in  talking about how right he is. I have been in this body for 7 years and  we don't generally get the appropriations bills done before the end of  the year, Mr. Speaker. Deadlines don't tend to mean anything to us. We  are about to make that happen.   Mr. Speaker, 1997 was the last time Congress funded the government  ahead of schedule, before the deadline. It has taken a continuing  resolution every other year since 1997. We have an opportunity this  year to do it. I don't know if we will take it or not. I hope that we  will.   We can't solve everything every day, but we can solve something every  day. We can make something better for someone every day.   If you support this rule, we will bring to the floor four  appropriations bills and 119 amendments, give or take. We are up in the  Rules Committee right now making even more amendments in order, Mr.  Speaker, to have even more voices be heard, to have even more  opportunity to make a difference for the families that we all represent  back home.   Support this rule. Be proud of this rule. Be proud of the work the  Appropriations Committee did. Mr. Speaker, you don't hear it on the  floor of the House, but it so frustrates me. If you had been in the  Rules Committee last night, you would have seen Democrats and  Republicans sitting side by side talking about the amazing work they  did together on the appropriations  [[Page H6693]]  process in the Appropriations Committee, talking about the great  admiration and respect that they had for one another because of the  work they do together on the Appropriations Committee.   We don't hear that here on the floor of the House, and we should. We  should hear more of that. We should hear more about the good work we  are doing together. If we support this rule, Mr. Speaker, we will get a  chance not to hear about it, but to experience it, to do it.   I know my colleague from Massachusetts and I have another 6, 7, 8  hours of Rules Committee work to do together tonight. I know my  colleague is going to challenge us to do even better than what we are  doing. I am prepared to accept that challenge.   But for today, Mr. Speaker, for this moment, I urge my colleagues to  come to this floor; support this rule; move the appropriations process  forward; finish the appropriations process before the September 30  deadline; and serve your constituents back home, like I know every man  and woman in this Chamber does.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the rule and support for the  underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 500 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec 9. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (HR.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 10. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.

There are 2 minutes  remaining.                                time  1616    So the resolution was agreed to.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 1163, beginning line 23, strike ``such'' and all that       follows through ``That'' on line 8 of page 1164.        Page 1164, beginning line 16, strike the colon and all that       follows before the period at the end of line 24.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Woodall) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment to provide the  maximum flexibility to States that are being asked, under this bill, to  rescind $800 million in an obligated budget authority.   As you know, Mr. Chairman, we put money in a lot of different pots  and send it out to a lot of different places to do a whole lot of good  for a whole lot of people, but when you have a bill that is going to  ask the States to pull back some of that money, historically, we have  limited the ability of States to make those decisions.                                time  2000    With all due respect to anyone's hometown team, I will tell you no  one knows more about how to take care of the safety of the citizens of  Georgia than do the citizens of Georgia and our local elected  officials.   What this amendment would do is allow our local Departments of  Transportation, our State Department of  [[Page H7047]]  Transportation, maximum flexibility in meeting this Federal mandate to  rescind those $800 million worth of unobligated funds.   I ask my colleagues for their support in providing that maximum  flexibility, and I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I commend the gentleman  for offering the amendment. I am compelled to oppose it, in part,  because our authorizers have expressed reservations, at least on our  side, about this amendment.   No one disagrees with giving the States flexibility, but we and the  authorizers, in particular, have some questions about how the  gentleman's amendment would go about providing that flexibility.   The set-asides in the bill reflect the agreement in the FAST Act.  Therefore, before legislating on this, we need to be clear about how  this would work and whether it does, in fact, violate the premises of  the FAST Act and other questions raised by our colleagues.   I suggest a ``no'' vote. I also suggest that we could return to this  and deal with it later once some of these questions might be cleared  up.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am one of those authorizers. I sit on the Transportation Committee,  so I will make myself available to anyone who has questions about the  intent of the Transportation Committee on that measure.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart).   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for bringing  this up. This is something he has done a lot of work on and he knows  this issue very, very well. I think this is a well-done amendment. I  welcome the amendment, and I wholeheartedly support it.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend for those comments.   Again, I want to provide maximum flexibility to what is a very  difficult job, and that is reclaiming those obligated funds from each  one of our districts back home. The question is: Will we trust our  local officials to make the best decisions or will we structure how  those decisions are made here? I trust our local engineers, our local  builders, and our local folks in charge of our public safety.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall).   The amendment was agreed to.   The Acting CHAIR.
