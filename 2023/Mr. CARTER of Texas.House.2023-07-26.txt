 Mr. Chair, I am honored to present the fiscal  year 2024 military construction, veterans affairs, and related agencies  appropriations bill to the House today. This bill is special because it  supports our troops and their families and the Nation's veterans.    The bill provides $17.5 billion for military construction and family  housing projects. This is less than the FY23 enacted amount. However,  it is nearly $800 million above the President's request.   We focus this investment in the Pacific to deter China's aggressive  and coercive actions. We also provide significant funding for new  barracks and child development centers.   The bill fully funds veterans programs at the level requested by the  President. It keeps our promises to veterans, and we do more to help  veterans in the Pacific. We also ensure taxpayer funds will be used  appropriately and effectively by increasing oversight of several  programs.   I thank my subcommittee ranking member. Although she disagrees with  this bill, she has been a joy to work with, and our partnership has  been good.   I thank all the people who have worked on this bill and all of their  families and the families of the veterans.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4366.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Rutherford), a member of the Appropriations  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Georgia (Ms. Greene).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition,  although I am not opposed.    Mr. Chair, I support the amendment, and I urge  its adoption.   Mr. Chair, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, the NATO Security Investment Program  is NATO's military construction program. The U.S. contribution supports  projects needed by the alliance and also supports U.S. strategy in the  region. It does not finance other countries' construction costs, and  the cost share is favorable to the United States.   The increase included in the bill this year is needed to reinvest in  infrastructure in the region to deter Russia's aggression. Literally,  this program is a concrete investment in deterrence.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I yield 2  minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, my arguments are the same.   The NATO Security Investment Program is NATO's military construction  program. The $73 million increase this year is needed to reinvest in  infrastructure in the region to deter Russian aggression.  [[Page H3994]]    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.

Madam Chair, I understand the intent and that  some States permit the use of marijuana. However, the VA doctors are  required to comply with Federal law. This amendment does not address  that. I don't want to put them in legal jeopardy. I believe this should  be handled by the authorizing committee.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
