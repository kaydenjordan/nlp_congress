 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Edwardsville High School's baseball team on their Class 4A  State championship.   Edwardsville played Saint Charles North for the title last week,  going into extra innings before the Tigers won it all 3-2, claiming  their third State championship in school history and their first since  1998.   With a 37 win and 5 loss season record, Edwardsville came to the  championship game ready to win. At the bottom of the seventh inning,  Saint Charles had a 2-1 lead with the bases loaded and no outs.   Thanks to a double play, the Tigers tied the game 2-2 and sent the  game into extra innings. In the top of the eighth inning, the Tigers  stole second base and later laid down a bunt, which led to a close play  at the plate, allowing the Tigers to score the winning run.   When the Tigers took the field that morning, Coach Tim Funkhouser had  699 career wins. After the game, he came home with number 700 and a  State championship.   What a way to hit 700 wins in your career. I congratulate Coach  Funkhouser and the entire Edwardsville Tiger baseball team on a  fantastic season and a well-deserved win.                  Recognizing Adoption Lawyer Ellyn Bullock     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Ellyn Bullock, a lawyer from Champaign, Illinois, who specializes in  adoption. She has been nominated to be an Angels in Adoption honoree by  the 2019 Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute.   Since 1999, Ellyn has finalized the adoptions of more than 1,800  children. More than half were in the Illinois foster care system and  ultimately found permanent homes.   She has won the Catholic Charities Friend of Adoption award and has  been recognized multiple times by associations for her advocacy of  family values and adoptions outside the office.   Ellyn and her husband, David, are proud parents of three children:  Kyle, Imy, and Charlie. They adopted Kyle  [[Page H5592]]  and Imy and have acted as guardians of another child.   A stable and permanent family is perhaps the most important thing in  a child's developing life. Every day, we rely on people like Ellyn to  unite families and improve lives. I applaud Ellyn for all of her hard  work and for her fighting for families in the 13th District of  Illinois.                            ____________________
