 Mr. President, today I wish to express my  disappointment that David Stras was confirmed to serve on the Eight  Circuit Court of Appeals.   Mr. Stras's nomination should not have made it to the Senate floor.  For over a century, the Senate Judiciary Committee has used the blue  slip process to ensure that the White House fulfills its constitutional  duty to seek the Senate's advice and consent for judicial nominations.  Traditionally, a nominee received a committee hearing only if both of  their home State Senators returned their blue slips to the committee.  Despite receiving only one blue slip, Mr. Stras was granted a hearing,  and his nomination was sent to the Senate floor for a vote. I am  extremely disappointed that my colleagues are abandoning long-standing  practices in order to fill the judiciary with conservative ideologues.   Moreover, Mr. Stras is yet another judicial nominee selected for this  administration by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society.  His name was on President Trump's Supreme Court shortlist, and although  he was not selected to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, outside dark  money PACS spent millions of dollars running ads in support of his  nomination to this seat. These facts should alarm every American. Our  judiciary system, under the Trump administration, is being outsourced  to outside organizations with unlimited financial resources that are  not accountable to voters.   I urge my colleagues to return to regular order.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am introducing the Carryover  Equity Act of 2018 to eliminate the 20 percent carryover limitation  which is an impediment to flexibility and effective financial planning  of the 1890s Extension Program. The 1890s Extension Program is  administered by the USDA's National Institute of Food and Agriculture  (NIFA) and is a capacity funding program supporting extension  activities at 1890 Land-Grant Universities. Its intent is to increase  and strengthen agricultural sciences at the 1890s through the effective  integration of education, research and extension programs.   My State is the home of the University of Maryland Eastern Shore  (UMES), Maryland's only 1890 Land-Grant University and one of the  State's four Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).  UMES, along with the University of Maryland College Park, form the  University of Maryland Extension--a statewide educational organization  funded by Federal, State, and local governments that brings research- based knowledge directly to communities throughout the ``Old Line''  State. The mission of University of Maryland Extension is to educate  citizens to apply practical, research-based knowledge to critical  issues facing individuals, families, communities, the State of  Maryland, and its global partners.   In Maryland, the 1890 Extension Program is headquartered at UMES in  Princess Anne, MD and extension programming at the University focuses  on 4-H STEM; nutrition and health; seafood technology; small farm  outreach; and small ruminant research. The UMES program is targeted to  diverse audiences on the agriculturally important Eastern Shore with  special emphasis on those with limited resources to help them improve  their quality of life and to successfully pursue a career in  agriculture.   Mr. President, current law limits the funding amount an 1890  institution may carry over in any fiscal year to 20 percent of the  1890s Extension Program funding received. This prohibition creates  significant impediments for 1890 institutions to carry out their  mission to deliver programs to customers and clientele and restricts  the ability of 1890 institutions to efficiently and effectively manage  their funding. No other USDA/NIFA capacity program has a similar 20  percent carryover limitation. By eliminating this 20 percent  limitation, via the Carryover Equity Act, the 1890s Extension Program  will have the same funding flexibility found in the other major  capacity programs administered by NIFA. This bill has the strong  support of 1890 institution Presidents as well as the Association of  Public & Land-Grant Universities.   I am pleased to be joined in introducing this bill by Senators  Perdue, Brown, Tillis, Cardin, Coons, Graham, Manchin and Kaine who,  like me, recognize the value 1890 land grant institutions bring to the  rural communities of our States and the research and technical support  these institutions provide to our socially disadvantaged, and veteran  farmer, and rancher constituents with limited resources. I look forward  to working together with Senate and House colleagues to see that this  important legislation is included in the next Farm Bill.                                  ______                                         By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Manchin, and Mrs. Ernst):   S. 2386. A bill to provide additional protections for our veterans;  to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
