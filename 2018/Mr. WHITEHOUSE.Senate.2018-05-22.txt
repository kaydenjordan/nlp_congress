 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in this, my 20th speech about the  climate changes and ocean changes being driven by fossil fuels, I would  like to discuss America's largest oil company, ExxonMobil.   For decades, ExxonMobil did everything in its power to deceive the  American public about the existence and causes of climate change. I  believe that full transparency would show ExxonMobil and its agents  still obstructing efforts here in Washington to resolve the climate  crisis, but I want to focus on one particular audience I believe Exxon  has long misled--its shareholders. An Exxon CEO once went so far as to  cite a bogus scientists petition to his shareholders--yes, that  infamous ``petition'' cooked up by climate deniers that included  cartoon characters and Spice Girls among the scientists.   For decades, Exxon investors have filed resolutions at shareholder  meetings starting back as far as 1990 urging ExxonMobil to address  climate and sustainability issues. Exxon succeeded in quashing every  single one of them--quashing more than 40 shareholder resolutions in  total, year after year--until last year.   At last year's meeting, big institutional investors like BlackRock  threw their weight behind a resolution requiring Exxon to produce an  annual report explaining how it will be affected by climate change and  global efforts to protect us against climate change. Again, Exxon  fiercely opposed this resolution, but this time Exxon lost. The  resolution passed with 62 percent of the vote.   That gave Exxon some serious questions to answer: As the world  transitions to a low-carbon economy, how much oil and gas does Exxon  think we will need? How might declining demand for oil and gas affect  Exxon's operations and bottom line? Will it be economical to produce  all of the reserves currently listed on Exxon's books? Most  significantly, can we burn all Exxon's reserves and not damage the  planet?   Well, Exxon's inaugural climate risk report is out--I have been  through it--and it looks to me like they are still playing hide the  ball. It looks to me like a report that started with the conclusion  that Exxon can develop all its reserves and then back-calculated the  assumptions necessary to get to that conclusion. Let's have a look.   Scientists tell us that we must limit global warming to no more than  2 degrees Celsius if we are to avoid catastrophic changes to the planet  we inhabit. Many believe that to keep a margin of safety, we actually  need to target 1.5 degrees.   There is an article that just came out today headlined ``Limiting  warming to 1.5 degree C would save majority of global species from  climate change.'' To quote the article, it would ``avoid half the risks  associated with warming of 2 degrees C.'' So there is a big difference  of outcomes between 2 degrees Centigrade and 1.5 degrees Centigrade,  and it will affect innumerable species on our planet.   Well, in its report, Exxon doesn't address the 1.5 degrees scenario;  it goes with 2 degrees.   Exxon's report goes on to say that its roughly 20 billion oil- equivalent barrels of reserves ``face little risk'' from efforts to  meet the 2 degrees scenario. Exxon also says it is ``confident'' about  roughly 71 billion not-yet-proven oil-equivalent barrels that it  reports to its shareholders as assets. It claims that no more than 5  percent of these unproven resources will be rendered uneconomical by  measures to protect us against climate change.   Exxon's report obviously gets to the result management wants: to tell  shareholders that basically all its listed assets are recoverable. But  look at the assumptions required to arrive at that conclusion beyond  the 2-degree assumption.   One assumption is huge amounts of carbon capture and sequestration,  what is called CCS. CCS is technology where carbon emissions are  contained at the site where the fossil fuel is burned and then captured  and buried far underground. This prospect exists but barely exists now.  Its future development is something that is projected by the  International Energy Agency.   This graphic shows the projection by the International Energy Agency  of the various elements that will reduce carbon pollution in the  future.   The top one is efficiency gains, burning less because of better  insulation and so forth, because motors become more efficient.   This green one is all the contribution to carbon reduction of  renewable energy.  [[Page S2840]]    This bottom, dark-blue segment is what the International Energy  Agency attributes to CCS, carbon capture and sequestration.   For its report, ExxonMobil assumed deployment of CCS technology as  much as five times greater by 2040--this year depicted right here--five  times greater than the IEA's projection. If you take IEA's CCS  projection and you quintuple it, you get carbon savings that exceed  everything IEA projects from efficiency and renewables combined. That  is quite an assumption. CCS is actually very expensive, and all it  produces is carbon reduction. You still have to run the fossil fuel- burning powerplant to make the power, and then, on top of that, you add  the carbon capture and sequestration technology that can add $1 billion  to the price of the equipment.   So here is Lazard's comparison of various kinds of energy costs. This  bottom one is solar. Per megawatt hour, it runs $46 to $61--pretty  efficient. This is onshore wind--$32 to $62 per megawatt hour produced.  This is natural gas; it runs from $48 to $78. Then you add on $25, more  or less, per megawatt hour for carbon capture and sequestration, and  now you have a very expensive product--about $100 per megawatt hour  compared to $46 to $61, for instance, for solar.   If that is the case, it is a little surprising because you would  think that renewables would do better than CCS because they come out  far more cheaply. So how do you get to an assumption of a world in  which CCS outcompetes renewables? It seems improbable, given the  pricing, that CCS will roar ahead of renewables, let alone ahead of  renewables and efficiency combined. If that were true, what a booming  market CCS would be to invest in.   So let's test Exxon's CCS assumption against Exxon's own investment  behavior. If Exxon truly saw carbon capture and sequestration as the  magic bullet to allow it to produce all its oil and gas reserves, you  would expect that it would put its money where its mouth is, but Exxon  barely even mentions CCS in its 2017 10-K filing for investors. There  is one tiny mention right here under its ``Risk Factors'' section. Risk  factors.   If you look at Exxon's announced investments in the United States  this year--$50 billion worth--it makes no mention of any new  investments in carbon capture and sequestration. If Exxon really  believed that CCS was going to boom like that, bigger than renewables,  why not invest more? My hypothesis is that they don't believe that,  that this was just an assumption backed into this report to make it  look as if Exxon was going to be able to protect and use all of its  reserves to get to the foreordained conclusion.   Exxon's report omits another fact about CCS: that this developing  technology will likely see most use with gas-fired powerplants, as my  previous graphic showed. It likely cannot be used to capture Exxon's  products' emissions in the transportation and chemical sectors. Power  generation accounts for only about one-seventh of total demand for oil  and gas, and that share is predicted to fall. Even if it doesn't fall,  that still leaves six-sevenths where it is hard to see a carbon capture  and sequestration offset. Exxon's report does not describe where  exactly this massive deployment of carbon capture and sequestration  will take place, but I can assure you it will not be on auto tailpipes.   Let's move on from CCS.   A second odd assumption in Exxon's report is the growth rate Exxon  predicts for renewable energy. Exxon claims that renewables will grow  only by 4.5 percent annually through 2040. Well, the IEA, the  International Energy Agency, reports that in 2017--the year we just  went through--renewable energy actually grew by 6.3 percent. Well, 6.3  percent is the actual, and they assume it will grow only at 4.5  percent. And that 6.3 percent occurred with massive global subsidies  still giving huge advantages to fossil fuel. If you go down the street  to Exxon's rival BP, BP predicts that renewables growth will average  6.5 percent annually through 2040.    Exxon claims--although we who live here know it is not true--to  support a price on carbon that would obviously lower fossil fuel's huge  subsidy advantage, that would give renewables a fairer shot, and that  would presumably accelerate renewables growth above the 2017 rate of  6.3 percent.   Is Exxon's low-growth assumption realistic for renewable energy?  Well, new solar and wind energy products are already becoming more  economical than existing coal plants, as we just saw in Colorado. New  solar and wind projects now compete on price with new natural gas  plants, as a recent auction in Arizona showed. The cost trajectory for  renewables continues steeply downward.   This downward curve is the cost of centralized solar power, like  those big arrays of mirrors that focus solar on a generator. This  steeply downward curve is the downward curve of photovoltaic, the types  of arrays that go out on their own in fields or on rooftops. This is  the downward curve of offshore wind energy, and this is the downward  curve of onshore wind energy. All of these renewable sources are on a  steep downward trajectory. So why would growth slow?   Here, again, Exxon made an assumption that does not seem plausible,  but the assumption does help it arrive at its desired conclusion that  it can develop essentially all its assets.   Here is a third questionable Exxon assumption. Exxon predicts that  the market for electric cars and trucks will grow slowly, if at all.  Exxon assumes that by 2040 only 160 million out of roughly 2 billion  cars--just 8 percent of the automobile fleet--will be electric  vehicles. By contrast, the IEA predicts that roughly twice that many  cars will be electric by 2040. Most other projections I have seen are  even more bullish for electric vehicles, like this one from Bloomberg,  which predicts well over 400 million electric vehicles by 2040. Indeed,  just the new sales in these 4 years exceed the entire market prediction  of electric vehicles for ExxonMobil.   Stanford economist Tony Seba studies economic disruptions. He is fond  of showing two photos of Fifth Avenue in New York City. In this photo,  taken in 1900, you see the parade of traffic on Fifth Avenue. If you  look, you will see that every single one of those vehicles is pulled by  a horse, except one. There is one vehicle right here with an engine in  it. It is 1900, and the entire street is filled with horse-drawn  carriages, with just one vehicle in that street scene.   Cut forward to 1913, and Fifth Avenue is again filled with vehicles,  only this time it is hard to find a horse. There is a vehicle right  here that looks as though it is a carriage, and there may be a horse  behind this vehicle. But other than that, all of the vehicles that you  see are gasoline powered.   In just 13 years, the automotive world, the travel world changed,  illustrating Dr. Seba's point that major economic disruptions can take  place in remarkably little time. Think cell phone and landline, if you  want a modern example.   There is a lot of evidence that electric vehicles present just this  sort of economic and technological disruption. Governments in major  auto markets like France and the United Kingdom have announced the end  of internal combustion vehicle sales by 2040. China, the world's  largest car market, recently announced that by 2025, 20 percent of new  cars sold there must run on alternative fuels, and it is on its way to  an eventual total ban of the sale of gasoline- and diesel-powered cars.  Japan, the world's fourth largest car market, now has more electric  charging stations than gas stations. India, the fifth largest car  market, has announced that by 2030, all new cars sold there must be  electric or hybrid. Electric cars are cheaper to build, to operate, and  to repair, and they can provide supercar performance in everyday  vehicles.   Moving on from regular automobiles and into the commercial fleet,  Exxon makes the further assumption that no commercial transportation-- no buses, no trucks--will be electrified by 2040. Never mind that  electric buses are already in use in China, Germany, France, the United  States, and many other countries. Rhode Island's public transit agency  is going out to bid for electric buses right now. An American  manufacturer asserts that once electric buses get 10 percent market  share, complete transition to electric becomes inevitable. Just last  year, the city of Shenzhen in China replaced its entire fleet of more  than 16,000 buses with electric ones. Almost 20 percent of buses across  China are already electric.  [[Page S2841]]  There are now almost 400,000 electric buses on the road worldwide.  Tesla recently announced plans to produce 100,000 electric trucks per  year by 2023.   Well, maybe everyone else is wrong and Exxon is right, but it sure  looks as though Exxon investors aren't getting the complete story from  this report. It looks as though they are getting the assumptions that  produce the answer that Exxon wants. Cars and commercial transportation  account for more than 50 percent of the demand for oil and gas, so if  Exxon fudged this assumption, that has big consequences for the  conclusion Exxon reaches that all will be well with its reserves.   Stack up all those assumptions--that 2 degrees is the right climate  threshold, that CCS will boom and even impact gasoline markets, that  renewable energy growth will slow rather than accelerate, and that  electric vehicles will be a bust. It takes all of those assumptions  piled together to get to Exxon's desired result. It looks and smells  bogus. If you don't believe me, let me leave you with one last chart.   Rystad Energy is an international energy consulting firm widely used  and respected in the energy industry. 2C Energy is an American firm  looking at how oil companies' resources and reserves fare as we face  climate risks. Rystad and 2C worked together to develop this carbon  consumption budget for various oil and gas and energy companies using,  by the way, the more generous 2-degrees scenario for global warming. So  we will spot them the 2 degrees, but it would obviously be different if  it were only 1.5.   This is ExxonMobil right here. The study shows that ExxonMobil, in  their best case scenario--this upper scenario--is able to extract and  burn only 82 percent of its oil and gas assets. The other 18 percent  would be left unused or stranded--stranded assets.   But wait. If you look at this scenario where methane leakage is  allowed to continue from oil and gas drilling, which, by the way, is  exactly what Exxon and others are encouraging Scott Pruitt to allow and  where CCS technology is not significantly deployed, then this scenario  here leaves 39 percent of Exxon's assets stranded. That is 39 percent  of all assets stranded versus what Exxon claims, which is that 5  percent of unproven resources might be. By the way, again, that 39  percent stranding is based on 2 degrees of warming, not the more  prudent 1.5 degrees, which would require less development of those  resources.   Well, Exxon's 2018 shareholder meeting comes up next week, and the  investors who did such a great job with last year's climate resolution  should take a look at this report and not be satisfied. There are some  questions that need to be answered. Even a former senior Exxon  executive has criticized Exxon's climate risk report as flawed and  insufficiently detailed. In an op-ed for CNBC, the former executive,  Bill Hafker, writes that ``oil and gas companies must take Paris  climate targets seriously'' and says that investors should be  dissatisfied with Exxon's climate risk report because it doesn't do  this.   If Exxon, in fact, started with the answer it wanted and worked  backward to plug in whatever array of unlikely assumptions would get  them that foreordained answer, well, then BlackRock and other  institutional investors who forced this report should demand that Exxon  do better.   Earlier this year, BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink wrote to the CEOs of  the companies in which BlackRock invests. He urged them to ``serve a  social purpose.'' He urged them to ``make a positive contribution to  society.'' Well, where the underlying issue is as vital as the  stability of our climate and oceans and where the company involved is  as immense as ExxonMobil, cooking the numbers not only harms investors,  it is a full-on hazard to human society.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
