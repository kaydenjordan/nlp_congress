 Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, first, I thank my friend, Chairman Price,  for working with me to include a number  [[Page H5053]]  of provisions important to Members on both sides of the aisle.   Mr. Chair, I congratulate Mr. Meadows for his amendment to help  unmanned aircraft manufacturers, one of our most important and  innovative transportation sectors.   I also thank Mr. Graves and Mr. Scalise on their tireless work on  behalf of their constituents to help them recover from devastating  hurricanes and floods.   Mr. Burchett has a great amendment that increases funding for highway  and bridge infrastructure.   Also, Mr. Chair, I want to mention Mr. Calvert and Mr. Cook. They  have cosponsored an amendment to address an issue that is critical to  Amtrak employees in their districts.   Finally, I congratulate Mr. Smith of New Jersey for his tireless  advocacy for veterans housing, as he always does.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, liquefied natural gas is a major  component of domestic U.S. energy growth, and it is facilitating the  export of U.S. natural gas around the world.   Railroads have been successfully moving flammable gases for 100  years. As a matter of fact, Transport Canada already allows LNG on rail  and tank cars. So this provision would put us at a huge disadvantage  with our largest trading partner.   Furthermore, DOT always conducts a thorough, comprehensive, and  transparent safety evaluation, accounting for public input and, again,  before allowing for transportation of any hazardous material.   This amendment would block a proven process at DOT and would inhibit  U.S. LNG from meeting growing markets, the demand from growing markets  for cleaner--again, cleaner--and more affordable energy.   And again, Mr. Chairman, this is another important point. Currently,  this is moved by trucks. They are all over the country, trucks moving  LNG. And so, obviously, the question is: Are rails less safe than  moving this on trucks? Obviously, the answer, I would say, is no.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I would just remind everyone that  there are trucks with natural gas right in Florida and in, pretty much,  every State around the Nation.   Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Kevin Hern).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I find it ironic that some of the same folks who are  concerned about climate change and global warming want to make it so  difficult to transport things that actually lower emissions compared to  other sources of energy.   Mr. Chair, I ask for a ``yes'' vote on the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, again, I want to first thank Mr. Vargas,  not for this amendment, but for his leadership and for his support of  immigrants. He has done that for many, many years, and I thank him for  that. But I want to make some things clear.   There is no DACA policy related to FHA-backed mortgages. As a matter  of fact, there has been no change in policy. FHA's published policy  states that non-U.S. citizens without formal lawful residency are not  eligible for FHA-insured loans.   Again, this is not a new policy. This was the policy during the  previous administration. This was the policy when Secretary Castro was  Secretary of HUD. It has been in place since the previous  administration. There has been no change.   Mr. Chair, obviously, I don't question the motives of the gentleman,  whom I have great respect for, and I once again thank him for his  concern on this issue. If I have some concern, it is the fact that this  may let some people believe, those folks out there who are DACA  recipients, that, all of a sudden, they have this new protection, which  this amendment does not give them.   Mr. Chair, I have no real objection other than to the fact that this  really doesn't do anything. But I do appreciate my friend for his years  of leadership and of care. Again, I don't have a real objection. This  amendment just doesn't do anything.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I want to add what I said before, that  there has been no change in policy. This was the same policy that was  there during the previous administration. Again, that does not take  away my great respect for the gentleman who is introducing this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, first, I understand what the gentleman  is trying to do, and I respect him for that. But I think Chairman Price  has set the right threshold for BUILD planning grants.   More money going to planning could potentially, frankly, mean less  money for infrastructure for actual projects. That is particularly true  if, as I fear, when there is a top-line number agreed to by the House,  Senate, and the White House, the number that Chairman Price is going to  have to work with might be less than what he is working with today,  making his job a lot more difficult.   Again, I understand what the gentleman is trying to do. I have said  it publicly and I have said it privately: I think Chairman Price has  done a great job and has got a good balance. Therefore, even though I  understand what the gentleman is trying to do, I respectfully have to  oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, again, after hearing the chairman, who  is always willing to work with colleagues--again, I just understand the  difficult task that he has ahead of him, but it is an issue that, as  the chairman himself has said, he will continue to work on and with  that--I understand where Mr. Garcia is coming from. Also, I know that  he understands that this is a very difficult balance that the chairman  has to deal with. I look forward to continuing to work with the  chairman.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I don't object at all to the program  that the gentleman is supporting with an increase. I think he has  mentioned why, and I would agree with what he has stated.   The problem that I have is not with the program he is trying to  increase. The part that I object to is where the cuts are coming from,  where he is obtaining the money, and that is cuts to transit bus and  bus facilities.   We have had a lot of Members who were supporting funding for transit  bus and bus facilities. I believe it is over a dozen Members who have  actually written support letters for that program that this amendment,  unfortunately, reduces funding from. That provides vital resources and  mobility in urban areas. It is crucial to a number of urban areas  around the country.   So, as I said before in other amendments, I think Chairman Price has  struck the right balance in determining funding for this program. I  think what the gentleman is trying to do in his amendment is  meritorious. I would, however, say that taking it out of transit bus  money and bus facility money is not the place to do it. Obviously, I  know that Chairman Price will continue to work with the gentleman as  the process goes along, regardless of what happens with this amendment.  [[Page H5067]]    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, on rollcall No. 400, I mistakenly voted  ``no'' when I intended to vote ``yes''                   Amendment No. 235 Offered by Mr. Duncan
