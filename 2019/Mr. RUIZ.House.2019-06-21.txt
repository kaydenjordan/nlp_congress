 Madam Speaker, I rise to urge a vote on my bill, the  Humanitarian Standards for Individuals in Customs and Border Protection  Custody Act, an all-American, value-based, comprehensive public health  approach to help CBP address the basic humanitarian needs of children  and families under their custody and responsibility.   When I visited our southern border, I saw overworked agents and the  meltdown of a system that is understaffed, under-equipped, under- resourced, under-trained, and under-skilled to meet the humanitarian  needs of children and families.   That is why my bill identifies humanitarian standards on water,  sanitation, hygiene, nutrition, and shelter missing from the  administration's emergency supplemental budget request.   My bill requires a clearly defined medical screening for all  individuals in CBP custody, and identifies priority groups, like  children and seniors, who should receive their screenings within 3  hours of being detained by CBP.   It identifies how many calories a pregnant woman or a child should be  given each day, for example, and it requires that CBP provide  toothbrushes and diapers, the chance to bathe at least once a day, and  meets everyone's basic daily need to drink enough water.   Madam Speaker, I urge my fellow representatives to support these  straightforward reforms to prevent the deaths of children, and ensure  our treatment of women, children, and families seeking asylum is  consistent with the basic principles of human dignity.                            ____________________
