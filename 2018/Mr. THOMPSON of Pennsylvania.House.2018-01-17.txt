 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Emporium Borough Mayor Bruno Carnovale on his upcoming  retirement after more than 50 years of service to the community.   Mayor Carnovale first served as a council person for 18 years, then  as civil service chairperson for the Emporium Borough Police Department  for 4 years, and, most recently, as mayor beginning in 1988.   It was 1966 when Bruno Carnovale ran for office with the goal of  finding a solution to continual flooding problems near Oak Street. He  stuck around long after that goal was achieved.   Mayor Carnovale grew up in Johnsonburg, but he has had connections to  Emporium since spending childhood summers working on his grandfather's  farm. After high school graduation, he moved to Emporium and briefly  went to work for Sylvania before joining the Navy during World War II.  After the war, he returned to Sylvania and became a senior electrical  designer, certified electrical inspector, and master electrician.   Mayor Carnovale has been active with The American Legion, Lions Club,  Cameron County Republican Committee, the American Cancer Society, and  he is an active member of St. Mark's Church.   Mr. Speaker, I wish him the best in his well-deserved retirement, and  I thank him for his service.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding.   What an outstanding turnout tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here tonight and participate in this  Special Order to celebrate the sanctity of human life and redouble my  commitment to protecting the most vulnerable among us: the unborn.   I want to thank Congressman Chris Smith for hosting this opportunity  tonight. He has certainly been a champion of the pro-life moment, and  this week marks the 45th anniversary of Roe V. Wade, the Supreme Court  decision that set constitutional precedent on the issue of abortion.   That decision also ignited the pro-life movement, which was already  taking shape.   And this movement will be witnessed on Friday, when more than 100,000  pro-lifers from across the country will come to Washington, D.C. for  the 45th annual March for Life. This year's theme is ``Love Saves  Lives.''   And, Mr. Speaker, it surely does.   Thanks to the pro-life movement, abortion rates across the country  are at the lowest since 2013.   Proudly, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania remains one of the top  protective states in the nation to provide legal protections for human  life from conception to natural death, according to Americans United  for Life.   From 2015 to 2016, we saw a 3 percent decline in abortions in  Pennsylvania, and these statics reflect important Pennsylvania State  laws, such as, the ban on sex-selection abortion.   These figures are certainly welcome news, but the fight is not over  and there is more work to be done.   I know this House will continue to work tirelessly at the federal  level to put the health and safety of women and children first. Pro- life education and legislative efforts are making an impact on our  culture and in the lives of women facing unexpected pregnancies.   We must always be a voice for the voiceless. And we must continue to  build a culture that values life and respects mothers and their  children.   I am proud to be part of this movement and I thank every individual  here tonight for their commitment to this important cause.   Because we all know that ``Love Saves Lives.''   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.                            ____________________
