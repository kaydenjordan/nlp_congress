 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, having taken my seat in this Congress on behalf of the  citizens of the Ninth District only last week, I am experiencing  already that the majority is prone to theater, in this case, a show  vote for which the majority lacks the two-thirds necessary to override  a promised Presidential veto.   It is the first time I have had an opportunity to vote on it, so I  will take the opportunity to declare the southern border is indeed an  emergency because Democrats have sundered and blocked effective border  protection, border security, for over 30 years.   It is not the emergency that is fake; it is this futile vote. It is  the sudden, professed concern for men and women of our armed services.   We saw it yesterday, the majority's concern for our armed services,  when it preferred electronic medical records for illegals over EMR for  our vets. Our servicemembers know who is protecting their interests and  who has their backs.   As for me, I am with the President.
