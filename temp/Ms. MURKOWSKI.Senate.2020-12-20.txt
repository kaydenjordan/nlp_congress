 Mr. President, I rise today to address equitable  treatment in Native healthcare. When the Senate Committee on Indian  Affairs considered S. 3650, the companion bill to H.R. 6535, I noted  the strong history of Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians working  together to ensure that there is parity in Federal policy for all  Native peoples. Enactment of H.R. 6535 will address the lack of parity  in Federal urban Indian health programs, and by sending this bill to  the President, the Senate is making a necessary correction that will  support delivery of healthcare to Native communities across the  country. But, as we pass this measure, we must not forget that a lack  of parity continues to persist for the Native Hawaiian healthcare  Systems funded through the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act.  I am therefore committed to standing with Senator Schatz to ensure that  Native Hawaiian healthcare systems are not left behind and will work  with him to address the inequitable access to Federal Tort Claims Act  coverage among Native health systems in the next Congress. Together, we  will continue to fight for the trust and treaty rights and access to  benefits for all of our country's Native peoples.                            ____________________
