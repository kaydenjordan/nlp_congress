 Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this brazen political  stunt.   Qasem Soleimani was a vicious terrorist who built a cult following on  the backs of dead Americans. He armed Hezbollah, KH, and other Iranian  proxies who killed American troops and our allies throughout the Middle  East. The Homeland Security and Defense Departments have kept close  watch on his terror campaigns for years.   Soleimani was not visiting Baghdad because it was a great holiday  destination. He was there to meet the leader of a terrorist group that  killed an American just days before.   Our President used the law and his constitutional authority as  Commander in Chief to eliminate this terrorist mastermind before he  could kill again.   Democrats immediately responded by doubting our intelligence and  dismissing the expertise of our military leaders. Now they bring this  resolution to the floor that maligns our President, undermines our  national security, and makes a martyr of a man who killed nearly 600  Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.
