 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Lowey for yielding to  me.   I rise in support of an amendment that includes a provision I  coauthored with Representative Panetta to send a clear message to this  administration that our public lands are not for sale.   We will not put the interests of Big Oil over our people and sit idly  by as the Trump administration seeks to open up the Carrizo Plain  National Monument and other public lands in my district for oil and gas  development.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
