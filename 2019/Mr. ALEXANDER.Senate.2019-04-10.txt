 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with  respect to the Morales nomination, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call be waived.    Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that a copy of  my opening statement at the Subcommittee on Energy and Water  Development's budget hearing for the Corps of Engineers and Bureau of  Reclamation's fiscal year 2020 budget request be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:             Corps of Engineers Fiscal Year 2020 Budget Request          First, I would like to thank our witnesses       for being here today, and also Senator Feinstein, with whom I       have the pleasure to work with again this year to draft the       Energy and Water Appropriations bill.        Our witnesses today include: R.D. James, Assistant       Secretary of the Army for Civil Works; Lieutenant General       Todd Semonite, Chief of Engineers for the U.S. Army Corps of       Engineers; Brenda Burman, Commissioner for the Bureau of       Reclamation at the Department of the Interior; and Timothy R.       Petty, Ph.D., Assistant Secretary for Water and Science at       the Department of the Interior.        Based on the number of appropriations requests we receive       each year, the Corps of Engineers is the federal government's       most popular agency. Because this is so important to many       Senators, Senator Feinstein and I have provided record level       funding in a regular appropriations bill for the last four       years.        The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers touches the lives of       almost every American. The Corps maintains our inland       waterways, it deepens and keeps our ports open, and its dams       provide emission-free, renewable hydroelectric energy. The       Corps also manages river levels to help prevent flooding.       This year record rainfall caused the Missouri River to       experience historic flooding, devastating parts of Iowa,       Nebraska and Missouri.        I can recall when, after the Missouri and Mississippi       rivers flooded in 2011, a room full of Senators showed up at       a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing to       ask what went wrong and what went right with disaster relief       efforts. So, there's a real interest in what the Corps does.        So, last year, Senator Feinstein and I worked together to       provide record funding for the Corps of Engineers--a total of       $7 billion. However, this year, the president's budget       request only includes $4.8 billion for the Corps--a dramatic       reduction in spending. In my opinion, we should spend more,       not less, on our nation's water infrastructure.        Today I will focus my questions on four main areas:        1. Making our nation's water infrastructure a priority and       properly funding our inland waterways system;        2. Adequately funding our nation's ports and harbors;        3. Making sure the Corps has the resources it needs to       respond to flooding and make repairs so they can continue to       manage river levels, and;        4. Using a more common-sense approach to making decisions       about which projects receive funding by looking at the       ``remaining benefit to cost ratio'' of an ongoing project.       Today, because of Office of Management and Budget rules, the       Corps has to pretend a project is not already under       construction when the Corps decides which projects will       receive funding each year. This does not make any sense, and       makes it harder to complete projects on time and on budget.        In 2012, Senator Graham, Senator Feinstein, and I said,       ``Let's ask what would a great country, the United States,       want from its ports, locks, dams, and waterways in order to       fully maximize them for our economic growth.''        We asked everyone to focus first on what needed to be done       and not get bogged down in the difficulties of how to pay for       it. From these discussions, Congress took three important       steps, focusing on properly funding our inland waterways       system.        First, Congress passed a law that reduced the amount of       money that comes from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund to       replace Olmsted Lock, a project in Illinois and Kentucky that       was soaking up almost all of the money that was available for       inland waterway projects.        Second, we worked with the commercial waterways industry to       establish a priority list for projects that needed to be       funded, on which Chickamauga ranks near the top, in fourth       place.        And third, we enacted a user fee increase that commercial       barge owners asked to pay in order to provide additional       funds to replace locks and dams across the country, including       Chickamauga Lock.        These steps increased the amount of funding that was       available for inland waterways projects from about $85       million in fiscal year 2014 to $105 million in fiscal year       2020. And Congress has followed through by appropriating all       of the user fees that have been collected in the last five       years. The user fees that are paid into the Inland Waterways       Trust Fund by waterway users are matched with federal       dollars, which allow the Corps of Engineers to make       significant progress to address the backlog of work on our       inland waterways.        But despite knowing the Inland Waterways Trust Fund would       have $105 million available for fiscal year 2020, the       Administration's budget is only proposing to spend $55.5       million--which leaves 47% of these funds sitting unspent in a       Treasury account. Then we would not be spending the money for       the intended purpose. And despite not spending the entire       $105 million in user fees from commercial barges, the       administration's budget also includes a new user fee for       inland waterways that would raise another $1.8 billion over a       10-year window.  [[Page S2381]]         I do not think this is a responsible approach. It makes no       sense to ask barge owners to pay more in fees when the       administration is not even proposing to spend all the fees we       are collecting today. The budget also only proposes to fund a       single project using Inland Waterways Trust Fund revenues,       the Lower Monongahela, and eliminates funding for the other       two projects that have been funded for construction for the       last five years--Kentucky Lock and Chickamauga Lock.        I can't count the number of times that the head of the       Corps--including General Semonite--has told me that it makes       no sense to start and stop construction. It's not an       efficient way to build projects and it is a waste of taxpayer       money. Replacing Chickamauga Lock is important to all of       Tennessee and if Chickamauga Lock closes, it will throw       150,000 more trucks onto 1-75. Funding for construction of       the new Chickamauga Lock has been provided for the past five       years so it does not make sense for the administration to not       include the project in the budget request. This year's budget       proposal is a huge step backwards for our nation's inland       waterways.        We have done a good job providing record level funding over       the last five years to adequately fund our nation's harbors,       including Mobile Harbor in Alabama; Savannah Harbor in       Georgia; and Long Beach Harbor in California; and many others       across the country. Six years ago, Congress took a look at       the need to provide more funding for our nation's ports and       harbors to ensure we can compete with other harbors around       the world. We realized that the government was spending only       a fraction of the taxes each year that were collected in the       Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund for our ports and harbors,       resulting in billions of dollars of unspent funds just       sitting in a bank account that got bigger and bigger each       year.        In fact, unlike the Inland Waterways Trust Fund--which has       virtually no balance in the trust fund--the Harbor       Maintenance Trust Fund has an unspent balance of over $9       billion today. To provide more funding for our ports and       harbors, Congress enacted spending targets for the Harbor       Maintenance Trust Fund in the Water Resources Reform and       Development Act of 2014 that were meant to make us spend a       little more each year on harbor maintenance projects.        We have met these targets for the last five years in the       Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill. The target       for fiscal year 2020 is about $1.595 billion. However, the       administration's budget only proposes to spend $965 million,       $585 million less than what Congress appropriated last year       and $630 million below the target. So I will ask the       witnesses how they plan to sufficiently fund our ports and       harbors without requesting adequate resources to do it.        Several members of this subcommittee are interested in       making sure the Corps has the resources it needs to deal with       the recent flooding in the Midwest and along the Missouri and       Mississippi Rivers. I look forward to hearing from the       witnesses about what resources they need so that we can make       sure they are included in the disaster supplemental       appropriation bill.        I'd also like to recognize Brenda Burman, Commissioner from       the Bureau of Reclamation and Dr. Timothy Petty, Assistant       Secretary for Water and Science at the Department of the       Interior. The Bureau of Reclamation delivers water to one of       every five farmers in the West, irrigating more than 10       million acres of some of the most productive agricultural       land in the country. Although Reclamation doesn't manage       water resources in Tennessee, I know of its deep importance       to Senator Feinstein and other Senators on this subcommittee,       and we look forward to hearing your testimony.                            ____________________     Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that a copy of  my opening statement at the Senate Health, Education, Labor and  Pensions Committee be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       Strengthening Accountability To Protect Students and Taxpayers          When I was president of the University of       Tennessee, I asked David Gardner, who was then president of       the University of California, why his university was       considered one of the best in the world. He told me: First,       autonomy. We basically have four branches of government, he       said, and one of them is the University of California.       Second, competition and choice--large amounts of state and       federal money following students to the campus of their       choice. Third, a commitment to excellence by institutional       leaders and faculty.        As a former university president, I am very much aware that       despite that autonomy, our country's 6,000 colleges and       universities report to a lot of bosses--they are accountable       to a great many individuals, boards, governments and other       entities.        First, they are accountable to the students who may take       their federal and state grants and loans to any accredited       institution that will admit them; next, to 44 federally       recognized accrediting agencies whose certification of       quality is necessary before institutions are allowed to       accept students who bring $30 billion in new Pell grants and       $100 billion in in federal student loans each year; to ensure       that these billions of dollars are spent wisely, the federal       government measures how many students default on their loans;       for the 80 percent of students who attend public colleges and       universities, states have governors, state legislators, laws,       and state higher education authorities; every institution,       public or private, also has its own board of trustees or       directors; and in addition, there are specific federal rules       for the for-profit institutions, which about five percent of       students attend, in order to stop fraud against students and       taxpayers; and when making a list of bosses, no former       university president should leave out the faculty--most       faculty members I have known take great pride in maintaining       institutional excellence.        So any president of an American higher education       institution has a lot of bosses and a lot of people to whom       he or she is accountable. And that has been a mostly       successful approach. Most surveys show that the United States       has most of the best colleges and universities in the world.       The dream of many of the best students from around the world       is to attend American colleges and universities. Still, I       hear often from students asking if college is worth their       time and money.        I believe there are steps we can take to make our higher       education institutions more accountable--to provide those       students, and the taxpayers backing their loans, with a clear       yes, college is worth it.        In March, at our first bipartisan hearing during this       Congress on updating the Higher Education Act, we looked at       how to simplify how 20 million families apply for federal       student aid. Last week, we held a bipartisan hearing about       how to create a safe environment for students attending       college.        Today's hearing will be looking at ways to ensure that       students are earning degrees worth their time and money and       that taxpayers are paid back the hundreds of billions that       they have loaned students to earn degrees.        To hold colleges accountable for the $130 billion a year in       grants and loans, in 1990, Congress created the Cohort       Default Rate, which applies to all colleges and universities.       This measure makes a college ineligible to receive federal       student aid if, for three consecutive years, more than 30       percent of its borrowers are in default or over 40 percent in       any one year. However this cohort default rate has proven to       be a poor instrument of accountability, since it does not       take into account the one third of borrowers who are not yet       in default but don't make payments on time. Over the last       decade, only 20 schools have become ineligible for federal       student aid under the Cohort Default Rate, according to the       Congressional Research Service.        And then there are two federal accountability rules that       apply only to for-profit institutions. One, the 90-10 rule,       which requires that at least ten percent of a for-profit's       revenue come from nonfederal sources; and two, the Gainful       Employment Rule, which looks at how much debt a graduate has       compared to his or her salary. This comparison of debt to       salary has proved to be a confusing and ineffective measure       of accountability because it is too complex and does not       account for students who take out loans but do not complete       their degrees. So we need a more effective measure of       accountability.        But I do not want the federal government acting as a sort       of National School Board for Colleges--telling states and       accreditors and boards of directors at institutions how to       manage the 6,000 colleges and universities. Four years ago,       this Committee passed the Every Student Succeeds Act, which       reversed the trend towards a national school board for       elementary and secondary education. For the same reasons,       Washington should resist the urge to send thousands of       federal bureaucrats to evaluate our colleges and       universities, which would, in effect, create a national       school board for colleges.        Instead, Congress should create a new measure of       accountability that looks at whether students are actually       repaying their loans. This would be a more effective and       simpler way to ensure that taxpayers aren't financing degrees       that are priced so high and worth so little that students are       never able to pay back their loans. This proposal is much       like the Gainful Employment Rule--but it would apply to every       program at every college--public, private, and for-profit and       would include students who took out loans but dropped out       before graduating. For some programs, this new measure should       provide colleges with an incentive to lower tuition and help       their students stay in school to finish their degrees and       find a job so they can repay their loans.        A second step to improve accountability would be for the       federal government to make the data it collects from colleges       more useful to students and families. The Department has       struggled for years under all administrations to make such       information easily accessible to students and families. As we       work on updating the Higher Education Act, we first need to       identify what information schools actually need to report,       and second to provide direction to the Department on how to       make that information accessible and useful to students.        And third, we should strengthen the 44 federally recognized       accrediting agencies upon which we rely for certifying that       students are receiving a quality education. For example,       instead of requiring that accreditors  [[Page S2382]]       have a standard of ``student achievement,'' Congress could       more clearly require that accreditors measure whether       students are both learning and succeeding, but leave the       specific ways of measuring those to accreditors and       institutions.        Our goal needs to be to help students know that their       degrees are going to be worth their time and money and to       help taxpayers know that the federal government isn't       financing programs that do not provide students with a       valuable education.                            ____________________
