 Madam Speaker, mail is an essential government service  and a critical lifeline for many, especially during this pandemic.   What have operational changes made to the postal system accomplished?  Parts of the country are having their mail delayed by up to a week or  more. This is harming veterans, seniors, and our rural communities.   What has the Postmaster General already done? Curtailed overtime;  restricted deliveries; eliminated sorting machines; in Hartford,  Connecticut, in the parking lot there is a dismantled machine; removed  mailboxes; prohibiting employees from making late mail deliveries,  directing them to leave mail undelivered at distribution centers  overnight; warned 46 States and the District of Columbia that it could  not guarantee all ballots cast by mail for the November election will  arrive in time to be counted.   Yes, this is about our democracy, as well. This administration is  undermining a pillar of our democracy, voting for a partisan purpose.  Obstructing the Postal Service for political purposes is illegal. It is  illegal to interfere with the mail.    During this unprecedented time, we must be streamlining, not  sabotaging, voting by mail.   The administration wants to destroy the public's faith and trust in  the public service. No, the American people are not going to let you do  it. I might add, the Postal Service has a 90 percent favorability  rating. It is the most popular Federal agency. Would that we had a 90  percent favorability rating.   We must fight for this essential component of our democracy and of  people's lives. We will, through rain, shine, or sleet, or President  Donald Trump.
