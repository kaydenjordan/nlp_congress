 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in the wake of a terrible storm  that is devastating my district in southeast Texas as we speak today,  Tropical Storm Imelda, which appeared out of nowhere. Highways and  roads are flooding, and local authorities are advising folks to seek  shelter. Relatives of mine have complained that they are now  underwater, as well, and flooding.   Again, we seem to see these storms come out of nowhere. This one hit  us by surprise. It wasn't even a named storm, and once they named it,  it seemed like, within just a few hours, it made landfall.   Our office is working with the Governor's administration in Texas,  Governor Abbott, and with the Trump administration to quickly get  declarations of a Federal emergency to ensure that the resources and  help necessary will be provided to our constituents there.   Right after votes today, I will be heading home as quickly as  possible and will be doing all that I can to help the people of  southeast Texas. We are a tough and resilient people in southeast  Texas, and we live by the rule that we need to help our neighbors. We  saw that in technicolor just 2 years ago with Hurricane Harvey and that  devastation.   My prayers are with everyone in this storm right now, and my office  will be working around the clock to do all we can, and I will head  home.                            ____________________
