 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  and service of Sergeant Wytasha Carter, a 16-year veteran of the  Birmingham Police Department, who lost his life, tragically, in the  line of duty on January 13, 2019.   Wyt, as his family and friends fondly called him, was a natural-born  leader with whom others enjoyed working. Sergeant Carter was a  Birmingham native who graduated from Phillips High School before  attending Liberty University.   Sergeant Carter was drawn to service from a young age. After  graduating from college, he served in the United  [[Page H1003]]  States Armed Forces, as a U.S. Air Force sergeant, before beginning his  law enforcement career in 2002 as a correctional officer with the  Shelby County Sheriff's Department. Sergeant Carter served with the  Birmingham Police Department for nearly 8 years and was recently  promoted to sergeant last year.   But above all, Sergeant Carter was a husband, he was a father, and he  was a beloved member of his community. He was so beloved that more than  2,000 people gathered to celebrate his life and his service at his  funeral last Saturday.   Sergeant Carter was a passionate guardian of his Birmingham  community: He was a fierce protector of his coworkers; he mentored  children about the dangers of drugs and gangs; and he was someone who  consistently worked above and beyond the call of duty, devoting his  life to improving his community.   Sergeant Carter died from a gunshot wound while doing the job he  loved so passionately. He and other police officers were working to  make our community safer.   Sergeant Carter led by an example of excellence and of giving back to  his community. The city of Birmingham is better because of his  contributions.   His death is a stark reminder of the dangers that our brave policemen  and -women face while working to secure our safety. They courageously  put their lives on the line day after day to protect and to serve our  neighborhoods while we sleep. Every time they put on their uniform--and  even when their uniform comes off--they bravely put duty before self.   I ask my colleagues to join me in praying that God provides comfort  to Sergeant Carter's family and friends, especially his wife of 21  years, Tiphanie, his daughter, and his young son. We pray for all of  those who were affected by this senseless tragedy, as well as his  fellow officer, who was critically injured in the shooting and who  continues to rehab toward full recovery.   We must use this tragedy as a reminder that Congress must act to  prevent this sort of senseless gun violence, gun violence that Sergeant  Carter spoke out against. We honor the legacy of service of Sergeant  Carter by making sure we in this body act. As President Obama said:  ``Our tears are not enough. Our words and prayers are not enough.'' We  must act.   Madam Speaker, on behalf of Alabama's Seventh Congressional District  and a grateful nation, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating  the life of Sergeant Carter's contribution to making the community of  Birmingham better and this Nation. May we live out Sergeant Carter's  legacy by working for a safer and more secure nation today and every  day.                            ____________________
