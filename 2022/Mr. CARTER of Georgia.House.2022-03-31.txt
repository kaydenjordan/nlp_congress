 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of  my political mentors, the dean of the House, Representative Don Young.   I met Don on one of my first days as a Member of the House of  Representatives. I walked into this Chamber and took a seat. Minutes  later, some old guy starts digging his knuckles into my back. I  couldn't believe that was happening. I had no idea what this guy was  doing.   You can imagine my confusion as I frustratingly found myself another  chair, but you can also be assured that I never sat in that seat again.  It wasn't until afterward that I learned that I had sat in his seat. I  never made that mistake again.   Knowing him, he has probably already picked out a seat in Heaven, and  I pity the fool who tries to sit there.   Don Young is and was a dear friend. At work, he was my mentor,  someone whose stalwart belief system and passion for public service  inspired me every single day.   Don truly loved the great men and women of Alaska. That was obvious  from his fearless advocacy for the Last Frontier up here in Washington  and even more obvious on our annual fishing trip, where I got to see  firsthand the State he loved so dearly.   I was able to go with him on three separate occasions on that trip.  Every one was a great experience. I will miss those annual fishing  trips, not just for the sport of it, but for the comradery I felt with  the amazing public servants who joined together to learn from one  another.   Luckily for Alaska residents and the Young family, Don was a better  man and legislator than he was a fisherman.   My prayers and support go out to his wife, Anne, his children, and  everyone who was privileged to know this great friend, father, and  public servant.   It was an honor to gather and pay tribute to him yesterday. He made  every second count and worked hard to leave this country better than he  found it. He was the oldest Member of Congress, and I never let him  forget that. I still feel like his time on Earth here was cut short.   Don, your presence, your knowledge, and your leadership will be  sorely missed, but they will never be forgotten.                   Remembering Mabel Josephine ``Jo'' Mason     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of a woman dedicated to the service of her community, Jo Mason.  Throughout her years, Jo remained involved in her community in as many  aspects as she could.   After graduating from Glynn Academy, Jo was active in The American  Legion Auxiliary for 78 years, where she held several positions in the  local, district, and State levels.   The Saint Simons native enjoyed making the lap throws that The  American Legion Auxiliary gave out to veterans and their spouses in the  local nursing homes in Brunswick. Jo also volunteered at the fire  department, helping to man radio station 2 and serving as treasurer for  many years.   She was involved with the Golden Isles Emerald Society, Elks Lodge,  Golden Isles Retired Firefighters Association, Veterans Council of  Golden Isles, and the Coastal Republican Women's Club. She set an  example for all of us to follow.   Her memory will be cherished by the many lives that she impacted,  including her husband, Bill, who she met on a blind date in December  1965 while he was serving in the Marine Corps.   I am praying for her friends, her family, and her community during  this very sad time.                   Recognizing the Life of Dr. Grover Bell     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  life of a man dedicated to his community and to the people he served,  Dr. Grover Bell of Savannah, Georgia.   Dr. Bell was born in Sardis, Georgia, in 1928 and went to Georgia  Teachers College, where he met his beloved wife, Lourdine.   After determining that his calling was to join the ministry, Dr. Bell  attended Emory School of Divinity, where he learned to be a shepherd of  men.   Throughout his career, he served almost 30 churches of the South  Georgia United Methodist Conference, including my home church of Wesley  Monumental.   He was loved as a minister by those he served and truly embodied what  it means to put others before oneself.   Dr. Bell was also known for his gardening and for his southern,  homestyle cooking, two of his passions. His love for daylilies and  fried chicken were rivaled only by his love for God and his family.    Leaving behind his wife, four children, eight grandchildren, six  great-grandchildren, and countless others to whom he ministered, Dr.  Bell has left a lasting impact on the community that he loved so  dearly.   His family and friends remain in my thoughts and prayers after this  tremendous loss.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, for over 30 years I was the one  who was on the other side of the counter who had to tell the patient  how much their insulin costs. I was the one who watched the senior  citizens trying to decide whether they were going to buy insulin or buy  groceries. I was the one who watched a mother cry because she couldn't  afford the medication for her child.   I was the one who watched all this happen, and now I am finally  getting the opportunity to address this issue on the House floor. I am  saddened that it will do nothing to protect those mothers from the pain  of not being able to afford lifesaving medications.   Make no mistake about this. We all agree on the same thing, Madam  Speaker. We want lower prices for drugs, particularly for insulin. But  instead of fixing a broken system, this bill aims to control it. This  Socialist plan of requiring every private insurance company across the  country to offer certain insulins, not all but certain, at a mandated  price will have disastrous consequences on seniors and the 217 million  Americans who rely on private insurance.   We all know that insurance agencies will shift these costs to  patients with other diseases. Don't kid yourself. This is like  squeezing a balloon, it is going to go somewhere else. We aren't  talking about the bipartisan solutions that currently exist, like the  Lower Costs, More Cures Act of 2021, H.R. 19. That is what we ought to  be talking about.   Why aren't we talking about the PBMs, the middlemen? The Berkeley  Institute came out with a study last week, Madam Speaker, that said  that 37 percent of the price of a drug goes to the pharmaceutical  manufacturer and the rest goes to the middleman, the PBM. The solution  is right there before us. This is not going to fix it. This is going to  control it, but it is not going to fix it.   Madam Speaker, I oppose this. We all have the same common goal, but  this is not the solution.  [[Page H4038]]         Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Georgia golfing legend, Jack Lumpkin.   Jack was a master at the game of golf and a pillar of what Sea Island  and Glynn County is today. When it came to the game, Jack was  unparalleled in his understanding and knowledge. He spent his life  coaching others and was recognized for his teaching ability numerous  times.   In 1995, Jack was named PGA National Teacher of the Year, and he was  named a Top 50 Golf Teacher in America every year since 2000.   I will always remember Jack teaching students at the first tee box at  the Golf Performance Center, which is now known as Lumpkin's Tee. Jack  would take his students to where the Golf Performance Center now stands  because the area naturally blocked out the north wind coming from the  ocean.   It was Jack's ideas, passion, and prowess that made this center  possible.   My prayers are with his family, friends, and the staff of Sea Island,  as well as those that he mentored.                            ____________________
