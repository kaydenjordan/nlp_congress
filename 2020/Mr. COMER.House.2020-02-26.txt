 Madam Speaker, this week is Public Schools Week, and I  rise today to recognize our public schools in Kentucky for the critical  work they do to educate Kentucky's students.   Public schools are essential to the growth and development of future  generations. They are the backbone of our communities and responsible  for educating our young people and providing them with a stable and  secure learning environment.   The learning opportunities provided by our schools are also critical  to preparing a workforce capable of taking on the challenges of the  21st century economy.   I am very proud of the public schools which make up the First  Congressional District. As a product of the public school system  myself, I know how hard our teachers and staff work to prepare our  students for success.   Madam Speaker, we thank our educators for their service, and I look  forward to advocating for the needs of our public schools moving  forward.                            ____________________
