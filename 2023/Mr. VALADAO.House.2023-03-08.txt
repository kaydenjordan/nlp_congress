 Madam Speaker, this week, California is preparing for  more atmospheric rivers that are bringing much-needed rain to our  State.   This is welcome news to the Central Valley farmers who have suffered  through the last 3 years of exceptional drought.   While I am grateful for this rain, and I know my fellow farmers are,  as well, we have all seen this situation before. Eventually this rain  will stop.   That is why it is critical to capture and store as much of this rain  as physically possible so we don't put ourselves in this type of  situation with another man-made water shortage again.   Extreme environmentalists and Sacramento bureaucrats have grossly  mismanaged our water with complex and contradictory laws and  regulations that control how much we are able to pump and what storage  projects we are able to move forward with.   While I am grateful for the Governor for his temporary relief that he  pushed for a few weeks back, we cannot let this water go to waste. We  must maximize what can be moved at all times through the delta and  invest in water storage infrastructure and conveyance projects so we  can capture and store this critical resource. Thousands of livelihoods  and the future of agriculture production in California and countless  Americans we feed depend on it.                            ____________________
