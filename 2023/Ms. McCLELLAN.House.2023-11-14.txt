 Mr. Chair, I thank Congresswoman DeLauro for her  leadership.   When we invest in our children, we invest in our communities. I  agree, and that is why I am so perplexed and frankly outraged by the  draconian cuts in this bill, specifically targeting teachers, students,  and title I schools that serve vulnerable communities.   These draconian cuts would force 220,000 teachers from the  classrooms. In my district, that is nearly 700 title I teachers who  would lose their jobs.   I am one of the few mothers of young children in this Congress. I  have an eighth grader and a third grader. I see every day that at a  time when our schools are still struggling to address learning  disruption and a growing achievement gap resulting, in part, from the  COVID pandemic and the growing mental health crisis, that this bill  compounds that problem by cutting resources to our schools and cutting  mental health services that will help to address the crisis that our  children and the adults that care for them are facing every day.   For that reason, I urge my colleagues to vote against this extreme  Labor-HHS appropriation bill.
