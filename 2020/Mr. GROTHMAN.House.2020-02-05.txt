 Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to be able to speak on this  initiative, given what is going on in the other house today where we  have so much partisanship. This is the type of bipartisan work we  should be doing.   I am honored to be a cosponsor of the Great Lakes Restoration  Initiative. My district goes along Lake Michigan. I know it means so  much for the communities of Port Washington, Sheboygan, Manitowoc and  Two Rivers.   I would just like to clean up a little something here. I know a few  years ago in 2013, there was a great deal of concern that the watermark  in Lake Michigan was at an all-time low. People talked about climate  change and how bad that was. It was good to report now in 2020 in  January on the 30-year high on Lake Michigan. So maybe that is the  reason for a crisis as well, but it is interesting to see how things  kind of ebb and flow on Lake Michigan.   As previously has been said, about a fifth of the fresh water in  lakes in the world is in Lake Michigan by itself. Lake Michigan is the  fifth biggest lake in the world. We have had problems with invasive  species, which is one of the major reasons why I am on this bill.   We want to keep the lakes clean not only for consuming water, but the  fisheries, the fishing going on there is important, and recreation on  Lake Michigan is important.   A lot of this money goes into the agriculture in places like  Wisconsin. We do have to keep the lakes clean, and as we keep our farms  clean, it results in less algae blooms and a healthier lake system.   So, in any event, I am honored to be a cosponsor on this. I am  pleased that the Speaker has decided to put such a great bipartisan  bill on the floor today.
