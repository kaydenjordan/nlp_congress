 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate for 1 minute as in morning business.    Madam President, over the past year, the Iranian regime  has been increasingly aggressive, attacking oil tankers in the Persian  Gulf, shooting down a U.S. drone, seizing a British tanker, attacking a  Saudi oil facility, attacking U.S. military bases in Iraq, and storming  the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.   The U.S. response to Iran's increasing provocations had been too  measured, to the point that we risked Iran's leaders mistaking  restraint on the part of America for weakness and encouraging further  escalation.   Another attack that risked many American lives was in the works when  President Trump ordered U.S. forces to take out the terrorist  mastermind of the Iranian regime.   Now, think about it. Sometimes you have to stand up to a bully to get  him to back off or else we might be inviting further aggression.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
