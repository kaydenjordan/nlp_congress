 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  House Doctors Handyman of Hardin County, in Elizabethtown, KY, as the  Senate Small Business of the Week.   For most people, retirement is the clear choice following an  illustrious career in their chosen field. Franko Antolovich, on the  other hand, is not like most people. After serving in the U.S. Army for  35 years, including over 20 years in the Special Forces, Franko took  the road less traveled. When many would have chosen retirement, Franko  embarked on a new endeavor, swapping his combat boots for work boots by  becoming the franchise owner of House Doctors Handyman of Hardin  County, KY.   House Doctors provides top quality home repairs and maintenance to  residents of central Kentucky and the surrounding areas. Franko ensures  that his customers receive exemplary service by employing handymen who  are the best at what they do, with most members of his team having  years of experience in the realm of home repair. Franko understands  that it takes a great amount of trust to employ someone to work on your  own home. As the name House Doctors would imply, each employee of this  successful franchise provides an unrivaled level of care because they  understand that a house is more than just a roof over one's head. The  repair men and women operating at House Doctors treat their customers'  homes with as much respect as they would treat their own; that is the  level of quality that Franko and his team are committed to providing to  Central Kentucky.   House Doctors' services range from one-time maintenance repairs for  home appliances, to small projects like drywall installation and  repair, all the way up to full home remodels. Whatever the need may be,  residents of central Kentucky can count on House Doctors to provide the  services they need for quick and professional home repair. In addition  to the wide array of services they perform, House Doctors offers a 1- year labor guarantee for each job they perform, proving their steadfast  commitment to quality craftsmanship. This commitment extends beyond  House Doctors' policy of a 1-year labor guarantee, as Franko ensures  that all the handymen and women he employs are professional, insured,  bonded, and trained. Residents of central Kentucky can achieve full  peace of mind knowing that the job they have entrusted to House Doctors  will be completed only after the highest standards of quality have been  met.   I want to thank Frank Antolovich for the service he has paid to this  country and commend him for his transition from Active Duty to being an  active member in his central Kentucky community. After putting his mind  and body to work for our country, he saw a franchise opportunity that  allowed him to work towards the betterment and protection of central  Kentucky homes. It is the level of dedication and service that has been  a hallmark throughout Franko's life that makes his franchise thrive.  Congratulations to Franko Antolovich and to the entire team at House  Doctors Handyman of Central Kentucky. I look forward to watching your  continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
