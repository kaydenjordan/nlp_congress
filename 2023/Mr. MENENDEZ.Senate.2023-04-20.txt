 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   [[Page S1290]]                                                     Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION         Turkey--F-16 Avionics Upgrade        The Government of Turkey has requested to buy defense       articles and services to support upgrading its fleet of F-16       aircraft, to include software upgrades of the Operational       Flight Program (OFP) avionics with the Automatic Ground       Collision Avoidance System (AGCAS) capability; hardware       modifications to enable integration of the Multifunctional       Information Distribution System Block Upgrade II (MIDS BU       II), procured separately; hardware and software upgrades to       include aircraft major modification; both classified and       unclassified software and software support; integration and       test support; support equipment; training and training       equipment; spare and repair parts; publications and technical       documentation; U.S. Government and contractor engineering,       technical, and logistical support services; and other related       elements of logistical and program support. The estimated       total cost is $259 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by helping       to improve the security of a NATO ally that is an important       force for political stability and economic progress in the       Black Sea region.        The proposed sale will improve Turkey's capability to meet       current and future threats by providing a critical flight       safety and tactical integration capability to assist in       defending its homeland and U.S. personnel stationed there.       Turkey has demonstrated a willingness to modernize its F-16       capabilities since it purchased the aircraft in the mid-      1980s, and will have no difficulty absorbing these       capabilities into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin       Aeronautics Company of Fort Worth, TX. There are no known       offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential       sale.        Implementation of this sale will not require the assignment       of U.S. Government or contractor representatives in Turkey.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            TRANSMITTAL NO. 21-34       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System       capability is used as a flight safety mitigation tool in       order to reduce incidents of controlled flight into terrain       and ground collisions, which account for seventy-five percent       of F-16 pilot fatalities worldwide. The system consists of a       series of collision avoidance and autonomous decision-making       algorithms that utilize precise navigation, aircraft       performance, and digital terrain data to determine if a       collision is imminent. If the system determines a collision       is imminent, the system commands an autonomous maneuver to       prevent impact, although the pilot may override this       functionality.        2. The highest level of defense articles, components, and       services included in this potential sale is CONFIDENTIAL.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures which       might reduce system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        4. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of Turkey.   CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO Sec. 620C(d) OF THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT OF                              1961, AS AMENDED         Pursuant to Section 620C(d) of the Foreign Assistance Act       of 1961, as amended (the Act), Executive Order 12163 and       State Department Delegation of Authority No. 245-2, I hereby       certify that the furnishing to Turkey of defense articles and       services to support upgrading F-16 aircraft is consistent       with the principles contained in Section 620C(b) of the Act.        This certification will be made part of the notification to       Congress under Section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act,       as amended, regarding the proposed sale of the above-named       articles and services and is based on the justification       accompanying such notification, of which such justification       constitutes a full explanation.                            ____________________
