 Mr. Speaker, day three of this shutdown, thousands  and thousands of Federal employees not working. The leader of the  Republicans in the Senate has moved with some offer that would  hopefully be something to start with, but I applaud the Democratic  leadership in the other body because they have been focusing on what we  want, and that is parity, national security parity for children's  healthcare and federally qualified health clinics and veterans.   But the people who have imploded this, of course, are the President  and his staff, with vulgarity and then breaking up a deal last Friday.   So, if we are serious, we need to be able to work on what the issues  are, and that is domestic spending to have parity to ensure that the  families of our soldiers are, likewise, provided for.   I support the national security needs of this Nation, as a Homeland  Security member since the tragic and heinous terrorist act of 9/11. I  believe national security goes with providing for their families. When  are we going to do that and provide for innocent DREAMers who have done  nothing but come to this country to be able to do what is right?   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R. 4872, the End  the Shutdown Act of 2018, a continuing resolution that would  immediately open and reopen the government with a clean CR while  negotiations continue on a budget agreement that adheres to the parity  and on other critical issues so that we can end the Trump shutdown.    Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary inquiry is the  utilization of the words ``illegal immigration'' being used against the  well-stated policies of the United States dealing with respecting  people who come to this country.   My question is the terminology being used to indict Democrats, the  Democratic Party, and it is maligning hardworking Americans who came  from an immigrant background.
