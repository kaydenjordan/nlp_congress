 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in  support of H. Con. Res. 71. It has been said frequently that our  Federal Tax Code today is more than 60 times longer than the Bible, and  it contains none of the good news.   It has been more than 30 years since we updated our tax system, and  many Americans are struggling to make ends meet, to find decent paying  jobs and prepare for retirement.   No matter where I travel in my district, Mr. Speaker, Louisiana's  Fourth District, I hear story after story about how our excessive Tax  Code and burdensome regulations continue to hinder our businesses and  stunt our economic growth.   Congress must act now and deliver a Tax Code that meets the current  demands of the 21st century economy.   Fortunately, my Republican colleagues and I have put forth a  framework to do exactly that. Our plan will create more jobs, fairer  taxes, and bigger paychecks for working class Americans and small  businesses.   When the people are allowed to keep more of their hard-earned dollars  instead of turning them over to an already bloated Federal Government,  we will unleash the free market again.   It is well past time we get our economy back on track, and passing  meaningful tax reform is a crucial first step in completing that  mission.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, as a proud cosponsor of this  legislation, I rise towards the end of this long debate to reiterate a  central idea: the reason behind this legislation is because of what we  stand for as Americans.   The Declaration of Independence, as we know, is our Nation's birth  certificate, and it states very succinctly in the second paragraph what  has come to be known as the American's Creed: ``We hold these truths to  be self-evident: that all men are created equal; that they are endowed  by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are  life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.''   The reason that the Founders put the right to life first, listed as  our most fundamental freedom, is because they understood that we are  made in the image of a holy God.   Our creator, who gave us those unalienable rights, is the one who  made each and every one of us. Because of that, there is a central  truth that comes through: every single person, every single life, is of  inestimable dignity and value. Your value is not related in any way to  where you went to school, what you make for a living, how good-looking  you are, how talented you are, what your fortune was in life, whether  or not you have a physical disability. Your value is inherent in who  you are as a creation of the God who made you.   That is the reason we stand for this. It is the reason the bill is so  important. We urge our colleagues to support it today.
