 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Enes Kanter  Freedom.   Since being drafted third overall in the 2011 NBA draft, Mr. Freedom,  a newly minted American citizen, has made our country incredibly proud.   Growing up in Turkey, Enes says he did not know what freedom was  until he moved to the United States. And since then, he has used his  platform to speak out against human rights atrocities in China, Turkey,  and beyond. Enes uses his voice for the people around the world who are  voiceless.   And because of his outspoken criticism of Turkey's authoritarian  regime and inhumane treatment of political prisoners, the Turkish  Government revoked Enes' passport and issued multiple warrants for his  arrest, leaving  [[Page H7468]]  him stateless for many years. And in China, broadcasts of Enes'  basketball games were banned after he criticized the Chinese Communist  Party's repressive regime and their human rights abuses against the  Uighurs and Tibetans.   Since facing backlash, Enes has made it his life's mission to push  the boundaries of what is possible on and off the court. He understands  and recognizes using his voice and the importance of it.    After waiting six long years, Mr. Speaker, last week Enes finally  became a U.S. citizen, and at his citizenship ceremony, he recited the  oath using his newly minted last name, Freedom. And I cannot think of a  more appropriate new last name for Enes, as he embodies all that  freedom means. And by changing his last name, Enes can now carry that  word with him wherever he goes.   Mr. Speaker, I salute the brave work of Enes Kanter Freedom. At a  time when others remain silent, he has spoken up.   I congratulate Enes on his citizenship, and this United States  Congress and all of us welcome him to our American family.                            ____________________
