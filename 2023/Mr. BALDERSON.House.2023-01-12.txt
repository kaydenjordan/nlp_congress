 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I  am honored and blessed to be able to serve with you.   Instead of supporting American energy producers and reversing their  disastrous energy policies, the Biden administration decided to drain  our energy reserves to the lowest levels since 1983.   So who benefited from this decision to drain these reserves?   The Chinese Communist Party now has the largest government-controlled  petroleum reserve in the world. In fact, this administration  transferred 900,000 barrels from our stockpile to a subsidy of the  Chinese Communist Party-owned China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation.   H.R. 22, sponsored by Madam Chair McMorris Rodgers, bars the  Secretary of Energy from selling any of America's petroleum reserves to  an entity affiliated with the CCP or any entity that intends to export  it to China.   Energy security is national security. House Republicans are fighting  to ensure one of our greatest geopolitical challengers, China, does not  benefit from this administration's misguided energy policies.   I urge passage of H.R. 22, the Protecting America's Strategic  Petroleum Reserve from China Act.
