 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to  complete my remarks here today.    Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an American hero,  a powerful leader, and a dear friend, Senator John McCain. After  decades of dedicated service to this Nation, John was taken from us  over the weekend. The good Senator from Arizona fought his battle with  brain cancer as he did every battle in his life, with toughness and  tenacity, with grit, and with grace. This week, I join millions in  mourning the passing of a beloved patriot. Over a  [[Page S5969]]  lifetime of selfless service, John came to embody the very pinnacle of  American virtue, courage, commitment, integrity, and sacrifice. These  are the precepts he lived by and by which he will always be remembered.   No one is more worthy of the word ``hero'' than John McCain. The  Senate--indeed, I should say, the Nation--will miss the steady, guiding  presence of a singular statesman.   By now, the biographical details of Senator McCain's life have been  covered at length. The son of a four-star Navy admiral, John knew great  expectations from an early age. He was to forgo the comforts of  civilian life and fight for freedom, which he did.   What is exceptional about John McCain is that he not only met the  heavy expectations placed upon him, he far exceeded them. Few have ever  risen to the positions of influence that John McCain did. Fewer still  have done so and kept their character intact, but Senator John McCain  did. Indeed, he never parted from it. As a prisoner of war in Vietnam,  John was offered release on multiple occasions. Yet he refused each  offer until the POWs incarcerated before him were also released.   Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for  his country, for his friends. John possessed such love, proving time  and again his willingness to lay down his life for his brothers in  uniform. As a captive, John McCain personified selfless sacrifice,  offering himself as a bargaining chip to secure the freedom of his  fellow countrymen.   Each day, for more than 2,000 days, he endured horrors that few of us  could ever imagine: solitary confinement, forced starvation, repeated  beatings, and the constant threat of death. Yet he stayed the course,  finding strength in the love he felt for his fellow servicemen--and  most of all, the love he felt for his beloved country.   When John was eventually released in the spring of 1973, he came home  a living scar of Vietnam. The cartilage in his knees was all but gone,  the bones in his body broken by endless beatings. He was a walking  testament to the brutalities of torture and the depths of human  depravity, but the hell of war was not enough to stop John McCain from  being a happy warrior. Upon his return, he continued the same mission  he started in Vietnam: looking out for the safety and welfare of his  fellow sailors.   Few remember that the time before John was elected to Congress, he  was the Navy's Senate liaison. It was in this capacity that he and I  first became friends. Even then, John impressed me with his sense of  mission, going to incredible lengths to ensure that our service men and  women had the resources they needed to keep us safe. He would carry  that same commitment with him when he was elected to the House of  Representatives in 1982 and 5 years later when he joined us in the  Senate.   The Pentagon had no closer ally than John McCain. They also had no  fiercer critic. Like an admiral who demanded only the very best of his  sailors, John wanted to ensure that our servicemen were living to their  full potential, and so he held our Armed Forces to the highest  standard, never hesitating to call out bureaucratic complacency and  runaway spending in military ranks. Our men and women in uniform were  stronger and our Nation more safe because of his efforts. No one  commanded more respect than John McCain as the chairman of the Senate  Armed Services Committee.   John constantly put others before himself as a prisoner of war, and  he did the same as a Senator. He was the kind of a friend you could  count on for help when you needed it most.    Nearly 20 years ago, Governor Mitt Romney--who at the time had been  tasked with salvaging the Salt Lake Winter Olympic Games--came to me  with a pressing problem: With only months to go before the opening  ceremony, Utah lacked the Federal funding it desperately needed to pull  off the Olympic Games.   In our moment of need, we turned to Senator McCain. I took Mitt over  to see him. The two of us marched up to Senator McCain's office in the  Russell Building. Even though we came unannounced, Senator McCain  gladly received us. Together, Mitt and I made the case for emergency  funding. Within days, we had secured the resources we needed to move  forward with the games, all thanks to Senator John McCain. Were it not  for John's quick action, I can honestly say the 2002 Winter Olympics  would not have been a success. In fact, it would have been an  embarrassment. He was not excited about putting up Federal funds  either, but all I had to do was ask, and he said fine.   So esteemed was John by his Republican colleagues that we didn't  hesitate to throw our support behind him in the 2008 Presidential  election. Senator McCain mounted an admirable campaign, refusing to  stoop to the political mudslinging that all too often defines  Presidential contests. I agree with the assessment of the late Charles  Krauthammer:         McCain ran a valiant race against impossible odds. He will       be--he should be--remembered as the most worthy Presidential       nominee ever to be denied the prize.    That was a wonderful quote.   We will remember John for many things--for his courage as a sailor,  for his dedication as a Senator, and for his principle as a statesman.  We will also remember how he embodied the best in us. John McCain was a  man for all seasons--a voice of temperance in intemperate times and a  model of civility and reason. The tragedy of his passing is that we  need men like John McCain now more than ever before.   I consider myself incredibly lucky to have known John and even  luckier to have called him friend. Here in the Senate and across the  Nation, we will miss him dearly.   John, thank you for blessing us with your service and your sacrifice.   Today, my prayers are with the people of Arizona and the McCain  family. I differed with John from time to time, but we never had any  acrimony between us. He was always open. He would come across and help  me when I needed the help here in the Senate, as I would do for him. It  was a privilege to serve with him. I feel very deeply about John  McCain, and I am very pleased that I can stand here as one of his  friends who knew him well and praise him--maybe not as good as I really  feel but good enough.
