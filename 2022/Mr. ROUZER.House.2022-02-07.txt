 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Dr. Eileen  Langdon of Johnston County, North Carolina. Following more than 30  years working as a distinguished veterinarian at Willowrun Veterinary  Hospital in Smithfield, Dr. Langdon is retiring.   In the words of Dr. Langdon, she ``felt called to serve the ones in  our world who seemingly have no voice. The ones who need an advocate.''  As a devoted Christian, God's plan led her to Auburn University where  she received her degree in veterinary medicine in 1986.   She joined the Willowrun Veterinary family and healthcare team as an  associate veterinarian in 1990 and became a partner at the practice in  2007. Dr. Langdon is cherished by her colleagues. Her many years of  hard work and expertise, without a doubt, have built a lasting legacy  of exceptional service, as well as mentorship to other women in the  profession that will provide a lasting influence.   Though she will be retiring from Willowrun with a tremendous record  of achievement, she will be moving on to do what she loves, working  full-time on the family farm with her husband and three children. The  Langdon family farm is a third generation farm in the McGees Crossroads  community--a family I know quite well--not all that far from my own  family's farm. Like all of our wonderful farm families, preserving  natural resources is always their top priority as they grow crops and  livestock.   In addition to her veterinarian career and working on the family  farm, Dr. Langdon served for 10 years as a member of the Johnston  County Board of Health. She has been an active church member, and she  has received recognition as a Paul Harris Fellow through the Rotary  Club of Central Johnston County for her years of service to the  community. Dr. Langdon and her husband are also inducted members of the  Johnston County Agricultural Hall of Fame.   I commend and thank Dr. Langdon for her many years of service to our  community, State, and country. May God continue to bless her path and  that of the Langdon family.                     Tribute To The Honorable Craig Olive     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay special tribute to my  friend, Craig Olive, who has served as Johnston County Register of  Deeds since December 2002.   Craig found a love for politics at an early age, and he assisted many  local and statewide candidates by putting up signs as a young boy.  During his involvement as a volunteer for the Johnston County  Republican Party, he helped bring rise to the Republican Party in  Johnston County in eastern North Carolina.   Beyond politics and his own service as register of deeds, he has  served his community in a variety of ways and he continues to do so. He  is a past member of the Board of Advisors for the Paul A. Johnston  Auditorium and Johnston Community College, a past member of the Capital  Campaign for the Johnston County Heritage Center Community, and a past  member of the Johnston County Tourism Board--just to name a few.   He also helped spearhead an annual ceremony remembering those who  have lost their lives to dementia and honoring those currently living  with dementia as well as their caregivers. Even long before these  contributions and his election to office, Craig was awarded the Long  Leaf Pine, an award that is bestowed on North Carolinians, the highest  civilian honor the State bestows.   During his tenure as Johnston County Register of Deeds, Craig has had  tremendous accomplishments implementing major improvements in  automation, technology, and customer service. His office was the first  Register of Deeds office in North Carolina to electronically record  documents, and the first office in the Nation to electronically record  a survey map.   He has worked tirelessly to ensure that the county's history is  preserved and secure within his office while performing the duties of  his office under budget. He has returned $4.1 million to the county,  which is a tremendous savings to Johnston County taxpayers.   Mr. Olive also worked with me during my time in the North Carolina  Senate to introduce a bill to improve identity theft protection. This  bill became law in 2009 and was a direct result of his great efforts.   In 2016, Craig implemented a Thank A Vet program to assist veterans  by providing them with an ID. An added benefit of this program is that  it allows for better safekeeping of veterans' military discharge  papers.   Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, his office has faced  many challenges, yet he has been determined to remain open to assist  our citizens. He continues to lead the way in providing the highest  level of efficiency, productivity, innovation, and service to the  people of Johnston County in North Carolina.    Thank you, Craig, for your commitment to your family, your neighbors,  and to the citizens of Johnston County and beyond.                            ____________________
