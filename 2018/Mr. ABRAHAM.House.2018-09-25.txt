 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Lieutenant Colonel Robert Miller, a veteran of the Marine Corps from  Bogalusa, Louisiana, which I have the privilege to represent.   Colonel Miller went above and beyond to answer the call of service to  our Nation. He fought in three wars between 1945 and 1973: World War  II, the Korean war, and the Vietnam war.   He received three Purple Hearts during his time with the Marines, and  some of his war experiences are quite impressive.   While in Korea, American forces suffered enormous casualties due to  bitter cold and frostbite, yet Colonel Miller's platoon did not suffer  a single casualty. He was asked later how he protected his men, and he  shared with them a trick he learned from a gentleman, Delos Nobles, a  homeless man from his home of Bogalusa.   Mr. Nobles would line his clothes and shoes with old newspapers to  block the cold. Colonel Miller and his men asked friends and family to  send them as many newspapers as they could get, and the results helped  earn him a battlefield commission.   Maybe fittingly, Colonel Miller eventually earned a degree in  journalism from the University of Maryland.   Colonel Miller also caught the eye of Marilyn Monroe while serving in  Korea. His rifle platoon provided security to her while she visited the  DMZ. She arranged a front row seat for him at her show.   She even gave him her phone number and told him to call her when he  got home from the war. He did, and the two went on to become great  friends.   Following his military service, Colonel Miller started what now is  known as Venture Scout Crew 313, which specializes on learning survival  skills and winning national white water canoe races.   That legacy includes 18 national championships in open cruisers, 27  national championships in advanced aluminums, and 26 national  championships in the novice division.   His scouts also serve as stretcher bearers during medical emergencies  at LSU football games. There is a reason that some of us joke that our  Tigers are more like the Cardiac Cats.   His work with youth garnered him national and international  leadership awards.   Colonel Miller has stayed active throughout his long life as a member  of the local Lion's Club and chairman of the Christmas in Cassidy Park  in Bogalusa.   He is certainly a shining example of public service, someone who puts  community and country first. We could always use a few more Colonel  Millers in whatever community we call home, and I thank him for  everything and all he has done for Bogalusa and the United States of  America.                            ____________________
