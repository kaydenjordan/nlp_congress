 Madam President, today I wish to recognize Mr.  Scott Kaufman's term of service as chief executive officer of the  Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Detroit, which includes the  contributions he has made to Metro Detroit and its Jewish communities.   Founded in 1926, the Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Detroit has  supported the Jewish population in the greater Detroit area by  addressing their health, welfare, educational, cultural, and spiritual  needs, not only in Southeast Michigan, but also in Israel and  throughout the world. Under Mr. Kaufman's stewardship, the federation  has expanded these efforts, which have strengthened the Jewish  community, and Southeast Michigan, as a whole.   Mr. Kaufman has been with the federation since 2007, serving in a  variety of roles including director of strategic initiatives and  director of the federation's yearlong effort to celebrate the 60th  anniversary of Israel in 2008, as well as leading multiple family  missions to Israel.   Mr. Kaufman has also ensured the longevity of the federation by  encouraging its engagement of young Jewish people. Mr. Kaufman's  leadership in those efforts led to the development of programs such as  CommunityNEXT and NEXTGen Detroit. These programs have gone on to  become models of engagement for Jewish organizations across the  country. His initiatives have focused on addressing crucial needs  within the community, such as JHelp, where individuals in need can find  resources to aid them in areas such as housing, disability services,  and mental health. These efforts have led to the expansion of the  federation's scope and mission, as well as the impact it continues to  make in Metro Detroit.   The Jewish Federation of Metropolitan Detroit is a dynamic  organization whose endeavors have been felt far and wide in communities  across metro Detroit. Its rich history of service to the Jewish  community and all residents of Southeast Michigan continue to enhance  of vibrancy of Metro Detroit. As the federation celebrates and reflects  on the end of Mr. Kaufman's term as CEO, I ask all my colleagues to  join me in congratulating him, as well as the employees and volunteers  of the federation, whose impact has and continues to improve the lives  so many. I wish the federation success in the years ahead as it  continues in its mission, and I am confident Mr. Kaufman's will  continue to lead endeavors in metro Detroit that strengthen the  community.                            ____________________
