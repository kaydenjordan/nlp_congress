 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember  Leroy Jordan. He was a beloved educator and community leader who passed  away on September 5, 2020.   Leroy was a native of Murphysboro, Illinois, and a graduate of  Southern Illinois University at Carbondale. Leroy was hired by Iles  Elementary School in Springfield, becoming the first Black male teacher  in the district. He later served on that district's school board,  including two terms as school board president. He also went on to  become the vice president of academic affairs at Sangamon State  University, which is now known as the University of Illinois at  Springfield.   He was a dedicated servant and leader to his community. He advocated  for freedom and justice, perhaps most notably in his involvement in a  1974 desegregation lawsuit that created a busing system that helped  balance the White and Black populations in Springfield's public schools  and encouraged the hiring of more minority teachers.   Leroy was a legend in the city of Springfield, both in and out of the  classroom. He was active in the Springfield Diocese, serving as the  director of Black Catholic Ministries and instrumental with the  Springfield Dominican Anti-Racism Team. He was also a member of Prince  Hall Freemasons and Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc.   For so many, including our mutual good friend Irv Smith, Leroy was a  friend, a role model, and a mentor. He will truly be missed.   My prayers are with his wife, Johnetta; four daughters; and  grandchildren.                          Congratulating Dove, Inc.     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Dove, Inc., on celebrating 50 years of dedicated service  to their community. Formed in July of 1970, Dove has seen considerable  growth in both their organization and the impact they have made on  their community.   Dove is a coalition of religious organizations that has excelled in  their mission to address unmet human needs and social injustices. Their  ministry, shared through a network of volunteers and advocates, aims to  empower individuals to become self-reliant by encouraging clients'  freedom to make responsible decisions and determine their future based  on informed opinions.   For half a century, community leaders at Dove have provided some of  the most vulnerable in their community a place where they are cared for  with dignity and compassion while on their path toward healing and  self-sufficiency.   Dove provides services on important issues, such as domestic  violence, homelessness, emergency financial assistance, and prevention  education programming to K through third grade students. They currently  impact thousands of citizens every year through their various community  service programs.   Again, congratulations to Dove, Inc., on their 50th anniversary. I  wish them and those they serve nothing but the best in the years to  come.                       Congratulating Thomas J. Wickham     Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss not to  offer heartfelt congratulations to somebody who, over the last 8 years,  has not just been a colleague but has become a friend while standing up  at that same Speaker's rostrum when we were in the majority. The  gentleman is none other than the House Parliamentarian, Tom Wickham.   Tom has helped so many people on our side of the aisle. Now, as the  other side has taken the majority, you have gotten to witness firsthand  what I learned from Tom and the great people who work in the House  Parliamentarian's Office during my 6 years in the majority and being  able to be up in that chair working directly with him.   Tom is somebody who I think everybody got to know very well as  someone who is actually very fair at administering the rules of this  House. But I  [[Page H4388]]  always enjoyed most walking by his office and harassing him if his  favorite baseball team wasn't doing that well or if his favorite  college football team may have lost to one of the others in the Big  Ten.   An institution like the House of Representatives will move on from  all of us who are here now, but this one is a hard one to replace.   I thank Tom Wickham for his service, and I wish the best to Jason  Smith, his successor.                            ____________________
