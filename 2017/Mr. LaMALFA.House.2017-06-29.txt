 Mr. Speaker, finally, this week, we are taking up two  pieces of legislation that will address a huge problem in my home State  of California for a long time.   As California moves more and more towards becoming a sanctuary State,  already having several sanctuary cities, H.R. 3003 and H.R. 3004 move  in the right direction toward law and order and what people expect from  their government in providing for the public safety.   We go back to the story of two Californians I can think of off the  top of my head immediately, Kate Steinle and Jamiel Shaw, Jr., taken  needlessly by people who shouldn't have even been in the country. They  were illegal immigrants who were allowed to slip through the system and  cause the death of both of those fine young people in California.   Juan Sanchez was an illegal immigrant with a record of seven  felonies. He had been caught and deported not once, not twice, by five  times. He should not have been on the streets of California. But on  July 1, he was roaming around free in San Francisco. He stole a gun out  of a Federal officer's car, fired shots in public, and shot Kate  Steinle in the back. San Francisco is a so-called sanctuary city, but  it was not a sanctuary city for Kate Steinle.   By shielding illegal immigrants from Federal authorities, sanctuary  cities are disobeying the law. These actions have fatal consequences,  as Kate Steinle and her family found out.   Action we take this week on H.R. 3004, Kate's Law, will toughen the  punishment for illegal immigrants who reenter the country. The second  bill, H.R. 3003, No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, cracks down on  sanctuary cities, protects the public from dangerous criminals, and  sends a message that if you are not with us in enforcing the law, then  you are not going to receive funding or other help from the Federal  Government.   I think that is finally the right message coming out of Washington,  D.C., for those who don't uphold the laws and see to the first duty of  government, which is to protect and stand up for the safety of its  citizens.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I have a presentation here, but, first, I  yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), my friend, who has  a very important topic to cover as well. I appreciate his friendship  and his strong leadership on the things that really count around here.                            Liu Xiaobo Resolution     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Smith for standing up for  that important issue and making that known. So, I thank him, and I  appreciate him joining with us tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to discuss the devastating impacts that  illegal marijuana grow operations are having on our public lands--even  private lands, as well.    As pictured here, this is not an uncommon scene in my district in  northern California, in many of the Western States, or anywhere where  people think they can get away with it, where someone may not be paying  attention. We see that very often on our Federal lands because,  honestly, regretfully, they are not managed very well and they are not  managed very often.   We hope to see that turn around under this new administration, this  new leadership, that U.S. Forest Service lands have more attention to  them, that they are managed more with timber harvest, thinning, things  of that nature, to make the forests healthier.   This certainly does not cause a healthier situation for our forests,  as you see pictured here, the amount of damage that can come from that.  I will tell you a little bit about it here.   The devastating effects inflicted on the habitat and wildlife due to  the nonpermitted water diversions, extensive grading of the terrain-- which, people in agriculture and construction have to get permits to do  grading--and use of illegal toxicants and pesticides purchased outside  of the United States--chemicals, products you can't even use here, that  haven't been subjected to an EPA label process that ag chemicals and  household chemicals have to do--this is what is coming in and being  used on our public lands, poisoning them, poisoning the wildlife, and  making it very dangerous for any people that might go in there.   According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, many threatened and  endangered species which we are bending over backwards to try to  recover, to try to protect, have tested positive for these poisons and  other contaminants used at these illegal grow sites.                                time  1930    Preliminary tests of game animals, including birds and deer, have  also tested positive for these illegal pesticides, again, that are  banned by the EPA, not allowed to be used in the United States, haven't  been subject to the labeling requirements that are legal materials that  we use in agriculture and other things that they have gone through.   So it is difficult to understand how the Federal Government can spend  extensive resources going after farmers, ranchers, miners, whoever for  doing legal operations. In agriculture, it might be disking or plowing.  In mining, it might be panning for gold or normal mining operations.   So we have people cultivating their land for food. We have people  extracting minerals that are needed for our daily lives, whether it is  paving a road, driveway, concrete, whatever it might be. We have people  legally doing these actions. They are the ones who have been--at least  until recent months with the new administration--harassed with rules  that hadn't even been subject to congressional attention.   But at the same time, until recent months, this blatant criminal  activity has been allowed to stand.   Is it because law enforcement can't go into those--areas they are not  authorized?  [[Page H5372]]    I know local law enforcement is really interested in doing this. But  it has been a hands-off approach by some of our Federal officials who  have either not wanted to put the resources together or haven't had the  wherewithal to put enough of the resources together to go out and  enforce on these foreign nationals doing these devastating things to  our lands and the danger they cause.   What good are these Federal laws and statutes if we do not properly  enforce the law to protect our public lands?   We are protecting, on one hand, again, the wrong people by inaction;  and we are criminalizing normal activity, people farming, ranching,  mining, et cetera. The priorities have been backwards. I hope to see a  big change in that with the new direction of the new administration.   As if the environmental effects are not disturbing enough, the safety  of the general public is at risk. Heavily armed drug cartels are using  our National Forest to engage in large-scale illegal grow operations.  You can see the haul on some of the weapons that have been taken from  some of the raids that have been successfully done. This is pretty  dangerous stuff.   Somewhere in the picture are people who have grenade-launching  devices, if I am not mistaken.   So what kind of situation do we have going on where this kind of  heavy armament is coming into our forests?   And on the other hand, law-abiding, Second Amendment-loving Americans  are subject to confiscation, threatening high cost of ammunition,  multitudes of anti-gun rhetoric that, again, makes you ask the  questions: Who are we protecting and who are we criminalizing?   U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, for example, has been forced to  temporarily close refuge units during hunting season to protect the  public from stumbling on to an illegal grow that might be guarded  heavily by these criminals with these weapons.   In 2012, the DEA's Domestic Cannabis Eradication/Suppression Report  indicated more than 10,000 or more illegal firearms seized nationwide  in raids. This is the people's property. The public should be able to  hunt, fish, camp, recreate with their families on it as they wish, safe  from this criminal activity.   Unfortunately, the number of illegal grow sites on Federal lands  continues to rise at an alarming rate. Even in States that have  legalized marijuana for recreational use, like California-- regrettably--and Colorado, they still are doing the illegal grows in  lands that are in States that have so far legalized marijuana.   According to the U.S. Forest Service, in 2016, the Pacific Southwest  region saw a 52 percent increase in marijuana production on Forest  Service lands compared to a previous year.   So maybe the answer hasn't been in legalizing marijuana grows. The  activity is still going on. It is still a sought-after market for those  people who want to be using it.   While the statistics seem staggering, it is believed that the true  number of illegal grows on Federal lands is actually much higher than  that 10,000 figure, much higher than what has been documented, much  higher than the 52 percent increase that we are talking about.   So with the heavy rainfall that the Western States saw this winter-- thankfully, we have gotten the rain--the regions are expecting an even  higher surge of illegal marijuana production on the people's public  lands.   The law enforcement capabilities of the U.S. Forest Service, the Fish  and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management are not  currently equipped to handle an issue of this high magnitude. These law  enforcement officers are doing what they can with the resources  allotted and the permission they are allowed by their higher-ups, but  we need much more additional means and support to develop a coordinated  approach to enforce against these foreign nationals and others that are  doing these illegal grows, despite what the public might be wanting  with legalized marijuana in their own grows.   While confronting the challenges of illegal marijuana cultivation in  our National Forests is a large undertaking, it is important that we  face this head on. Strong enforcement needs to come from the Federal  Government that is supposed to be overseeing these lands. So we are  talking about scenes like this right here. This is what is allowed to  happen.   That is why criminalizing people doing legal activities, such as  farming, ranching, mining, what have you, for tiny, very narrow  occasional violations, this is what is being fostered out there. Look  at this. The trash that is allowed to happen; empty chemical  containers; everything else involved in the grow; people camping up  there illegally, because the Federal Government, until recently, does  not seem to have an interest in enforcing against these illegal grows.    Protecting our public lands from these destructive environmental  threats, making sure our National Forests are safe for the public's  use, for the habitat, for the wildlife, these are of key importance.  This is what the public demands that we do. It is our job to keep the  public safe and the lands, as well, in good stewardship. Much more  needs to be done.   The Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture, they  have immediate jurisdiction over these. They need to allow and partner  with local law enforcement as well, who knows the lands better than  anybody in Washington, D.C., ever would.   And I don't need to remind you once again that marijuana is still  classified, Federally, as an illegal drug. So these States--no matter  how the voters have been duped, coerced, overwhelmed with dollars at  the ballot box and on campaigns, this is still an illegal drug. It is  an illegal activity that has been going on.   So I hope what we are hearing from the Department of Justice--they  will be looking really hard at whether this is even a legal activity in  States that have been legalizing marijuana, and the harmful effects it  is going to have on society as this stuff gets more powerful, more  potent, and more available to kids.   We have a job to do. It all starts right here: taking care of these  lands, the habitat and environment for wildlife that we all care about,  the habitat for people, and the water quality.   What is going to come out of here as the water runs downstream  through this stuff? What is that going to mean for our streams, rivers,  lakes, to the water supplies that the people draw from here, that the  animals draw from here?   It is not good. So the Federal Government needs to take a stronger  approach, whether it is DOJ, in concert with the Department of the  Interior and the Department of Agriculture, and that input from local  law enforcement in local communities. This could be a very good team  operation if we are allowed to do it and we aggressively go after that.   I am seeing the seeds of that in the conversations that are coming  out of our agencies here in Washington, D.C. Let's push forward on that  and let's hear from the American public on making this happen as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 39 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday, July  3, 2017, at 11 a.m.                            ____________________
