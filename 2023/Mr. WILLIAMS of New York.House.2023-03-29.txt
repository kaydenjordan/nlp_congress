 Madam Speaker, I rise today on this  important day to commemorate those who served in Vietnam. I want to  call attention to one servicemember, Colonel Marshall McRee, who passed  from us just 4 years ago.   Colonel McRee started his life in North Carolina poor. He chose a  college because they offered a football scholarship and clothing that  he could not afford.   President Kennedy called him up to rush to Florida as a young officer  in the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Colonel McRee went on to serve  for 30 years. He did two tours in Vietnam. In early 1965, he served  first as an adviser but then in the fierceness of battles in 1967 and  1968, in the Battle of Caisson, supporting the Marine Corps from his  artillery position, supporting marines on long-range patrols during the  day, and defending his perimeter all night.   Marshall McRee earned three Bronze Stars with a V for valor for his  service to our country. He returned to a Nation that was ungrateful,  and he returned to a Nation that spit upon him when he returned.                                time  1100    There are those in our highest levels of government today who are  among those who protested against our veterans before, more recently,  it became popular to support the veterans.   I want to add that Marshall McRee did not stand alone. His wife of  over 50 years, Patricia McRee, was part of the fabric of the Army  community that when the telegrams would bring news of loss, she was  part of the fabric of women who came and supported young women who were  now widows with children who were now fatherless. That was the Army and  the fabric that they provided.   I am proud to talk about Colonel and Mrs. McRee because they have a  beautiful daughter who happens to be my wife. I am very proud to be a  part of their family, and I am proud to stand up and talk about the  Vietnam veterans who deserve our respect.                            Reducing Energy Prices     Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 1 to lower energy costs for New York's 27th Congressional  District.   As an expert in energy and a nuclear submarine officer in the Navy, I  understand firsthand the importance of reliable energy for American  families, businesses, and national security.   I stand here in support of H.R. 1 for the men and women of New York's  22nd District.   A constituent of mine, Steve Turner, shown right here behind me, is a  Marine Corps veteran with cancer who is unable to pay his electric  bills. Five days a week of treatment and soaring energy prices have  brought this hero to his breaking point.   This is unacceptable. I can't cure Steve's cancer, but I will be  damned if I let Steve continue to suffer the indignity of soaring  energy costs taking food off his table.   H.R. 1 takes critical steps to promote American energy independence  and will lower costs for people like Steve and the rest of central New  York and the Mohawk Valley.   Burdensome regulations and radical policies are hurting working and  middle-class Americans through no fault of their own--taking their jobs  and putting our country last. Let's streamline the process by  reinvigorating oil and natural gas production, renewables, and nuclear  energy dominance. The Lower Energy Costs Act is a commonsense solution  to our Nation's energy challenges.   Madam Speaker, Steve and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
