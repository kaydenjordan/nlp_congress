 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 38,  which unconscionably combines a needed reform to improve background  checks  [[Page H9680]]  with a wholesale abandonment of sanity with respect to gun permitting.   The Fix NICS Act would improve notifications about criminal activity  for background checks, which I strongly support. A system, by the way,  that tragically failed prior to the Sutherland Springs shooting.   Unfortunately, this reform is tied to the Concealed Carry Reciprocity  Act, which would endanger millions of Americans and undermine well- established State laws with respect to concealed carry.   My home State of Rhode Island has strong, sensible procedures for  getting a concealed carry permit. In Rhode Island, you must be at least  21 years old, trained in gun safety, and must have just cause to carry  a concealed weapon. Domestic abusers are not eligible.   H.R. 38 would override these commonsense laws, putting our residents  at risk. It would allow anyone denied a permit in Rhode Island to  permit shop in States with weaker laws, and it would allow residents of  States with weaker requirements to carry freely in our neighborhoods.   Mr. Speaker, gun violence is an epidemic in this country. We should  not be taking steps to put more guns on our streets. I urge my  colleagues to heed the warnings of law enforcement officers and reject  this dangerous bill.
