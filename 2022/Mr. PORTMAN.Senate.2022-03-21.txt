 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to stand  in solidarity with the people of Ukraine as they suffer through the  brutal and cowardly Russian assault.   I have spoken on the floor each of the last 6 weeks about the  horrific events we have all watched unfold and what role the United  States should play. Simply put, we need to do more, and we need to do  it more quickly, as do our allies.   As we talk this evening, the shelling and killing of innocent  civilians continues in the dark of night in places like Kyiv and  Kharkiv and Mariupol, a beautiful port city being reduced to rubble by  a frustrated Vladimir Putin. He seems intent on destroying what he  can't have because of the brave, outgunned Ukrainians, who refuse to  surrender and refuse to live under his despotic rule.   Those heroic Ukrainian defenders of their homeland deserve our  support. Even if they didn't, this bloody war launched by an  authoritarian regime against a peaceful, democratic neighbor matters to  world freedom, to our own national security. It must not stand, or else  all of us in freedom-loving countries are at risk.   As we talk this evening, the ruthless bombing continues. Something  else is happening. President Biden is getting ready to cross the  Atlantic to meet with our NATO partners to talk about next steps.  Although nothing has done more to solidify the West than the ruthless  Russian attacks, I commend President Biden for the important role he  has played in helping keep the alliance together. Now, I call on him to  lead that alliance to redouble their efforts to stop the madness, to  ensure that Russia is not rewarded for its war crimes. It is one thing  to keep the alliance together; it is another to lead the alliance out  of its comfort zone to a more aggressive stance to actually win this  war.   I believe moving leaders to do more is possible because of all the  deadly Russian escalation that we have seen but also because free  citizens all around the world are shocked by the death and destruction  that they see online and on TV every day, and they are speaking up. I  see this at home in Ohio, but I see it all around the globe.   I think leaders can be persuaded to do more. Over the past month, the  administration itself has changed its mind and ratcheted up some  sanctions and military assistance that we have advocated from both  sides of the aisle from this Senate floor. To their credit, the  administration reversed themselves and agreed to implement the Nord  Stream 2 sanctions, to allow U.S. Stinger missiles to go to Ukraine  directly from us, to impose the SWIFT banking sanctions, to ban oil  from Russia, and to take away Russia's most favored nation trading  status with us.   Now, with Russia ramping up its brutal assault, targeting and killing  thousands of innocent civilians, America and the free world must do  more--as they bomb maternity hospitals and schools and a shopping  center in Kyiv last night and bomb shelters filled with children.   Last week, I led a bipartisan group of Senators to Poland and to the  Ukrainian border, where we witnessed firsthand the pain that Russia is  inflicting on innocent civilians. We talked to dozens of refugees-- almost always Ukrainian women and children, sometimes grandmothers and  grandchildren. They came to Poland with only a backpack or a suitcase  and nothing else, leaving everything else behind. In tears, they begged  us to close the skies so the bombing would stop. They told of  apartments or homes being destroyed, of the heartbreak of leaving their  husbands or sons or fathers behind to fight the invaders.   So what more can we and our allies do to help Ukraine win this war?  Note, I say ``win this war.'' If we act swiftly, I think we can still  defeat the Russians and keep Ukraine as a viable democracy. If we do  too little, thousands will die, as will the dream of Ukrainian  democracy. The forces of evil will win, and all of us will pay a price.   Let me talk about five areas where I think we could do more to assist  Ukraine. First, on the military side, we must redouble our efforts with  urgency to provide Ukraine with the equipment and munitions and, where  necessary, the immediate training to improve their air defenses and  give them better offensive air capabilities.   The decision whether to facilitate providing more MiG-29s from Poland  and perhaps other allies in the region who have these Soviet-era  airplanes has been hotly debated. In my view, we should have done it a  long time ago, when we got the initial green light from the  administration a few weeks ago.   The Ukrainians have asked for them, and I do not believe they are any  more escalatory than, certainly, the escalation that Russians are  engaged in virtually every day. We now have reports of cluster bombs  being used. We have reports of vacuum bombs being used against  civilians. It is also no different than what we have done and continue  to do with other weapon transfers, whether it is Stingers or Javelins  or others.    Remember, the Ukrainians are on defense here. They are just trying to  protect their country. Give them what they say they need to defend  themselves. I would hope that at least we could immediately facilitate  spare parts and other assistance to keep the current Ukrainian planes  flying.   The Ukrainians have made it desperately clear that they need more air  defense. We just learned today from public sources that the United  States is providing SA8s, an older Soviet-era defense system, to  Ukraine. Apparently, this is equipment that we got years ago--because  it was the Soviet system--to be able to study it. We now have that  system, and as of today, we have decided to send it to Ukraine.  However, the same reporting also said that the more capable S-300  Soviet-era systems that we have are not being sent.   Look, I am very glad these systems are going to protect innocent  civilians, but, to me, this shows the lack of urgency that I was  talking about earlier. Here we are on day 25 of this all-out war-- people dying every single day--and, finally, we have looked into the  closet, and we have in the inventory these incredibly important air  defense systems, and we are providing them? Where were they on day 5 or  day 10 or day 15 or even day 20, with people dying every one of those  25 days?   And why are we not sending the A300s? I don't know the answer to  that. There may be an answer. There may be a reason I can't know what  that answer is. But again, to me, this is an example of us having to  have the urgency to respond and doing more and doing it more quickly.   The United States can and should facilitate the transfer of former  Warsaw bloc anti-aircraft systems that Ukrainians know how to operate,  like the S-300, like the SA8s, the SA10s, and others. There are  regional partners in the area, Eastern European countries, that have  these systems, without going into detail.   We should also provide extra munitions to replenish existing anti-air  batteries. Our partners in the region say they are willing. Let's  facilitate. Let's  [[Page S1267]]  make it happen. Let's get the NATO countries that can help to help  more.   Over the weekend, there were reports, as an example, that Slovakia  and Turkey were willing to take such action. We have got to be sure  that we are ensuring these transfers take place immediately. Of course,  we must also keep sending Stinger missiles, which are effective in  shooting down Russian helicopters and the lower-flying jets.   We must find ways to quickly provide Ukraine with more armed drones,  such as the Turkish TB2, which has been very effective, apparently, and  even one-use loitering munitions, which the Ukrainians know how to use  and have been very effective with on the battlefield.   Last week, it was announced that the United States was sending 100 of  these loitering munitions, one-use munitions, called the Switchblade.  One hundred will go very quickly. We should increase that number. Let's  get the hundred there first, and let's increase that number to give the  Ukrainians more to be able to defend themselves.   To our Israeli friends--I know this is controversial--but I would ask  them to consider selling us or other countries--and we should agree to  buy--their Harop drones, which Ukraine could use right now. The bottom  line is we need to flood the zone when it comes to providing Ukraine  with military assistance.   We are not being asked to fight this fight for them. They just want  the tools to be able to defend themselves and have a chance--a fighting  chance--to be able to win. There should be no gaps in our weapon  transfers, and we need to lead our NATO allies and others when it comes  to providing and coordinating support.   Second, we need more sanctions. We need to implement them faster. The  sanctions have to bite now, not 2 weeks from now or 2 months from now.  We need to remove all Russian banks' access to the global financial  system. Russia must be financially cut off from the rest of the world  if we are to have the effect that we want to have. Even without using  our full sanctions authority, we have already seen some of the pain  that we can inflict.   However, there are loopholes in these sanctions. It is not enough to  go after individual banks, such as VTB and Sberbank. We are told that  the Kremlin has already transitioned payments from these banks through  Rosbank, UniCredit, and Raiffeisen. We need blocking sanctions on all  of Russia's finance and defense industry as long as Russian forces are  in Ukraine.   We need to exert maximum pressure to ensure no money can be sent to  Russia to fund its war effort. We must implement full blocking  sanctions on all Russian banks and ensure energy transactions are not  exempt from these transactions. Russia should not be allowed to use its  oil and gas profits to kill innocent Ukrainians.   We can also target the way Russia, including individuals close to  President Putin, currently evade sanctions. In 2020, when I was chair  of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, we published a  bipartisan report showing how sanctioned oligarchs continued to have  access to the U.S. financial system, in this case, through the purchase  of high-value art. The two oligarchs we investigated were sanctioned in  2014 following Russia's invasion of Crimea.   You have heard that those sanctions weren't particularly effective.  This is one reason. They laundered their money through art. They  continued to purchase millions in art through auction houses and  dealers in New York after they were sanctioned.   In that report, we recommended Congress should amend the Bank Secrecy  Act to require art dealers to confirm the identity of buyers and  sellers in transactions to ensure they are not using the art purchases  to launder money or evade sanctions. These are the same requirements we  place on financial institutions. Those changes are now more urgently  needed than ever. The European Union and the United Kingdom recently  closed this loophole by requiring businesses handling art transactions  valued at 10,000 pounds or more to comply with anti-money laundering  laws, including verifying the identity of the seller, buyer, and  ultimate beneficial owner of the art so that the purchase isn't being  used to evade sanctions.   Since the EU and UK have tightened compliance, the United States,  which has the largest art market in the world, becomes now the main  target for sanctioned Russians to continue to evade sanctions and  launder money through high-value art purchases. If the administration  doesn't move on this, we are currently drafting legislation to close  this loophole in the U.S. Senate.   Third, on tax treatment, we should suspend our tax treaty with Moscow  and explore options to remove other tax benefits from Russian  businesses. The United States has income tax treaties with a number of  foreign countries to facilitate investment and prevent double taxation  of residents and businesses which operate in both countries. Under  these tax treaties, residents, not necessarily citizens, of foreign  countries are generally taxed at a reduced rate or exempt on certain  items of income. It is important to note that these treaties reduce  U.S. taxes on Russian residents and businesses, but they generally  don't reduce the taxes of U.S. citizens or U.S. treaty residents.  Instead, they would reduce Russian taxes for U.S. citizens.   President Biden has the constitutional authority to suspend our tax  treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation. We need to  pursue all options to isolate Russia and make it clear that there are  consequences for their actions. The tax treaty is one more way to do  that.   We should also follow the UK and suspend the exchange and sharing of  tax information with Russia and Belarus. With Russia's hostile actions  toward Ukraine, we should no longer incentivize U.S. investment in  Russia or provide preferential tax treatment for Russian investment in  the United States.   Fourth, on trade, there are two additional things we can do to bring  pressure on President Putin and his allies. Access to our market is a  privilege, not a right, and we should not give Russia the normal  access. The House passed a law to suspend what is called ``most favored  nation,'' or PNTR, for Russia last week, which some in the Senate  oppose because it does not contain a statutory ban on Russian energy  imports. Currently, the energy import ban can be undone at the whim of  a President, rather than the legislative criteria about the restoration  of Ukrainian sovereignty and the cessation of hostilities. So I agree  with putting it in statute. I think that would be a good idea. But I  also believe the urgency of the moment means that we have to find a way  to stop preferred access to our market. Let's do it this week.   The International Trade Commission should also bring the full might  of U.S. trade remedy law to bear on Russian companies which trade  unfairly, similar to how we treat Chinese companies. Last week, I sent  a bipartisan letter with Senator Brown to the ITC on this topic. The  Commission is required by law to consider ``all relevant economic  factors which have a bearing on the state of the industry in the United  States.'' Given Russia's behavior, including its manipulation of trade  flows in pursuit of malign strategic objectives and exceptional  involvement of the state in the domestic economy, we ask the Commission  to take these into account in cases involving Russia when they violate  our trade laws.    The Commerce Department should reclassify Russia as a nonmarket  economy, making it easier to bring unfair trade cases against them. It  is appropriate to reclassify them because up to 77 percent of their  economy is now run by the government. Commerce was asked to reclassify  in the fall but retained Russia as a market economy, allegedly after a  Russian delegation pressured the Biden administration. In light of the  invasion, Commerce should reconsider that decision and ensure that  Russia is reclassified as a nonmarket economy.   Now a handful of countries, like China and Belarus, are in that  category. This means these countries don't have a free market. Instead,  they have policies that restrict the flow of capital, involve  government in the running of the economy, and don't allow wages to be  set by free bargaining between labor and management. When a country is  a nonmarket economy, it means our trade enforcers have an easier time  of being tougher on those countries when they sell products here that  are unfairly priced. It is time to do it.  [[Page S1268]]    Fifth, and maybe most important and most difficult, we need to lead  our European allies on fully sanctioning Russia's energy sector.  Russia's war machine is funded primarily through energy sales,  including natural gas and oil to Europe. Probably the best way to  persuade those persuadable in Russia is to cut off those resources, as  we are doing here in the United States. It is going to be a lot more  difficult for our allies in Europe to do that because many are  dependent on Russian energy. But there are many steps the United States  and other allies, like Qatar, can take to expand energy production here  at home and help our allies abroad. LNG export contracts need to be  finalized now and the export and import terminals quickly expanded. And  that can be done.   Further, the Treasury Department's announcement that sanctions  against Russia's biggest banks, including VTB Bank, do not apply to  energy transactions until June 24--June 24 may be too late. That is  unacceptable. We need to change that Treasury Department approach to  sanctions against those biggest banks and ensure that we are applying  them to energy transactions as soon as possible.   I would advocate for a similar approach in how we designated Iranian  entities in 2018 when we left JCPOA. We did not issue sanctions waivers  to European companies that continued to do business with Iran's  economy, and that forced those companies to leave Iran's market, even  though European governments weren't particularly supportive of that.  That is what happened.   Some countries in Europe have not done enough to diversify their  energy future in light of this invasion, which they are now financing,  again, through the purchase of Russian gas. It can't be business as  usual. We need to figure out a way to stop that revenue.   By the way, there is a connection between the Iran deal and Ukraine.  Under the new Iran deal, secondary sanctions will be lifted on the  Central Bank of Iran and all other Iranian financial institutions,  enabling transactions between Russia and Iran, to include the Central  Bank of Russia, Sberbank, and others. In other words, the Iran nuclear  deal guarantees that Russia can use a sanctions-free Iran as a  sanctions-evasion oasis. This should not stand.   The administration needs to reverse course here. Sanctioning Russia  because of the barbaric war in Ukraine and then giving them a pass when  it comes to the Iran nuclear deal is contradictory to our foreign  policy interests. At the very least, this proposed treaty needs to be  submitted to Congress as is required by law so that we can analyze that  issue and make a decision.   We need to do more, and we need to do it quickly. I have outlined  some of the actions we can take, and we should act fast to let the  people of Ukraine know we stand with them. The popular Ukrainian  rallying cry ``Slava Ukraini,'' when translated into English, is  ``Glory to Ukraine.'' ``Slava Ukraini,'' to which the response is  ``Glory to the Heroes,'' ``Heroyam Slava.''   In the midst of this atrocity, there are so many heroes to glorify in  Ukraine: the soldiers, professionals, and civilians, alike, doctors and  nurses and firefighters and the volunteers who are providing food and  water and blankets. We pray for them all. We pray for their families.   Godspeed to the people of Ukraine in their simple and profound quest,  a battle for a free and independent Ukraine. We must show the world  that America supports that simple quest, that we stand with Ukraine.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
