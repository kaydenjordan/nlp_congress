 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Indiana for  yielding the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think we can all agree that public education plays a  central role in our democracy, helping to ensure the Jeffersonian ideal  of having an informed electorate to participate in the governance of  our country. I think we can also agree that it is vitally important  that parents, as their children's primary caregivers, play an active  role in their kids' education in our public schools.   That is why governance of our public schools is entrusted to local  boards of education, where most school board members are, in fact,  parents and are directly responsible to the communities they serve.   In our fast-paced and online world, the glue that so often holds our  communities together is our neighborhood schools, the parent-teacher  and home and school organizations that support them, and the  extracurricular athletics and activities that we all gather at.   That is why it is so disappointing that the Republican majority has  chosen to bring to the floor a bill that undermines those community  values and does nothing to address the real issues facing America's  schools today.   Contrary to its title, this bill does not give parents any more  rights than they already have. Even the conservative Cato Institute has  criticized this bill for doing nothing to actually empower parents. In  fact, many of the so-called rights this bill claims to establish, like  parents' ability to meet with their child's teachers, testify at school  board meetings, examine school budgets, or protect their children's  privacy, are already enshrined in law and are things school districts  nationwide already do and in which parents consistently participate in.   What this bill does do is promote efforts to inject divisive D.C.  politics and culture wars into our neighborhood schools and create  burdensome new Federal mandates for those schools, dictating to our  local communities and our local taxpayers how and when to perform  certain tasks.   To add insult to injury, this bill doesn't offer any funding to meet  these new Federal mandates or propose resources that would actually  help students and families or support our public schools, many of which  are already struggling to make ends meet under inequitable funding  formulas.   This bill would force schools to invest already scarce time and  resources toward onerous compliance requirements and administrative  costs and away from crucial measures that actually improve student  outcomes, all with no additional money and with no discernible benefit  to our children.   Ultimately, this bill is an act of Federal overreach that would  hinder students' ability to learn and undermine the important work that  educators, librarians, and other school professionals do every day. It  would undermine the valuable relationships among parents and between  parents, students, and teachers, relationships that are built on trust  and shared goals.   The truth is that the primary concerns for too many teachers and  parents are to make sure that their children have enough to eat, a bed  to sleep in at night, and can get to and from school safely. This bill  does not address those critical needs or, for that matter, anything  else that promotes student success and well-being.   What this bill does is open the door to allowing a noisy minority to  dictate what all students can and cannot read or learn, and that hurts  both our kids and our communities.   We have already seen in Florida and other States that have passed  versions of this bill that the provisions buried in this legislation  have allowed rightwing bullies to ban books, gut history lessons, and  marginalize some of our communities.   The beauty of our public schools is that they help our children  become critical thinkers and functional adults by meeting and learning  about the diversity of people, viewpoints, and experiences in the world  around them.   Allowing some parents to dictate their worldview to all parents and  students in our public schools does a disservice to our schools, our  children, and our communities, particularly when, as has been so often  the case recently, those efforts have sought to marginalize people of  color and the LGBTQ community.   Perhaps my Republican colleagues are discounting the opportunities  for parental engagement that are already baked into our public  education system because the views they are pushing, to ban books and  whitewash history, are not accepted by the overwhelming majority of  Americans.   I know how much children benefit when parents and teachers work  together to help them reach their full potential. I know this from  experience. I spent a decade providing training and representation for  parents and students in the public school system. I spent two decades,  while my children attended public schools, as a home and school parent,  a classroom volunteer, and, like my father and sister before me, a  school board member to help not only my kids but all the kids in our  district to succeed.   I often think that school boards are one of the purest forms of local  representative democracy. Unpaid members from the community--most of  them, like myself, parents--spend endless hours working together with  school administrators, educators, and parents, all united by a common  goal to do what is best for all of our children.   Over the years, I had countless conversations with involved parents  and constituents in grocery stores, at school concerts, on soccer  fields, and at formal board meetings about how our schools could best  serve our children and taxpayers, where we could do better, and where  our options were limited, usually by financial constraints.   Those discussions were sometimes emotional or passionate, and people  didn't always agree, but everyone respected our democratic processes  and the boundaries of protected speech as we sought to reach the best  possible solutions for our community.    Those conversations and deliberations also reflected a core principle  of our civil society, one that is important to remember as we struggle  to reduce the hyperpartisanship and lack of civility in our politics  and to model good behavior for our children. That is the principle of  cooperation and compromise, that having the loudest voice or being a  bully doesn't mean that you always get to win.   This bill, H.R. 5, does not help parents, educators, and school  districts to work together more effectively. Instead, this bill pits  parents against each other and against teachers in a way that creates  more chaos and community discord. That hurts students and families,  disregards talented educators, undermines public schools, and detracts  from what should be our ultimate goal, providing the best possible  public education for America's children.   Our national motto is ``e pluribus unum,'' ``out of many, one,'' not  ``my way or the highway.'' We form a stronger and more perfect  community when we bring our diverse talents and strengths together, and  this bill undermines that goal.   I now represent a congressional district with 21 school districts in  it, including one of the largest in the country, and I talk to a lot of  parents in my community.   Parents in my district want to talk about how to help our kids  succeed. They want to talk about hiring enough teachers, librarians,  and guidance counselors. They want to talk about fixing crumbling  school buildings and preparing our children for the jobs and challenges  of the 21st century.   They want schools in our communities that serve the healthy food kids  need to learn and grow, offer mental health resources, and teach the  skills  [[Page H1339]]  that every American needs to be engaged and informed citizens and  taxpayers to ensure our long-lasting democracy.   Overwhelmingly, these parents are appalled that bills like H.R. 5  threaten to open the floodgates to book bans, more restrictions on what  can be said in the classroom, and attempts to rewrite history and  censor facts, all at the expense of our students.   While it sounds benign, this bill will be used to eliminate classroom  conversations about racism in the American story or portrayals of LGBTQ  people in books, all while refusing to deliver on what parents are  actually asking for to keep their children safe, the kind of policies  that House Democrats are bringing to the table to keep children safe  from dangerous toxins like asbestos and lead that are still prevalent  in too many schools and to keep children safe from gun violence, now  the leading cause of death for American children.   We need commonsense gun safety laws that keep weapons out of  classrooms and out of the hands of children so parents aren't scared  that one day they will send their kids to school and they will never  come home.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle often talk about being  the party of small government and local control. They condemn the  intrusion of the Federal Government into local affairs, but this  legislation is nothing more than an attempt to nationalize our  education system and mandate a one-size-fits-all approach across the  country, assuming that the size that fits is a rightwing straitjacket.   Even the conservative Cato Institute has said that H.R. 5 suffers  from a fundamental flaw: It is not constitutional.   We should give young people the resources they need to learn and  grow, not stifle their ideas, threaten their civil rights, censor their  classrooms and teachers, or take books off library shelves. We should  not promote chaos and bullying in our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to enter into the  Record a letter from the American Library Association opposing H.R. 5,  saying that the bill would create a catalyst for more book banning and  censorship.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the distinguished ranking member of  the Committee on Rules.    Mr. Speaker, I wanted to take a minute--or not even a  minute--to correct a couple statements that were made.   First of all, I include in the Record an article from Jax Today  titled: ``Duval Schools to keep 73 `diverse, inclusive' books out of  classrooms.''                      [From Jax Today, Dec. 22, 2022]   Duval Schools To Keep 73 `Diverse, Inclusive' Books Out of Classrooms                            (By Claire Heddles)         Dozens of books the Duval County school district ordered in       the summer of 2021 will never hit classroom shelves. That's       the result of an ongoing review after the district pulled       almost 200 books this spring while the Florida Legislature       passed limits on what teachers can say about race, gender and       sexual orientation in classrooms and set new rules for       purchasing classroom materials.        After a 10-month process--delayed by staffing shortages,       according to the district--47 titles are being returned to       the distributor. Twenty-six others will remain in storage,       awaiting further state guidance.        Among the rejected titles are a book about Martin Luther       King Jr. intended for fourth graders; a biography of Rosa       Parks for second grade classrooms; a first grade Berenstain       Bears book about God; and multiple titles including LGBTQ+       characters and families. District staffers are sending the       rejected books back to the distributor, Perfection Learning,       for exchange.        The rest of the 179 books that had been held for review       were determined to meet ``statutory guidelines and are useful       toward our reading goals,'' and were distributed to       classrooms in October, a district representative tells       Jacksonville Today in an email.        All of the books are from the Essential Voices Classroom       Libraries collection, which the distributor says are meant to       engage students in ``independent reading through these       diverse, inclusive'' stories.        Explore the full list of books that were pulled for review:                                `Banned books'         In September, PEN America, an organization advocating for       free speech, released a tally of books they said were banned       across the country, including more than 550 in Florida, the       second-most of any state. Only Texas banned more.        The list included the Essential Voices books the district       withheld from classrooms. Duval Schools contested the       characterization as a book ban because none of the books was       challenged by the public--the district pulled them before       they ever went on shelves.        Ami Polonsky is the author of one of the recently rejected       books, Gracefully Grayson, a transgender coming-of-age novel       intended for fifth grade classrooms. A teacher herself,       Polonsky believes books like hers are blocked to appease a       small subset of parents.        ``Books can save kids' lives, and to know this, but still       refuse to take them out of storage is nonsensical, it's       immoral. A parenting perspective cannot outweigh a national       mental health crisis among trans children,'' Polonsky told       the School Board this month. ``Books that are ordered with       the best of intentions gather dust, and the LGBTQ children       continue to receive the message that their existence is       controversial.''        Polonsky and two other authors came to Jacksonville to       address the Duval School Board in early December at the       urging of national free speech organizations PEN America, We       Need Diverse Books and Freedom to Read. At the time, the       district had not yet publicly released the list of 106 books       it now says were distributed to classrooms in October.                                New state laws         Another of the authors, Linda Sue Park, wrote a book about       South Sudanese sisters on a two-hour walk to get water for       their family called Nya's Long Walk. Her book was among the       179 titles initially pulled, but it was since distributed to       kindergarten classrooms, according to the district.        Park was in Jacksonville advocating for all the books in       the Essential Voices collection, many of which are written by       authors of color with main characters of color.        ``You never know what book is going to do it for them, what       book is going to hit them, and that's why more choice, more       access, more variety is so important,'' she said.        Duval decided to pull the books for review as it grappled       with limited state guidance for how to implement at least       three new Florida laws that restricted school curricula: HB       1467, HB 7 and HB 1557.        HB 1467, sponsored by Rep. Sam Garrison, R-Fleming Island,       requires school districts to maintain a list of library       materials and make it easier for the public to contest school       books. Districts are also required to have a state-certified       media specialist sign off on new materials.        Starting in January 2023, school librarians and media       specialists will have to complete an online training program       developed by the state Department of Education. In an email       this week, a Duval Schools spokesperson said the remaining 26       Essential Voices book reviews will be the first use of this       training.        ``Once that training [is] released, the district will use       this as a great opportunity to go through this process       applying the required training,'' the spokesperson wrote.        Another new law, HB 7, which Gov. Ron DeSantis nicknamed       the Stop WOKE Act, limited how teachers can talk about race       and  [[Page H1342]]       racism and in the classroom. A federal judge blocked the law       from taking effect last month, calling it ``positively       dystopian.'' The DeSantis administration is appealing the       ruling in federal court.        Though HB 7 is not currently in effect, Duval Schools       blocked multiple books that deal with race and history,       including a Memphis, Martin, and the Mountaintop by Alice       Faye Duncan, about Martin Luther King Jr. and the 1968       sanitation strike; Other Words for Home by Jasmine Warga,       about a 12-year-old Syrian refugee in the U.S.; and Separate       Is Never Equal: Sylvia Mendez and Her Family's Fight for       Desegregation by Duncan Tonatiuh, a children's book about the       fight to end segregation in California schools seven years       before Brown v. Board of Education--the Supreme Court       decision that found school segregation unconstitutional.        A third new law, HB 1557, or Parental Rights in Education,       bans instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity       in first through third grade, ``or in a manner that is not       age-appropriate'' in older grades. Rather than define ``age       appropriate,'' the law that critics call ``Don't Say Gay''       allows parents to sue districts if they believe something is       not.        Polonsky's rejected book, Gracefully Grayson, was intended       for fifth graders. Other books meant for older grade levels       with LGBTQ+ stories are also being sent back, including the       fourth grade book, Rainbow Revolutionaries: Fifty LGBTQ+       People Who Made History, by Sarah Prager, and The Stonewall       Riots: Coming Out in the Street, by Gayle E. Pitman for fifth       graders.        Also in response to HB 1557, the Duval school district       dramatically shrank its LGBTQ+ support guide, removed rainbow       stickers and posters that supported LGBTQ students from       classrooms and took down a 12-minute anti-bullying video that       taught middle and high school students how to support their       gay and transgender peers.        Ellen Oh, author and CEO of the national nonprofit We Need       Diverse Books, says Duval's actions are particularly       concerning because the decisions were made before any parent       complained about the books.        ``It's the secretive, the silent censoring part of it that       is so troublesome to us,'' Oh said ahead of the Dec. 6 School       Board meeting. ``Books that have been banned have been done       publicly. People have challenged books. In this case, these       books were pulled because of fear. We can't live in a society       like that.''     Mr. Speaker, also, it is not the first time my colleague  mentioned the book ``Flamer,'' which he described as a graphic book  about a child at summer camp. In fact, it is a graphic novel, which is  kind of a trend that he may not be familiar with.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Correa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Mrs. Hayes), who is a teacher.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Landsman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Neguse).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Colorado.    Mr. Speaker, there are many issues that we should be  dealing with here.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to provide for consideration of a resolution that  states the House's unyielding responsibility to defend and preserve  Social Security and Medicare for generations to come and to affirm that  it is the position of the House to reject any cuts to these vital  programs.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, Social Security and Medicare are  foundational to our constituents' economic and health security.  Republicans have demanded unconscionable cuts to these programs in  exchange for raising the debt limit and paying our Nation's bills.   Some of my Republican colleagues have recently changed their rhetoric  and now say that they don't want to eviscerate Social Security and  Medicare benefits.   Mr. Speaker, I am offering my friends the opportunity to back up  their newfound position.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Rules Committee, I do feel compelled  to comment upon the amendment process that we have with respect to this  rule and bill.   I am astounded that, once again, the Republican majority has reported  such an imbalanced rule. This rule actually makes in order every single  germane Republican amendment submitted before our meeting yesterday,  but for Democratic amendments, the rule blocks 28 of the 31 germane  amendments offered by the Democrats. That is a 90 percent suppression  rate of the ideas submitted by the minority party, all of which were  compliant with the rules of the House but have been blocked by  Republicans from being debated or voted upon.   The Rules Committee Republicans actually complained about amendment  disparities during the Democratic majority, saying, ``There is no  context in which such a stifling of minority voices is consistent with  the designs of this institution or in the best interest of the American  people we represent.''   That complaint was written after we made in order 30 percent of the  amendments submitted by Republicans to structured rule bills. When we  do 30 percent, it is a crisis for the institution, but when they do 5  percent this month, it is okay.   Speaker McCarthy actually promised both sides ``. . . more openness,  more opportunity for ideas to win at the end of the day.''   Mr. Speaker, that promise has been broken. This Republican majority  knows their bills fail to address real problems, so they continue to  block our good ideas from coming to the floor rather than actually  debating them. It is wrong, and they need to do better.   Mr. Speaker, with respect to H.R. 5, it does not promote the rights  of parents, but it does open the door to censoring teachers and  textbooks, threatening the rights of students and their parents,  imposing costly burdens on our neighborhood schools that they cannot  afford, and infringing on core American values, including freedom of  speech and ideas.   It puts rightwing politics over parents and would let a noisy  minority push their own agenda and impose their beliefs of what  children can or should read or learn onto all parents and students.   Our schools carry out important responsibilities of educating the  next generation of Americans, and all children deserve access to an  equitable and well-rounded education that equips them for the future.   We should give our schools the resources to help young people feel  supported and ready to reach their full potential. We should not create  hostile environments for our most marginalized students. We should not  pit parents against each other and against educators, and we should not  drive wedges between families and their neighborhood schools. I want to  do better than that for our kids, and I hope others today want the  same.   Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous  question and the rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
