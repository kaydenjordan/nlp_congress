 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman  from South Carolina, the Honorable Ralph Norman, be permitted to take  the oath of office today.   His certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest  and no question has been raised with regard to his election.    Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege, as dean of the South  Carolina delegation, to introduce to this Chamber Representative Ralph  Norman.   Mr. Norman is from Rock Hill in York County, South Carolina. He is a  real estate developer, a graduate of Presbyterian College, and  previously served in the South Carolina Legislature. He and his wife,  Elaine Rice Norman, have four children: Warren III, Caroline, Anne, and  Mary Catherine.   Last Tuesday, June 20, Mr. Norman won the special election in South  Carolina's Fifth District to fill the vacancy created when former  Congressman Mick Mulvaney became Director of the Office of Management  and Budget.   Now it is my pleasure to yield to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Wilson), representing the Second Congressional District, for  further introduction.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Norman).
