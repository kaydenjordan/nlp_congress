 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  permitted to complete my remarks prior to the recess.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with respect  to the Fudge nomination, the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the  nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to be United States Attorney  General and to describe some of the greatest challenges confronting the  U.S. Department of Justice.   The DOJ, as it is often called, is unlike any other Federal Agency.  It is charged with protecting the constitutional rights and civil  rights of all Americans. The past 4 years, to put it mildly, broke the  longstanding precedent that has enabled the Department of Justice to  operate above the political fray.   The Trump Justice Department joined a misguided lawsuit to take away  healthcare coverage for tens of millions of Americans. The Trump  Justice Department oversaw a cruel set of immigration policies that  separated young children from their parents at our southern border and  locked these children in cages. And the Trump Justice Department  remained painfully silent as our Nation cried out for racial justice in  the wake of the murder of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man.   After the firing of Attorney General Sessions, the Attorney General  of the United States became the Attorney General for Donald Trump. When  our Nation's top law enforcement official becomes little more than a  political fixture for the President, it erodes the principle of equal  justice under the law and calls into question the mission of the  Department.   In the waning days of the Trump administration, with nearly half a  million Americans dead from the coronavirus, a swarm of White  supremacists and other extremists stormed our Capitol, including this  very Chamber, and disrupted our peaceful transfer of power. Tragically,  five people died during the January 6 insurrection, including a United  States Capitol police officer.   Our Nation must now bring the perpetrators to justice and address the  root causes in our society that enable White supremacists and other  extremists to fuel hate and violence.   The next Attorney General cannot shy away from these historic  challenges. The next Attorney General must meet these challenges head  on to restore integrity to the Justice Department and to work every  day--every day--to restore the trust of the American people.   President Biden has nominated Judge Garland--not just one of the  finest public servants I have ever met but one of the finest people I  have ever met--to be Attorney General of the United States. His name  should be familiar to many of our colleagues because President Obama  nominated him to serve on the Supreme Court in 2016. At the time, I  called him perhaps the most qualified individual ever nominated to be  on our Nation's highest Court, and I still believe that to this day.   Judge Garland graduated at the top of his class at both Harvard  undergrad and Harvard Law School. He clerked for Justice Brennan on the  Supreme Court, and after a time in private practice, he worked at the  Department of Justice, where he prosecuted the perpetrators of the  Oklahoma City bombing. Judge Garland called this, and I quote him,  ``the most important thing I have ever done in my life.''   In 1997, Republicans and Democrats joined together to confirm Judge  Garland to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, which is often called the  ``second highest court in this land.'' Judge Garland has served  honorably and dutifully for the past 24 years on the DC Circuit,  including several years as its chief judge.   Judge Garland has gained the respect of all of his colleagues--left,  right, and center--as someone who knows the law and never allows  politics into the courtroom. Judge Garland works to  [[Page S1446]]  build consensus and find principled compromises. Judge Garland will  bring a wealth of legal, law enforcement, and judicial experience to  the Department of Justice to make him uniquely qualified--uniquely  qualified--to lead the Department at this critical moment.   Judge Garland will be an Attorney General for all Americans--all  Americans. He will not shy away from the challenges facing the Justice  Department. He will meet them head on.   At the top of Judge Garland's to-do list is bringing the perpetrators  of the January 6 insurrection to justice. Judge Garland will make sure  that the Department stays out of the political fray and remains  independent from the White House. And Judge Garland will answer the  calls for racial justice and refocus the Department on one of its core  missions, to protect the civil rights and voting rights of all  Americans.   While I will never truly forget the shameful treatment of Judge  Garland during his previous nomination to serve on the Supreme Court  and in my heart I will always believe he should be serving on the  Supreme Court today, I am grateful that Judge Garland has answered the  call to serve.   I am also grateful to his wife of many years. I am grateful to his  family for supporting him and allowing him to serve us as he has. He is  more than just a judge or attorney or a servant. He is a mentor. He is  somebody who, every week, for years--20 years--has made time, found  time in his life to mentor a kid who needs somebody in his life or her  life. As someone who has been mentored for many years myself, I just  want to say: God bless you. God bless you, Judge Garland. My hope today  is he will get a resounding--resounding--vote out of this body. He has  earned it. He deserves it.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, we have just invoked cloture on the  nomination of Michael S. Regan, President Biden's nominee to be  Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The vote was 65  to 35. To every Democrat and every Republican and maybe an Independent  or two, I want to thank you for your vote.   I rise today to talk about this nomination and, more particularly,  about the person, the man who has been selected to serve as our EPA  Administrator.   As Members of this deliberative body, each one of us has taken an  oath to protect and defend our U.S. Constitution. That oath includes  offering our  [[Page S1447]]  advice and our consent when it comes to nominations of the President to  fill posts in his or her administration.   It is hard to think of a time in modern history when the Senate's  role on nominations could be considered more urgent. We live in a time  of great challenges. Our Nation faces multiple crises all at once. This  includes the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic--the first in 100 years of this  nature--the worst economy since the Great Depression, as well as the  reckoning of racial injustice. All three of these crises are  interconnected with a fourth that is even greater and graver than any  emergency the United States may have ever faced before, and that is the  climate crisis--the climate crisis.   President Biden recognizes the importance and urgency of tackling  this challenge. That is why he ran with a promise to make climate  action a core of his administration's work and of our work. It is also  part of the reason why a record-setting majority of the American people  voted him into office last November.   There are few leadership roles in the Federal Government that have  greater responsibility for setting environmental and climate policy  than that of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  This role has a profound responsibility--a profound responsibility--to  ensure that the Agency effectively carries out its mission to protect  our health and our environment.   That mission is particularly challenging right now. We know that the  next EPA Administrator has his work cut out for him. He knows it as  well.   In addition to addressing the serious environmental issues that are  affecting Americans, the next EPA Administrator will also need to  rebuild an Agency suffering from organizational drift and low morale  after being repeatedly damaged in recent years by flawed leadership.   Scientific integrity has also been under attack. We need a strong,  principled leader to get the EPA back on track.   Michael Regan is the right person for the job at this critical  moment. He is a man of deep faith who believes, as I believe we all do,  that we have a moral obligation to be stewards of this planet on which  we live together. Michael Regan is the kind of person who can help  unite us in common purpose as we respond to the climate crisis we face,  as well as to clean our air, clean our water, and strive to make sure  that we don't leave some of our communities and some of our neighbors  behind in our efforts to do so.   He knows how to put together inspired teams of men and women who are  mission-focused and can together tackle complex problems and  challenges.   As Secretary of North Carolina's Department of Environmental Quality,  he has proved himself to be an effective policy executive and  bipartisan problem solver, someone who forges practical solutions to  clean our air and clean our water, while making and building a more  nurturing environment for job creation and job preservation.   Anyone who has watched the EPA over the past few years knows that Mr.  Regan will have his hands full as Administrator. From scandals to  climate denial, to the unrelenting disregard for the opinions of career  scientists throughout EPA, the past two Administrators leave in their  wake a frustrated workforce, suffering from organizational drift and  low morale at what may be an all-time low.   One of the keys to restoring that morale is returning scientific  integrity to the Agency. Let me say again: One of the keys to restoring  the morale in the EPA is returning to scientific integrity. That also  means curbing the influence of special interests on EPA's scientific  advisory boards, which play a large role in crafting the Agency's  policies.    Mr. Regan will be tasked with combating climate change, the greatest  environmental crisis we are facing as a world today. On this issue, we  have no time to waste. I know my State, Delaware, does not have the  luxury to wait a minute longer. We have the lowest lying State in the  country. The State is sinking, and the seas around us are rising.   We are not the only State in which that has happened. This is felt by  other States across the country too. One unlikely State you might find  it in is Louisiana. Louisiana, according to John Neely Kennedy, one of  the Republican Senators here, told me last month, he said his State,  Louisiana, is losing--get this--a football field of wetlands to rising  sea levels every 100 minutes. Think about that, a football field of  wetlands to rising sea levels every 100 minutes.   I see the signs of this crisis too clearly as I travel throughout my  State. Madam President, eroding shorelines, waterlogged roads, and  extreme weather threaten our economy and our way of life. Erratic  weather patterns make farming some of our biggest crops--and we raise a  lot of soybeans, and I know in your State you raise a couple of  soybeans as well, but we raise a lot of soybeans. It makes farming,  whether raising soybeans or corn or chickens, a lot more difficult.   Mr. Regan saw similar problems around another Wilmington--not  Wilmington, DE, but Wilmington, NC--a problem similar to what we see  every day in Wilmington, DE. He understands that we do not have to  choose between economic growth and clean air and clean water. It is  indeed a false choice.   He knows, like many of our world's leaders, that combating this  crisis presents, instead, a chance for real economic growth--real  economic growth that can create millions of good-paying American jobs  and breathe life into communities large and small throughout this  country.   And we know that the economic cost of spending a little today more  than outweighs the cost of inaction. I believe it was Ben Franklin who  once said that ``an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.''   I know we all think that is a quote that comes from our grandmothers.  It actually came originally from Ben Franklin.   As EPA Administrator, Mr. Regan will also need to work with States,  with Tribes, and with municipalities to combat contamination in our  Nation's water supply from something called PFAS, one of thousands of  permanent chemicals. Some are benign. Some of them are very, very  dangerous to our health. They are called forever chemicals.  Unfortunately, this is a critical public health issue that the last  administration did not approach with the urgency it deserved. They  talked a good game but didn't come through. What do they say in  Montana? ``All hat, no cattle.'' That is what we saw with respect to  these permanent chemicals in the last administration.   This has hit home for me, and my guess is it hits home for the  Presiding Officer, too, in Wisconsin. But coming from a State--we have  got military installations, one of the biggest airbases in the world,  Dover Air Force Base. I am hugely proud of Dover Air Force Base. It may  be the best airlift base in the world. And, for years, we have,  unfortunately, occasionally, had incidents, accidents, and we need to  have firefighters come out, and they use firefighting foam to try to  save lives. And in doing that, it endangered the lives of other people  because of the PFAS contamination that is in the firefighting foam, and  it gets into our groundwater.   And it is not just Delaware. It is not just Delaware. It is not just  Wisconsin. It is like, last I heard, hundreds, maybe 300 bases around  the country where there is a problem with PFAS contamination in the  groundwater close to our military bases.   If his work in North Carolina on this issue is any indication, Mr.  Regan will leave no stone unturned. We will also be looking to the EPA  Administrator to ensure cleaner air by reestablishing the legal basis  for the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, which were upended by an  administration more interested in protecting special interests than  they were keeping mercury out of our air and our water supply.   These standards have been shown over time to be cost-effective, and  they are supported by major coal-fired utilities across this country.  Let me say that again. These standards have been shown over time not  only to be cost-effective, but they are supported by major coal-fired  utilities across this country.   As Administrator, Michael Regan will also oversee the phasedown of  something called HFCs, powerful greenhouse gasses used as a  refrigerant--think refrigerators, freezers,  [[Page S1448]]  air-conditioners in our house and our cars. They do a good job of  keeping it cool and our food cool. Unfortunately, they are about 1,000  times worse, more dangerous than carbon dioxide is to greenhouse gas-- 1,000 times worse.   Last Congress, I was proud to help lead a bipartisan effort with a  couple of our Republican colleagues, John Neely Kennedy and John  Barrasso, to phase down the production of these harmful chemicals while  giving American manufacturers a leg up in making the coolants of the  future.   How many jobs will flow from this? Tens of thousands of American  jobs. How much economic opportunity for American companies? Billions  and billions of dollars. And, oh, by the way, I should hasten to add,  you know, we hear from scientists that tell us that we are sort of at  the turning point for us in terms of climate change by which we can't  turn back. It is about 2 degrees Celsius for the balance of this  century--2 degrees. Our phasedown of hydrofluorocarbons is worth a  half-degree Celsius just by itself, just this one thing. So this is a  huge thing, and we did it in a bipartisan way here in the Senate and  the House. I am very grateful to everyone for their support.   Let me add a couple of more points, if I can. Mr. Regan will need to  help craft emission standards for cars, trucks, and vans that will  fight climate change and help keep America in the lead in the clean car  revolution. We heard not long ago from our friends at GM. GM announced  that beginning in 2035, they are not going to be building and selling  vehicles powered by gasoline or diesel. Think about that. That is like  14 years from now. I think Ford may have announced in Europe that they  are not going to be building vehicles that drive or are powered by  gasoline or diesel. In Europe, by 2030, like I said, 9 years, this is  coming.   So the question is, Will we be ready for it? Will we take advantage  of it? Will we be able to find, in this adversity of climate change, an  economic opportunity? Yes, we can and especially with respect to the  kinds of vehicles that we are going to build and drive into the future.   Michael Regan's tenure in North Carolina is, I think, a testament to  his ability to bring people together and work across the political  divide. He spearheaded what is considered to be the largest coal ash  cleanup settlement in U.S. history. He successfully led the  negotiations that resulted in the cleanup of the Cape Fear River, right  where my wife used to work for the DuPont company, the Cape Fear DuPont  plant. And he created North Carolina's first-ever Environmental Justice  and Equity Advisory Board.   Mr. Regan has been able to do these things and much more by bringing  people together to find bipartisan, lasting policy compromises, all  while never compromising on his principles. He and I both believe in  the adage that bipartisan solutions are lasting solutions, and we could  use a few more of those around here.   That ability to unite people in common purpose, to approach his role  as a public servant with humility, with empathy, and with grace, that  central part of Mr. Regan's character has been demonstrated throughout  his public service and his nomination process   Interestingly, 23 of our country's national agricultural  organizations wrote to my committee--to our committee, the Environment  and Public Works Committee--to recommend him for the job. Most people  might say: Well, big deal. Well, it was a big deal. How often do we  have like dozens of major national agricultural organizations stepping  up and saying, ``We want to embrace this candidate to be the head of  the Environmental Protection Agency''? Not very often, but they did in  this case.   They highlighted his ``established record of listening to all  stakeholders, including farmers and ranchers.'' And they applauded his  pragmatic approach, writing that ``during his tenure, he has worked to  find practical, sound solutions to myriad environmental issues in the  state.''   We heard this same sentiment in his nomination hearing before the  Environment and Public Works Committee. Throughout his testimony and  questioning, Mr. Regan made it clear that he will be an EPA  Administrator for red States just like he will be an EPA Administrator  for blue States. He listened to concerns from both sides of the dais  and made commitments to work with anyone to solve a problem facing  their constituents.   That is what helped earn him a 14-to-6 bipartisan vote of approval  coming out of the EPW Committee. I remember us measuring the amount of  time from someone's name being actually submitted by a President to,  actually, before we even had a hearing, much less got somebody reported  out--measured in months, in months. In this case, we are talking about  weeks, and, God willing, hours this afternoon.   Believe it or not, his committee hearing before the committee a  couple of weeks ago, he was introduced to the committee by two Senators  from his State. You may think that is not a big deal, maybe not, but  they are both Republicans. They are both Republicans. We heard from one  of them, Thom Tillis, that Mr. Regan ``has earned a reputation for  being a thoughtful leader willing to engage.'' His colleague from North  Carolina Senator Burr underscored Mr. Regan's ability to listen, saying  that organizations across North Carolina and across the country support  Mr. Regan for Administrator because ``they understand they will not  always agree with every decision handed down by EPA, but they know and  trust they will receive a fair hearing.'' This is a Democratic nominee  recommended by two Republican Senators from the same State. Honestly, I  don't see that every day, and I want to say a special shout-out thanks  to Richard Burr and Thom Tillis for doing that, supporting Mr. Regan's  nomination.   Michael Regan understands that climate change shouldn't be a partisan  issue. Its impacts hit red States and blue States alike. Wildfires rage  across California, while floods in Florida damage homes and roads.  Deadly ice storms endanger the power supply in Texas, while a drought  in New Mexico harms farming and puts people at risk. Water  contamination near an Air Force base in Delaware harms families just  like contamination near a National Guard base in South Dakota. And  dirty air from a powerplant in Ohio or West Virginia can make their way  into neighboring States like ours and like Maryland, our neighboring  State, like New Jersey.   The problems that are before our next EPA Administrator--and,  hopefully, it will be Michael Regan--those problems are great. As  Albert Einstein once said, ``In adversity lies opportunity.'' Think  about that--in adversity lies opportunity. We have an opportunity here  to fulfill our moral obligation to be good stewards of this planet, and  we can seize on that opportunity if we have the right leader in place  to make it happen.   During my years in the Navy, then as Governor of Delaware, I learned  firsthand that leadership is maybe the most important thing in the  success of any organization I have ever been a part of. I don't care if  it is a business; I don't care if it is a State; I don't care if it is  the Senate or House, a hospital, a school, leadership is always the  key--always the key. The leader sets the tone, helps write the rules of  the road, and makes sure that those working under him or her are doing  what is right.   I learned a lot from really good leaders, and, frankly, I have  learned a few things from really awful leaders. I suspect, if truth be  known, we would all say the same thing. The best leaders are humble,  not haughty. They have the heart of a servant. They understand their  job is to serve, not to be served. Leaders have the courage to stay out  of step when everyone else is marching to the wrong tune. They  understand their job is to unite, not divide. They build bridges, not  walls.   Leaders surround themselves with the best people they can find. When  the team does well, the leader gives the credit to his or her team.  When the team falls short, the leader takes the blame. Leaders don't  build themselves up by tearing other people down. They are  aspirational. They appeal to people's better angels.   I remember a French philosopher, Albert Camus, once said that leaders  are ``purveyors of hope.'' Think about that, purveyors of hope. Leaders  always seek to do what is right, not what is easy or expedient. They  focus on excellence in everything they do. If it is not perfect, they  say: Let's just make it better. Leaders treat other people the way  [[Page S1449]]  they want to be treated. And, finally, when leaders know they are  right, they are sure they are right, they don't give up. They just  don't give up.   Michael Regan is that kind of leader. We need that kind of leader,  and I am convinced that he is the leader we need for his critical role  at this critical time in our Nation's history.   So, Madam Chair and colleagues, as chairman of the Senate Committee  on Environment and Public Works, I urge all of my colleagues to support  his nomination.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
