 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Sergeant  First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our PACT Act.   We have an urgent moral obligation to take care of the men and women  who have served and sacrificed in uniform to defend our Nation. I have  seen the impacts of burn pit and toxic exposure hazards firsthand both  as a U.S. Army soldier in Iraq and also as somebody who has served  alongside others in the Veterans' Affairs Committee and who have  constituents today who are suffering from those ailments.   This comprehensive, bipartisan package will expand VA coverage; and  to those 3.45 million toxic-exposed veterans, provide the VA additional  resources so it can better care for our veterans and also create the  framework for establishing future toxic exposure-related presumptions  of service connection so we don't have to go through this again.   I am especially proud that a bill I introduced last year with my  colleague from Michigan, Congresswoman Slotkin, the Veterans Burn Pit  Exposure Recognition Act, was included in this final package.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to supporting final passage of this  bill, and I encourage all my colleagues to ensure its swift passage.  With this bill, we will make good on the promises we made to our  Nation's servicemembers and veterans.
