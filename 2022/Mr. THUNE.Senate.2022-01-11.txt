 Mr. President, later today, President Biden will be  speaking in Georgia as part of Democrats' effort to convince the  American people that voting rights are under attack so they can justify  their attempt to abolish the Senate filibuster to pass their partisan  election legislation.   A noted Democrat operative once famously said that you should never  let a good crisis go to waste. He meant, of course, that a crisis could  give you the opportunity to push things through that you might not be  able to get done in the ordinary course of things. It is a lesson the  Democrats have learned well.   Last March, for example, Democrats used the cover of the COVID crisis  to pass a so-called COVID relief bill that had very little to do with  COVID relief and had a lot to do with expanding the role of government  and providing payoffs to Democrat constituencies.   But, unfortunately for Democrats, when it comes to election  legislation, there is no crisis for Democrats to exploit, so Democrats  have spent the past year busily trying to manufacture one. I say the  past year, but Democrats have actually been claiming there is a voting  crisis for much longer.   The source of the election bill that we will likely vote on this week  is H.R. 1--election legislation that was first introduced by Democrats  back in 2019. Back then, Democrats told us that our election system was  broken and that we needed this bill to fix it. After all, a Republican  had won the last Presidential election and beat a favored Democrat  candidate. Surely, surely, that meant our system was in trouble. But  then the 2020 elections came along, and Democrats won the Presidency  and a majority--albeit a narrow majority--in both Houses of Congress.  Voter turnout was massive, and a Pew Research Center poll found that 94  percent of people found it easy to vote--94 percent. So all of a  sudden, it was pretty  [[Page S125]]  difficult for Democrats to claim that our system was broken. But they  still wanted to pass their election legislation, so they came up with a  new crisis.   In 2021, a number of States passed updates to their voting laws-- partly because of the challenges and special circumstances that arose  as a result of the pandemic. Democrats decided that these commonsense,  mainstream updates represented an unprecedented attack on voting  rights.   Georgia, which was one of the first to enact voting legislation, has  become the poster child for the Democrats' campaign to convince  Americans that their voting rights are in danger.   So what terrible voter suppression measures are States imposing?  Well, one provision of the Georgia law that has come in for a lot of  Democrat outrage is its measure forbidding partisan political  organizations from providing individuals with food or water within 150  feet of a polling place. Yes, apparently preventing partisan political  organizations from providing lunch to voters threatens the very  stability of our entire democracy.   Now, nothing in Georgia's law prevents outside groups from providing  food and water to individuals outside the 150-foot radius, and  Georgia's law explicitly allows nonpartisan election workers, as  opposed to political groups, to make water available to voters. Of  course, I am pretty sure any voter can bring his or her own food and  water. But none of that has prevented Democrats from suggesting that  rules about food and water distribution at polling places represent a  grave threat to voting rights.   Ironically, the State of New York has a similar provision in its  election law prohibiting any refreshment or provision to a voter at a  polling place except if the retail value of what is given is less than  $1 and the person or entity providing it is not identified. Yet I don't  see the Democrats traveling to New York to decry the threat to  democracy posed by the New York Legislature.   After Georgia passed its voting law, President Biden got up and  attacked the law for supposedly ending voting early to prevent working  people from voting. He made that accusation repeatedly. The problem?  There was exactly zero truth to his claim. In fact, as the Washington  Post's Fact Checker column pointed out, ``experts say the net effect of  the new early-voting rules was to expand the opportunities to vote for  more Georgians, not limit them.''   That is from the Washington Post's Fact Checker. Let me just repeat  that:         [E]xperts say that the net effect of the new early-voting       rules was to expand the opportunities to vote for most       Georgians, not limit them.    The Fact Checker gave the President four Pinocchios--a rating the  column reserves for ``whoppers''--for his false claim that the law was  designed to keep working Americans from voting.   I would also like to point out that not only is Georgia's election  reform law thoroughly mainstream, Georgia's laws are actually more  permissive in some respects than voting laws in some Democrat States.   Georgia offers no-excuse absentee voting. The Democrat leader's home  State--Senator Schumer's home State--does not. In fact, voters in the  Democrat leader's home State actually just rejected a ballot measure  that would have allowed no-excuse absentee voting. I guess the Democrat  leader thinks that those voters are trying to destroy our democracy.   Georgia also has way more days of early voting than the Democrat  leader's home State. So does Arizona, another State that has come under  fire from Democrats for updating its election laws. Yet red States,  according to Democrats, are the States attempting to suppress votes.   It is also important to note that the Georgia law was written to  address concerns from Republican and Democrat voters, including  concerns raised by Stacey Abrams-affiliated groups over the 2018  Georgia gubernatorial election.   There is no question--no question--we should make voting easy and  accessible, but there are a lot of different ways to do that. States  can have different requirements and still all offer ample opportunities  to vote.   Also, I think my Democrat friends need a little perspective check.  There are countries where individuals would consider it a privilege to  be able to stand in line to vote in a free election--even if someone  didn't provide them with food and water.   Of course, no one wants voters to have to stand in long lines, and,  in fact, Georgia's election law will make it less likely that they have  to. But Democrats' dramatic claims that a long line or a lack of a drop  box or, say, 9 as opposed to 10 days of early voting somehow threatens  the right to vote in this country are nothing short of absurd. I have  faith that Americans are capable of voting even without the Democratic  Party providing them with a boxed lunch.   There is no election crisis in this country. This last election-- biggest turnout in American history in 120 years. You have to go back  to the year 1900 to find a time when the election turnout in an  American election was equal to or exceeded what we had in 2020. What  there is, is a partisan Democrat election bill the Democrats have  wanted to pass since long before the Georgia Legislature reformed their  election laws because they think it will give them an advantage in  future elections. You don't have to take my word for it; more than one  Democrat has openly admitted the Democrats want to pass a Federal  election takeover because they think it will give their party an  advantage in the next election.   If Democrats were really concerned about the security of our  democracy and the integrity of our elections, if they really cared  about affirming Americans' faith in our electoral system, they would  not be seeking to break the Senate rules to pass a totally--totally-- partisan election bill on a totally partisan basis. A partisan Federal  election takeover is not going to do anything to strengthen Americans'  faith in our system. On the contrary, it will sow mistrust and division  and heighten partisanship.   Instead of changing the rules to gain an advantage in the next  election, I would suggest that my Democrat colleagues instead try  coming up with an agenda that would appeal to a broad majority of  Americans--perhaps starting with a plan to address the inflation crisis  the Democrats have helped create. That would be a far better use of  their time than undermining faith in our electoral system with a  partisan rules change and a partisan Federal takeover of elections.   I yield the floor.
