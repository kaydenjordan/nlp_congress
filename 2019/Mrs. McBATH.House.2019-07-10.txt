 Madam Speaker, today, I am proud to introduce the Relief  for Defrauded Students Act. This bill would give students the  opportunity for a quick and fair process for loan forgiveness against  schools that defrauded them.   Borrowers defense is especially important to me after the closing of  Argosy University's campus in my district this past March. The 1,500  students who were affected were left with incredible debts but no  degree to show for it.   Students should focus on getting the quality education they were  promised, not worrying about being saddled with large debts from  schools that could not and did not deliver on their education promise.   I am proud to lead the Relief for Defrauded Students Act with my  colleagues, Representatives Abby Finkenauer, Katie Porter, Cindy Axne,  Mary Gay Scanlon, and Sharice Davids. Together, we will protect our  students and hold these institutions accountable.                            ____________________
