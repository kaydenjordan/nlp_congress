 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Penn State Wrestling, the 2023 NCAA Division I National  Champions and recognize their two individual champions, Carter Starocci  and Aaron Brooks.   Continuing their dominance of NCAA wrestling, the Nittany Lions  brought their 11th national title to Happy Valley and concluded their  seventh perfect dual meet season.   Led by Coach Cael Sanderson, Penn State Wrestling reflects a culture  of excellence in their athletic preparation and competition.   Penn State's two individual champions are a testament to not only the  strength of their program, but to their personal strength, talent, and  determination.   Aaron Brooks took on the number one wrestler from northern Iowa to  secure his third straight national title at 184 pounds, while Carter  Starocci defended his number one ranking to win his third national  title at 174 pounds. Their teammates, Roman Bravo-Young, Levi Haines,  and Greg Kerkvliet joined them in the competition at the finals.   As a graduate of Penn State, I am proud to congratulate Penn State  Wrestling on winning the 2023 National Championship and their continued  success.                            ____________________
