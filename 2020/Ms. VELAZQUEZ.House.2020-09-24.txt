 Mr. Speaker, I rise to express support for our  Nation's public school systems, particularly, our K-12 institutions  that are grappling with a frightening reality.   Unfortunately, the coronavirus pandemic has posed an unprecedented  threat to our schools and without additional further assistance, they  cannot afford to take necessary safety measures to reopen.   For example, according to a recent Government Accountability Office  report, 4 of 10 districts need to update or replace HVAC systems in at  least half of their school buildings. The Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention has identified proper ventilation as a key consideration  for schools seeking to reopen safely.   Today, it has been 6 months since New York City Public Schools and  many others across the Nation were shuttered. The decision to close our  schools was necessary and slowed the disease's spread, saving lives.   However, I understand this was a difficult decision for many families  because of the vital support services that schools provide.   Not only is the school system where young people learn, but they also  serve as a vital community anchor, providing nutritional assistance,  special education, teacher support, and childcare. We all want schools  to reopen for our students, but it must be done safely, and that  requires additional Federal resources.   In March, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act and the  Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security, or CARES Act, were  signed into law. Both measures help address the urgent challenges  facing every part of our education system. These funds help educators  adjust to long-term school closures, fund purchases for online learning  materials, and provide a lifeline for public schools.   While the relief bills enacted so far took steps in the right  direction, the magnitude of this pandemic demands more. Four months  ago, the House passed the HEROES Act which will go even further.  Without the HEROES Act, budget shortfalls are projected to reach nearly  $500 billion for State governments alone.   The Senate's inaction has resulted in no relief for State and local  governments, which are now being forced to make deep cuts to public  education. Without significant Federal funding, our schools cannot  upgrade buildings, provide PPE, continue virtual or blended learning,  and, ultimately, safely reopen.   As the public health crisis has worsened since the passage of the  HEROES  [[Page H4895]]  Act, the amount of funding needed to repair and modernize school  facilities for the safe reopening has grown. My colleagues and I are  now fighting for $300 billion to safely reopen our schools and maintain  services for students.   Today, I am calling on the Senate to act immediately and pass a  comprehensive relief package that provides significant resources to  safely reopen our schools and protect students, staff, and families.   We must guarantee the academic achievement and basic development  needs of our youth. However, we must also care for the safety and the  mental and physical health of our students, educators, staff, and  families.   At every level of government, we must do more for our teachers, our  school administrators, and the families who depend on critical services  provided by our public school system. That is why the Senate needs to  stop obstructing and pass meaningful legislation for our Nation's  families.                            ____________________
