 Madam Chair, I rise today for Myra Thompson  and Susie Jackson, people who were murdered in their church during a  Bible study. And I rise for the tens of thousands of Americans who will  die if Congress does not close the Charleston loophole.   In 2015, the FBI reported that more than 270,000 guns were sold  because the NICS system failed to issue a ``do not sale'' order within  3 days.   One was sold to a man with a hate-filled heart, as we have heard. He  walked into Mother Emanuel church in Charleston, South Carolina, a  historically Black church, and murdered nine people who were simply  seeking to get closer to their God.   Madam Chair, we have seen this time and time again. Our houses of  worship are not safe from gun violence: Mother Emanuel, First Baptist  Church in Sutherland Springs, Tree of Life, Oak Creek's house of  worship, and the list goes on and on.   We talk about PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder. Just recently, I  heard someone in the Chicago area talk about PTSD, but it was  ``present-traumatic stress disorder'' because of all the guns that are  in the streets in the hands of people who should not have them.   Madam Chair, today, I challenge my colleagues to do the right thing:  Pass this bill and save lives. Pass this bill and prevent dangerous  people from getting guns. Pass this law because you never know if it  will be your son or mother who could be next, gunned down by doing  something as routine as praying.   Today, we need to do the right thing. Today, we need to pass H.R.  1112. Today, we need to honor the Emanuel 9 and close the Charleston  loophole.
