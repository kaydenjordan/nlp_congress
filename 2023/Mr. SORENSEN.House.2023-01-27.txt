 Mr. Speaker, this past Sunday, we marked the 50th  anniversary of Roe v. Wade. I remain outraged by the Supreme Court's  decision to rip away the fundamental right to safe and legal abortion.  [[Page H474]]    Already, States have implemented abortion bans, leaving women  desperate to access reproductive healthcare. Thankfully, States like  Illinois have access still available.   In the wake of the Supreme Court's extreme decision, I have heard  from women all across central and northwestern Illinois, mothers and  grandmothers, who are devastated that their daughters and  granddaughters will grow up in a country with fewer rights than they  had.   Mr. Speaker, I tell them that I will never stop fighting for a world  where everyone has the freedom to make their own healthcare decisions.   Uncle Sam has no place in a doctor's office.   Finally, to the women in my district and across this great Nation: I  am with you. I will fight for your rights and your freedoms to be  protected.                            ____________________
