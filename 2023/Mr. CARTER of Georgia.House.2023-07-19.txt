 Madam Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of  Bobby ``Blue'' Smith.   On Thursday, June 22, 2023, Ware County lost not only a beloved  member of their community but also a brave hero.   Bobby ``Blue'' Smith was born on July 12, 1998, in Waycross, Georgia,  to Bobby Green Smith and Crystal Blue Freeman. After he graduated from  Pierce County High School in 2017, he began working for the Ware County  Fire Department as well as Hodges Plumbing and Walker's Lawn Care.   Blue was a light in his community. He was a follower of Christ who  took every opportunity to love and uplift his family and friends as  well as strangers.   He enjoyed fishing, hunting, and spending quality time with his  family, and he never missed an opportunity to ride buggies at Fat  Daddy's ATV Park.   Blue bravely served his community for years, and he will be deeply  missed by everyone who was blessed enough to know and love him.   He is survived by his parents and siblings along with many other  relatives and friends who loved him dearly.                            ____________________
