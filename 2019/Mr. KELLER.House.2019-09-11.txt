 Mr. Speaker, today I introduced H.R. 4279, to name the  post office in Laceyville, Wyoming County, Pennsylvania, after Melinda  ``Mindy'' Gene Piccotti.   A native of Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, Mindy was an  Air Force veteran who knew the struggles combat veterans and wounded  soldiers face when returning home from duty.   Starting in 2009, at the age of 60, Mindy highlighted her commitment  to our Nation's Armed Forces by creating Hunts for Healing, based out  of Laceyville.   Mindy founded Hunts for Healing to help wounded soldiers returning  from military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other combat areas  transition back into civilian life by allowing them to experience the  joys of hunting, including social interaction and camaraderie.   With the assistance of volunteer guides and funded entirely by  private donations, Hunts for Healing helps veterans in need of  physical, spiritual, and emotional support.   For the impact of her life and for her continued legacy in the  veterans' community, I urge Members to support H.R. 4279 and name the  post office in Laceyville, Pennsylvania, for Melinda ``Mindy'' Gene  Piccotti.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Kansas  yielding to me.   I stand before you today representing the outstanding people of  Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District to call upon the Speaker to  bring up and my colleagues to pass the United States-Mexico-Canada  Agreement, otherwise known as USMCA.   Back in Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District during the August  work month, I heard from our farmers our manufacturers, and energy  producers, all of whom would benefit from the passage of the USMCA.   Their message to me was clear: We need to complete this trade deal so  we can continue hiring, growing wages, and keep this economy rolling.  The benefits of the USMCA to our agriculture community are critical.   Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District is home to over 10,500  farms, 98 percent of which are family farms. Moreover, our district is  responsible for 18 percent of Pennsylvania's agricultural sales.   During August, I visited Brown Hill Farms in Tunkhannock. I met with  dairy producers at an ag-dairy summit with USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue  and my colleague, Congressman G.T. Thompson.   I also attended Penn State's AG Progress Days, Pennsylvania's largest  outdoor agricultural exposition. At each visit, dairy producers said  the same thing. The USMCA agreement would greatly benefit them by  eliminating Canada's Class 7 milk, allowing American dairy farmers to  once again sell milk ingredient products in Canada.   Canada and Mexico have taken steps to finalize this agreement. What  is stopping the United States from doing the same? Right now, the  agreement is sitting on Speaker Pelosi's desk.   Let's be clear. Failure to bring up the USMCA for a vote is a failure  to stand up for American jobs, American workers, and American families.   That is a shame because one thing that Members of Congress share is  that we want to do what is best for our districts and for our country.  Our constituents sent us here to work on things that will actually help  people. USMCA will do that by prioritizing American jobs, American  goods, and American workers.   I thank Congressman Estes for organizing tonight's Special Order on  USMCA. Let's work on things that can actually help people. Let's work  on things that can have a positive impact. Let's pass the USMCA.   Mr. Speaker, let's get this done.
