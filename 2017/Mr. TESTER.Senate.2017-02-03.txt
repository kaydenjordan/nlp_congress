 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today to address the potential  confirmation of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education. I rise today not  just as a Senator from Montana; I am a former public school teacher, a  former public school board member. I have a mother who was a teacher  and an aunt who was a teacher. I have a daughter who is a teacher. I  have a sister-in-law who is a teacher. I have a number of teachers in  my family. They all have either taught at or currently teach at public  schools. When I was growing up, education was a critical part of what  we developed into. Public education was something that my parents  thought was very important. That was instilled in them by my  grandmother, who over 100 years ago immigrated to this country from  Sweden, due in part to the public education system we have in this  country today.   When I came home from school every day, my mother would quiz me on  what went on in public education. By the way, I went to the same school  she did. She would find out what had transpired, both the interactions  with the kids and what went on academically in the school, and also  offer me a hand if I needed help with the academic portion. We would  talk about my experiences in the public school because it was  important. She knew it was important.   She was the daughter of a homesteader. When she was a child,  homesteading wasn't exactly looked upon kindly by the ranchers of the  community. They thought homesteaders were taking away their right to  make a living--breaking up that good grass and putting wheat on it,  making it so cattle couldn't continue to graze there. There was a lot  of friction between ranchers' and farmers' kids. They all went to the  same public school. In my particular case, it was Big Sandy Public  Schools. In the environment of that public school, those kids learned  to get along. What resulted from that was the ``greatest generation.''  We live in a world today due in much part to their figuring out a way  to get along, figuring out a way to communicate, figuring out a way to  make the world a  [[Page S673]]  better place. That was due I think entirely because of the public  education system we have in this country today.   Our public education system is--and this cannot be argued--the  foundation of our democracy. When I was growing up and the Vietnam  conflict was going on and there were conflicts around the world,  everybody said: You know, these countries need to have a democracy. And  then there was a realization that without an educated population,  democracies really don't work.   We have had a democracy in this country for nearly 250 years because  of the success of our public education system. We have had a middle  class in this country that has been the envy of the world because of  our--listen to me--public education system. It is the foundation of our  democracy, it is the foundation of our economy, and it is a place where  we learn to live together peacefully.   What is troubling about the nomination of Betsy DeVos as Education  Secretary is that she wants to privatize this public education system  we have. I had her in my office. We talked about vouchers, and we  talked about privatizing education. We talked about accountability. Her  response to the public education system was that it was failing. Her  response to that was, pull a few kids out. Pull the kids out who don't  have any disabilities, pull the kids out who are a little smarter, and  put them into a classroom, and that will be what makes this country  great again. This country is already great, and if we do that, I am  here to tell the people of the Senate today that we will destroy the  foundation of this country and we will destroy--it may take a few  years--we will destroy our democracy.   It would be different if Betsy DeVos had spent 1 hour, 1 minute, 1  second in a public education classroom. She was not educated in public  schools. She has not dealt with public schools. I dealt with it as a  teacher. I dealt with it as a school board member for 9 years. In fact,  my second public service job was on the Big Sandy School Board. It is  important because my first one dealt with soil and soil conservation,  and my second one dealt with education. She has been in neither of  those positions. Quite frankly, it doesn't matter that she wasn't in  those--except it does because if you don't touch base with what is  going on and see the successes that are happening in public education,  you can have a warped view of what is going on in this country right  now, and that warped view will cause you to do things like say ``You  know what, we are going to put up charter schools, we are going to have  vouchers, and ultimately we are going to take away public education as  we know it today.'' Instead of saying ``You know what, we are going to  invest in accountability, we are going to invest in teachers' salaries,  and we are going to invest in a 21st-century education system so our  kids can compete,'' the answer is ``No, we are going to pull kids out  of the school.''   I am going to tell you a secret. I taught in the late seventies. I am  far from a master teacher; I taught for a couple of years. I quit  teaching because I could do anything else in society and make more  money. I could cut meat for a day and make as much money as I made  teaching school for a week.   Wouldn't it be a little bit smarter, instead of privatizing the  schools, as Betsy DeVos wants to do, to invest in those schools? Let's  give the kids the maximum opportunity we can give them. Let's value  public education, and let's value education.   I am going to tell you what happens in a rural State like mine with  privatization. My school system in my hometown of Big Sandy has about  175 kids. That is not an exception for Montana; there are a lot of  schools that have 175 kids or fewer. By the way, that is not high  school; that is K-12. Let's say that for whatever reason, somebody  wants to set up a charter school a few miles down the road and suck a  few kids out of Big Sandy and maybe suck a few kids out of the Fort  Benton school system and a few more out of the Chester system. Pretty  soon, they have their little charter school, and there is less money to  teach the kids who are left in those public schools. What do you think  is going to happen to those kids who are left there? That is going to  take away from our public education system. Ultimately, it will cause  those schools to close because the money that funds our education is at  a bare minimum right now.   The other thing that has happened in our public education system is  that Congress--people here--has made the promise to local schools to  fund kids with disabilities, the IDEA Program, things we can do to help  fix public education. Let's fund what we promised--40 percent. It is  funded at 16 percent right now. So if we had a person who was going to  go in as Secretary of Education and said: You know what, this is a  problem, and we are going to fight to make sure that folks have the  money from the Federal level to be able to teach the kids; and we are  going to live up to our promise; and, by the way, IDEA is a good  program that needs to be fully funded, and the Federal Government needs  to do their part at 40 percent, I may have a different opinion. But  that is not what she wants to do. She, in fact, wants to do something  far worse than that.    She told me she wanted to block grant the money for IDEA, which would  further put another nail in the coffin of schools around the country,  and then put three or four in the rural schools.   It has been documented here earlier this morning that the phones have  been ringing off the hook. They have been ringing off the hook opposed  to Betsy DeVos. There are 1 million people who live in Montana. Over  3,000 people have contacted me opposing her. I have had 20 contact me  to support her. Phones are ringing off the hook. In fact, the phones  are ringing to the tune of 1,200 to 1,500 calls a day. The phone system  has shut down. There are some Senators who aren't even answering their  phone because they don't want to hear it. But the truth is that public  education is important in this country. People know what is at risk  here. To have somebody who has never spent any time in the classroom of  a public education system is asking for catastrophic results.   I am going to read a few comments from people in my great State who  have sent me emails and letters about Betsy DeVos. Here is one from  Melee in Missoula:         Mrs. DeVos has no place in our national education system.       She is clearly not prepared nor does she even have the most       basic experience to do this job well. Our students, teachers,       and parents, deserve an excellent candidate, and she is not       it.    Kelly from Laurel:         As a mother of an 11-year-old daughter, the thought of this       woman in charge of our Nation's school system scares me.    Sandy from Billings:         It would be nice to have an Educational Secretary who has       actually worked, I say WORKED, in education instead of some       rich woman who has never spent a day in public schools.    Kim in Kalispell:         We need an Education Secretary that knows what the I-D-E-A       Act actually is and the needs of rural school districts. We       can do better and our kids deserve better.    Jenessa from Froid wrote me quite a long letter. I think it is  particularly poignant, so I want to read this to you. It is a little  bit long, but I think it is very clear. I want to back up a little bit  and tell you that Froid is a very small town, not unlike Big Sandy. It  doesn't have a lot of kids, but it has great people. Here is what  Jenessa says:         After marrying my husband, a local farmer, in August 2010,       I put down my roots with plans to spend my entire teaching       career in Froid. With Mrs. DeVos pushing for private school       funding, our small school will be one of the first to suffer.        Having two small boys that will be soon entering into their       school years, they will be the third generation to walk the       halls of Froid Public School. I want them to be able to spend       all 13 of their public school years in the same school.        As an educator, I have seen what a small rural school can       do for a student. While we may not get the same opportunities       as large schools, when the opportunities knock on our door,       we have a large percentage of students take advantage.        They have pride in their school and their community.       Montana is currently suffering from teacher shortage. With a       lack of funding, this shortage will only get worse.        I am currently in the process of earning my Masters degree       in Educational Leadership. With this degree, I have been       given the opportunity to become the principal of our small       school. A school my family attends, my roots are dug, and I       do not want a woman like Betsy DeVos having control over [our       school].        Please vote no. A vote for Betsy is a vote for private       control. A vote for Betsy is against the community of Froid.  [[Page S674]]         A vote for Betsy is against Froid Public School. A vote for       Betsy is a vote against public school teachers across this       country and against the great State you represent. A vote for       Betsy is a vote against my family. A vote for Betsy is a vote       against me.    Mary from Red Lodge:         As a 32-year veteran educator in a rural public school, I       am deeply concerned about the appointment of Betsy DeVos as       Education Secretary. I'm inclined to say that her loyalty and       financial backing of Mr. Trump were the reasons for the       misguided appointment and not her experience and knowledge in       education issues.        To be in such an esteemed position as Education Secretary,       one would expect years of experience and an advanced degree       to understand the ongoing issues we face in U.S.       education.    Sara from Billings:         As a first grade teacher in a low-income school, I believe       wholeheartedly in Montana's public schools.        Betsy DeVos believes in school privatization and vouchers.       She has worked to undermine efforts to regulate Michigan       charters, even when they clearly fail.        The marketplace solution of DeVos will destroy our       democratically governed community schools. Her hostility       towards public schools disqualifies her.        She will not work to provide a free and fair education to       my students who struggle every day with hunger, with       homelessness, and more. I am asking you to vote against the       confirmation of Betsy DeVos.    But I have heard from far more than that--from parents to  grandparents, to doctors, to average Joes who oppose this nomination.  Education is something that affects everybody's life. In my opening  remarks, I talked about the need for public education for democracy to  work and exist. As a former school teacher and as a former board  member, I can tell you that there are a lot of things we can do to make  public education better, and we ought to do it.   There are hard things to do. It is much easier to say: Let's just  destroy the program and privatize it, and then see what we end up with.  That would be a bad decision, and that is why we should not vote for  Betsy DeVos.   The impacts are huge. They are huge on our economy, they are huge on  our form of government, and they are huge for us being a leader in this  free world we live in.   In closing, I want Montanans to know that we have heard you. You  called, you wrote, and you contacted me on Facebook and Twitter. Your  message has been loud and clear. It is a message that we are hearing  all across this country. It is a message that, quite frankly, if we  confirm this lady, will not make America great again. In fact, it will,  over time, destroy this very country that we love.   As to people who I talk to who say: The Secretary of Education  doesn't matter; it is not going to affect me--I don't know whom you are  kidding. The fact of the matter is, this will affect every school in  every community in this country.   We can say President Trump got elected, and he needs to have the team  that he wants. I am not going to vote for a team that destroys the  public education system in this country. I would not be doing a service  to the people who came before me--the previous generations--and I  certainly would not be doing a service to my kids and my grandkids and  the generations to come after. This is a very important decision. If we  want to do the tough work of debating our public education system and  determining how we can make it better, get the best people in the  classrooms, and get the best academic material in there for them to  work off of, let's do that. But let's not destroy the public education  system that has made this country great for generation after generation  after generation.   I urge my colleagues to stand with the thousands of Montanans and the  millions of Americans who have told us to vote no on Betsy DeVos.   Madam President, I yield my remaining postcloture debate time to the  Senator from Washington, Mrs. Patty Murray.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
