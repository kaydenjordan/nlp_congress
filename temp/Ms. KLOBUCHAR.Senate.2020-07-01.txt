 Mr. President, I thank Senator Inhofe so much for his  allowing me to say a few words. I know it is his time. And I thank my  friend Jack Reed.   Today is July 1, which means that rent and mortgage payments are due,  and as I speak today, so many families across this country are being  forced to make the difficult decision about how they will make this  month's payment to stay in their homes.   Even before the pandemic began, almost one-fourth of all renters, or  11 million households, were forced to pay more than half of their  income for housing--half of their income. According to the National Low  Income Housing Coalition, more than half a million people experienced  homelessness on a  [[Page S4114]]  given night before the pandemic, and that has just gotten worse.   That is why I am a strong supporter of Senator Brown's Emergency  Rental Assistance and Rental Market Stabilization Act, which will  provide $100 billion in emergency funding. I am also proud to support  Senator Reed's bill as well as the work of Senator Menendez.   The pandemic, as we know, has wide and longstanding racial  disparities in housing. We had a 30-percent gap in Black and White  ownership rates before the pandemic due to discriminatory practices,  and it has only made it worse.   St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, a leader and a good friend, has  repeatedly reminded us that this means investing in programs like  section 8 housing, which still remains unavailable to so many families.   Yes, we need to address this shortage of affordable housing. We need  to take action now. I thank my colleagues. We have an opportunity. The  Fourth of July is at the beginning of July, but by the end of July, we  had better have gotten something done, and that means help our State  and local governments; that means funding for elections; and that means  making sure we are responding to the crisis in housing.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from  Michigan for her leadership on the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry  Committee, helping to pass and leading the last farm bill in the  Senate, along with Senator Roberts and so many of us who are on that  committee.   We understand that rural America is hurting right now, and rural  America is actually part of the solution as well for so many people who  are hungry and who need help.   This pandemic and its economic impact has left 41 million Americans  unemployed and strained the financial security of hundreds of thousands  of families across this country.   I have always worked to ensure, from the minute I got on the  Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, that we focus on  nutrition. Programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program--or, as it is known, SNAP--are the place to do this: to provide  meaningful relief to families, children, senior citizens, veterans.  People all over this country, people who never thought they would be  out of a job, people who used to--and I heard this story in Minnesota-- volunteer in food banks, now they are standing in line at food banks  because they unexpectedly lost their jobs.   Many of us have seen this. I have visited these food banks. Even  before the pandemic, more than 37 million people, including more than  11 million children, were living in a food-insecure household.   Analytics released by the national nonprofit Feeding America in April  [[Page S4124]]  projected these numbers to increase this year to more than 54 million  people, including 18 million children.   The 350 food shelves in my State operated by Second Harvest Heartland  are seeing double or triple the number of visitors. So this weekend, on  Sunday, I visited one of our biggest food shelves, Second Harvest  Heartland, with Director Allison O'Toole, with a number of people who  were working there around the clock. They just released a study. What  the study said is that before the pandemic 1 in 11 Minnesotans were  living with hunger. Now, they project for August--only a little over a  month from now--that one in eight Minnesotans will be food insecure-- one in eight.   They said, tracking our State's history back to the Great Depression,  they have never seen anything like this since the Great Depression--not  even the economic downturn 10 years ago, not the ups and downs in  unemployment that we have seen in our rural areas, the farm crises up  in Northern Minnesota--nothing like they are projecting to happen.   July begins with the Fourth of July. The Fourth of July is when we  celebrate our country. We celebrate what America means. My hope is that  we will end July by actually passing the Heroes Act. I know we are  going to negotiate it, colleagues. I know we will make changes over  what passed in the House, but we cannot let our States go bankrupt. We  must help local areas.   I was on the phone today with our friends in the Fargo-Moorhead area,  and we have seen it there too. We have seen it all over our State.   The SNAP program was originally designed to respond to changes in the  economy by expanding to meet increased need during economic downturns  and contracting as economic recovery alleviates the need for food  assistance.   Under the farm bill that was signed into law under Senator Stabenow's  leadership in 2018, we preserved this critical lifeline. The conference  report, which passed with 87 votes in the Senate and 369 votes in the  House of Representatives, avoided making cuts to benefits or changes to  eligibility that would take away benefits or create obstacles.   At this difficult time, we should ensure that we are getting  assistance to all of those who need it, not put up new barriers--not  with what we are seeing with more COVID cases in the southern part of  this country and in the western part of this country.   In fact, the facts and the numbers bear out that we should be  increasing those benefits. The House has taken action to do just that  by passing a 15-percent increase in SNAP benefits during the pandemic.  That is what they did in the Heroes Act. That is what we should do  here.   At the same time, the middle of a pandemic is the wrong time to be  cutting SNAP benefits or kicking participants out of the program, and  that is why I have called on the administration to withdraw rules that  would take these benefits away from families in need.   As for food deserts, again, the pandemic has simply put a big, fat  magnifying glass on a problem that already existed, and that is that  23.5 million Americans live in a food desert where the absence of a  grocery store within 1 mile of their home makes it more difficult to  purchase fresh, nutritious food.   Low-income Americans and people of color are much more likely to live  in a food desert, and people in rural areas live in these food deserts  all over America   That is why Senator Brown and I wrote a letter with 20 Senators  urging the Department of Agriculture to prioritize these programs  intended to minimize food deserts and support local and regional  efforts for these projects.   We cannot overlook the capacity needs of food shelves, and that is  something I talked about with our friends at Second Harvest Heartland  just this weekend.   The WORK NOW Act is something that--I appreciate Senator Wyden is  here as one of the cosponsors, along with Senator Brown and Senator  Schatz--supports nonprofit organizations, to make it easier for them to  hire people who are actually out of work, who could then help other  people.   It is why I joined Senator Stabenow and several of my colleagues in  the Agriculture Committee in introducing the Food Supply Protection Act  to help food banks increase their capacity and strengthen partnerships  to prevent food waste while feeding more families.   One of my predecessors, Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, whose desk  I stand in front of today--his name is carved in the desk--served on  the Agriculture Committee. He grew up in a small town in South Dakota.  He became a professor eventually, but his father was a pharmacist. He  understood the importance--growing up in that family, seeing the ups  and downs of rural America--of stable government policy for both  agriculture producers and families struggling to put food on the table.   He was a leading advocate of Federal nutrition programs and played an  instrumental role in the passage of what was then called the Food Stamp  Act of 1964, which turned what was then just a pilot program into the  permanent program we know today.   He knew that the moral test of government is how government treats  its most vulnerable citizens: those in need, those who are seniors,  those with disabilities.   He once said this: ``We will be remembered not for the power of our  weapons but for the power of our compassion, our dedication to human  welfare.''   In these times of uncertainty and with rising food insecurity, we  need to work to ensure that the nutrition needs of our most vulnerable  citizens are met.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I rise to honor the life  of Marny Xiong, who served as chair of the St. Paul school board and  was a beloved member of the community taken from us too soon on June 7,  2020. As one person put it, Marny wasn't just well-liked, she was well- loved.   Those who knew Marny best described her as someone with a joyful  spirit who was great at making other people laugh. Mayor Melvin Carter  of St. Paul may have said it best when he noted that she ``embodied our  city's spirit, gave her heart to our students, and worked tirelessly to  uplift the voices of the unheard.''   The daughter of Hmong refugees whose parents fled Laos to a refugee  camp in Thailand before arriving in Minnesota, Marny and her eight  siblings grew up in St. Paul and attended St. Paul public schools, Her  father earned a high school diploma as an adult, opening career  opportunities for him and showing Marny firsthand the value of  education and hard work.   Marny Xiong represented the best of us, driven by a simple mission to  do good and to give back. As the chair of the St. Paul School Board,  she demanded equity for her students--and fought for justice for all  people across our State. During the Covid-19 pandemic that sadly took  her life, she took on the fight against hate crimes against Asian  Americans and hateful rhetoric about the virus. She stood up against  these acts of hate that threatened the lives and dignity of so many in  Minnesota.   Marny led St. Paul's school board and Asian American elected  officials in condemning xenophobia and denouncing racism, saying:  ``While they brew hate, we're building a powerful movement for  change.'' Marny understood that there are more students to help, more  teachers to respect, more communities to support, and more justice to  deliver. Marny wasn't afraid or intimidated to take on these  challenges. She was resolute and determined to enlighten those who  engage in the politics of fear and division. That is Marny's legacy and  what we have inherited from her.   Marny Xiong is a role model and an inspiration and will be sorely  missed, but as we mourn her loss today, tomorrow we can honor Marny's  legacy by building on the movement to which she committed her life, a  movement to see a better, more just, vision of our communities and our  country, Marny's movement.   Thank you.                            ____________________
