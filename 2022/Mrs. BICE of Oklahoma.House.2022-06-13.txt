 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  release of the third coin in the American Women Quarters Program which  features Oklahoma's own Wilma Mankiller.   Ms. Mankiller lived an inspiring life, which has had a lasting impact  on Oklahoma and beyond. Hailing from the Cherokee Nation, she was hired  as an economic stimulus coordinator and founded the community  development department.   Through her incredible work, she became the first woman elected as  Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation. Under her leadership, she  revitalized the Tribe's economy, education systems, and health and  well-being programs.   Her remarkable leadership made the Cherokee Tribe a national role  model, but she didn't stop there. After leaving office, she remained an  advocate for women across the globe. She received the Presidential  Medal of Freedom, the highest honor given to civilians in the U.S., and  was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.   Ms. Mankiller's commitment to bettering her community and society as  a whole is truly inspiring. May her legacy continue to live on forever.                            ____________________
