 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote  against the extremist Republicans' default on our debt act.   The legislation, offered by Speaker McCarthy, really begs the  question: Is this what we stand for?   The default on our debt act means a 22 percent cut to our education  system, our students, and our Nation's competitiveness. Is this what we  stand for?   It means a 22 percent cut to the VA, cutting law enforcement,  including healthcare for America's brave; cuts to State grants to fund  the prosecution against domestic violence. Is this what we stand for?   It makes a 22 percent cut to the Special Supplemental Nutrition  Program for Women, Infants, and Children that feeds 53 percent of the  infants in the U.S. and ensures they have nutritious food to survive.  Is this what we stand for?   It is certainly not what I stand for, and I plan to vote ``no'' on  the legislation.
