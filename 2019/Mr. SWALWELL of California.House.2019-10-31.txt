 Madam Speaker, ``I would like you to do  us a favor, though.''   President Trump said those 10 words on July 25 to Ukraine's President  before asking Ukrainian President Zelensky to investigate a potential  political opponent.   For the past month, the Intelligence Committee has led an  investigation into what happened around that phone call. In this early  investigative stage, we have heard powerful, corroborating evidence  that President Trump led an extortion shakedown scheme over the  Ukrainians, leveraging $391 million of taxpayer dollars to have a  foreign power assist him in his upcoming campaign.   Just as powerful as the evidence we heard is the courage of the  people who have come forward to provide it, defying lawless White House  orders to obstruct and, instead, adhering to lawful congressional  subpoenas.   The evidence, however, is not a conclusion. At this stage, we must  move now to a public process with due process protections for the  President to secure and test that evidence.   When our Founders designed the Constitution, they considered a  lawless President and how to hold that person accountable. James  Madison said the Constitution needed a provision for defending the  community against lawlessness. Now we must solemnly embark upon this  journey.
