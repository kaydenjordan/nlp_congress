 Mr. Speaker, I am joined today by Jared Huffman from  California. And eventually, I think, Brendan Boyle from Philadelphia,  the home of the new NFC champions, is also going to join us.   What we are going to talk about is: What are the Republicans afraid  of? What is it they are hiding? What is it they think is going on with  respect to this investigation of the President and his ties to Russia?   It starts from the very beginning. This time last year, we asked the  President: Are you going to turn over your tax returns so that people  can see what is in your tax returns; whether you have relations with  the Russians, or who knows who?   Every President for the last 40 or 50 years has turned over their tax  returns. But, of course, the President did not turn over his tax  returns and has refused to turn over his tax returns.   The first thing you ask is: What is in there? What are you hiding?   Now, what we see is a concerted effort by the Republicans in the  Congress and in the White House to smear and disparage hardworking law  enforcement officers in the FBI, in the intelligence community, and the  Department of Justice, who have been tasked with trying to figure out  whether or not Russia involved itself criminally in our elections last  year and whether or not there is any implication of the Trump campaign  with respect to those particular efforts by the Russians.   We need to make sure that Russia does not hack into our elections,  does not participate in a way that favors one party over another or one  candidate over another.  [[Page H673]]    These investigations started and the first thing the President did  was fire Jim Comey from the FBI. Through a process, the Justice  Department then appoints a special prosecutor, a special counsel, to  continue this investigation.   Since that has occurred, there have been a couple of indictments and  a couple of plea agreements. Michael Flynn, who was the intelligence  head for the President, has faced part of this investigation. There was  Paul Manafort and Richard Gates, who were involved in the campaign, and  then George Papadopoulos.   But that is just the tip of the iceberg. All these people, both on  the Trump campaign side and all of these Russians, have played some  kind of a role, and this investigation must be pursued.   My friends on the Republican side of the aisle can complain, can  stomp their feet, can throw mud at the individuals who are asked to do  these investigations, but these investigations must continue so that  the people understand exactly what happened and to make sure that the  Russians are not allowed to participate and infiltrate and affect our  elections once again.   There are just a couple of questions: What are you afraid of? What  are you hiding? Is there a coverup of some kind here?   The bottom line is: just let our law enforcement individuals do their  detective work, do what they were asked to do, and leave them alone and  let it be done. If it exculpates and proved that nothing happened, then  great. But if there is some wrongdoing here, America needs to know  about it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from northern California (Mr.  Huffman).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from California for  his comments. He was talking about a memo.   One of the former chairmen of the House Intelligence Committee, a guy  named Mike Rogers, was also a panelist, I think, on a CNN program.  Apparently, this memo is going to be released today against all sorts  of norms with respect to the Intelligence Committee and classified  information. His words were, releasing a memo like this is farcical.   It is a mistake. It starts to undermine so many things with respect  to our intelligence community, the trust that we have with our allies,  and all of it to kind of put up this smoke screen. They go after the  law enforcement agents, who are the detectives on the beat. Now they  are releasing information that is incomplete and, in Mike Rogers's  words, ``farcical,'' to try to distract, divert, avoid the real  conversation, which is: What did the Russians do? How did they play in  the elections? Was there any kind of cooperation, collusion, whatever  it might be, with the Trump campaign?   We know that Bob Mueller was appointed. He has been a lifelong  Republican. Everybody embraced his position as special counsel when it  first came about, but quickly the President was  [[Page H674]]  thinking about firing him. Now people want to smear all of this: It is  a mistake.   The real question is: What are you hiding?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan  F. Boyle), my friend from Philadelphia, who is a pretty happy camper  because his Eagles are going to be playing in the Super Bowl on Sunday.   Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank my  colleague and friend for his belief early on in the season in the  Eagles, despite the fact he is a die-hard Broncos fan. The Super Bowl  will be a nice diversion from the seriousness of the subject that we  are discussing and debating tonight.   Let me take us back a bit to a couple of events that, yes, may have  happened a little bit before I was born, but I know well as a student  of American history. I fear that we are on the verge of repeating them,  possibly only days away on the verge of repeating them.   In October 1973, the Watergate investigation was being conducted by  the special counsel, Archibald Cox. It had been going on, at that  point, for most of 1973. On a Saturday night, President Nixon decided  to fire the special counsel, in part, because the special counsel was  doing his job and was getting too close to uncovering the conspiracy.   President Nixon ordered his Attorney General to fire the special  counsel. The Attorney General proved to be a profile in courage and  refused. It then went to the Deputy Attorney General. The Deputy  Attorney General refused. Finally, the number three man, the Solicitor  General, named Robert Bork, decided that he would follow what President  Nixon wanted and fired Archibald Cox. That became known as the Saturday  Night Massacre.   When John Chancellor, then the anchor for NBC News, came on the air-- and I was recently rewatching this--he said: Tonight, I utter words I  never thought I would say, but we are in the midst of the greatest  constitutional crisis in the history of the Republic.   I fear that history may very well repeat itself. We now know, since  we were last in session--and it has been reported and confirmed by many  media outlets, including FOX News--that President Trump has ordered his  own White House attorney to fire the special counsel.   Why? If the President really has nothing to hide, then why would he  fire the special counsel and want to bring this process to an end? It  gets back to the very first question that my colleague from Colorado  has asked: What does he have to hide?   I sincerely hope that the special counsel will find and will prove  that nothing happened. That would be the best outcome and best course  for all of us as Americans. But, boy, if the President is innocent, he  sure isn't acting like it.   We must come together--as Democrats and Republicans second, but as  Americans first--and do what is in the best interest of justice and of  this country and say that the special counsel must be allowed  to continue his work until its natural conclusion.    If the President moves to fire the special counsel, that, by its very  definition, is obstructing justice. This body and the other body on the  other side of this building cannot allow that to happen.   Here is the good news. In Watergate, ultimately, the American people  didn't let it happen. There was such an outcry on a bipartisan basis  that, within 48 hours, President Nixon had relented and appointed  another special counsel, Leon Jaworski, who ended up being just as  dogged, pursued the President all the way to the Supreme Court. Then  the Supreme Court ruled, unanimously, that President Nixon had to hand  over the tapes even though three of the eight Justices were Nixon  appointees.   President Nixon, actually, to his credit, complied with that Supreme  Court order and released the tapes, including a few tapes that clearly  proved he was guilty--the so-called smoking gun--and, within about a  week or two, resigned in August of 1974.   We can prevent that history from repeating itself if we act here in  Congress to ensure there is a proper procedure in place to protect the  integrity of this investigation. If that does not take place, there  will be, I predict, an outcry of the American people you have not seen  or heard since October 1973. This country and its institutions are a  heck of lot more important than any political party, and it is about  time all of us in this body act in such a way that shows we believe in  those words.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for  the history lesson he just reminded us about. His words are ones that I  don't think I can add anything to.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman),  my friend, if he has anything else to add.   But I just want the Speaker to know and I want this Chamber to know  that we are not going to go away. We are not going to allow things to  be hidden. We are not going to allow things to be covered up. This has  got to run its full course, just as my friend said.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from  engaging in personalities toward the President.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 56 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, January 30, 2018, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.
