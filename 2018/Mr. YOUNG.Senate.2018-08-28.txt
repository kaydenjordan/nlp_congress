 Mr. President, I wish to rise today to formally  recognize the retirement of Indiana Senate Pro Tempore David Long. The  former Fort Wayne City councilman has over 30 years of public service.  He has spent the past 22 years as State Senator representing Senate  District 16 and the  [[Page S5990]]  past 12 sessions as the chamber's leader.   Senator Long's accomplishments while serving as president pro tempore  are a testament to his leadership. He has presided over property tax  caps, a series of personal and corporate income tax cuts, the expansion  of charter schools and the creation of private school vouchers, and  passage of right-to-work law and the Healthy Indiana Plan. Senator Long  also has a lengthy record of fiscal prudence and acting as a good  steward of hard-working Hoosiers. His legislative accomplishments were  married with his consistent production of balanced budgets. Under his  tenure, Indiana achieved one of the lowest unemployment rates in the  Nation, while also boasting some of the lowest property taxes and  income taxes in the union.   I know that I add my voice to a chorus of those that have sang  Senator Long's praises and expressed their appreciation for his  exemplary service when he announced that he will formally step down on  November 6. His steadfast service to his fellow Hoosiers and his  leadership of the senate lead to long lasting success for our home  State. I wish Senator Long and his wife Melissa a very well-deserved  and happy retirement.   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the service of Indiana  Senate Pro Tempore David Long for his years of unwavering service as we  wish a fond farewell to a true titan in the history of the Indiana  Senate.                            ____________________
