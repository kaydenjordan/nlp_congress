 Mr. President, I would like to highlight the  outstanding accomplishments of Lt. Zachary Hodges of Gainesville, FL.  Four years ago, I nominated this impressive young man to attend the  U.S. Air Force Academy.   I recently received a letter from Zachary letting me know that he has  graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy--a major milestone that his  family and friends should be very proud of.   Zachary also said he plans to attend medical school at the University  of Florida and looks forward to serving our Nation as an Air Force  physician.   I am very proud to have nominated Zachary, who has already  accomplished so much at the age of 22. His enduring commitment to his  studies and his country is a testament to his will to succeed and  serve. I have no doubt he will inspire others around him to do the  same.   I wish Zachary the best of luck and look forward to hearing of his  continued success; I am sure he has a very bright future ahead. May God  bless him and all of the men and women who serve our Nation in the  Armed Forces.                            ____________________
