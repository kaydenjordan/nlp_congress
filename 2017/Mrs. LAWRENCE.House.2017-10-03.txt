 Mr. Speaker, today I rise for Rose from Michigan.   In Rose's first pregnancy, which was planned and very wanted, severe  brain abnormalities were detected in the 22nd week. She made the  decision, she said ``I will take that risk,'' because the doctor said  there was a 70 percent chance that the child would be able to function.  But at 28 weeks, the doctor made an analysis that said a severe brain  condition with a life expectancy under 4 years, with severe seizures  and limited development.   We are talking about suffering now. The baby would have problems  swallowing, breathing, even smiling. The baby would never be able to  communicate or control her body. And today we are talking about  suffering.   Rose made the choice between a short, painful life and peace. She  chose the latter.   Rose says: ``I believe we made the most compassionate and loving  choice we could for our baby, but the grief was initially  overwhelming.''   On behalf of Rose, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 36. We  must stop the bans.
