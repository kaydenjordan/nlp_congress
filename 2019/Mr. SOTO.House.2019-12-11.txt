 Madam Chair, back in central Florida, we had a townhall  where we had everyone from Bernie Sanders supporters supporting  Medicare for all to Donald Trump Make America Great Again, red hat- wearing Trump supporters, and all of them, regardless of the political  spectrum, could not believe Medicare can't negotiate. ``What a sham''  is what they said.   Well, today is the day. We are going to end the ban on Medicare  negotiating.   So you can wring your hands, contort the facts, but then you are  going to have to go home and explain why you campaigned on ending the  ban on Medicare negotiating and then you voted ``no,'' and then you  voted to keep this sham system in place where we don't even allow the  government to negotiate for lower drug prices.   This bill caps out-of-pocket costs at $2,000. That saves $1,196 per  senior for the over 124,000 seniors in my district. It also applies to  the 550,000 people who have private insurance.   What do we do with the $500 billion we save? We finally crack that  injustice for seniors to get dental, vision, and hearing coverage.   We hear scare tactics: Hundreds of drugs aren't going to be improved.  Try 8 to 15, while 300-plus drugs, according to the CBO, will be  improved over the next 10 years. So let's stop the scare tactics.   And is it worth it? Of course it is worth it.   Hundreds of new cures; finally giving dental, vision, hearing  coverage--of course it is worth it.   $1,196 in savings per senior in my district. Of course it is worth  it.   America put us in the majority because they think it is worth it, so  it is time to pass the Lower the Drug Costs Now Act.
