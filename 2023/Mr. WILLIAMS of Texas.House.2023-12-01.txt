 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  891, I call up the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 32) providing for  congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States  Code, of the rule submitted by the Bureau of Consumer Financial  Protection relating to ``Small Business Lending Under the Equal Credit  Opportunity Act (Regulation B)'', and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and submit extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this joint resolution of  disapproval. We must overturn the CFPB's small business lending rule to  ensure small businesses across America, which are the backbone of our  country, have continued access to affordable credit to support and grow  our economy.   Access to affordable credit is key to ensuring communities across  America remain vibrant. Unfortunately, the CFPB's small business  lending rule undermines the goal of affordable and available credit,  which I think we all should share.   Here is why. First, the CFPB's rule is overly broad. It will require  lenders to collect massive amounts of data whenever a small business  owner applies for credit. Most of the information is unnecessary to  make a fair, equitable, safe, and sound loan. Requiring lenders to  provide the information infringes on small business owners' rights to  privacy about their personal and business information when applying for  credit.   Second, the CFPB's rule is burdensome. Community banks and credit  unions across America account for the majority of small business  lending. They are doing their part. Despite claims from my colleagues  across the aisle, this rule does not go after big banks. It will have  the biggest impact on the small community financial institutions  already operating under the thinnest of margins because of runaway  inflation and increased interest rates through the Federal Reserve--in  general, the Biden economy.   The rule also discourages banks and credit unions from expanding  their lending portfolios. They might simply decide that the droves of  new compliance officers they would have to hire to comply with this  onerous rule would simply not be worth it, and Main Street is hammered  again.   The CFPB Director says he is trying to be sensitive to the needs of  small community financial institutions, oftentimes advocating for  relationship banking. However, in the rule, CFPB sets the transaction  threshold at an incredibly low 100 loans in the preceding 2 calendar  years. This means the smallest of banks, small businesses, and their  owners will be the ones to bear the brunt of the unnecessary data  collection, and Main Street is hammered again.   Third, the rule will be difficult to implement. The rule itself is  nearly 900 pages and requires lenders to report 81 data fields.  Developing compliance systems to achieve this will be extremely costly  for firms, which takes resources away from actually lending to small  businesses, and Main Street is hammered again.   The timeline for implementation is also insufficient for lenders to  develop the necessary systems to comply with such a complex and  burdensome regulation. Each hour a lender spends on the overly broad  data collection demanded by the rule is an hour not devoted to ensuring  credit is available and affordable for small businesses, and Main  Street is hammered again.   Finally, it is unclear what the Bureau intends to do with its  exceedingly expansive data demands. What we do know is the CFPB plans  to post the data publicly on the CFPB's website. This is concerning,  given the Bureau's alarming record of facilitating the naming and  shaming of companies whose business activities progressive activists  want to attack, adding to the concerns of the CFPB's abysmal track  record of protecting the highly sensitive data it already collects.   In fact, back in February of this year, there was a major  unauthorized data breach by a CFPB employee, which included personally  identifiable information and confidential supervisory information.  Therefore, why should we ever trust them to protect sensitive  information of small business owners this time around?   To sum it up, the rule is backward-looking, anti-small business,  anti-capitalism, anti-competition, anti-free markets, and anti-risk and  reward.   It is critical that we pass this resolution to overturn this reckless  CFPB rule to protect small business access to the credit needed to  continue to innovate and grow our economy. A new idea while we are at  it: Let's put people back to work again.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from the great State of Texas (Ms. De La Cruz).   Ms. De LA CRUZ. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise today to express my strong support for S.J. Res. 32, a  resolution disproving of the CFPB's overreaching and burdensome rule  under section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Act.   This rule is nearly 900 pages long. It imposes onerous data  collection requirements on small business lenders in places like south  Texas.   This regulatory overreach is not just impractical; it directly  threatens the lifeline of America's economy--our great small  businesses.   Mom-and-pop shops are the backbone of our communities and need access  to create, to grow, and to thrive. This rule, with its misaligned  definitions and excessive demands, will only hinder their access to the  necessary financial resources.   By supporting this resolution, we stand for common sense, for small  businesses, for community banks, for local families, and for a  regulatory environment that fosters economic growth.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution to  safeguard the health of our Nation's economy.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from the great State of Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from the great State of Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from the great State of Nebraska (Mr. Flood).    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentleman from Texas.                                time  1000     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry), the chairman of the  Financial Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to the time  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim).    Madam Speaker, as my colleagues and I have  stated today, my biggest fear is that many lenders may decide to fully  exit small business lending due to the overly burdensome collection  requirements, or because they don't want to put their small business  customers in an uncomfortable situation.   I do not believe this is the outcome Congress, or the CFPB, intended  with the implementation of this section of Dodd-Frank. However, I know,  as a small business owner myself, that if this rule goes into effect it  will not bode well for small businesses seeking the credit needed to  grow and support their communities. That is the bottom line.   We need to help small businesses. We need to help them create jobs  but also to create net worth among their employees.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
