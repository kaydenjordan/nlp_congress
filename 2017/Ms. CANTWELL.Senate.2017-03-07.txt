 Madam President, I come to the floor to speak in  opposition to this resolution. Many of my colleagues know that we have  had discussions in the Senate on several Congressional Review Act  resolutions. In principle, Congressional Review Act resolutions-- besides repealing these existing Executive regulations--also have the  unfortunate aspect to them that they negate an agency's ability to make  new rules anytime soon in the same area. For example, if you like some  of this rule but not all of it, by using the CRA, you are literally  preventing the agency from moving forward on any improvements to the  rule.   I always believe in the legislative process. Working with my  colleague from Alaska or working with my colleagues from other areas, I  think we have proved that we can resolve key issues. But passing this  Congressional Review Act resolution on an issue so important as our  public lands and negating the hard work that the executive branch did  over a long period of time is something that my colleagues and I just  have to say no to.   When it comes to public lands, we want transparency; we want  sunshine. We want a bottom-up approach when it comes to land  management, and we certainly want collaboration.   As was said earlier, the Bureau of Land Management manages about 245  million acres of public land. That is about 10 percent of the Nation  and 30 percent of our Nation's minerals. So when it comes to this  management, it is very important that they continue to follow a very  good bottom-up process for land management.   I will read now from the actual requirements from the law that  oversees them, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. They have to  use and observe the principles of multiple use and sustained yield;  consider present and potential uses of the public lands; weigh long- term benefits to the public against short-term benefits; consider the  relative scarcity of the values; give priority to areas of critical  environmental concern; provide for compliance with applicable pollution  control laws, including State and Federal air, water, noise, or other  pollution standards or implementation plans; and coordinate with  Federal Departments and Agencies, State and local governments, and  Indian Tribes.   So all of these things are part of what is already in existing law.  The concept here is to make sure that we continue to have a transparent  and open process that is bottom-up. And I certainly believe in a  bottom-up process because our public lands must not be territories  owned and operated, for example, for the sole benefit of the oil, gas,  and mining industries, and we can't have polluters polluting in these  areas and not have input from the various communities about their  concerns on those issues.   For example, in 2001, the Bush administration proposed revisions to  six land use plans in eastern Utah, and these plans were finalized in  2008 at the end of the Bush administration, with only limited  opportunity for public involvement. All six plans were challenged in  Federal court by several motorized recreation and conservation  organizations.   It is now 2017, and these plans still remain tied up in litigation.  That is why those in the off-road vehicle industry did not feel as  though they had input at the very beginning stages of the process. In  January the Obama administration negotiated a settlement, which is  still pending in court, but this shows how, if there isn't meaningful  public involvement, we are just going to hit a logjam. This is why I  think it is so important for us to update this rule.   It has been a long time since the agency updated this rule; I think  since 1983. That was the last time--over 30 years ago. I guarantee you,  in those 30 years, we can come up with a better process for input from  our constituents on important land use issues.   I know the new Interior Secretary likes to talk about Teddy  Roosevelt, who once said: ``The Nation behaves well if it treats the  natural resources as assets which it must turn over to the next  generation increased, and not impaired, in value.''   Ensuring we are preserving and increasing the value of our public  lands is exactly what is meant by this planning rule that the Bureau of  Land Management put out. This rule wants to make sure that we have  input from the local community.   I think it is important to note that this is not a rule that  regulates any specific use on public lands. It does not restrict any  particular activity. It simply updates the current law in saying that  it is better to have input from local officials and to use that input  from local officials to update the process in an earlier way.   I said to my staff: It is like us huddling and saying that we should  write legislation and then me not coming back for 7 years and then  letting them know I am on my way to the Senate floor to drop a bill. We  would never do that, and the land plans in these communities shouldn't  be done that way either.   Once a local Bureau of Land Management official starts to discuss a  plan, there should be transparency. The local community should know  exactly what that plan looks like before it is going to be finalized.  It needs to encourage collaboration of the stakeholders or else--as the  example I just gave in Utah--you are going to end up in litigation or  an elongated process before such management plans can take place.   It seems to me that these are pretty reasonable goals: Have a bottom- up process that encourages discussion throughout the plan so that local  communities are not caught off guard, and continue to emphasize the  roles of State, local, and Tribal governments and cooperating agencies  so that they can have input in the process as well.   Finally, I know that there are some who would like to claim that the  BLM State director oversees the planning process in their specific  State and that somehow that might change, but that is not the case.   Many organizations understand that there will continue to be a  bottom-up process under the new rule. That is why so many sportsmen and  outdoors groups--like the Outdoor Industry Association, the National  Wildlife Federation, Trout Unlimited, the Theodore Roosevelt  Conservation Partnership, the Nature Conservancy, the Wilderness  Society, and the National Parks Conservation Association--all say: Do  not overturn the rule that was implemented. These groups know that 30  years is too long of a period of time to have to wait to encourage  public involvement and collaboration, that  [[Page S1612]]  these issues are too important to try to turn back the clock and to try  to exclude sportsmen and various interests of public access from the  planning and use of our public lands.   I hope my colleagues will turn down this override of a very important  project that has guaranteed public access, transparency, and sunshine  in planning for our public lands.                                   Medicaid    Madam President, I would like to come to the floor to discuss the  proposed Medicaid changes that are part of what the House is proposing  to the Affordable Care Act. This is so important because, as many  people know, Medicaid has been a bedrock of how individuals get access  to healthcare in our country. And in many parts of our States--at least  the State of Washington--Medicaid has been a lifeline in both rural  communities and in urban areas and we have heard much from various  people that it is actually helping to stabilize healthcare costs, so  costs are not rising as fast and giving people access to care in the  most serious situations where we are trying to fight opioids or are  trying to find more efficiency in our healthcare system.   First of all, I think the House bill is literally a war on Medicaid.  I say that because it is a capitation of healthcare costs.   The federal government, according to one budget analyst at the Center  on Budget and Policy Priorities, would shift the cost to the States by  more than $500 billion over the next 10 years. That would mean that  millions of people would lose coverage and be affected by this kind of  repeal.   Now, many people have talked about how they might block-grant  Medicaid. I also thought that was a horrible idea because, really, it  just becomes nothing but a budget mechanism to reduce the Federal  partnership that exists between the Federal Government and the States  on Medicaid. But the House chose not to do exactly block-granting. They  said, instead, that we are just going to have a budget cap at the  Federal level on how much money they are going to spend on Medicaid and  then work toward the repeal of Medicaid expansion. This is a very bad  idea.   The actual per capita cut--I know my colleagues like to come out here  and talk about a patient-centered relationship, which is exactly what  getting off fee-for-service and going to managed care does. But a per  capita cost is nothing but a budget mechanism to cap the Federal  responsibility to Medicaid and cut costs and basically shift the pain  onto the States.   I have been on various meeting tours in the State of Washington,  talking to my constituents about this. In Seattle, Spokane, and  Olympia. I met with hospitals, community clinics, women's health  groups, local and State government officials, civic leaders, civil  rights organizations, and I heard many things.   I basically heard hospitals say there is evidence that Medicaid is  actually lowering the commercial insurance premiums because of less  uncompensated care. And I heard a safety net hospital in Spokane tell  me that the population is already 70 percent Medicaid and Medicare and  that there is no way they can absorb this kind of a cut to the Medicaid  program and it would just mean healthcare costs would rise in the  future. I heard a hospital in Seattle tell me that this kind of attempt  is nothing but a budget trigger. It is not a reform of the system. It  is simply a way to cut the budget.   What we believe is that Medicaid is a key part of our healthcare  delivery system. The expansion has worked well and we should continue  to move to ways to innovate Medicaid as a way to save costs.   Unfortunately, right now, many people misunderstand how important  Medicaid is in the mental health and addiction area. Basically, when  you take what we have tried to do to address the opioid epidemic, those  individuals who are working through the bills that we just recently  passed to try to help patients in the emergency room or who are in  psychiatric care or who are trying to deal with this grave problem we  have in the United States, getting rid of Medicaid for those  individuals, you might as well roll back all the assistance we just  provided as part of the CURES and other legislation. Why? Because these  individuals will not be able to access the type of care they need  without the support.   I do believe that what we need to do is innovate instead. There are  many examples of innovation in our healthcare delivery system. One  example, as I have mentioned on the floor several times, is going from  nursing home care to community-based care.   Medicaid is going to equal long-term care. So many Americans are not  going to be ready to deal with their long-term healthcare issues, and  when they are not, they are going to use Medicaid for their long-term  care.   We showed in the State of Washington over more than a decade's period  of time that we could save $2.7 billion by shifting our Medicaid  population to community-based care instead of nursing home care. If we  would do that same kind of innovation at the Federal level, we could  achieve substantial savings instead of saving money by cutting.   The issue here is that innovation in our delivery system--innovation,  not a budget cap--is what is going to help us with our healthcare needs  for the future when it comes to the Medicaid population.   So I urge my colleagues to speak loudly against this proposal to try  to cap Medicaid, to try to shift the burden to States and local  providers, to county governments, to jails, to all of those individuals  who are going to see that population when and if they don't have  Medicaid coverage and instead work together on expanding the innovation  in Medicaid and coming up with savings we need to take care of and to  provide health insurance coverage to so many Americans.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we had a chance earlier today to talk  about this Congressional Review Act resolution before us that I urge my  colleagues to turn down. This resolution basically would negate a very  important aspect of a rule that was put in place to help the public  have more input on public lands.   The rule was pretty straightforward--common sense--to make sure that  there was a lot of increased public input to bolster the decisionmaking  process and to ensure that there are 21st century management policies  in place.   There is nothing in this rule that was implemented in the last  administration that erodes or takes away from the States' and local  governments' planning processes and the decisionmaking they do.   So it is very important to me that we continue to have the  transparency and openness and sunshine in our public planning. I think  one editorial from the Post-Register from Idaho said it best. So I will  read from it.         Resource management planning. Sound boring? Maybe. But if       you are a Westerner, it definitely shouldn't be.        Resource management planning (RMP) affects how you can or       can't use the vast swaths of public lands outside your back       door for things like hunting, camping, four-wheeling, hiking,       fishing, and rock climbing--a lot of the things you probably       love about being a Westerner.        With a new Republican presidential administration in power       and the GOP-controlled Congress rubbing its hands together in       delight, ready to implement part one of its grand scheme for       public lands--cashing in on  [[Page S1625]]       those resources--RMPs should get a whole lot more interesting       to Westerners.        Since 2014, BLM officials have been toiling away,       rebuilding the current rules for land use planning in a       significant way for the first time since 1983. . . .        One important change is that Planning 2.0 would let the BLM       take into account local impacts from the beginning.    Going on to read from the editorial:         The Republican-controlled House has already passed a       resolution to strike Planning 2.0 from the books once and for       all. The Senate will vote within days on whether or not       they'll use the same sledgehammer--the Congressional Review       Act (CRA). It's an especially diabolical weapon.        Once the CRA is used on Planning 2.0, it will be gone       forever. It prevents future BLM rules for planning land use       from being introduced if they are ``substantially the same.''        The utterly confounding part is why this rule is being       picked on in the first place. . . .        Planning 2.0 actually mandates more local control, gives it       more often and is a smarter, more elegant solution to sharing       use of our public lands.    I couldn't say it better than that editorial. Local communities are  watching. They want more sunshine. They want more input. They want a  smoother process. They don't want lawsuits that take forever. They want  us to work in a collaborative fashion, guaranteeing the public input of  local governments, States, and our citizens in how we manage our  Federal lands.   I urge my colleagues to turn down this resolution.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I yield back the remaining time.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that privileges  of the floor be granted to the following individuals with the Committee  on Energy and Natural Resources: Frances Brie Van Cleve, a Democratic  fellow, through December 31, 2017; Stephanie Teich-McGoldrick, a  Democratic fellow, through December 31, 2017; Patricio Portillo, a  Democratic fellow, through December 31, 2017; and Devinn Lambert, a  Democratic detailee, through December 31, 2017.
