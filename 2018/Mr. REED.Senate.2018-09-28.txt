 Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by a group of  members on both sides of the aisle and in both bodies in introducing  legislation today to renew the law that expands the reach of libraries  and museums and enables them to better serve their communities. These  vital institutions educate, inform, engage, and connect people from all  walks of life.   Our legislation, the Museum and Library Services Act of 2018, is  similar to legislation I also introduced on a bipartisan basis in  December. That legislation was developed with input and insights from  the library and museum communities. Since that time, it became apparent  in the library community that a vital change was needed to ensure that  funding increases for the State formula grant program would be more  broadly shared by States around the Nation. Under the current formula,  smaller States have seen little in the way of new funding even as  funding significantly increased over the last few years. The last time  we addressed this issue was in 2003, and an update, while ensuring no  State would lose funding, is needed today so that more communities can  benefit from increased investments in our Federal library program.   I am grateful our revised bill has the support of the American  Library Association, the American Alliance of Museums, and many of  their affiliated associations. I thank Senators Collins, Gillibrand,  Murkowski, and our many colleagues who are joining us in introducing  this bill today. I look forward to working with them and the entire  Senate on moving this bill swiftly to passage.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by a group of  members on both sides of the aisle and in both bodies in introducing  legislation today to renew the law that expands the reach of libraries  and museums and enables them to better serve their communities.
