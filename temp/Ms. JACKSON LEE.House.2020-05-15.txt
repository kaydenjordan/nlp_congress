 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   We cannot do and cannot do--and how many times can I say it?--we  cannot stand here and do nothing.   The Constitution has no provision that prohibits this body from doing  something to avoid a catastrophe of not being able to govern this  Nation.   My friends who were here during the heinous tragedy of 9/11 remember  that we had a continuity committee and put in a provision of the rules  under Republican leadership of what would constitute a quorum.   But let me say this, my friends. No one is telling you not to be  present, but what it does say is that we are prepared, we will not  panic. We are prepared in case a catastrophic resurgence of COVID-19  comes in the fall as the scientists have said.   And, no, no proxy is going to dominate this floor. A proxy is  directed by the Member, and they must specifically, on each vote, tell  you what to do. Those directions are specific.   At the same time, no Member is prohibited, as I said, from coming to  this floor. Eleanor Roosevelt said: ``One thing I believe profoundly:  We make our own history.'' That is what we are doing. We are making our  history so that we can serve the American public.   Do you think truck drivers and first responders want us to collapse  and not pass a bill that provides for them so they will not be  furloughed and fired? They want us to do our job.   Thomas Paine said, ``times that try men's souls.'' This is a  constitutional process. It allows for us to proceed and govern this  Nation without an interruption.   We have seen Members who are COVID-19 positive. It can happen to a  predominant number of Members. How, then, will we respond? We need to  respond with the exact idea that has been promoted and put forward in  this resolution.   Let me also acknowledge the fact that 36 million have filed for  unemployment; 85,000 have died. It is projected 134,000 will die. That  is why we have done prison dollars. That is why we put the heroes money  in so that we don't have people seeking to eat.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article entitled ``City  Staring Down $169 Million Budget Gap'' and an article from the Houston  Chronicle entitled ``Universal testing for coronavirus is a national  security issue.                 [From houstonchronicle.com, May 13, 2020]                     City Staring Down $169M Budget Gap                  (By Jasper Scherer and Dylan McGuinness)         Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, facing an economy hammered       by the coronavirus pandemic and collapsing oil prices, on       Tuesday proposed to close an upcoming budget gap by       furloughing about 3,000 municipal workers, deferring all       police cadet classes and exhausting the city's entire $20       million ``rainy day'' fund.        The proposals are in response to an estimated $169 million       revenue shortfall for the fiscal year that begins July 1.        Emptying the rainy day fund ``leaves the city in a       precarious state for the upcoming hurricane season,'' the       mayor acknowledged in a message to city council members that       accompanied his budget plan. The account hold money in       reserve for emergency situations, such as cash flow shortages       and major disasters.        The city had just recently replenished the fund after using       all $20 million in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. It will not       have that option if a storm hits Houston this year.        ``The dollars from the economic stabilization fund are       gone,'' Turner said. ``There is no rainy day fund.''        Under Turner's plan, the city also would draw $83 million       from its cash reserves to balance the budget.        The city's tax- and fee-supported general fund, which       covers most basic city operations, would spend $2.53 billion       under Turner's plan, a decrease of about 1 percent from the       current budget. Despite the narrow spending cut, the city       would be left with a general fund balance that dips below the       amount required by city ordinance.        Turner said the rule makes an exception ``in the event of       economic instability beyond the city's control.''        Houston is expected to lose nearly $100 million in sales       tax revenue during current fiscal year and the one beginning       in July, due in part to a precipitous drop in oil prices,       along with the closure of bars, restaurants and other       businesses during the pandemic.        The overall city budget, including services that are funded       by dedicated fees and utility charges, is $5.1 billion, a       slight increase from the current budget.        The proposed spending plan, which is subject to approval by       city council, only says that the city would furlough       ``thousands of municipal employees.'' At a news conference       Tuesday, Turner said the number would be around 3,000 of the       city's nearly 21,000 employees. The workers would forego 10       days of paying the city roughly $7 million.        Turner did not specify which departments would be required       to send workers home without pay, though he said the city       would not place anyone on furlough from the police, fire and       solid waste management departments.        The city will implement any cuts until the new fiscal year       begins July 1, Turner said.        The bulk of the city's operating budget is devoted to       paying roughly 5,200 police officers and nearly 3,800       firefighters. Public safety would account for 59 percent of       the general fund under the proposal, and usually about 90       percent of the police and fire departments' costs are devoted       to personnel. Both departments would see modest increases of       about 2 percent in spending under Turner's plan, with police       climbing to $930.6 million and the fire department to $516.9       million.        The departments seeing the biggest cuts in their operation       budgets include Public  [[Page H2030]]       Works ($4.5 million, or 14.3 percent of its budget); Parks       and Recreation ($10.4 million, 13 percent); and Solid Waste       ($4.5 million, 4.8 percent).        Turner's budget plan could undergo significant changes, the       mayor said Tuesday, if Congress allows local governments to       spend COVID-19 stimulus funds to make up for lost tax       revenue. Houston received $404 million from the roughly $2       trillion coronavirus stimulus package and for now is barred       from spending it on previously budgeted expenses, though city       officials may identify some public safety expenses related to       the pandemic that can be covered with federal aid, Turner       said.        ``More than likely you will see additional dollars flowing       into this budget in the next couple of weeks,'' Turner said.        The mayor already is proposing to use federal COVID-19       funds to cover the city's roughly $10 million annual contract       with the Houston Zoo, which is paid out of the general fund.       Turner said he also has directed the fire and police chiefs       to determine which of their recent operations were devoted to       COVID-19--spending that could be eligible for federal aid.        Democratic lawmakers in Washington, D.C., also have sought       more money for state and local governments in Congress' next       stimulus package, though such plans have met skepticism in       GPO ranks.        Even if Congress gives Houston officials more flexibility       to spend the funds, Turner said the $404 million will not       cover all the city's COVID-19 expenses and lost revenue. The       city already is projected to spend about $200 million on       testing, contact tracing and other health expenses, Turner       said, while putting additional funds toward rental assistance       and programs to help homeless Houstonians.        ``The $404 (million), though it seems like a big number,       it's not big at all considering the needs that exist,''       Turner said. ``Just because we may be able to pull dollars       from what we have received, it doesn't mean that there will       be sufficient dollars to do it.''        If the federal government does provide more money, Turner       said his first priority would be to reinstate the police       cadet classes, which would cost $14 million. Next on the list       would be eliminating furloughs and refilling the city's       reserves.        Cities across the country already have slashed large chunks       of their payrolls, placing workers on furlough, laying off       employees and implementing hiring freezes. As many as 1       million municipal workers may be laid off or placed on       furlough, according to the National League of Cities.                                   ____                  [From the Houston Chronical, May 6, 2020]       Universal Testing for Coronavirus Is a National Security Issue                        (By Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee)         Most Americans are not fully aware how up to now the United       States has been so effective at preventing, combating, and       mitigating outbreaks of infectious disease. We have been able       to do this because of the expertise and responsiveness of       superb institutions, independent agencies and offices       throughout the federal government that effectively dealt with       Ebola, H1N1, Zika, SARS and MERS.        I was alarmed by news reports in late December 2019 of a       new or novel coronavirus. By January, the machinery of       government with its unparalleled ability to project power       globally, galvanize our allies, and coordinate peer       competitors in the field of science and technology should       have activated to provide all needed resources and assistance       to China to contain the disease. This was not a China       problem; it was a global threat requiring a global response.        So early the next month, on Feb. 10, I held a press       conference to raise public awareness on the emerging threat       posed. Two weeks later, on Feb. 24, I called another press       conference to urge that testing be given the highest priority       in battling the spread of the new coronavirus and the       sickness it causes called COVID-19. And I continue to       champion testing as the tool that federal, state, tribal and       territorial governments must embrace to support our COVID-19       economic recovery.        We are at the beginning of May and testing is still       urgently needed. There cannot be further delay in acting. If       we cannot see COVID-19 there is no way to stop it. If we do       not dramatically increase testing, we will remain prisoners       of COVID-19 until we have a vaccine widely available, which       is not expected to occur until early 2021.        As the nation does battle with COVID-19 it is not the role       of public policy makers to determine acceptable losses of       civilian lives. Although in military battles commanders must       calculate acceptable losses as part of battle plans, none of       these calculations are based on the intentional sacrifice of       lives. Any commander thought to have unnecessarily cost the       lives of soldiers or civilians through their actions or       decisions would face severe consequences. If the decisions       are not driven by public health, but by economic interest,       this is the wrong calculation. The economic injury caused by       COVID-19 is because there has been and continues to be       insufficient testing to check its spread.        Decisions to open state economies seem to want to place       responsibility upon small business owners who decide to       reopen without making clear what the consequences may be to       them if even one case of COVID-19 occurs among their       employees or customers.        For this reason, I have partnered with Houston hospitals,       local public health agencies, local businesses and       international corporations to promote the provision of       community-based COVID-19 testing sites to assist in this       critical first step in stopping COVID-19's unchecked spread       in local communities.        The economic and health security of the nation hinges on       getting testing in every community so that we can shine a       light on where COVID-19 is and where it is not present. The       lack of testing early on and the continued lack of testing is       costing trillions in lost economic output and it will       continue to cost much more as we struggle to save lives       through social distancing and providing adequate universal       access to COVID-19 medical treatment, equipment and PPE to       protect medical personnel as well as essential workers.        The United States needs to meet or exceed the recovery rate       of other nations around the globe so that our national       economy can benefit as the global economy recovers. This will       happen once we demonstrate that our nation can do the hard       work of implementing successful testing, contact tracing and       social distance programs. Other nations including our own       will not tolerate reinfections once they are under control       because a COVID-19 infection anywhere is a threat to people       living everywhere.        The virus that causes COVID-19 is less than five months old       and it has rocked the world with its arrival. If this new       coronavirus is under active transmission in communities, it       could continue to evolve. This is the reason we must do the       hard job of stopping this virus and do it sooner than later.        There are six actions that can be taken before the end of       the summer to make it possible for children to return to       school in the fall:        1. The president should use the Defense Production Act to       produce enough of the COVID-19 15-minute test recently       approved by the FDA for use in high risk areas like urban,       rural, and Native American communities and environment such       as food processing, warehouses, production lines or       factories;        2. Target COVID-19 pandemic aid to communities based upon       mortality not just known infections;        3. Equip health care professionals with enough PPE to       provide home health visits to the elderly who will need more       engagement than telemedicine can provide to ensure their       health and welfare;        4. Provide 100 percent paid medical leave for persons who       themselves or someone in their household have one or more of       the known risk factors that make COVID-19 a deadly threat;        5. Implement robust contact tracing efforts to ensure that       every infection is tracked and those who may have been       infected are identified; and        6. Prepare contingencies to address public emergencies such       as hurricanes, tornadoes and wildfires in conjunction with       COVID-19 for known seasonal high-risk disaster areas of the       nation, such as along the Gulf Coast, the Mid-Atlantic,       Tornado Alley and fire-prone California and the Caribbean.        A greater commitment to universal testing will save the       lives of hundreds of thousands of people and cost far less       than the economic stimulus that is very necessary as the       economy stagnates under the weight of COVID-19 stay at home       orders and quarantines. A misstep at this point can have dire       consequences for the lives of families, their children and       the elderly; and result in an even deeper impact on the       local, state and national economy.    Mr. Speaker, we need rural, city, local, and State  funding and $15 million in rental assistance. We need to do this  resolution and pass the HEROES legislation now.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary,  and on Homeland Security, and the Budget, I rise in strong support of  H. Res. 965, which authorizes the Speaker, in consultation with the  Minority Leader, to temporarily implement remote committee proceedings  and remote voting in the House when she has been notified by the  Sergeant-at-Arms, in consultation with the Attending Physician, of a  public health emergency due to the coronavirus.   When exercised, that authority lasts for 45 days but can be extended  if the public health emergency persists or there is a resurgence.   Mr. Speaker, in the 231 years since the first Congress met in New  York City on March 4, 1789, our nation has undergone and overcome many  crises and challenges, from the presence of British troops in the  capital city during the War of 1812, to the Civil War, World Wars I and  II, the Spanish Flu of 1918, the Great Depression, and the Great  Recession of 2008.   Through it all, Americans have persevered and America has flourished  because Americans do not give up hope or give in to despair.   Instead of cursing the darkness, we light candles.   Our national history is one of pride in our democracy, in a  government of, for, and by the people, and our willingness to sacrifice  to keep it and our ability to adapt to changing times to sustain it.   Mr. Speaker, we are now in the midst of one of those `times that try  men's souls,' as Thomas Paine put it two centuries ago.   As of yesterday, there were at minimum 4,405,688 cases of COVID-19  across the  [[Page H2031]]  globe and 1,400,500 in the United States, resulting in more than  300,000 deaths worldwide and more than 84,985 in the United States.   With just 4 percent of the world's population, the United States has  one-third of the total COVID-19 cases and nearly 30 percent of deaths  from COVID-19 globally.   Mr. Speaker, the necessary measures taken to slow the pandemic and  'flatten the curve' so as not to overwhelm the nation's health care  system has also delivered a severe shock to economic activity in the  United States.   Yesterday, the Department of Labor reported that the number of first- time unemployment insurance claims exceeded 2.85 million, bring the  total number of unemployed to 36 million, shattering by orders of  magnitude all previous marks.   So, Mr Speaker, it is essential that this Congress act and act now to  put in place measure that will address the public health crisis, stem  the economic onslaught, and ameliorate the suffering and deprivation of  individuals and communities.   But requires that we first ensure that the Congress discharge the  duties delegated it under the Constitution in a way that does not  needlessly endanger Members, their staff, or any of the thousands of  Capitol Hill personnel.   That is the purpose and intent of H. Res. 965; to allow Members from  across the country to continue legislating on behalf of the American  people while adhering to the advice of medical experts and protecting  public health.   First, the resolution authorizes remote committee proceedings during  the pandemic.   During the public health emergency period, committees are authorized  to hold virtual hearings, markups, and depositions so Members can  perform oversight, conduct fact-finding, and prepare legislation for  the House floor.   Committee chairs can choose to hold entirely virtual proceedings,  with Members participating from any location, or they can hold  proceedings in the hearing room with some Members participating  remotely.   Members participating remotely will count towards a quorum and be  able to vote.   Committees are required to use software platforms approved by the  Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) for remote participation.   Second, H. Res. 965 authorizes and implements procedures for remote  voting on the House floor during the pandemic.   Specifically, the resolution allows for remote voting by proxy on the  House Floor during the public health emergency period.   All Members voting remotely will be counted toward a quorum.   After sending a letter to the Clerk designating a proxy, Members are  permitted to vote remotely on any vote.   Members voting remotely will be given 24-hours' notice before any  final passage vote to ensure they can secure a proxy if they have not  yet designated one.   Mr. Speaker, it is important to emphasize that this is not a general  proxy, rather proxies must receive exact written instruction from the  Member voting by proxy on each vote and are required to follow that  instruction precisely.   To ensure transparency, a list of designated proxies will be posted  on the Clerk's website and a list of Members voting remotely will be  printed in the Congressional Record following each vote.   In addition, Members' votes will be read aloud during the vote.   Additionally, no Member can serve as a designated proxy for more than  ten Members.   Finally, the resolution provides for remote voting through technology  during the pandemic, after a system is developed and certified.   The resolution directs the chair of the House Administration  Committee to study the feasibility of using technology to vote remotely  in the House, and to provide certification upon a determination that  there is operable and secure technology for remote voting.   After the certification, the chair of the Rules Committee is directed  to issue regulations on the implementation of remote voting and the  Speaker is then authorized to notify the House that Members may cast  their votes remotely during the public health emergency period covered  by the resolution.   Mr. Speaker, in this moment of national crisis Americans are looking  to their government to be there for them and enact policies and take  action that will see us through this pandemic as safely and as quickly  as possible.   To ensure that the House, the first branch of the co-equal but  preeminent body vested by Article I with the power to investigate,  legislate, and appropriate in further of the general welfare and  national defense, remains able to discharge its constitutional duty, I  urge all Members to join me in voting to pass H. Res. 965.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   We heard on this floor, Mr. Speaker, God bless America, and now we  know that America is sick and needs that blessing. Her lives, her  livelihood are sick.   This is not Speaker Pelosi's bill. This is America's bill. And I am  glad to stand here and support heroes who will get $200 billion,  including transit workers.   I am glad we will get more direct payments, $6,000, to families that  are desperate.   I am glad that there will be testing and contact tracing that will  help save lives.   I am glad that local governments--my mayor is suffering--$375  billion.   And I am delighted to make sure that we know that the hungry people  in the streets will get food.   I support the HEROES legislation.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary  and on Homeland Security, and founder and Co-Chair of the Congressional  Coronavirus Taskforce, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6800, the  Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, or HEROES  Act, the most installment of the necessary assistance and relief  provided by Congress to address the adverse health and economic impacts  of the COVID-19 pandemic.   The HEROES Act provides an additional $75 billion for the testing,  tracing, and treatment we need in order to have a science-based path to  safely reopen our country and helping ensure that every American can  access free coronavirus treatment.   I support this legislation also because it provides strong support  for our heroes fighting the pandemic on the front lines with nearly $1  trillion for state, local, territorial and tribal governments who  desperately need funds to pay the health care workers, police, fire,  transportation, EMS, teachers and other vital workers who keep us safe  and are in danger of losing their jobs.   The Heroes Act also establishes a $200 billion Heroes' fund to ensure  that essential workers receive hazard pay, something that I have long  advocated and for which I worked closely with the House and committee  leaders to secure.   Another reason to support this bill is that it puts money in the  pockets of workers with a second round of direct payments to families  up to $6,000 per household, new payroll protection measures to keep 60  million workers connected with their jobs and extending weekly $600  federal unemployment payments through January 2021.   There are several additional salutary provisions in this legislation  which I will later address, but it is important to note for the record  the scale of public health and economic crisis we are in.   Every day, we see the need for further action to combat the  coronavirus crisis.   To date, there are more than 1,400,000 confirmed cases, over 85,000  dead, including 42,403 cases and 1,158 deaths in my home state of  Texas.   On top of that, by taking the necessary measures to slow the pandemic  and `flatten the curve' so as not to overwhelm the nation's health care  system, economic activity in the United States has experienced a severe  shock to the system.   More than 36 million initial unemployment claims in the past month  alone.   In addition, on March 23, 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  (DJIA) dipped to 18,321.62, which is even lower than it was on Election  Night 2016, and far below the 19,827 mark where it stood on January 20,  2017.   In other words, Mr. Speaker, all the gains that were made to the  stock market and heralded by this Administration as evidence of its  genius have been wiped out, depleting the retirement savings and 401(k)  fund of millions of ordinary Americans.   The situation is so dire that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell,  appointed by the current President, stressed the importance of Congress  providing further fiscal relief, stating this week:   ``While the economic response has been both timely and appropriately  large, it may not be the final chapter, given that the path ahead is  both highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risks.  Additional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it if it helps  avoid  [[Page H2237]]  long-term economic damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery.''   Mr. Speaker, among people who were working in February, almost 40  percent of those in households making less than $40,000 a year had lost  their job in March.   And in addition to the highly inequitable of gender and racial  impacts, this economic downturn reveals a strong class dimension to the  unemployment wave with 18.1 million of the 19.5 million jobs lost in  the private sector last month classified as production and non- supervisory workers as opposed to managers.   So, we have simultaneously a public health emergency and an economic  calamity, both of which are addressed in the legislation before us.   But before we can get back on our feet economically and restore the  booming economy inherited by the current Administration, Americans must  be assured and confident that there is a plan and strategy to combat  COVID-19 and the resources and commitment needed to implement the plan  and execute the strategy.   And that means testing, testing, and more testing, along with contact  tracing.   Mr. Speaker, as the media was reporting in early January on the rapid  spread of the novel coronavirus and the alarming increase in the  numbers of persons infected, I understood that this was an emergency  situation requiring urgent and immediate attention.   On February 10, 2020, I held the first press conference on the issue  of the novel coronavirus at Houston Intercontinental Airport, which was  followed by a second press conference on February 24, 2020 to continue  efforts to raise public knowledge of the impending threat.   On February 26, 2020, I wrote the Chair and Ranking Member of the  Committee on Homeland Security requesting to be briefed by Acting  Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf to regarding the preparedness  of DHS to address a possible pandemic.   On March 19, 2020, I partnered with United Memorial Medical Center to  open the first drive through Coronavirus Test Screening facility in the  Houston area.   Since March 19, I have worked to open six other testing sites for a  total of seven that are located within high risk communities in the  city of Houston to reduce the need for travel to get access to COVID-19  testing.   In early March news reports regarding the high risks for COVID-19  infections in jails and prisons provided early notice that these  locations might become hot spots where the unchecked spread of the  virus would pose health risks to detainees, staff, and communities  where they were located.   Infectious disease experts warned that overcrowded unsanitary  conditions existed in these facilities making them extremely unsafe  given what was known about the highly infectious nature of COVID-19.   That is why I worked with the Harris County Sheriff's Office to  provide COVID-19 testing for detainees and staff beginning on April 21.   Detention centers are overcrowded and unsanitary and pose significant  risks to detainees and staff should COVID-19 breach them, whether they  are prisons, jails, or ICE detention centers.   In the weeks before the White House declared a national emergency  concerning COVID-19, ICE held approximately 38,000 individuals in more  than 130 federal, private, and locally operated detention facilities  across the country.   Crowded, unsanitary conditions in ICE detention facilities put  detainees, detention facility staff, and surrounding communities in  danger.   Placing detainees in local jails or state prisons may have triggered  infections in those confinement settings that might reach local  communities where the infections would not be detected until infected  persons were sick enough to seek medical assistance at hospitals.   Individuals in detention are often housed in close quarters together  with individuals in poor health, making them highly vulnerable to  contagious disease.   Reducing the number of persons being held by focusing on release of  non-violent persons who are at the greatest risk should they contract  the infection-the elderly, those with underlying medical conditions,  and those with compromised immune systems is the right thing to do for  public safety and health.   As I wrote in a May 6, 2020 Houston Chronicle op-ed, entitled  Universal Testing Is A National Security Issue, universal testing,  contact tracing, and social distancing is needed to protect the public  health and safety, and to provide Americans with the confidence they  need to restart the national economy by resuming economic activity.   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that H.R. 6800 includes in its  provisions many of the policies I have advocated and worked with  leadership to secure, including the following:   Bureau of Prisons--$200 million to prevent, prepare for, and respond  to coronavirus in Federal prisons, including funding for medical  testing and services, personal protective equipment, hygiene supplies  and services, and sanitation services.

As the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic becomes clearer  and more far-reaching, it will be necessary to continually replenish  the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loan  program (EIDL).   Mr. Speaker, perhaps the principle reason to support this legislation  is because it provides $75 billion for COVID-19 testing, contact  tracing, and isolation measures; and ensures that every American can  access free coronavirus treatment.   The legislation also provides hospitals and health care workers on  the frontlines needed funding for the necessary resources, especially  personal protective equipment (PPE), to battle the coronavirus pandemic  and care for its victims.   Mr. Speaker, we have all seen the heart-wrenching stories of  courageous doctors, nurses, ambulance drivers, orderlies, and others  selflessly striving to save other others while putting themselves in  harm's way because of the severe shortage of PPE.   Mr. Speaker, the current president fancies calling himself a ``War  President.''   For anyone who needs reminding, the nation's greatest wartime  presidents made sure that American troops on the frontlines were  trained, equipped, and protected in battle.   The funding provided in this legislation will help states and local  jurisdiction conduct necessary COVID-19 testing in local jails,  juvenile detention centers, and elsewhere in the criminal justice  system.   Testing is the key to reopening the economy and resuming our lives,  and to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus, domestically  or internationally.   If we cannot see where COVID-19 is within a community, there is no  reliable way to prevent its spread other than quarantine.   If we do not dramatically increase testing, we will remain prisoners  of COVID-19 until we have a vaccine widely available, which is not  expected to occur until early 2021.   Universal testing for COVID-19 is a matter of life and death for  millions of Americans, but it is also a salvation for millions of  others who are living desperate lives behind locked doors.  [[Page H2239]]    The liberation of millions hinges on getting testing in every  community so that we can shine a light on where COVID-19 is and where  it is not present.   Mr. Speaker, the occasion demands that we rise, and I urge all  Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 6800, the Health and Economic  Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act.
