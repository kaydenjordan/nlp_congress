 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, and leader of the  committee, Frank Pallone.   H.R. 8454 is an important bill, and it is interesting to hear the  conversation here on the floor. Mr. Carter was talking about the  history that you couldn't get marijuana rescheduled because they didn't  have enough research, and you can't get the research because it is  scheduled as a schedule I drug, so we have been trapped in this vortex  where we can't get the information.   I, too, am against recreational marijuana. But for medical marijuana,  I think it has a great benefit. For years, we have been in this trap  where you couldn't do sufficient research, therefore you couldn't  reschedule it. It is crazy. We are going to fix it here today.   My belief is that medical marijuana can be beneficial when used in a  proper setting. Despite the increasing use of cannabis products around  the country, there have been very few legitimate peer-reviewed studies  to determine the effect of cannabis on the body.   We know it does some good anecdotally for patients with juvenile  seizures. What we don't know is how much THC has to be in the  cannabidiol to make it effective. This is what we need research for.                                time  1700    This bill allows us to obtain approval to conduct cannabis research  and obtain quality product, not just one strain out of Mississippi, but  multiple products, quality products, monitored by the Government, to  make sure it is not being misused, to be used in this research.  [[Page H7124]]    It encourages research by improving and streamlining the registration  process for marijuana. It also ensures the availability of verified  cannabis products necessary for legitimate research by allowing  approved institutions of higher education, practitioners, and  manufacturers to manufacture and distribute marijuana for the purpose  of conducting research.   As someone who has advocated for this legislation for years, I  appreciate the work that has been done to get us here today.   Whatever position you may have on marijuana use, you need to know  that this bill will allow us to come together and support more  scientific research so that we can make informed decisions as we move  forward as legislators.   I have to tell you, being here live as a legislator is also  important, because the genesis of this bill was several conversations  that took place on the floor of this House when people who disagree on  the underlying issue would argue about what research showed. It finally  became clear to Representative Blumenauer, to Representative Harris, to  myself, and to others, that we had to have more research in order to  get the right answers for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to support H.R. 8454.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 623, the Gabriella Miller Kids  First Research Act 2.0. As many people know, I try to be fairly  conservative when it comes to spending Federal dollars or authorizing  Federal dollars to be spent. But, Mr. Speaker, if we are going to spend  money at the Federal level on all kinds of things, near the top of that  list ought to be research for cures for cancer. And even higher on that  list should be research for children who  [[Page H7126]]  have cancer and for diseases that affect specifically the young people  of this Nation.   I don't think that anyone is going to oppose this. I am sure that I  will be proven wrong in a floor vote later. But for me, this one  reaches the bar that we ought to have unanimous or near unanimous  support on the floor, as we did in the Committee on Energy and  Commerce.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
