 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Classroom Clinic of Carroll, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the  Week.   Psychiatric nurse practitioner Sue Gehling founded Classroom Clinic  in 2019 to help with the mental health needs of children attending  schools in rural Iowa. Sue spent most of her life in rural Iowa and saw  firsthand the opportunities to serve her community by addressing mental  health needs while working at a clinic in Carroll. Classroom Clinic  provides rural school districts with the ability to serve students  using a telehealth model. Since 2019, Classroom Clinic has worked with  four districts, including seven schools,  [[Page S1894]]  and has provided mental health care services to over 250 Iowa students.   In October 2022, founder Sue Gehling received the Iowa School Mental  Health Hero Award. The award honors a practitioner, researcher,  educator, or community partner for their defining contribution to  school mental health in Iowa. Additionally, Classroom Clinic was chosen  as the winner of the Small Business Development Center Iowa's statewide  August Small Business of the Month award due to their contributions to  the community. Today, Classroom Clinic is striving to reach more  students across Iowa to have a more positive impact within these  students and families' lives.   Classroom Clinic's commitment to providing mental health services in  Iowa is clear. I want to congratulate Sue Gehling, and the entire team  at Classroom Clinic for their continued dedication to providing  students from rural Iowa with the additional mental health services and  resources they need. I look forward to seeing their continued growth  and success in Iowa.                            ____________________
