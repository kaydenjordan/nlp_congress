 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support Congress'  bipartisan approval of harsher sanctions on Vladimir Putin and his  vicious Russian enablers. We all support suspending normal trade  relations and support destabilizing the Russian economy as the price of  their savageness.   The nations of the free world and all freedom-loving people have an  obligation to stand up resolutely against the tyranny and murder being  unleashed against Ukraine.   Let liberty lovers continue arming Ukraine's brave defenders. Let  free nations send them the lethal and defensive equipment they need.  And let civil nations continue to isolate this rogue and criminal state  from all that it needs to function.   The murder of innocent, men, women, and children simply cannot be  tolerated.                            ____________________
