 Mr. Speaker, in honor of the 47th anniversary of Roe v.  Wade on January 22, I rise for the 1-in-4 women in America who have had  an abortion, and the 1-in-3 women living in a State where abortion  would be banned if Roe was overturned.   On March 4, the Supreme Court will hear June Medical Services v. Gee.  The Louisiana law requiring admitting privileges would leave just one  clinic open and one physician to provide all the abortions in  Louisiana.   Although Roe is the law of the land, 27 States impose waiting  periods, 12 ban private insurance coverage, 18 mandate counseling, and  43 have abortion-ban laws ready to go.   Mr. Speaker, to those waging war on the rights of women, next week is  the anniversary of the Women's March. We have seen the power women  wield when they march to the ballot box. Get ready for 2020 because we  are not going back.                            ____________________
