 Madam Speaker, I thank the Member for yielding and  including my two amendments in this package.   My first amendment directs OSHA to implement an emergency temporary  standard to protect employees, employers, and customers from COVID-19.   In these chaotic times, standards will provide that predictability we  need. Without these enforceable standards, we can't take that  responsibility to reopen in a safe and effective way.   My second amendment: Health and Human Services must create  comprehensive national testing and tracing for childcare centers.  Essential employees are hard at work. Millions want to get back to  work. Yet, childcare providers can't do the job they need to do to be  safe.   A national testing strategy and contact tracing standard will help  safely reopen these childcare centers. It is what our economy needs. It  is what our kids need and, certainly, what our parents need.   I urge my colleagues to support these amendments, and I thank the  chairman, once again, for his years of service.
