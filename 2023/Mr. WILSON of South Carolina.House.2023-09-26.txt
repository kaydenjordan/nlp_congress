 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, 8 months into the newly  elected House Republican majority, led by our Speaker, Kevin McCarthy,  we are delivering on the Commitment to America.   On behalf of American families, we are fighting to tackle inflation  and lower the cost of living, defending national security, making  America energy independent, securing the southern border, preserving  constitutional freedoms, promoting fiscal responsibility, and much  more.   Highlights of the accomplishments so far include defunding the Biden  army of 87,000 IRS agents, eliminating the military vaccine mandate,  establishing the bipartisan committee to strengthen America against the  threats of the Chinese Communist Party, passing the Secure the Border  Act to address the chaos at the border, passing the largest deficit  reduction package in American history, passing the Parents' Bill of  Rights, passing the Lower Energy Costs Act.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues, moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with Biden open borders.                            ____________________
