 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  achievements of nine young men in my district.   Because schools in Iowa are open for in-person learning, our young  men and women are able to participate in sports, and I am able to rise  today to honor their recent achievements for winning Iowa's State  championship in wrestling.   Dustin Bohren, Bradley Hill, and Griffin Liddle of Bettendorf; Hunter  Gavin of Iowa City West; Ben Kueter of City High in Iowa City; Matthew  Lewis  [[Page H1133]]  of Centerville; Hayden Taylor of Solon; Kobe Simon of West Liberty; and  Marcel Lopez of New London each won State championships last month in  Des Moines.   Wrestling, we think, in Iowa, we are the center of the universe. When  it comes to wrestling, we are, but we do give a nod to a certain  Representative from Ohio. Wrestling and Dan Gable are as much a part of  Iowa's unique history and culture as corn, first-in-the-Nation  caucuses, Casey's Breakfast Pizza, and, of course, Chuck Grassley.   Before the pandemic, fans would cram into gyms across the State to  watch our local teams compete. For the lucky few who made it to the  State tournament, thousands would travel from all 99 counties to watch.   These young men and women have marked their place in Iowa history,  and I could not be prouder to represent them in Congress.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Foxx for yielding time  for me to speak today.   Even though I have family members who are members of unions, I rise  today to speak in opposition to H.R. 842, the PRO Act.   The PRO Act is an unnecessary challenge to the rights of business  owners and workers alike. The legislation would eliminate right-to-work  laws across our country, and Iowa has one of those. It is yet another  attempt to attack States' rights.   Abolishing these laws would force workers to participate in and pay  dues to unions, even if they don't wish to be represented or support a  union's political philosophy.   If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle cared about workers'  rights, why did this administration cancel the Keystone Pipeline and  open our borders to a crisis?   Additionally, this bill would strike down other worker protections,  including their ability to hold secret ballot elections and to be heard  by the National Labor Relations Board, and would create burdensome  guidelines for determining joint employment and independent contractor  status.   We need to do more to support our workers and businesses and do it in  a bipartisan fashion.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose the prounion boss  act.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up  H.R. 682, the Reopen Schools Act, to get our kids out from behind  screens and back in the classroom.
