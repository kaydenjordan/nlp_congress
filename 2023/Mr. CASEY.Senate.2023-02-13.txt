 Madam President, every year, it is my privilege, during  Black History Month, to honor Black Pennsylvanians who have made  particularly notable contributions to their communities and the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I rise today to pay tribute to this  year's honorees and to commend their deep commitment to service. This  year's theme is ``Inspiring a Bold and Bright Future.'' Several  individuals we honor have been laboring in their communities for  generations, while we are also honoring a younger generation of  Pennsylvanians who have already brought about positive change in their  communities. We have chosen to honor both those in the dawn of their  service and those who are well established in that service to highlight  the generational and sustained nature of this work and to emphasize the  enduring relationships between our older heroes and those who come  behind them to take up the mantel of justice work and community  empowerment.               Hettie Simmons Love--south central Pennsylvania    In 1947, a young African-American woman, Hettie Simmons, graduated  from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania  with her MBA in accounting, becoming the first African-American to do  so. While Hettie never had the opportunity to pursue a career in the  same manner afforded to other graduates of Wharton, she continued to  forge a path where she could apply her talents for the benefit of  others. While she has recently been discovered late in life as a  ``hidden figure,'' to many in central Pennsylvania, she is an  accomplished community leader clearing a path for those who came after  her.   Hettie Simmons was born in Jacksonville, FL, and attended Fisk  University, a historically Black college or university--HBCU--in  Tennessee where she majored in math. After graduating from Fisk in  1943, her desire for better opportunities for her future led her to  apply for admission to Penn's Wharton School.   Unable to pursue a career with her Wharton degree, Hettie Simmons  Love, newly married and living in Philadelphia, applied her academic  skills in community settings, serving as treasurer in several  organizations and, after the family moved to Harrisburg in 1971,  serving as the church treasurer at St. Paul's Episcopal Church for over  20 years.   Hettie also lent her business acumen to three different Black-owned  businesses in the Harrisburg area, serving as a bookkeeper and offering  suggestions for operational improvements. In her early eighties, Hettie  Simmons Love was still volunteering to help seniors with their income  tax forms. Hettie is also a long-time member of her sorority,  volunteering for decades and becoming a diamond member of Alpha Kappa  Alpha Sorority, Inc., in 2016 for having been a member for 75 years.   In December 2016, Hettie was awarded a Trailblazer award from the  National African-American MBA Association for being the first African- American graduate student to earn her MBA degree from the Wharton  School. The current Dean of the Wharton School, Dean Ericka James, the  first African-American dean of the school, had the honor of meeting  Hettie and presenting her with a certificate acknowledging the historic  significance of Hettie's achievement.   Now 100 years young, Hettie Simmons Love continues to thrive, serving  [[Page S348]]  in her church and community whenever opportunities arise. With each  passing birthday, she thinks that if God is keeping her here, then she  must have more to do. Hettie continues to donate her time, talent, and  treasures to others, earning the respect of her community and inspiring  generations of leaders to come.                     Gary Horton--northwest Pennsylvania    While Ms. Hettie Simmons Love was building community in Philadelphia  and Harrisburg, Gary Horton was learning the same lessons of community  service from his parents in northwestern Pennsylvania and making those  lessons his own. Born into a large family in Erie, Gary learned from  his parents and grandparents the importance of public service early in  his life. One of his first acts of civic engagement at the young age of  8 was to canvass for U.S. Senator John F. Kennedy's 1960 campaign for  President. Gary recalled that he and others, ``were able to picket  places as a young person for job opportunities, for voting rights, for  justice and we were able to register people to vote.''   The transformative power of education was evident early in Gary's  life and would become a theme of his own service over time as well.  Gary was educated in Erie Public Schools and graduated from Strong  Vincent High School. Gary went on to pursue higher education at Hampton  Institute and then Cheney University, earning a bachelor's degree in  political science. He applied the political education he learned as a  young activist and then as a student by going to work in State  government for several years and then returning home to work in the  administration of Erie Mayor Joyce Savocchio, Erie's first woman mayor.  Wanting to continue his work to improve his hometown of Erie, Gary then  founded the Urban Erie Economic Development Corporation--UECDC--and  became its chief executive officer when it merged with the Reverend  Ernest Franklin Smith Quality of Life Learning Center in 2002. At  UECDC, Gary leads an organization that carries on the educational  mission that informed his life from an early age, offering job training  programs, a summer youth work program, and self-help initiatives for  young people and, more recently, a growing number of new Americans from  South Sudan, Eritrea, Liberia, Ukraine, Iraq, the DRC, and other  countries. With Gary's help and that of the UECDC, these new arrivals  have found the promise of a new life.   Gary Horton has also served his city through voluntarism, serving two  terms as an elected member of the board of directors of the school  district of the City of Erie from 2004 to 2011, serving as the  president of the Erie chapter of the NAACP, and leading Erie's  ``Walking in Black History,'' a program that takes Erie school children  to historic sites of the civil rights movement throughout the South.   The city of Erie is blessed to have Gary and those like him who have  dedicated their lives to the city and its residents. Gary has truly  been an inspiration in Erie and with Gary and others leading the  charge, offers a bright future to its residents.   I have thus far talked about two leaders who have devoted their  entire lives to community building, Ms. Hettie Simmons Love, who is  still doing so at the age of 100, and Gary Horton, who though he cannot  match Ms. Simmons Love in total years, has brought his own unmatched  service to Erie. But today I also want to honor the next generation of  leaders, those who have been inspired by the efforts of people like Ms.  Hettie Simmons Love and Gary Horton and upon whose shoulders they  stand.                     Shawn Aleong--southeast Pennsylvania    Shawn Aleong is a disability, civil, and human rights activist from  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Although Shawn lives with cerebral palsy,  he has always said, ``For me, my disability is not a curse. It's not a  handicap. It is a gift so that I can help implement change.'' His  passion and dedication were recognized this past year on a national  level. On March 11, 2022, President Biden appointed Shawn to serve on  the President's Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities,  which advises the President on disability policy. Shawn will now be  able to effect change nationally just as he does locally.   Leading up to that well-deserved appointment, Shawn has been steadily  building his platform through his education and community engagement  efforts, particularly at Temple University. He is a pre-law student at  Temple, and he serves as senior adviser for local and community affairs  for Temple student government and is a director on the board of  advisers for Temple's Institute on Disabilities. During an internship  with the Temple University Police Department, Shawn developed an  interest in the interactions between law enforcement and people with  disabilities and started a process to train officers to better interact  with people with disabilities.   Shawn is also an intern at Disability Rights Pennsylvania, where he  supports staff working on potential discrimination cases related to the  disabilities of clients. He has been a member of the NAACP and the  board of directors for the Arc of Philadelphia, an organization that  advocates for the rights of people with disabilities.   Shawn has been an outspoken advocate for disability policies  affecting the well-being of all people with disabilities. He has  advocated for passage of a bill providing an expansion of ABLE account  eligibility to age 46. We achieved passage of this in Congress this  past December with Shawn's assistance. He has also worked to preserve  and expand access to Medicaid, home and community-based services, and  accessible voting for people with disabilities. Shawn has also been an  advocate for people with disabilities having the opportunity to live in  their own homes, in neighborhoods of their own choosing. When  describing what inclusion means, he has said it is ``living in the  community and working in the community. We need affordable housing,  good paying jobs, good support systems, and a good community. That's  how I believe that we can all be as one.''   Shawn has been able to continue his advocacy in a much more creative  way. He is an accomplished actor and long-time cast member of ``A  Fierce Kind of Love,'' a theater piece highlighting the struggles of  people with intellectual disabilities who were institutionalized in the  early and mid-20th century and how leaving institutional living  affected their lives.           Deahmi Mobley and Jaia Harrison--southwest Pennsylvania    This year, we also honor two high school freshmen from southwest  Pennsylvania, Deahmi Mobley and Jaia Harrison. In 2022, Dehami and Jaia  were named Do the Write Thing Ambassadors for their impressive essays  on the impact of gun violence.   Deahmi Mobley is a freshman at Central Catholic High School. In 2022,  Dehami was named one of Pittsburgh's two Do the Write Thing Ambassadors  after his essay on the impact of gun violence for young people won a  top honor. In his essay, Deahmi describes how youth and gun violence  has affected his life since he lost his brother, SeQuorri Smith. In his  essay, Deahmi reflects on a number of things, the impact of his  brother's death at a young age, the misplaced priorities of some young  people, the bullying that others face, and the critical importance of  violence prevention and the need for parents and educators to play a  role in it. Deahmi talks about his belief that education and youth  violence are closely linked and he echoes our other honorees in  stressing the important role that education has on community change. He  writes, ``We need to do better as a whole. Instead of putting others  down, we should bring each other up. Instead of balling up a fist, hold  someone's hand. Instead of picking up a gun, pick up some books. And  watch how society, and us as a community, change.''   Jaia Harrison, a student at Northgate Senior High School is, like  Deahmi, a freshman. In her essay, Jaia talks about her own experience  with youth violence as a witness to a deadly shooting in 2021, and she  summons the courage to talk about its impact upon her. She speaks  poignantly about the shock that spread through her body as a result of  witnessing youth violence firsthand. She also shares her views on youth  violence more broadly, particularly the need to take youth mental  health more seriously in order to prevent violence. She likens youth  mental health to a home that may appear to be in good shape on the  outside, but which internally has many problems that may be invisible.  ``To address  [[Page S349]]  what may seem like the bigger problems,' Jaia says, ``you have to  address the internal problems first.'' Jaia loves being a big sister.  She has a sister, Jaylen, and a young brother named Junior, and she  dreams of attending a historically Black college and university.   It is difficult to share your loss and your struggles in public, and  Deahmi and Jaia have shown remarkable courage for stepping forward and  telling their stories. They have not only reminded us of the terrible  toll that violence takes upon our communities, especially our young  people, but they have also provided us specific areas of focus to  prevent violence and promote better health in our communities. I am  grateful for their wisdom and leadership, and I encourage them to  continue speaking up. I have no doubt that they will continue to speak  the truth and bring about change in the years to come.   The community leaders working in our communities large and small  across Pennsylvania improve our neighborhoods and strengthen our  communities. Pennsylvanians like Hettie Simmons Love and Gary Horton,  who apply their talents wherever they are called to do so, lead our  communities through dark times and into a brighter future. Shawn  Aleong's fight for disability rights and the right to self- determination inspires me and so many others to join him in the  struggle for the civil rights of people with disabilities. It is young  people like Deahmi Mobley and Jaia Harrison who muster the courage to  challenge all of us, young and old alike, to declare that we must act  boldly to end the epidemic of violence in our communities.   I am inspired by the example and the commitment of the leaders who we  are honoring this year, and I am sustained in my own work by the  knowledge that they stand with me in the fight to bring equity and  justice to communities across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.                            ____________________
