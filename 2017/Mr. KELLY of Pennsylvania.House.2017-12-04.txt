 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition  of Greenville Junior/Senior High School in Greenville, Pennsylvania,  and Laurel Junior/Senior High School in New Castle, Pennsylvania, which  were recently honored by the Department of Education as 2017 National  Blue Ribbon Schools.   This award, given to only 342 schools in America this year, is based  on a school's overall academic performance as well as its progress in  closing achievement gaps among its students.   In her message of congratulations, Secretary DeVos commended the  visionaries, innovators, and leaders who are preparing every child for  a bright future. I am proud to join her in congratulating the teachers  and administrators of Greenville and Laurel, as well as the families of  these students, for the love and support they provide.   Most of all, I want to congratulate the students themselves for a job  well done. They are truly a credit to Pennsylvania's Third District and  to our country. It is an honor to represent them in the people's House.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I wasn't going to speak  tonight because I was just trying to figure out what it is that we are  trying to get here and if it is always going to be the same thing as if  it is not our bill, just not the bill we want.   When we talk about a rush to judgment, for 31 years, we have  postponed the inevitable. We no longer can compete globally because of  our corporate tax rates and the regulations.   Our people--and I don't care if they are Republican voters or  Democratic voters or people that don't vote at all--isn't it time to  give them a little bit more money in their take-home pay? Isn't it time  to let them get up in the morning with an idea that ``I can actually be  better at the end of the day than when I started''? Isn't it time for  us to talk about bringing millions of jobs back to the United States as  opposed to sitting here and trying to battle back and forth about  something that politically doesn't make any sense?   For the folks who are sitting at home, do they realize how far we are  getting away from what we pledged we would do for them: a dynamic and  robust economy that allows for more take-home pay, a dynamic and robust  economy that allows corporations to flourish and not flounder, and a  tax plan that absolutely puts America back where it so deservedly  belongs?   With all the assets that we are blessed with, with all the talent  that we are blessed with, and with all the opportunity that we are  blessed with, can we really think that tonight is the night to turn  this into a political battle, to make one side look good and one side  look bad?   Is it always going to be the war on the wealthy? Is it always going  to be the war on some entity? Does it have to be some type of identity  before we can actually back away and say: Tonight we are going to do  something for every single hardworking American?   Please, refrain from using the term ``middle class.'' There is  nothing, I think, that flies more in the face of who we aren't as a  society than classifying people: ``Oh, they are middle class''; ``Oh,  they are upper class,'' which leads people to think: ``Oh, there must  be a lower class.''   I am asking, tonight, not for either side of the aisle, but for  America to look at what is going on and say: It is not time for us to  get back in the game.
