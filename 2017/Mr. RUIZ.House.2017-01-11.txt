 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment to H.R. 5 at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 36, strike line 10 and all that follows through page       37, line 9.        Page 38, strike line 11 and all that follows through page       39, line 12.        Add, at the end of the bill, the following (and conform the       table of contents accordingly):                   TITLE VII--EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN RULES       SEC. 701. EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN RULES.         This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall not       apply in the case of a rule (as such term is defined in       section 551 of title 5, United States Code) pertaining to the       safety of children's products or toys. The provisions of law       amended by this Act, as in effect on the day before the date       of the enactment of this Act, shall apply to such rules.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ruiz) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to  H.R. 5, which will ensure children's products are safe for use.   In 2015, there were an estimated 254,200 toy-related injuries treated  in emergency departments across the Nation. Tragically, 15 children  were killed in toy-related incidents that same year. As an emergency  medicine physician, I have treated children who have fallen victim to  these accidents.   H.R. 5, the Regulatory Accountability Act, prioritizes cheaper  alternatives for companies over the safety of our children. To me, this  is unconscionable. It is wrong. It is not the direction we should be  taking our Nation.   My amendment to H.R. 5 will ensure that an agency rule regarding the  safety of children's products or toys is not delayed by the  bureaucratic hurdles that H.R. 5 imposes on Federal agencies. My simple  amendment provides a straightforward safety net for our sons and  daughters across the country.   Our children should always be our priority. The facts are clear: a  vote against my amendment is a vote to put a company's bottom line  above the safety of our children. So I urge all of my colleagues to  support this commonsense amendment to protect our children.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I want to emphasize what is at stake here. We  are talking about delay or forgoing regulations that protect our  children, regulations that give parents like me the peace of mind that  when I buy a bottle for my daughter, Sky, I know it is safe for her to  use, and that when I buy a product that is labeled age-appropriate for  my daughter, Sage, I can reasonably expect it will not contain small  parts that Sage could swallow and send her to the emergency room with  an obstructed esophagus that will require emergency surgery.   For me as a dad it is personal, and for our Nation it is essential.  This is commonsense legislation.   I urge my colleagues to put aside partisanship, politics, and  corporate greed and to think about the children in their lives who  could be harmed by this bill. Vote ``yes'' on my amendment to protect  children and save lives.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California  will be postponed.              Amendment No. 12 Offered by Mr. Scott of Virginia    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12  printed in part A of House Report 115-2.   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk  made in order under the rule.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 36, strike line 10 and all that follows through page       37, line 9.        Page 38, strike line 11 and all that follows through page       39, line 12.        Add, at the end of the bill, the following (and conform the       table of contents accordingly):                   TITLE VII--EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN RULES       SEC. 701. EXCEPTION FOR CERTAIN RULES.         This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall not       apply in the case of a rule (as such term is defined in       section 551 of title 5, United States Code) pertaining to       workplace health or safety at mining facilities which are       subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (30       U.S.C. 801 et seq.) or workplaces which are subject to the       Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651 et       seq.), and which is necessary to prevent or reduce the       incidence of work-related traumatic injury, cancer, or       irreversible lung disease. The provisions of law amended by       this Act, as in effect on the day before the date of the       enactment of this Act, shall apply to such rules.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 33, the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.   Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, this amendment to the Regulatory  Accountability Act, H.R. 5, if adopted, would exempt regulations  proposed by the Mine Safety and Health Administration or the  Occupational Safety and Health Administration, MSHA and OSHA, which are  needed to prevent or reduce the incidence of traumatic injury, cancer,  or irreversible lung disease.   I am deeply concerned that this legislation would impose layers of  unnecessary procedures to the rulemaking process and provide incentives  for frivolous litigation, while hindering workplace safety agencies  trying to help keep workers safe.   Current procedures that govern OSHA's rulemaking already involve an  extensive review process and stakeholder engagement from small business  review panels, risk assessments, economic feasibility determinations,  public hearings, and multiple opportunities for public comment.   According to the GAO, to meet these requirements, it takes OSHA 7  years to issue a new safety standard. In fact, it required 18 years for  OSHA to update a rule that reduces exposure to beryllium, a metal that  causes irreversible lung disease, even though there was broad agreement  between employers and unions on the new standard.   H.R. 5 imposes 60 additional procedural steps in order to issue a new  rule, on top of extensive layers of review already required by the  Administrative Procedure Act, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Data  Quality Act, and numerous executive orders. The goal of adding these  layers is obvious: to tie agencies such as OSHA and MSHA in red tape so  they can't do their jobs protecting workers and improving workplace  safety.   One especially troubling part of the bill would require a super- mandate that requires agencies to use the least cost alternative  instead of the most protective rule. Nobody favors excessive cost, but  this requirement overrides the carefully balanced requirements in OSHA  that require life and limb must be fully protected, provided that the  safety requirements are technically and economically feasible. That is  the present law.   The question that needs to be asked is: The least cost to whom and at  what cost to others? What is the least cost mandate protection of  workers? Is the least cost mandate secondary to worker safety in order  to limit cost to corporations? And then again, who decides?   Under the bill, some regulations could be delayed until the end of  any litigation, the final determination in a lawsuit which, with trials  and appeals, could take years. The bill prohibits the rules from going  into effect until the end of the litigation. Now, normally, you can get  an injunction, but that would require the court to consider the  likelihood of success of the lawsuit and the potential harm done if the  injunction is issued or not issued.   Under H.R. 5, rules could exceed the least cost alternative, but only  if the agency demonstrates that the additional benefits outweigh the  additional costs. This eliminates a well-established test under OSHA  which requires ``the most productive standard which is feasible,'' and  that standard obviously just invites litigation which will delay the  final rule for years.   The problem with the least cost framework is that it would tilt the  playing field to ensure the least cost for industry but at the expense  of workers and the American public. According to expert witnesses  before the Judiciary Committee, this bill will add another 2 or 3 years  to the regulatory process, and these delays will allow preventable  injuries and occupational diseases to continue unabated.   Mr. Chairman, the premise behind this legislation is based on the  erroneous assumption that regulations issued over the last 8 years have  obstructed job growth; however, employment statistics do not bear this  out. Since the end of the recession, the U.S. economy has gained almost  16 million jobs, while establishing the longest consecutive months of  job growth on record.   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment to ensure that, even if  the bill passes, OSHA and MSHA will be able to prevent or reduce the  incidence of traumatic injury, cancer, and irreversible lung disease.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
