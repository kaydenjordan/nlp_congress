 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  opposition to H.R. 6311, which, contrary to its name, would do very  little to help Americans access quality healthcare coverage. Instead,  it would force families to accept low-quality, catastrophic health  plans, or junk coverage, that does not meet healthcare needs and leaves  ordinary Americans to foot the bill when something goes wrong.   What does a catastrophic and high-deductible plan mean? Well, it is a  disaster for many.   Recent studies have shown that 40 percent of Americans cannot afford  even a $400 emergency expense, let alone the thousands of dollars  necessary for a medical emergency, which could happen to any of us, but  that is the plan Republicans are offering. Americans would get a plan  that is substandard. No one wants to have health coverage that doesn't  actually cover much at all.   What is more, these catastrophic and high-deductible health plans are  especially harmful to women. Since 50 percent of the pregnancies in the  United States are unplanned, many parents in these plans will not have  saved enough to cover these high deductibles or unexpected costs.  Furthermore, most pregnancies last 9 months and, thus, span more than  one plan year. That means during the course of a single pregnancy, a  mother in one of these plans would have to hit her deductible twice.   Maternity care services without complications can average around  $10,000 per pregnancy. What would happen in a pregnancy with  complications?   The Affordable Care Act was passed so that we could move away from  junk plans that offered nothing in terms of coverage and left people  with thousands of dollars in medical debt. This bill is just another  attempt to undermine the ACA, and we cannot go back.
