 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5892, a bill  I am proud to have cosponsored with Representative Lewis.   I thank Congressman Lewis, as well as the Education and the Workforce  Committee, for their hard work on this bill.   Madam Speaker, Pennsylvania has the fourth highest rate of death due  to drug overdoses in the Nation, and northeastern Pennsylvania, where I  represent, has one of the highest rates of fatal drug overdoses in our  State. Beyond the statistics are stories of broken families and broken  dreams, due to the addiction to and the abuse of these drugs.   In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that  approximately 91 deaths from opioid overdoses occur every day in our  Nation. This epidemic breaks our hearts. But it also hurts our economy.  An estimated 20 percent of men's and 25 percent of women's decline in  labor force participation between 1999 and 2015 can be attributed to  the increase in opioid prescriptions. This is a public health and  economic crisis that we have to address right now.   That is why I am so pleased to see the House taking up this  legislation. Establishing this advisory council to study the impacts of  opioid abuse on the workplace is essential to understanding how  damaging this epidemic is, both to individuals and communities.   We know that we must confront this epidemic on all fronts. It is a  bill that is an important step towards helping those dealing with  substance abuse remain in the workforce.   Our work on opioids has to continue after this week. Our communities  have not yet healed from the traumatic losses they have suffered, and  we have to continue to focus on this issue if we are to have any hope  of adequately addressing the harm to public health that opioid abuse  has caused.   Again, I thank Congressman Lewis for his work on this bill, I am  proud to join him in that work, and I urge my colleagues in the House  of Representatives to support it.
