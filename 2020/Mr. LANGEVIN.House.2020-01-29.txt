 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  Comprehensive CREDIT Act, which we will be considering very soon. It  will help bring much-needed accountability to credit reporting agencies  and protect consumers from fraud and abusive lending.   Far too often, I hear of Rhode Islanders who have suffered as a  result of credit reports with inaccurate or adverse information. The  impacts are serious. They can prevent an individual from getting a job,  taking out a mortgage, or acquiring student loans that they need to go  to college. Yet, when they need to dispute an error, credit reporting  agencies make it near impossible.   Mr. Speaker, the system is broken, and the Comprehensive CREDIT Act  will provide long-overdue reforms to address these systemic issues.  This bill will ensure Americans have the information they need to  protect themselves from fraud; opportunities and a mechanism to dispute  any errors, and to get them fixed; and protection from predatory  lenders.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this bill, and I thank  Congresswoman Pressley and Chairwoman Waters for bringing it to the  floor later today.                            ____________________
