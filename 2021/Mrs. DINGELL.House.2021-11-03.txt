 Madam Speaker, this month, we will pause on November  11th to honor the men and women who have selflessly served America in  uniform. Veterans of the United States Armed Forces have dedicated  their lives to protecting our nation, and it is critical we express our  sincere gratitude for the sacrifices they have made.   I appreciate the opportunity to draw awareness to a critical issue  affecting both veterans and current servicemembers--toxic exposure.   Toxic exposure has affected U.S. servicemembers for generations.  While each war and conflict has posed unique hazards and health risks  for servicemembers, our nation's youngest veterans are increasingly  facing health consequences due to exposure to toxic chemicals during  their military service in the Middle East.   Over the past two decades in the Middle East, open burn pits were  commonly used as disposal sites for materials such as trash, weapons,  batteries, and other waste. Servicemembers are concerned about the  illnesses that are linked to exposure to the toxic fumes and smoke  emitted by these burn pits, especially as some have begun developing  rare cancers and illnesses at higher rates than their counterparts that  were deployed to other parts of the world.   Michigan-native Kevin Hensley is one such veteran who has been deeply  impacted by burn pits. Kevin is a veteran of the U.S. Air Force who was  deployed to the Middle East eight times and stationed near open air  burn pits during four of his deployments. After retiring and moving  back to Wayne County in 2015, Kevin's health began rapidly  deteriorating. By 2017, Kevin had been diagnosed with Constrictive  Bronchiolitis, and later brain scans revealed serious damage from  inhaling toxic smoke.   Kevin struggles with daily tasks, saying he finds it difficult to go  grocery shopping without gasping for air. Equally upsetting, Kevin has  faced challenges receiving care through the VA. Only in 2020 did the VA  formally expand benefits for veterans suffering with illnesses related  to exposure to burn pits. Still, veterans must shoulder a burden of  proof, which requires them to precisely pinpoint where and when they  may have been exposed to burn pits. As a result, the VA continues to  deny an overwhelming number of burn-pit related disability claims.   Unfortunately, Kevin's story is one of far too many. Our nation's  veterans deserve better, and we must recommit ourselves to this effort  to ensure veterans receive the benefits and care they're entitled to.   That's why I'm a proud cosponsor of H.R. 3967, the Honoring Our  Promises to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2021. This bipartisan  bill will provide vital support to veterans who have been exposed to  burn pits and other toxins and ensure they can access crucial  healthcare services through the VA.   I thank Rep. Ruiz for his steadfast leadership on toxic exposure and  burn pits. I urge all my colleagues to support this important  legislation and continue pursuing other legislative solutions that will  ensure our servicemembers have access to the healthcare they deserve.                            ____________________
