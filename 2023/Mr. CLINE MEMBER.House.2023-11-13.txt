 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, as was stated, this bill makes technical corrections to  provisions of the code that contain statutory references to title 25 of  the United States Code. Title 25 is where laws relating to Native  Americans are classified.   This bill was submitted to the Judiciary Committee by the Office of  Law Revision Counsel.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all Members to support the bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.
