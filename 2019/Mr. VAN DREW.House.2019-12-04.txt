 Mr. Speaker, today I would like to express my gratitude  for the efforts of the NAACP Atlantic City branch to make south Jersey  a place of inclusion, acceptance, and equality.   In the past few years, this organization has worked to improve access  to the polls for marginalized voters, to protect maternal and infant  health with the Infant Mortality Task Force, and to provide  scholarships for the education of our vulnerable youth.   The NAACP of Atlantic City has also focused on tackling hatred in our  community by organizing vigils to call out hateful and unacceptable  actions against minorities and by addressing the environmental  injustice disproportionately suffered by these groups.   This group has worked tirelessly to support minority groups in south  Jersey, and our region is safer, healthier, more inclusive, and happier  because of it.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Atlantic City NAACP for their commitment and  service to our community. South Jersey and the State of New Jersey  appreciates all the work that they do.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Pallone for yielding time  and for all of his work.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support for the TRACED Act, a good  anti-robocall bill that is badly needed given the robocall epidemic  facing our United States of America.   Robocall scams are at an all-time high, and they are getting worse.  Data shows that New Jersey residents reported the most robocall  complaints of any State in the Nation last year.   Robocalls not only impede our quality of life as family dinners and  important work meetings get interrupted, but they also effectuate  scams, scams that take advantage of vulnerable populations such as our  senior citizens, who need to be protected.   This bipartisan legislation is a critical step toward ending the  scourge of robocalls. I am pleased to see portions of my own robocall  bill, the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act, incorporated in the TRACED Act.  While there is more to be done, without a doubt, I am proud to be a  part of this important effort to help protect consumers, and I urge my  colleagues to support this bill.
