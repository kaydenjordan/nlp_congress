 Mr. Speaker, January is Human Trafficking Awareness  Month, so I rise today to renew my resolve to eradicate the horrific  injustice that is human trafficking.   Human trafficking is a modern-day form of slavery, as it strips  individuals of their freedom and dignity. It has absolutely no place in  our society.   In my part of Minnesota, many of the women and children preyed upon  by human traffickers are Native American. In fact, Minnesota currently  ranks ninth in the Nation for missing and murdered indigenous women.   As a Member of Congress, I believe we have a moral obligation and  legislative duty to protect the most vulnerable. That is why I proudly  support Savanna's Act, a bill that will empower Tribal law enforcement  to address this devastating issue.   I will also ensure that the recently created Federal task force on  missing and murdered Native American women coordinates with State,  local, and Tribal officials to more effectively solve unresolved cases  and prevent similar violence.   While these are steps in the right direction, our work is far from  done. As a father, a former law enforcement officer, and a Member of  Congress, I will not stop until human trafficking is eliminated and the  criminals who have chosen to exploit others have been brought to  justice.                            ____________________
