 Madam Speaker, a Senator said yesterday he would let local  governments go bankrupt. And while he said that, our local county  executive was busy loading food into people's cars. Cars that had  toolboxes and work boots in them, and people who were nonetheless  hungry.    If the Senator has his way, it is these people whose towns will go  bankrupt. He talks about the economy. And I asked, ``What happens to an  economy where entire towns of firefighters and teachers and others lose  their paycheck or their pension?''   We are moving the ball today, but no one should mistake this for a  touchdown. The Senator would send our best players off the field. The  American people will never accept that, and neither should we.
