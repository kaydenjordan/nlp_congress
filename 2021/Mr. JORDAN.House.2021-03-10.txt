 Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Massie), the co-chair of the Second  Amendment Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, no, it doesn't. The previous speaker said  when this bill becomes law, it will stop some of the mass shootings-- all of the mass shootings that happen in this country. No, it won't.  Nothing in this bill would prohibit, would have stopped any of those  terrible things that took place.   What this bill does is stop law-abiding citizens from exercising  their Second Amendment liberties, just as the gentleman from Kentucky  mentioned a few minutes ago.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs.  Spartz).                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Hice).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. Owens).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs).  [[Page H1295]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Colorado (Mrs. Boebert), the co-chair of the Second Amendment  Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, the previous speaker talked about the  increase in violent crime in her neighborhood last year. Maybe if  Democrats actively supported our police and not  [[Page H1296]]  supported defund the police, maybe that wouldn't be the case.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona  (Mrs. Lesko).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Cline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Clyde).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Murphy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Murphy) an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Budd).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Chabot).    I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Massie).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).    Mr. Speaker, the previous speaker talked about Chicago's  strictest gun laws in the country, but yet there was a record number of  shootings and crime last year.   What could be the cause of that?   Maybe it is the fact they defunded their police, something we have  talked about now, well, since the Democrats started doing it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Grothman).     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Gooden).    Mr. Speaker, can I inquire how much time we have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Donalds).  [[Page H1300]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Pfluger).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think part of the point of the gentleman from  Pennsylvania was this system is a mess. Over 110,000 people were denied  access to a firearm when they went through the background check, but  only 12 were prosecuted. Mr. Massie led off our debate by talking about  this one. That tells you one or two things.   I think the main takeaway is, how many people were falsely denied? Or  if they weren't, why weren't more people prosecuted?   If the focus is to make sure the bad guy doesn't get the gun, holy  cow, over 110,000 were denied access to a firearm, not given a  clearance. Yet only 12 prosecuted?   If you guys want to work with us on that issue, we are happy to do  that. In fact, we have supported that and talked about that, but you  don't want to do that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, we can say we are opposed to the en bloc amendments for  all of the reasons we have cited now in the last hour and a half on  this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Mr. Speaker, the previous speaker indicated that you have  to ask the government to exercise your constitutional right. That is  the problem. What happened in Charleston was terrible, it was wrong,  and wrong as wrong can be. But this bill is not going to stop--the FBI  had 2 months. It didn't do it. It didn't stop this guy. They had 2  months.   What this bill does is shift the burden. It takes it from 3 days to  10 days, and the burden now becomes on the American citizen to be able  to exercise their constitutional right. That is not what the Second  Amendment is supposed to be about. Unfortunately, it is where the  Democrats want to take our country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Cawthorn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Cammack).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Hudson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Palmer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the FBI tells us, in a 4-year time period, 18,000 people  who exercised their Second Amendment liberties to get a firearm who  were denied got that reversed. Those are just the ones who went there  and said, ``You know what, you guys screwed up. It is not really me.''  They had to work it out.   Mr. Speaker, 18,000 times, the system screwed up. In 2017, over  112,000 people were denied, but only 12 people were prosecuted, which  means that, most likely, thousands of law-abiding people were falsely  denied their right to exercise their Second Amendment liberty.   Now what do Democrats want to do? They want to say: Wait a minute.  That all happened in a 3-day time period. We are going to extend that  for 10 days because we know the government bureaucracy will get so much  better in 10 days. We know it will work out if we just give them more  time to screw up more things.   That is what is going to happen. Oh, by the way, that single lady who  needs to protect herself, she is going to have to wait longer now for a  system that had this many screwups to get the firearms she needs to  exercise her Second Amendment liberties to protect herself and her  family. That is what this legislation does.  [[Page H1308]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Alaska (Mr.  Young), the dean of the House.    Mr. Speaker, the previous speaker used the term  ``reasonable.'' This legislation shifts the burden, so you are now  telling an American citizen the burden is on you to exercise your  Second Amendment liberties. They deny the background check, deny you  your ability to purchase a firearm, and the burden is on you.   Mr. Speaker, I would think that a professor of law would understand  that you don't shift the burden when you are talking about a  fundamental liberty that we enjoy under the Constitution. It doesn't  seem reasonable at all to me.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Clyde).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Cline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Earlier, we had a couple of the folks who spoke on our side. Earlier  they said the Second Amendment is right next to the First because it is  pretty darn important. I think some of our folks said that.   But it struck me that, you know what, I don't know that the other  side actually cares all that much about the First Amendment.   Think about what has happened this past year. Democrats have told  Americans they can't go to church, can't go to work, can't go to  school, can't go to a loved one's funeral.   Of course, the rules never apply to them. We had a Governor of one of  our largest States--a Governor of our largest State--out at a 5-star  restaurant, having dinner with friends and lobbyists at the same time  he is telling folks in his State that they can't even have Thanksgiving  dinner with their family.   We see the attack on free speech. I mean, just to laugh at this whole  cancel culture phenomena. First it was Kermit the Frog and the Muppets,  then it was Dr. Seuss. I think yesterday it was cartoon characters from  the Looney Tunes. Tack on your right to speak, specifically to speak in  any type of political nature.   We have had Democrat Members of Congress, Mr. Speaker, send a letter  to carriers, asking those carriers not to have certain news networks on  their system. That is frightening. You talk about chilling speech. That  is as scary as it gets--just because they don't like what is being said  on certain news networks? Scary.   And now they are coming after your Second Amendment liberties as  well. I mean, think about your First Amendment rights, your right to  practice your faith, your right to assemble, your right to petition  your government, freedom of the press, freedom of speech. And then the  very next right the Founders mention, your Second Amendment liberties,  they are coming after that, too.  [[Page H1310]]    It wasn't enough to go after your right to practice your faith. It  wasn't enough to go after your right to assemble and be with people you  wanted. Think about some of the things we saw this year. We had  Democrat leaders in States telling Americans you had to be in your home  at a certain time with curfews. You had to be in your home by 10.   We had another State say, when you are in your home, you have to wear  a mask. And then we had States say, well, when you are in your home,  you don't have to wear a mask because you are not allowed to have  anybody over.   Government was limiting your First Amendment right to practice your  religion, your First Amendment right to assemble. And now they are  coming after your First Amendment right to speak and speak in a  political nature. And here we are today, coming after your Second  Amendment liberties.   The Democratic Party is the party that says defund the police, open  the border, attack people's Second Amendment rights to defend  themselves while they are defunding the police and opening the border,  and all the while they are undermining American's First Amendment  liberties as well.   This should frighten everyone.                                time  1700    This should frighten everyone. This should frighten everyone wherever  they want to go. It is scary. I certainly hope we defeat both of these  bills today when they are offered.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I oppose both bills and the amendments for all the reasons we have  stated today. I think my colleague from Pennsylvania said it best. We  are now going to have to wait 10 days to exercise your Second Amendment  rights.   One of the previous speakers, Madam Speaker, on the Democrat side  said that felons don't get guns. They are felons. They are not going to  follow the law.   We all know what this is. This is going to make it more difficult for  law-abiding Americans to exercise a fundamental liberty guaranteed in  the United States Constitution, the second right they have, the Second  Amendment to the Constitution. It is going to make it more difficult  for them to exercise their fundamental liberty. That is what this is  about.   The FBI had 2 months in the Charleston situation to get it right.  They couldn't. Somehow we think now extending it from 3 days to 10  days, a system that messed up as much as it has, somehow that is going  to help, and then shifting the burden so that if this system that has  falsely denied people their right to purchase a firearm, time and time  again, if the system does it again, the burden is on you.   Since when do we ever do that? When are you presumed guilty by the  government? Only now. Only now are you presumed guilty. You are not  going to be able to exercise your rights.   Those are our concerns with both of these bills and the amendments  that are in front of us today.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
