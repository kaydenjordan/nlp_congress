 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the PAST Act. This  legislation attempts to eliminate the Walking Horse industry, which is  prominent in my congressional district. The vast majority of the  Tennessee Walking Horse industry is located in Tennessee and Kentucky.   The Tennessee Walking Horse is the most inspected horse in the world  under current law, with both pre-show and post-competition inspections  performed by both USDA inspectors and horse industry organization  inspectors. The PAST Act eliminates the industry inspection entities  and replaces them with new employees of the U.S. Department of  Agriculture and the U.S. Justice Department, increasing bureaucracy and  cost to the taxpayer.   The PAST Act is not widely supported by the horse industry. In fact,  the vast majority of the active Tennessee Walking Horse industry  stakeholders in my district oppose this bill and instead support  Representative Scott DesJarlais' commonsense reforms and modernization  of the Horse Protection Act contained in H.R. 6341, of which I am a  cosponsor.   This bill fails to promote objective, science-based inspections. I  oppose the PAST Act and how it will lead to the hiring of more  government bureaucrats while failing to protect the horse industry from  biased inspections. I encourage my fellow Members to vote against this  bill.
