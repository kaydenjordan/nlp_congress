 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the veterans in my  district and those who support them.   Earlier this month, I attended a Veterans Esteem Team event in Lapeer  County. It is a dinner organized and prepared by local junior high and  high school students from North Branch, Almont, and Dryden to honor  area veterans. Those who served our Nation are the best 1 percent this  country produces.   Words will never be adequate to capture the debt of gratitude owed to  the  [[Page H9529]]  men and women of our military who have enabled our Nation to continue  to be safe and prosperous. I am honored to serve with them and the  students in my district who took the time to recognize and organize the  veterans at this event.                            ____________________
