 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, right now in south Texas there are American citizens  whose lives are in danger because of wide open borders as a direct  result of Biden's border crisis and the policies of the Democratic  leadership of this body and the Senate. American citizens are unsafe. I  am not making that up.   For the last 2 years, I have heard my Democratic colleagues talking  about a fake crisis at our border. There is nothing fake about 100,000  people coming across our border; or high-speed chases through Uvalde,  Texas; or high-speed chases in Real County, which I represent. There is  nothing fake about break-ins putting lives in danger.   People own ranches, and now my Democratic colleagues, after defunding  the police and opening up our borders,  [[Page H1297]]  want to take away our God-given right--yes, God-given right--to defend  ourselves under the Second Amendment. That is what this is about. This  is about creating a gun registry to track guns of the American people.  There is no way to implement what the Democrats are trying to implement  without doing that.   I can just tell you straight up, Texans, Americans, the Government is  never going to know what weapons I own. Let me be clear about that. It  is not going to happen. We have a God-given right to defend our  families, defend our State, and defend ourselves against tyranny; and  we will do that regardless of the errant policies that this Democratic  Congress is trying to jam through.
