 Mr. Speaker, I wish to talk about a very special person  in our community who recently left us. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pray  tribute to a gentleman of exceptional generosity, deep principles, and  extraordinary wit: Justice William Newsom, or, as many called him,  ``Bill.''   A dedicated public servant with a commitment to the arts and  conservation, he leaves a lasting legacy for America. Any one of us who  knew him considered him a cherished friend.   Bill was a proud fourth-generation San Franciscan, who was born to a  large Irish brood. As a commissioner of the San Francisco Superior  Court, judge on the Placer County Superior Court, and then California  Court of Appeals judge, he worked relentlessly to uphold liberty and  justice for all.   Again, Bill's charitable and civic contributions to our city and our  State are legendary. He was endowed with great decency and humanity and  took the golden rule literally. He considered an injustice and  indignity to one an injustice and indignity to all.   A passionate student of natural history and a lifelong enthusiast of  the  [[Page H10277]]  outdoors, Bill worked relentlessly to preserve the beauty of God's  creation. His leadership on a vast range of conservation and  environmental organizations was vital in protecting clean air, clean  water, and public lands for our children and grandchildren.   Bill also understood the power of the arts to bring us together and  dedicated decades to fostering beauty, culture, and the arts in the bay  area and around the world.   Again, all who were fortunate enough to call Bill a friend knew him  as a brilliant man of letters, a tireless champion of civic causes, and  a trusted confidante of unsurpassed empathy and generosity. But it is  Bill's profound love of family that we will miss the most.   Bill's favorite role was that of patriarch, or paterfamilias, of a  big Irish brood. Family trips to Squaw Valley and Dutch Flat were his  great joy, and he relished every opportunity to share books, stories,  and special moments with his family, especially Irish literature.   Mr. Speaker, I will include in the Record an obituary written about  Bill Newsom that I think everyone should read. It is about a person so  special that you merely have to read the story to find it believable  that somebody could accomplish such things with dignity and grace.   Mr. Speaker, his obituary says that Justice William Newsom was  paterfamilias of a pioneering San Francisco family and a revered figure  to his family, including his wonderful daughter, Hilary, whom we all  love, and his son, Governor-elect Gavin Newsom, whom, unfortunately, he  will not see sworn in, but he did see him elected Governor in November.   Again, he is a fourth-generation San Franciscan, born to a large  Irish Catholic brood in Depression-era San Francisco. His story is  really the story of America.   Again, throughout his life he served the community with great, great  dignity. His civic and charitable commitments were substantial, serving  on the Board of Regents of the University of Santa Clara. The list goes  on in terms of education and the arts.   Sometimes, Mr. Speaker, we lose someone whose passing makes it seem  like an entire era has vanished, but that is not so with Bill Newsom  because he left such a legacy for us to continue to enjoy.   Again, he is survived by Hilary; Gavin; his beautiful grandchildren,  whom he enjoyed so much time with in later years; and so many friends  who revered him.   I want our colleagues to knew this very special person made a mark on  the lives of so many of us in the great State of California and our  country. If you have a moment, read his obituary. It is a story of  America, of the American Dream of a great Irish American family, a  pioneer family in California.   Again, when Gavin is sworn in the first week of January, we will all  take such great pride in the love that his father had for him and his  sister, Hilary, and know that he is looking down from Heaven on that  blessed day for the State of California as the Newsom legacy lives on.                            ____________________
