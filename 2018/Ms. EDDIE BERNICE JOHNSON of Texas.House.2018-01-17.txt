 Mr. Speaker, in 2017 alone, there  were 16 extreme weather and climate events that devastated the United  States and its territories, including Hurricane Harvey, which ravaged  my great State of Texas and brought Houston's third 500-year flood in 3  years. Since 2006, the contiguous U.S. has experienced five of the  warmest years on record. Year after year, new temperature and weather  severity records are broken.   As researchers attempt to answer why this is occurring, it has become  clear that there is a link between the severity of these events and  human-caused climate change. Last year, in a study published by Nature  magazine, scientists concluded that the frequency of extreme weather  events in the Northern Hemisphere were amplified by anthropogenic  climate change.   It is time to face the fact that climate change is real and admit  that we are directly contributing to it. We must continue to find  innovative ways to address this challenge before it is too late.   I will continue to speak out in support of all research that furthers  our understanding of our planet's climate and helps identify ways of  reducing the harmful impacts on it.                            ____________________
