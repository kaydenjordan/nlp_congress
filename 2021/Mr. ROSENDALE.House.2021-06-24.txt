 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Detective Travis  Burrow for his remarkable contributions to his community as general  case detective for the Great Falls Police Department.   This past week, Detective Burrow was named Officer of the Year by the  Montana Police Protective Association for his service as lead  investigator for major criminal activity in Great Falls. His  investigations included high-profile cases such as homicides,  kidnappings, robberies, arson, missing persons, and suspicious death  investigations.   Detective Burrow's competence and experience has made him a valuable  resource to the department, where he consults on his coworkers' cases  and serves as a leader and mentor to his colleagues.   Detective Burrow continues to serve the Great Falls Police Department  with honor and distinction.  [[Page H3094]]    I commend Detective Burrow for his outstanding service to Great Falls  and the State of Montana and wish him and the department continued  success.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for  yielding to me.   Madam Speaker, my constituents sent me here to Washington to fight  tooth and nail on behalf of the unborn.   I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 239, the Equal Access to  Contraception Act for Veterans. This radical piece of legislation would  require taxpayers to subsidize the full cost of all contraception  through the Department of Veterans Affairs, including Plan B and Ella.    Let me be clear, drugs like Plan B and Ella are not contraception,  they are abortifacients. These chemical drugs prevent a newly conceived  embryo, a human embryo, from implanting in the uterus and continuing to  develop as a child. Again, that is not contraception, that is abortion.   Using taxpayer funding for abortions is not only wildly unpopular, it  is immoral. It forces tens of millions of people who have personal or  religious objections to abortion and abortifacient drugs to fund the  termination of life. That must not and should not be the public's  obligation. The true measure of any society can be found in how it  treats its most vulnerable, especially the unborn.   Since the ruling of Roe v. Wade, well over 62 billion abortions have  occurred in the United States. To put it in perspective, that is more  than the amount of worldwide casualties directly caused by World War  II, the most deadly military conflict in the history of the world.   The loss of life on such a tragic, massive scale due to abortion is  heinous. If passed, this legislation will increase abortions committed  in the United States, and that is at the taxpayer's expense. This is  absolutely unacceptable. We must do better as a Nation.   When this bill was considered in committee last month, a majority of  the Republicans voted against it. Last week, we considered this bill  under suspension of the rules, and fortunately, 187 of my Republican  colleagues joined me and stood for life. Due to this strong showing of  opposition, we were able to prevent the two-thirds supermajority needed  to pass this bill under the suspension of the rules, dealing Speaker  Pelosi a significant legislative defeat.   That is why Democrats--and even some Republicans, unfortunately--have  brought this bill back to the floor today under a rule for debate. I  hope the Republicans will be just as unified in opposition of this bill  today. Another strong vote would send a message that the Republican  Party is the party of life.   Our constituents expect us not to compromise in our defense of the  unborn. To support legislation like H.R. 239, which promotes the  killing of the unborn, at taxpayers' expense, is the ultimate betrayal.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
