 Madam Speaker, 2017 was a year marked with  division and distraction, a disservice to Americans seeking solutions  to real challenges facing our Nation.   My hope is that the new year provides an opportunity to move away  from divisive discourse and toward constructive dialogue and real  outcomes. This year, we can take real steps to strengthen Medicare and  Social Security, as well as ensuring access to quality and affordable  healthcare for all Americans.   This year, we can promote job growth and success for all Americans by  making smart, targeted investments in education and scientific  research, as well as preparing our workforce for the 21st century.   This year, we can commit ourselves to building a foundation for a  stronger America by making investments in our Nation's roads,  waterways, infrastructure, and communities.   Madam Speaker, as we consider the State of the Union, this Congress  has two choices: build walls or build bridges. Bridges lead to better  healthcare, to better jobs, to a better economy to make America great  again, and again, and again.                            ____________________
