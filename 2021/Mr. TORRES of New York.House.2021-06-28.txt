 Madam Speaker, I thank Chair Beatty for  yielding. And I know brevity is the soul of wit, so I will express my  thoughts as succinctly as I can.   I am honored to be the co-chair of the CBC Special Order hour and to  serve under the dynamic leadership of the CBC chair, Joyce Beatty, who  is a force to be reckoned with. I thank the gentlewoman for affording  me the honor to co-chair the CBC Special Order hour.   I echo what our majority whip said, that we cannot afford to take an  obsolete view of infrastructure. Infrastructure is about more than  roads and bridges. It is about the quality of the air we breathe and  the water we drink. It is about access to the internet, especially in a  world of remote learning and telehealth. It is about safe, decent,  affordable housing, which is a human right.   Abraham Maslow spoke about a hierarchy of needs, and the highest need  we have is self-actualization. And in order to actualize ourselves, we  have to meet our most fundamental needs, our need for employment,  housing, transit, and education. That is what we mean by  infrastructure.   Infrastructure is not simply physical, but it is social and human. It  is that which enables us to become the best version of ourselves.   The component of infrastructure that matters most to me is affordable  housing. I would not be where I am today were it not for affordable  housing and the stability that it gave me and my family. For me  affordable housing is not simply brick-and-mortar, but it is the  foundation on which we build a better life for ourselves and our  family.   It is often said that the south Bronx is the poorest congressional  district in America, but I think of the south Bronx as the essential  congressional district. Because it is home to essential workers who put  their lives at risk during the peak of the pandemic so that the rest of  the city and the country could safely shelter in place.   And I believe deeply that the essential workers of America, the  essential workers of New York City should be able to afford to live in  a city that cannot survive and succeed without them.                                time  2110    Now, the American Jobs Plan proposes hundreds of billions of dollars  in new funding for affordable housing, but just as important as the  dollar amount is how those dollars are spent. If we simply invest those  dollars in expanding housing supply without expanding housing subsidy,  then we run the risk of creating housing that leaves behind the lowest  income Americans. We run the risk of creating the appearance rather  than the reality of affordable housing.   When the subject of affordable housing is raised, the question that  often comes to mind is: Affordable for whom?   We need deep affordability. We need real affordability. And the best  path to deep affordability--to affordability for all Americans--is  housing vouchers for all. Housing vouchers ensure that you pay no more  than 30 percent of your income towards your rent.   Madam Speaker, I am honored to sponsor legislation with Chair Waters  and subcommittee Chair Cleaver, which would expand the Section 8  program and establish housing vouchers as an entitlement, as a human  right, codified in Federal law.   Housing vouchers for all takes on a special urgency because we are  facing the greatest affordability crisis that we have seen since the  Great Depression. There are 37 million Americans who pay more than one- third of their income toward their rent. There are 17 million Americans  who pay more than half their income toward their rent. And that does  not even factor in the cost of utilities, food, transportation, and  healthcare.   There are millions of Americans who are living on the brink of  foreclosure and eviction in the midst of COVID-19. And at the heart of  the affordability crisis is the gap between supply and demand. The  demand for affordable housing far exceeds the supply.   Madam Speaker, I will provide you with some statistics in New York  City. In New York City, there are 1 million households earning at or  below 50 percent of AMI, which is about $60,000 a year. But there are  only 420,000 units affordable to those households. That is a gap of  580,000 units.   That is why we need a Federal Government that is going to take an  expansive view of infrastructure and invest in the creation and  preservation of affordable housing on a scale that we have not seen  before. Our country deserves no less.    Madam Speaker, we are not only from the great  State of New York but the great county of the Bronx.   Education is infrastructure and who better to speak about education  than a lifelong educator.   Well, before running for Congress, our next speaker was a principal  who dedicated his life to educating the students of the northeast  Bronx. He is one of the first Black Members of Congress to ever  represent Westchester County, which has historically been ground zero  for resistance to fair housing.   If you have ever seen the movie, ``Show Me a Hero,'' in Yonkers, that  is the district of our next speaker. Even though he embodies how far we  have come as a country, he knows more than most how far we must go.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Bowman),  the one and only.    Madam Speaker, I will just quickly state, you  know, we are in the midst of an FDR moment, and we have an historic  opportunity to govern as boldly in the 21st century as FDR did in the  20th century. But the difference between then and now is ours is going  to be a new deal for everyone; Black and Brown new deal.
