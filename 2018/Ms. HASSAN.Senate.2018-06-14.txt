 Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I  recognize the passing of Kittie Moore Wilson, of New London, NH.   Today, I wish to celebrate the life of Kittie and her service to New  Hampshire.   While Kittie was born in Bangor, ME, she spent a majority of her life  as a Granite Stater. She attended Epsom High School and then went to  Plymouth State University, as well as the University of Connecticut.  After graduating, Kittie taught third grade for 15 years at Kearsarge  Regional School District before going on to oversee and teach the  Mindstretch Program throughout the entire district for the next 16  years.   Known affectionately as the Loon Lady, Kittie had a deep love of the  environment and was dedicated to protecting loons and conserving  Pleasant Lake in New Hampshire. For her work and her passion, she  received the Loon Preservation Committee's Spirit of the Loon Award and  the EPA's Meritorious Lifetime Achievement Award.   During my time as Governor of New Hampshire, I had the pleasure of  working with Kittie and the Loon Preservation Committee on SB 89,  legislation that helped to protect our loon population from deadly lead  poisoning and to preserve an important part of our State's natural  beauty that helps drive our economy.   Kittie is survived by her husband of 29 years, John, her brother  Michael Moore and his family, her sister Karen Johnson and her family,  her stepson Jeb Wilson, and her Scottish Terriers Aberfeldy and  Macallan.   I join with Kittie's friends and family, and many people across the  Granite State in remembering and honoring her legacy.                            ____________________
