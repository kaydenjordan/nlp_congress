 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, ever since President Trump signed the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, we have seen how one law can  literally transform the economic landscape across the country. The New  York Times has reported that there is a wave of optimism surging among  job creators.   Let me just footnote that the New York Times was certainly a skeptic  as to what the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would be, but they  now report that a wave of optimism is surging among job creators.   Since January 2017, 2.3 million jobs have been added in the United  States, and unemployment is at a 17-year low. U.S. weekly jobless  claims are at their lowest since 1969. Many people who thought that  stagnant growth and flat wages were the new normal have been  surprised--and maybe a better word is ``gratified''--to see what the  impact of this policy has been on their take-home pay, on their  confidence in their future, and on investments and new jobs. It is  pretty exciting. In 2017, average unemployment rates decreased in 32  States according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.   Mr. President, 186,000 manufacturing jobs have been added over the  last 12 months. I know the President and all of us are concerned about  manufacturing moving offshore because the cost of doing business in  some places around the world is much lower than it is in the United  States, but we should all be excited about the fact that 186,000  manufacturing jobs have been added in the last 12 months.   As I mentioned, consumer confidence is now at its highest level since  November 2000, and real disposable incomes have seen their biggest gain  since April 2015.   According to a National Federation of Independent Business survey,  more small businesses than ever now believe it is a good time to  expand. This is a very important part of the equation, and I will say  more about small businesses in just a moment.   In Texas, where I am from, a survey of Houston businesses found that  2 out of 3 companies there will increase hiring and wages, while nearly  9 out of 10 said they expected to see an increase in their revenue. The  head economist of the bank that conducted the survey didn't waste any  words, saying that ``something real is happening in the economy.'' I  agree. The positive gains from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are real and  undeniable.   Recently, my office heard from one of my constituents by the name of  Judy Patton. Judy lives in Cleburne, TX, which is roughly an hour from  Dallas, down U.S. Highway 67. Judy owns a plumbing company called P&P.  She said that her plumbing company will be giving both raises and  bonuses to all of its employees this year because of the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act, and she just wanted to let us know that she appreciates what  we are doing.   Well, all of us who have the honor of representing constituents here  in the Senate hear from our constituents from time to time, and they  don't always give us an ``attaboy'' or words of encouragement.  Frequently they say ``Can't you all do better'' or ``You have done  this, and I don't like that much.'' So it is nice to hear from people  like Judy the encouragement that she has given us for the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act. I can say, for my part, to Judy that we are thrilled you  decided to pay the savings forward to other folks in the Cleburne area.  Plumbers are a good example of the untold stories on tax reform.   Here in Washington, we are not always conscious of the ripple  effect--the way in which the changes we have enacted affect small  businesses and individual lives. Judy reminds us of the positive  impacts that are felt all over. It is not just the big players, the  Fortune 500 companies with thousands of employees and operations around  the world; it is small businesses like P&P in Cleburne, too, that are  busy helping out those small communities and making lives better. Those  examples are just as important as those in the Fortune 500.  [[Page S1345]]                                     Fix NICS Bill    Mr. President, another issue I will continue to be focused on  concerns a bill that I cosponsored with the junior Senator from  Connecticut, Mr. Murphy, called Fix NICS. The President, when we were  over at the White House last week, said: Well, maybe you need a better  name for the bill. I had to explain that NICS was the National Instant  Criminal Background Check System and that we believed it was broken and  needed to be fixed; hence the name ``Fix NICS.'' But I take the  President's point--maybe we ought to do a better job branding what it  is we are selling here, and what we are selling is something vitally  important that will save lives.   The Fix NICS bill will fix holes in the background check system that  is utilized when firearms are purchased by individuals in the United  States. As we know, when you go buy a gun at a gun store, there is a  background check that has to be conducted. That is current law. When  federally licensed firearm dealers like McBride's Guns, Inc., in  Austin, TX, that I patronize--when you go in to buy a new shotgun to go  bird hunting or something like that, they will run a background check.  Of course they ask you to answer the questions, but the problem we  discovered in Sutherland Springs is that not everybody is performing  their responsibility and uploading the information that would show that  people who are purchasing guns are lying on their background check and  are legally disqualified from purchasing those firearms.   For many, the aftereffects of the shooting last month at Stoneman  Douglas High School in Parkland, FL, still resonate--I know that is  true for all of us--and the pain and frustration aren't going away. I  always worry, though, after one of these events occurs, that given the  relentless carpet-bombing of news and other information that we all  sustain here in Washington, in the Nation's Capital, it is too easy to  begin to lose sight of our objective to make things different and to  improve outcomes when it comes to terrible events like this. Sometimes  we get distracted and we move on to other topics, but we can't allow  ourselves to do that. We have heard from Stoneman Douglas students  themselves who are angry and deserve to be so.   Last week, the junior Senator from Florida, Mr. Rubio, and I met with  Andrew Pollack, the father of a victim who lost her life at Stoneman  Douglas. Mr. Pollack's daughter isn't coming back, sadly, but the least  we can do is to prevent others like her from losing their lives in  similar incidents in the future.   I wanted to tell Andrew that steps have already been taken, and I  wanted to say: This will not happen again. Your daughter and other  future victims have pushed us, finally, to change.   But I couldn't do that, not with a straight face, and I still can't.  Here we are almost a week after the meeting and we have taken zero  steps forward, even though the Fix NICS bill is now cosponsored by 50  Senators on a bipartisan basis. The majority leader, a Republican, and  the minority leader, a Democrat, are cosponsors of the bill. Senator  Murphy from Connecticut and Senator Cornyn from Texas--we are the  principal cosponsors of the bill. We agree about very little in other  areas of public policy, but we agree in this case that this is simply  too important of an issue and that we really need to demonstrate our  competence and to try to regain the public's confidence in our ability  to actually function in a way that will save lives in the future.   Well, unfortunately, much like the DACA debate, people want to make  this bill a Christmas tree, trying to decorate it with other  legislative ornaments that look nice to their political base but stand  no chance of passing this body or the House. I think we have to call  that what it is--political posturing. It is not about getting a result.  It is not about passing a bill that will actually improve the  background check system to prevent people like the shooter at  Sutherland Springs, for example, from actually purchasing a firearm by  lying on the background check.   Thankfully, Andrew Pollack sees all this with clear eyes. He has said  to me and Senator Rubio that we need to focus on what is achievable.  He, himself, is focused on school safety, and I certainly support that.   I know my colleague Senator Hatch has introduced a bill that is  bipartisan and widely supported by all sides, which I support.   Another reform that is achievable today, if we were allowed to vote  on it, is Fix NICS--to fix our broken background check system. We  should start with what is achievable and what will actually save lives,  and that describes the Fix NICS bill. It will help prevent dangerous  individuals with criminal convictions and history of mental illness  from buying firearms. This bill could easily pass the Senate. It has  already passed the House. The President would sign it, as he told me  when he called me last Thursday night. He said he supports the Fix NICS  bill. There are other things he would like to do. There are other  suggestions people have made, but we need to do what is achievable, and  we need to do that as soon as we possibly can.   Several publications have endorsed the Fix NICS bill, saying it is a  commonsense proposal that is a ``test of [Democrats'] sincerity.'' Do  our colleagues really want to work together to prevent further  shootings at churches and schools? Voting on this bill would be one way  to do it.   The New York Times calls Fix NICS a ``rare piece of gun legislation  that has no meaningful opposition and that has bipartisan support.''  That is one of the most maddening things about working here in  Washington, DC--when there are bills that have no meaningful opposition  and have bipartisan support and they still don't go anywhere.   The Dallas Morning News said the bill ``keeps deadly weapons away  from people already prohibited from owning them.'' The San Antonio  Express News calls Fix NICS a ``relatively easy place to start.'' That  would be wonderful if it were true in the Senate. The Express News  calls the bill ``narrow'' and ``necessary.''   I am not suggesting it is a panacea, but why don't we want to take  the first step in the direction of passing legislation, which  essentially enforces existing law and one that will save lives?   If the shooter at Sutherland Springs had run into the FBI background  check system in the Air Force, in that case, and they uploaded his  felony conviction as well as his conviction for domestic violence,  where he fractured the skull of his infant stepson--if they had  uploaded that information into the background check system, he would  not have been able to legally purchase a firearm, but he did purchase  those firearms, and he used them to walk around a little Baptist Church  in Sutherland Springs one Sunday morning when people were worshiping  inside. He didn't go inside at first. He shot through the wall. It  wasn't a stone building. It wasn't a brick building. It was made out of  wood. It was a simple little Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs.  People were gathered to worship, and 26 of them were gunned down. He  walked into the church, after he shot dozens of rounds through the  building, and he went inside and shot them and killed them--26 people.  There were 20 more wounded. Fortunately, they did not die from their  wounds.   I believe, with all my heart, that those 26 people would be alive  today if we made sure our broken background check system worked by  enforcing current law and passing a bill like Fix NICS. I believe that  would have saved their lives, and it would have stopped the change that  the 20 who were wounded are now going to experience as a result of  their life-altering injuries.   I told myself, at that time, I am not going to come back to that  small community and look those families in the face unless I have done  everything humanly possible to change the outcome in the future. How  can any of us, in good conscience, look our constituents in the face,  those who lose their loved ones to incidents like this--how can we look  them in the face, in good conscience, and say we have done our duty,  when we failed to act where we could on an achievable bill, with no  opposition and broad bipartisan support?   The Waco Tribune says: ``Second Amendment advocates who regularly  stress the need to enforce existing gun laws rather than forging new  laws should welcome'' the bill. This bill is supported by the whole  political spectrum when it comes to guns and the Second Amendment, from  the NRA to people who say, well, they really have  [[Page S1346]]  reservations about law-abiding citizens owning guns even for their own  defense or for recreation or hunting purposes. The whole political  spectrum agrees this is a commonsense, achievable bill, and so do 49  colleagues in the Senate, both Republicans and Democrats.   I have said it before, but I am here to say it again: Let's pass Fix  NICS now. Andrew Pollack and the rest of the Nation are waiting for a  sign that we are serious about preventing wanton acts of violence that  should not and cannot continue.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Arizona (Mr. McCain).
