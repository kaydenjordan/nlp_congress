 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding me  time and for her tireless work on behalf of working families in  America.   Mr. Chairman, the Financial CHOICE Act is nothing more than a  misguided attempt to return to the days where bad actors could put the  entire financial system at risk.   There is bipartisan support to provide regulatory relief for  community banks and credit unions. Just last  [[Page H4727]]  week, I met with credit unions in my district, and they talked about  the need for thoughtful, tailored regulation. Unfortunately, that kind  of thoughtful reform is not what is before us today.   Instead, we have a bill before us that is a fundamental attack on  working families in America. This bill will make it harder to go after  bad actors in the financial markets by hamstringing regulators, and  would completely gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It would  eliminate important programs that ensure that taxpayers will not be on  the hook for future bailouts. And it makes our financial system a whole  lot less secure.   The district that I represent was one of the hardest hit in the  entire country during the financial crisis. My constituents sent me  here to ensure that we don't repeat the mistakes of the past, which is  exactly what this bill does.   Mr. Chairman, this bill has been named the Financial CHOICE Act, and  I think it is a fitting name.   Each of us here today has a simple choice to make: Do we side with  the working families of America? Or do we side with the big  corporations and the special interests?
