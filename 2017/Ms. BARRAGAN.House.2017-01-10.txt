 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give thanks. I give thanks  to the people of California's 44th District for giving me the honor and  the privilege to serve them.   My district is rich with immigrants. My own mom, who turned 76 today,  is an immigrant from Mexico who came here with a third grade education  so her kids could have a shot at the American Dream.   In my district, only 10 percent of students go on to college. I am  grateful to be one of those 10 percenters who beat the odds and got a  piece of the American Dream.   But those numbers are unacceptable. I pledge to fight for them to  make sure everyone, regardless of income, immigration status, or race  has a shot at the American Dream.                            ____________________
