 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts  for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, this is a bad joke on America. Here we are, the choice  act:   The choice is get sick or go broke.   The choice is more coverage for average Americans or more tax cuts  for the rich, higher costs for families.   Twenty-four million people, at least, lose their coverage under the  choice act, or TrumpCare.   That is a bad joke. That is a bad choice.   Here is something: discrimination against older Americans. They have  five times the cost of younger Americans under TrumpCare, under their  choice act.   This hurts Medicare.   There are no savings in this bill--that was what the whole thing was  all about--but instead, we get less coverage for average Americans. We  get many people cut off their coverage, but we get big tax cuts for the  rich.   This is a bad joke. This bill should be defeated. This rule should be  defeated.
