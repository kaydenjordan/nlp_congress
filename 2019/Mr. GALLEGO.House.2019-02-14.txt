 Mr. Speaker, let's be clear. Donald Trump's Presidency  is the real national emergency.   President Trump fired the FBI director to protect his national  security adviser. He tried to rip healthcare from millions of Americans  and destroy protections for people with preexisting  [[Page H2025]]  conditions. He orchestrated the largest transfer of wealth from middle  class families to rich families.   And Trump has done nothing in the face of epidemic levels of gun  violence and devastating impacts of climate change.   Why is Trump lying about a national emergency at the border? He is  doing it to distract the American people from the fact that he has no  plan to improve healthcare, improve our schools, or do one damn thing  for working people in this country.
