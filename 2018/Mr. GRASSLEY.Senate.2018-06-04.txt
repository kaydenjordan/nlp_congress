 Mr. President, I intend to object to any unanimous  consent request relating to the nomination of William R. Evanina, to be  Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center,  PN1548.   During the course of the Judiciary Committee's inquiry into how the  Justice Department and FBI handled the Clinton and Russia  investigations, committee staff have reviewed text messages between  Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. In some of the text messages, an individual  named ``Evanina'' is mentioned in the context of government officials  having briefed then Vice President-Elect Pence on national security  related issues and planning to brief him a second time. The name was  redacted from text messages initially provided to Congress.   ``Evanina'' most likely refers to the nominee who is and was at that  time Acting Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security  Center. The committee needs to more fully understand the meaning of the  apparent references to Mr. Evanina in the Strzok-Page texts and will  need to obtain further context from him and the Justice Department in  order to do so before I could consent to proceeding to consider his  confirmation.   The committee has recently experienced increasing difficulty in  obtaining relevant documents and briefings from the Justice Department  and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, ODNI. For  example. Deputy Attorney General, DAG, Rod Rosenstein personally  assured me that the Senate Judiciary Committee would receive equal  access to information provided to the House Permanent Select Committee  on Intelligence, HPSCI, with regard to any concessions in its  negotiations regarding pending subpoenas from that committee. Two weeks  ago, the ODNI and the DAG provided a briefing in connection with a  pending HPSCI, subpoena to which no Senate Judiciary Committee member  was invited. Thus far, the committee's attempts to schedule an  equivalent briefing have been ignored.   Additionally, beginning November 29, 2017, I made requests for  information from the inspector general of the Intelligence Community  and ODNI regarding the diffusion of the IC whistleblower program and  the highly unusual and problematic termination of the IC IG's former  Executive Director for Whistleblowing and Source Protection. In March,  having received none of the information I asked for, I formally and  publicly objected to the confirmation of the ODNI general counsel  nominee. To date, I still have received nothing. Therefore, I also  object to Mr. Evanina's confirmation until and unless the ODNI provides  a fulsome response to my letters. Additionally, I understand that Mr.  Evanina was responsible for developing policies and procedures to  address retaliatory security clearance actions pursuant to a statutory  directive, but that it is not clear whether such policies and  procedures have been implemented. I would like for Mr. Evanina to  explain the status of those efforts.   Thus, unfortunately, I must object to any consideration of this  nomination. My objection is not intended to question the credentials of  Mr. Evanina in any way. However, the executive branch must recognize  that it has an ongoing obligation to respond to congressional inquiries  in a timely and reasonable manner.                            ____________________
