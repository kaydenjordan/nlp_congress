 Madam President, I would like to address the Senate and  describe the situation in Vermont.   On July 10, we had a catastrophic flood that affected parts of the  entire State. What I would like to speak about today are a couple of  things: one, where Vermont stands in the recovery and, two, to describe  specifically damages to our agriculture community and our farming  community.   Before I do start, I want to express my gratitude to the Biden  administration, to the FEMA folks who visited, to the Secretary of  Transportation, who visited, and to the staff at FEMA, who have been  working tirelessly to help Vermonters go through the very difficult  process.   There are folks who have lost their homes or suffered significant  damage to their homes, folks who have lost their businesses. We saw,  when I was here originally, a photograph of Montpelier, where the  entire downtown district was flooded, and the individuals in the  farming community who have seen all of their work and all of their  crops destroyed.   Senator Sanders and Congresswoman Balint and I are working as closely  as we possibly can with Governor Scott, whose administration is totally  dedicated to trying to help Vermonters recover. What did happen in  Vermont affected homes, it affected infrastructure, it affected  businesses, but it also affected the farming communities.   Earlier this week, Governor Scott and I visited the farm of Paul  Mazza in Essex Junction. Paul has been farming for about 40 years,  since he was 11 years old. The farmland that we see here along the  river--as you can see, it has risen up so that it covers much of the  acreage. The acreage included raspberries, blueberries, blackberries-- crops for which neighbors and Vermonters from all around look forward  to coming to the Mazza farm and self-harvesting.   As Paul Mazza said to Governor Scott and to me, ``The people of Essex  and the people of Vermont need my farm, and my farm needs the people of  Vermont.''   A custom in Vermont was for folks, with their families, to go to the  Mazza farm and do their own picking.   He has about 40 acres that are dedicated to those extraordinary  crops, and they have been destroyed. We walked that farm and saw the  devastation. When the flooded waters rose up above the crops and then  receded, it left a residue which destroyed them. He also has almost 300  acres of corn, feed corn, and about 250 acres of that were destroyed as  well.   What we understand is that about 100,000 acres of forest and cropland  have been affected by the flood. About 10,000 of those acres are in  direct agricultural activity.   As for the vegetable crops from our small farmers, whose work is only  paid for at the end of the season when they harvest and sell those  crops, those crops are destroyed. So, with many of our smaller  vegetable farmers, who are so important to community life and so  important to getting good, nutritious food, those crops have been  destroyed.   The question is whether those farmers are going to be able to get  back in business, and we are going to need to be able to help them if  that is going to happen.   I have a couple of things I would like to say. One is to Vermonters  and to Vermont farmers: Report. Report. Report.   In order for us here in Washington to be able to make the case for  the aid that we need and you need, we have to document what the damages  are. Some folks in Vermont are hesitant to make that report, thinking  they might affect their neighbor's ability to get aid. That is not the  case. We need to document how much loss has been suffered by every  Vermonter.   So, please, especially our farmers but our homeowners and our  businesses, report. Call 211, and let us know what the damage is where  you live. It could be anything from driveway damage to Paul Mazza's  crop damage of a couple hundred acres.   Second, Senator Sanders and I will be asking at some point, when we  know what that damage is, for the assistance of our colleagues to help  out Vermonters who have been the victims of this natural disaster, this  catastrophic flood, that occurred 17 days ago.    Before I finish, I want to express the inspiring response that  Vermonters have had.   You know, we are 17 days into this, and immediately after the flood,  there was an outpouring of support from volunteers--other Vermonters-- to come to help businesses that were flooded, to help homeowners who  were flooded, and even to help our farmers.   People are going back to their lives, but Vermonters still want to  help. Some of the stories so inspired me, and I will give one.   In Marshfield, there is an owner of a general store, Michelle  Eddleman McCormick. She thought she was running a country store. Well,  on the day of the storm, in Marshfield, it was absolutely devastated.  She took in three dozen people who stayed in her store, and she  sheltered them. I just can't believe the generosity of this person to  fellow Vermonters in need--taking three dozen people in, sleeping on  the floor, and doing whatever they could to get through the night and  the next day. The damage was enormous. Marshfield, where the country  store is, lost three bridges, and a fourth was severely damaged.   In the small town of Johnson, a sewer main was taken out when the  line attached to the bottom of a bridge was ripped away by a car that  was floating down the river. The wastewater treatment facility in  Johnson was totally destroyed. It suffered 8 feet of water in the plant  itself. Across Vermont, we lost 33 wastewater treatment plants.   In the small town of Cabot--famous for its Cabot/Agri-Mark cheese-- every single road was damaged, and people were stranded within the  community because you couldn't get out, and you couldn't get in.   In Cambridge and Jeffersonville, these small towns were completely  cut off during the flood. A senior low-income housing project was lost  to the flood.   So we are now in that stage where the initial trauma of that flood on  July 10 is behind us, but there is very hard work that is required to  try to get that business back on its feet or for that homeowner to find  shelter, for that farmer--Paul Mazza and his daughter, Katie, and the  folks who worked so hard on the Mazza farm--they have to do the day by  day, step-by-step recovery because we want folks to be back in their  homes; we want folks to be back on their farms; and we want folks to be  back in their businesses.  [[Page S3737]]    Vermonters are going to do everything they possibly can. The  Governor's response and the legislative response is important, and  there is public and private activity that is going on to help  Vermonters get back on their feet, but we in the Federal Government  have to do our part.   Vermonters have always, always been there to help other parts of our  country that have suffered natural disasters, which is through no fault  of anyone's, but for the folks who are on the receiving end--in this  case a flood, in another case a hurricane, in another case a wildfire-- we have to help each other, and Vermonters have always helped others.   My hope--and I am confident on the basis of the very supportive  comments that my colleagues have made to Senator Sanders and to me--is  that we will get the help that we need for Vermonters. I am inspired by  how Vermonters have helped each other, and my hope is that we will help  them get back, fully recovered as soon as possible.   I yield the floor.   (Mr. COONS assumed the Chair.)   (Mr. WELCH assumed the Chair.)    Mr. President, on May 24, 2023, Congressman  Jim McGovern  spoke on the House floor about the distressing situation in Cuba, and I  want to associate myself with his remarks. He expressed his deep  disappointment and frustration, which I share, with the current policy  of the United States toward Cuba that amounts to little more than a  continuation of the failed policies of the previous administration.   If the consequences of our policy were benign, perhaps one could  ignore what is happening on that tiny island of 11 million people. But,  as Congressman McGovern described, it is anything but benign. Our  policy is contributing, directly and indirectly, to widespread  hardships and hunger in Cuba that caused some 313,000 Cubans to abandon  the island last year alone, seeking entry to the United States.   As any objective observer of Cuba knows, since long before the Castro  revolution, the Cuban people have suffered continuous deprivations and  humiliations. Political oppression and severely limited economic  opportunities, punctuated by recurrent natural disasters, have  circumscribed their lives. Through it all, they have persevered,  propelled by their extraordinary ingenuity, national pride, and innate  resilience. However, the mass exodus of Cubans in the past two years  illustrates how dire the situation has become.   This is by no means the first time that large numbers of Cubans have  risked their lives to seek refuge and a better life in the United  States, but none were on the scale of recent years. Several factors  have led to the current calamity, including punitive Cold War sanctions  reimposed by the previous administration and unfortunately kept in  place by the current administration.  [[Page S3743]]  The Cuban Government's mismanagement of the economy and its reluctance  to fully unleash and energize Cuba's fledgling private sector, the  global COVID pandemic and economic downturn, and the cutbacks in oil  imports from Venezuela have all played a role in the Cuban people's  plight.   However, there also are several deeply flawed U.S. policies which  enable Cuban authorities to continue to deflect blame for their own  failures onto the United States. They have compounded the misery of  average Cubans and damaged our relations with partners in the  hemisphere. These policies must change.   First, Cuba must be removed from the state sponsors of terrorism  list. We will continue to have profound differences with the Cuban  Government over the importance of democracy and protection of human  rights. But the designation as a state sponsor of terrorism is based on  a determination that a government has ``repeatedly provided support for  acts of international terrorism,'' not on differences of opinion about  democracy or association with unsavory governments. Removing Cuba from  this list, as President Obama did, will bolster Cuba's growing private  sector and enable American commercial investment, trade, and travel to  Cuba. Both are critical to the future prosperity of the Cuban people.  The Biden administration should expeditiously complete any necessary  review to remove Cuba from the terrorism list.   Second, the administration should waive the extraterritorial  sanctions under title 3 of the Helms-Burton Act, which drew the ire of  our hemispheric allies when it was enacted in 1996 and have been waived  by all previous Republican and Democratic administrations, save one.  Cubans continue to flee the island out of desperation, and we cannot  credibly claim to ``stand with the Cuban people,'' while supporting  policies designed to cripple their economy and increase their daily  hardships.   Finally, we should continue on the path of improving relations  between our two governments, including by sending an ambassador to  Havana. U.S. engagement with a foreign country does not ascribe  legitimacy to its government. If that were the case, we would recall  our Ambassadors and close our Embassies in dozens of countries. Our  isolationist policy is helping to expand malign Chinese and Russian  influence in Cuba, not prevent it. Engagement creates opportunities to  cooperate when it is in our national interest and to actively defend  universal rights and freedoms. Notably, engagement provides the United  States the ability to more effectively counter the influence of our  adversaries who seek to exploit the vacuum created by our absence.   None of us condone the repressive policies and practices of the Cuban  Government but there are serious consequences to our policy of  unilateral isolation. History has shown that regardless of how  difficult life is in Cuba, the Cuban authorities will take whatever  measures they deem necessary to crush public dissent to maintain  control, as we saw in the wake of the historic street protests of July  11, 2021. Hundreds of brave protesters continue to languish in Cuban  jails.   For years, Senator Patrick Leahy worked to replace an anachronistic,  failed, punitive policy toward Cuba with one based on common sense and  in accordance with our national interests. His efforts played a central  role in President Obama's decision to restore diplomatic relations and  engagement with Cuba in 2015. That policy was producing unprecedented,  positive results for the Cuban people until it was unfortunately  reversed. I urge the Biden administration to continue the work Senator  Leahy and President Obama began. It is the only policy worthy of the  United States.                            ____________________
