Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4406, the Small Business  Development Centers Improvement Act of 2019.   Mr. Speaker, as always, before we address the many benefits of the  bill, I just want to thank the ranking member and his staff for all of  their collaboration and hard work to bring this bipartisan package of  bills to the floor. Our committee prides itself on our ability to put  the noise aside and get meaningful work accomplished.   These bills are especially critical because they strengthen the  entrepreneurial network of small businesses contributing to our country  every day. It is once again a reminder of the importance of working  across the aisle and getting things done for America's 30 million small  businesses.   H.R. 4406 bolsters the Small Business Development Center, or SBDC,  Network, which is the Small Business Administration's largest  entrepreneurial resource partner.   The network delivers free face-to-face counseling and at-cost  training in all aspects of business management to new and existing  small firms. The services include, but are in no way limited to,  assisting small businesses with developing a business plan, accessing  capital, marketing, regulatory compliance, technology development, and  international trade.   The benefits of the program are tangible to businessowners and the  Federal taxpayer. For every Federal dollar spent on SBDCs, $2 is  returned to the U.S. Treasury, nearly $3 to the States, and  approximately $48 in new capital is generated.   Unfortunately, over the years, Congress has asked them to take on  additional responsibilities, ranging from cybersecurity to export  promotion. Increasing the authorization level to $175 million each  year, just as this bill does, will allow the program to grow and reach  more American entrepreneurs.   H.R. 4406 also requires regular reporting to Congress on new metrics  to help us better assess the program and how improvements can be made  in the future.   Starting a business is not for the faint of heart, and strengthening  the network will enable SBDCs to continue providing the in-depth  business training for aspiring entrepreneurs and small business owners.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Golden and Vice Ranking Member Radewagen for  leading this effort to improve the program, measure its success, and  increase awareness of the SBDC program and its many valuable services.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bipartisan piece of  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Golden), the sponsor of the bill and  chair of the Subcommittee on Contracting and Infrastructure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   America's 30 million small businesses account for more than 56  million jobs and create two out of three private-sector jobs in the  United States. The SBA offers a wide range of free or low-cost  counseling and training services through its entrepreneurial ecosystem  to help entrepreneurs launch and grow their businesses.   H.R. 4406 makes a number of improvements to the SBDC program. It will  enable more collaboration between the centers and SBA, improve the  ability of this committee to oversee its performance, while also  clarifying other rules, such as confidentiality requirements.   Most importantly, this legislation is a much-needed reauthorization  of the program for 4 years at greater authorization levels.   It is time for Congress to prove its commitment to entrepreneurs all  over the country by strengthening one of the greatest resources, the  SBA SBDC program. It is a commonsense move and one supported by the  Association of Small Business Development Centers.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the ranking member for his support, and I  urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4405) to amend the Small Business Act to improve the women's  business center program, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4405         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill before us today, H.R.  4405, the Women's Business Centers Improvements Act.   Women's Business Centers, or WBCs, are a critical component of SBA's  entrepreneurial ecosystem. WBCs were created to assist small businesses  primarily owned by women, many of whom are socially and economically  disadvantaged.                                time  1545    The WBC program funds more than 100 centers nationwide and offers a  full range of counseling and training services for all stages of  business development. Many of the WBCs provide multilingual services,  maintain evening and weekend hours to accommodate clients who work full  time, and allow children to attend training sessions with their  mothers.   In fiscal year 2018, the WBC program trained and advised more than  150,000 clients and created nearly 12,000 small businesses. It has also  proven to be a great return on investment, just like the SBDCs. For  every dollar invested in WBCs, $46 is returned to the economy. And,  with women making up the fastest growing sector of entrepreneurs, it is  imperative to invest in modernizing and adequately funding the program.   The Women's Business Centers Improvements Act increases the  authorization level to $31.5 million each year and lifts the cap on  individual center grants to $300,000, allowing more established centers  to expand their reach to greater numbers of women entrepreneurs,  particularly those of whom are socially and economically disadvantaged.   Additionally, this legislation makes key changes to the program,  enabling the WBCs to serve more of America's nearly 30 million women- owned small businesses. By eliminating unnecessary reporting  requirements and creating a transparent and consultative process  between SBA and the Association of Women's Business Centers, the bill  guarantees WBCs can meet the growing demand for their services.   I want to thank Representative Davids and Representative Hagedorn for  their diligence in working to get this bill right and ensuring that  women entrepreneurs across the country have continued access to vital  counseling and training.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bipartisan bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. Davids), sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, so I am  prepared to close if the gentleman doesn't have any other speakers.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the United States has nearly 30 million women-owned  firms, more than one-third of all firms. Our economy relies heavily on  women-owned small businesses, as they generate over $1.9 trillion in  revenues and employ 9.4 million workers.   H.R. 4405 ensures that they have access to the tools they need to  succeed.   The good news is, women-owned small businesses are growing two times  faster, on average, than all businesses nationwide, and women of color  are launching businesses 4.5 times faster than all businesses.   The discouraging news is that half of aspiring women business owners  report a lack of available mentors. We must take action to break down  the barriers hindering their success. That is why it is imperative for  us to pass this legislation today, ensuring access to  [[Page H8274]]  mentorship and professional guidance to the fastest growing group of  entrepreneurs.   The Women's Business Centers Improvements Act builds on their success  by creating uniformity through accreditation for WBCs and increasing  maximum grant levels to ensure they have the resources to meet demands  for their services.   We all agree that women business owners offer invaluable  contributions to our economy. By passing this bill, we are standing  with women.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4407) to amend the Small Business Act to reauthorize the  SCORE program, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4407         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bill before us, H.R.  4407, the SCORE for Small Business Act.   There are nearly 30 million small businesses in the United States,  representing more than 99 percent of all businesses. These small firms  employ nearly 50 percent of all private-sector employees in the U.S.   The SBA administers a portfolio of entrepreneurial development  programs, which includes the SCORE program. Since its inception, the  SBA has undertaken efforts to connect new entrepreneurs and small  business owners with more experienced businessmen and -women. This  expansive network consists of entrepreneurs, business leaders, and  executives who volunteer as mentors to small firms, both in person and  online.  [[Page H8276]]    SCORE has grown to become one of the Federal Government's largest  volunteer business adviser and mentoring programs. Yet, the SBA OIG  found that improvements are needed to ensure SCORE minimizes risk of  fraud or misuse of program funds and to strengthen SBA's oversight and  the committee's ability to review the effectiveness of the program.   On July 11, 2019, our Subcommittee on Investigations, Oversight and  Regulations held a hearing to examine the agency's oversight of the  SCORE program. This bill is a direct result of that hearing and much  stakeholder engagement.   H.R. 4407 not only reauthorizes this essential program, but it also  takes steps to restore integrity, accounting, and performance to the  program. Doing so ensures the program will continue to have the ability  to meet the needs of entrepreneurs.   With technology enhancements and streamlined service processes, SCORE  mentoring will now be accessible to business owners no matter their  location.   I commend Congressman Hern and Congresswoman Craig for working  together to make sure that the counseling and training programs are  operating effectively, as well as holding SBA accountable as a good  steward of taxpayer dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers if the  gentleman is ready to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   There is no question that we need to support our small businesses  across the country, no matter their location, industry, or expertise  level.   H.R. 4407 does exactly that by reauthorizing a major component of  SBA's entrepreneurial programs and clarifying the utilization of the  volunteer base. This bill is reflective of the growth of the SCORE  program, which actively engages business owners, as well as retired  executives, to mentor the next generation of job makers.  [[Page H8277]]    Most importantly, it responds to the findings of the IG and makes  strides to hold the agency and SCORE mentors accountable.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4387) to establish Growth Accelerator Fund Competition  within the Small Business Administration, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4387         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. GROWTH ACCELERATOR FUND COMPETITION.         (a) In General.--There is established a program within the       Small Business Administration to be known as the ``Growth       Accelerator Fund Competition'' under which the Administrator       of the Small Business Administration shall award prizes on a       competitive basis to covered entities that--        (1) assist small business concerns with accessing capital       and finding mentors and networking opportunities; and        (2) advise small business concerns, including advising on       market analysis, company strategy, revenue growth, and       securing funding.

(g) Selection of Small Business Concerns.--A covered entity       that receives a prize under the Growth Accelerator Fund       Competition shall use a selective process to identify small       business concerns to provide assistance and advice described       under subsection (a).        (h) Development of Metrics.--The Administrator shall       develop metrics to evaluate the effectiveness and the benefit       to the people of the United States of the Growth Accelerator       Fund Competition that--        (1) are science-based and statistically driven;        (2) reflect the mission of the Small Business       Administration; and        (3) include factors relating to the economic impact of the       Growth Accelerator Fund Competition.        (i) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the       Administrator of the Small Business Administration.        (2) Covered entity.--The term ``covered entity'' means a       private entity that is incorporated in and maintains a       primary place of business in the United States.        (3) Small business act definitions.--The terms ``small       business concern'', ``small business concern owned and       controlled by women'', ``small business concern owned and       controlled by veterans'' have the meanings given such terms,       respectively, in section 3 of the Small Business Act (15       U.S.C. 632).        (j) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized       to be appropriated to the Administrator $2,000,000 for each       of fiscal years 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 to carry out the       Growth Accelerator Fund Competition.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the bill before us today, H.R.  4387, which establishes the Growth Accelerator Fund Competition within  SBA.   Accelerator programs provide founders of early-stage companies with  education, mentorship, financing, cohort-based training, and technical  assistance. There are many accelerator success stories. Among them are  well-known companies like Airbnb, Dropbox, and Stripe.   The SBA funds the Growth Accelerator Fund Competition for the  Nation's most innovative, diverse, and promising small business  accelerators and incubators. It was created in 2014 to support small  business job creation by giving early-stage entrepreneurs opportunities  to immerse themselves in an intense learning environment.   Monetary prizes of $50,000 to each of the winners go a long way  towards supporting the development of accelerators and incubators.   Not only does the Growth Accelerator Fund Competition spur economic  development and create jobs, but most importantly, it supports  innovation in economic areas that are outside of what we have come to  think of as traditional coastal tech hubs.   It supports places like the industrial heartland, where barriers to  capital access have hindered entrepreneurs. The program also has a  proven track record of investing in women and minority entrepreneurs.   The legislation will authorize $2 million in funds, annually, for 4  years, to  [[Page H8278]]  carry out the Growth Accelerator Fund Competition. H.R. 4387 continues  our commitment of investment in the next generation of American  entrepreneurs by promoting innovation and growing jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to take this opportunity also  to congratulate Congressman Adriano Espaillat from New York and Mr.  Balderson for their hard work and the contributions that they are  making with this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Espaillat), who is the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Business accelerators help high-growth startup enterprises develop  their products, identify promising customer segments, and secure  resources, including vital capital and potential employees. It is clear  that they serve an important role in innovation, and H.R. 4387 enhances  the ability of the SBA's Growth Accelerator Fund Competition so it can  continue to assist entrepreneurs.   By opening the funding network for companies that may not otherwise  have gained such exposure, the growth accelerator fund helps boost  small business innovation and grow the economy.   The SBA growth accelerator program supports underserved business  owners and fills critical gaps in capital access. In 2019, 60 percent  of the winners were either women owned, socially or economically  disadvantaged, or located in areas with a lower number of SBIR and STTR  awards. This bill reinforces our committee's pledge to entrepreneurship  and job creation.   Finally, I want to thank Mr. Espaillat and Mr. Balderson for their  diligence on this bill, and I also want to take the opportunity to  thank the ranking member, Mr. Chabot, his staff, and my staff.   What we are showing today is that there is not a Republican or  Democratic approach when it comes to small businesses. This is the way  that we do right by the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
