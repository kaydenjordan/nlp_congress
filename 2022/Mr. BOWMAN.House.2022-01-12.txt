 Mr. Speaker, it is our responsibility to ensure that our  veterans have the resources they need to access care after serving.   Every year, brave men and women enlist in the military, seeking to  serve their country, pursue a better life, and obtain benefits and  security for their future. This means being able to afford college and  having access to housing, healthcare, and other opportunities.   Our troops are deployed into active war zones that too often leave  veterans with PTSD, suicidal ideation, anxiety, addiction, depression,  and other mental health challenges.   Regardless of what congressional district you live in, you will  always take what happens in your service back home with you.                                time  1330    But when they return, our government has failed to provide them with  the care and support they deserve.   The outcome is a veterans suicide crisis. The suicide rate for  veterans is 1.5 times higher than the rate of nonveteran adults, and I  see this in my district. I have had veterans call my office as a last  resort after not being able to access the healthcare they need at the  VA. My constituent services team has had multiple cases of veterans  struggling with suicidal ideation and other mental health challenges  who have expressed an immense frustration that no  [[Page H56]]  one in our government seems to care about their well-being. Our  veterans deserve better, and we must do better.   I am grateful for incredible organizations in my district like Black  Veterans for Social Justice, Veterans for Peace, and The American  Legion who are leading with care, working to support our veterans'  mental health by destigmatizing mental health care and connecting  veterans to mental health professionals. They regularly host support  groups for veterans with mental health challenges, advocate for a  stronger VA system, and provide one-on-one opportunities for veterans  to learn about benefits available to them.   Our amendment to H.R. 1836 builds upon their work to ensure that when  transitioning to civilian life, veterans receive information about what  healthcare and mental healthcare services are available to them,  including how to access the Veterans Crisis Line and seek mental health  support. This amendment also specifies that this information should be  provided to veterans in a manner that helps destigmatize mental health  and encourages veterans to reach out.   These are important steps toward creating a society in which every  single veteran has access to universal, high-quality healthcare and is  empowered to seek out the mental health support they need to thrive.   If you are a veteran who is struggling with mental health challenges,  please know that you are not alone and that seeking out mental health  support is an important step toward feeling better. During these  especially difficult times, we must care for ourselves and for one  another.
