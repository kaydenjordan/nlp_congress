 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I called Lisa Pittman,  who is the counsel for our committee, to make sure we had somebody  covering us for floor time.   She chastised me then, saying that under my condition, I need to ask  about calling a doctor first, not calling a lawyer.   No, Lisa, we call you not just for legal advice but for all sorts of  things. For 38 years, she has been a true public servant, with 33  consecutive years here in the House where she has served with poise  under pressure and always brings an air of stability.   We ask opinions of a lot of people, but we always double-check by  going to Lisa because she understands it all.   She served under 17 Republican leaders in Natural Resources. I still  think I am her favorite one--trust me. But even yesterday, she still  told my chief of staff that she gets choked up when she looks at the  Capitol dome or hears the Pledge of Allegiance. It is still magical to  her.   As our committee mom, when she brings cupcakes to everyone on their  birthdays and special occasions, her kindness is magic to the rest of  us.   So, when I leave at the end of the month, no one is really going to  care. When Lisa leaves at the end of the month, it is going to take  decades to replace the institutional knowledge that she brings to this  place.   Lisa, we thank you. And, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your indulgence.                            ____________________
