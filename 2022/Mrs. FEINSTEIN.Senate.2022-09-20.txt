 Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Michael  Schiffer on being confirmed to serve as Assistant Administrator of the  U.S. Agency for International Development.   Michael has prepared himself well for this important position,  becoming one of the most respected foreign policy hands in Washington,  having also served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for East  Asia.   I had the pleasure of working with Michael for nearly a decade when  he served as my senior national security adviser and then my  legislative director. In our time working together, I saw Michael's  skill, expertise, and dedication every day.   He has excelled in every role he has had throughout his career in  public service advancing America's interests and improving our standing  abroad. He is committed to advancing U.S. national security and  advocating for freedom, democracy, and human rights, the pillars of  USAID's mission.  [[Page S4851]]    Michael will be sorely missed by the Senate, where he has been a  pillar of the Foreign Relations Committee staff. USAID will benefit  greatly from Michael's service, and I have no doubt that he will  continue to serve the American people well. I wish him great good luck  as he embarks on this new chapter.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to support my bipartisan  resolution--which I introduce along with Senators Todd Young, Tammy  Baldwin, and Tim Scott--to designate September 2022 as National  Workforce Development Month and to highlight the importance of  workforce development programs for dislocated workers, low-income  adults, and at-risk youth.   According to a recent poll, nearly half of U.S. workers said their  current job may be at risk due to advancements in technology and  automation. By 2030, the number of U.S.-based jobs that will require  more than a high school degree but not those of a 4-year college  education is expected to increase by nearly one-quarter. Our economy is  changing, and our workforce must change along with it.   Accordingly, both business leaders and workers say that they would  benefit from investments in worker skills training and development.   In response to the needs of workers and businesses, Congress  reauthorized the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act in 2014,  which passed with strong bipartisan support. This landmark legislation  has supported employment, training, and support services in recognition  of the need to strengthen the focus of the United States on the skills  necessary to effectively prepare individuals for employment in local  and regional industries.   The COVID-19 pandemic has led many Americans to adapt their work  habits and change their jobs or career paths. The pandemic has also  altered the demands for many jobs. It is therefore imperative for us to  prioritize workforce development programs focused on this new reality  while also getting people back to work.   This resolution reaffirms the impact that education, skills training,  and career advancement training can have on workers' ability to improve  their lives.   Our resolution would designate September 2022 as National Workforce  Development Month, something Congress has done each year since 2017.  More specifically, our resolution would reaffirm the Senate's support  for Federal initiatives promoting workforce development and acknowledge  the vital role this training plays in supporting employees, businesses,  and our national economic prosperity.   As the needs of businesses and workers change, it is important that  Congress support the development of a skilled workforce. I hope my  colleagues will join me in support of this resolution.                            ____________________
