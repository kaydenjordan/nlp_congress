 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and memory  of Adam Johnson of Hibbing, Minnesota.   Adam was a star hockey player for Hibbing High School who went on to  play for the University of Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs for 2 years.   After college, Adam played professionally with the Pittsburgh  Penguins and eventually went overseas to continue his love of the game.   On October 28, Adam's life was tragically cut short during an on-ice  incident. He passed away playing the game he loved.   Many in our State will remember Adam as a talented and dynamic hockey  player who possessed incredible skills on the ice, skills that many of  us could only dream of having.   He will also be remembered as a wonderful person. He was kind, he was  humble, and he never forgot where he came from. He was a hometown hero.   To his parents, Dave and Sue; his brother, Ryan; his fiance, Ryan;  and countless other loved ones, please know that our prayers are with  you and that the State of Hockey will always be there for you.   I thank Adam for the memories. My he rest in peace.                            ____________________
