 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a truly outstanding  individual from Louisiana's Fifth District. For almost 50 years, Irene  Robinson, known to so many of us as Ms. Irene, has been the radio voice  of West Carroll Parish, using the airwaves to keep our rural  communities informed about the latest news, weather, and events around  town. In addition, she is a diehard football fan and spent her Friday  nights as the beloved announcer for the Oak Grove Tigers.   Throughout her career, Ms. Irene ensured that her station, KWCL, was  a community gathering place, highlighting some of the best in our  region. Her love for family and for Louisiana, particularly her native  West Carroll Parish, was always evident on the air.   Ms. Irene's late husband, Ivy, also served as her engineer, ensuring  that her broadcasts were always a family affair. I can tell you that  the sense of family also extended to her guests as well.   Madam Speaker, we are honored to celebrate Ms. Irene Robinson for her  many contributions in northeast Louisiana, we recognize the incredible  legacy she leaves behind, and wish her  [[Page H997]]  well in her retirement after decades of service to our region.                            ____________________
