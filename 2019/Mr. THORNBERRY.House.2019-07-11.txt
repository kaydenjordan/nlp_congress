 Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I appreciate the comments of the gentleman from Rhode Island, and I  want to agree in substantial measure with what he said about the  progress that Cyprus has made both in countering Russian influence and  in combating international money laundering and other issues on which  we have been working with them. I do believe that, as the gentleman  indicated, the embargo that has been in place since 1987 ought to be  considered and looked at, and there ought to at least be considered a  plan to gradually move away from that embargo if and as Cyprus  continues to make progress in weaning itself off Russian weapons and  the other priorities that we have with them.   What I worry about is, all of a sudden, in a total of a 10-minute  debate on the National Defense Authorization Act, that we come in and  say, ``Okay, the embargo is gone; what has been in place since 1987,  never mind anymore,'' without really thinking through the consequences  and having that plan that helps us work with Cyprus to get to a better  place.   And I don't need to remind Members that this area is very complex,  with a  [[Page H5601]]  number of actors that have intense interest in what happens in Cyprus  and in the region. I am not saying that we don't move in that  direction, but I am saying, to come here with a 10-minute debate and  say, ``Okay, never mind what we have done since 1987'' is fraught with  danger.   So, for that reason, I must oppose this amendment. I appreciate the  progress that is being made. I think it is important to look for ways  to build on that progress, but for us to come in and say, ``Oh, never  mind; we are going to upend something that has been in place for so  many years'' would be dangerous.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I simply want to make two points.   One is that the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control is supposed  to meet with her Russian counterpart on this issue next week. What are  we doing? We come to the floor, and we want to tie her hands. We want  to restrict her ability to negotiate with the Russians. That doesn't  make any sense to me.   There has been discussion about flaws in the treaty, how it has not  kept up with changes in technology. Yet the House wants to come and  say, ``Well, we think we ought to extend it anyway,'' giving the  Russians a benefit that they don't have to give anything up for.   It may be that we come to a point where we think extending New START  makes sense. The Russians ought to participate in that as part of a  negotiation, not a unilateral move for us.   Secondly, I have to note more broadly in this bill that when New  START was ratified, part of the agreement was, yes, we will go down to  a lower number of nuclear weapons, but we are going to put increased  investment into the nuclear weapons complex to make it more responsive,  because with lower weapons, if something goes wrong, you have less  margin for error.   This bill before us cuts the requested funding from the nuclear  weapons complex. It cuts funding requested for the Minuteman III  replacement. It cuts in a variety of ways our attempt to have a strong  nuclear deterrent.    Mr. Chair, it seems to me the studies that have been  conducted make it clear that it makes no cost sense to try to extend  the life of these missiles that have been in place for so long.   I think what is really at stake here is whether the three legs of the  triad upon which our defense has depended for so many decades are to be  renewed, modernized, and remain credible.   Each leg of that triad, the submarines, the air leg, and the missiles  that we are talking about now, have unique characteristics. It is the  three of them working together that has been so successful in making  sure that our country has been protected and that no nuclear weapon has  been used since the end of World War II.   It is essential to modernize the land leg base of our triad to make  sure that it stays credible, modern, and safe. That is why this  amendment should be rejected.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.   Mr. Chairman, my understanding is that, in January of this year, the  independent Office of Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation, which is  part of the Department of Energy's NNSA, provided a report and an  objective analysis of this program. Everything that they reported was  that the program remains on budget as expected for the first production  unit by fiscal year 2025.   I think what has happened is that they have a greater opportunity, a  greater need, to spend more money from 2019 to 2020 than they  originally planned. Now, that can occur for several reasons.   Number one, a program can start to move a little faster so you can  make good use of money. Unfortunately, what sometimes happens is once  you start looking into some of these very old warheads, you discover  problems that need some resources in order to deal with those problems.   Now, we can't really talk on the floor about the specific concerns  with any particular warhead today because of classification. But the  key point is, the overall funding program has remained consistent and  perfectly within the guidelines of what was planned originally.   Again, I am afraid that this amendment, like the last one, is delayed  by study. We can study things to death,  [[Page H5620]]  but we have not done what we should to renew the three legs of the  triad and the weapons which constitute our nuclear deterrence, and upon  which our security depends. We have basically reached the point where  we have no margin for error. We have to move ahead with submarines, we  have to move ahead with the new bomber, we have to move ahead with the  Minuteman III replacement, and we have to move ahead with the warhead  replacement, not only to make sure they work, but to make sure the  people around them are safe. That is the crucial point.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Chairman, I thank Ranking  Member Thornberry and Chairman Smith for including my three amendments,  amendments No. 162, 163, and 164, in this en bloc package.   Amendment 162 requires the Department of Defense to review the  effects on preparedness and support to States and territories in  connection with natural disasters, threats, and emergencies prior to  inactivating Army watercraft units.   There are four of these vessels in Puerto Rico. They were  instrumental during the recovery process after Hurricane Maria and  conducted several recovery missions, including delivering food and  other essentials to island municipalities and the Virgin Islands.   This role should be taken into account as part of the review process  prior to divesting any of the Army's watercraft systems, especially  considering the multiple jurisdictions that have been recently impacted  by natural disasters.   Amendment No. 163 seeks to help us speed up the Federal cleanup and  decontamination process in the former military ranges on the island  municipalities of Vieques and Culebra. Specifically, my amendment  directs the General Accounting Office to complete a study and a report  to the congressional defense committees on the status of the process,  including an analysis of the pace of ongoing environmental restoration  efforts and potential challenges and alternatives to accelerate their  completion. This comprehensive study will allow us to explore the most  effective and secure methods to complete the cleanup process in Vieques  and Culebra, which is vital to improve the quality of life of island  residents.   The last amendment, amendment No. 164, highlights the importance of  the Department of Defense counter-drug operations in the transit zone  and Caribbean basin. It expresses the sense of Congress that combating  transnational organizations in the region, particularly in and around  Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, is critical to national  security of the United States, and that the Department of Defense shall  work with the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of  State and other relevant partners to improve surveillance capabilities  and maximize the effectiveness of counter-drug operations in the  region.   That is the reason I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  effort, and I thank you for including these three amendments in the en  bloc package.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry).    Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Chairman, we have had a number of speakers over the course of the  last 2 days talk about that this bill provides a pay raise. I just want  to clarify that it does not.   There is an existing formula which provides the military a 3.1  percent pay raise. If we do nothing, they still get a 3.1 percent pay  raise.   Now, in the past, sometimes the Obama administration, for example,  recommended a lower pay raise. Sometimes in Congress we have enacted a  higher pay raise than the formula would require.   But the key point is 3.1 percent is what the formula is. This bill  does not change that in any way. If the bill passes, if it doesn't  pass, the pay raise still goes in.   I think the Speaker just indicated that she supported the amendment  we are discussing now. Let's be clear. The bill before us cuts $17  billion from the President's request. The amendment before us cuts  another $16 billion from that.   So all the folks who have come here and said it is not too much, it  is not too little, it is just right, they have to vote against this  amendment because this cuts an additional $16 billion.   What is the effect of this $16 billion? It decimates counterterrorism  operations around the world. All of this cut comes from operations and  maintenance within the OCO, the overseas contingency account. That  means we do not do as much to fight terrorists overseas.    It hurts our ability, as another example, to train and help the  Ukrainians fight the aggression that is occurring on their soil. Lots  of people talk about standing up to the Russians. This amendment takes  away the biggest factor in Ukraine that is helping push back against  the Russian-backed insurgents. It decimates support for the Afghan  security forces.   Whether you think Americans should be there or not, we are trying to  help you. Afghans defend themselves. This amendment takes that away.   Real consequences in the real world, I think this amendment finally  gets to where the direction of this bill is headed. Members should  oppose it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Waltz).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I have no other speakers other than  myself, and I reserve the right to close.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, for some years now, there have been some people in the  country who go around ginning up concern that Americans are going to be  whisked out of their beds at night and taken to Guantanamo and left  there indefinitely.   This sort of scaremongering has been used to call attention to  themselves. It has been used to raise money.   As Chairman Smith noted, we have had some debates on this issue in  the past. It had kind of died down when everybody realized that 18  years after 9/11 it hadn't happened.   Yet, there are still some out in the countryside who try to frighten  people that, well, it could someday. Well, actually, it can't.   Let me read three provisions, starting with the FY 2012 NDAA that  said, ``Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect existing  law or authorities relating to the detention of U.S. citizens, lawful  resident aliens of the United States, or any other persons who are  captured or arrested in the United States.''   Now, that says nothing here affects any right of U.S. citizens or  those captured or detained inside the United States. That was part of  the law to begin with.   Another part of the law to begin with says, ``The requirement to  detain a person in military custody under this section . . . does not  extend to citizens of the United States.''   Well, we passed that in 2012. There were some concerns, so we come  back the very next year and have a rule of construction that has been  passed and signed into law.   It says that:         Nothing in that law or in the AUMF shall be construed to       deny the availability of the writ of habeas corpus or deny       any constitutional rights in a court ordained or established       by Article III of the Constitution for any person in the       United States when detained pursuant to an AUMF and who is       otherwise entitled to such writ or rights.    So, we have belts, suspenders, ropes, pretty much anything you can  think of, to make sure that no one inside the  [[Page H5646]]  United States, no U.S. citizen's constitutional right is affected. And  it hasn't been. For 18 years this has not been a problem.   So, I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, that it is not a problem now, that  it is not something that we need to tinker with, especially with so  many court decisions that have interpreted some of the legal issues  related to detainees.   In fact, we should push back against attempted scaremongering and  reject this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. Miller).    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus).    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), our Republican leader.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Riggleman).

Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.  [[Page H5659]]         Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have no speakers here at this time, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, the last speaker made a comment that this is the first  time in many years that House Democrats have an opportunity to put  their priorities on a defense bill. I realize the gentleman is new to  this body, but that statement is simply not true.   Last year, the House Armed Services Committee reported the bill to  the floor by a vote of 60-2. There were more Democratic amendments made  in order under the Rules Committee last year on the floor than there  were Republican amendments. The bill passed the House with 351 votes.   It has been a hallmark of the Armed Services Committee to work in a  collaborative way and to give every member of the committee and,  ultimately, of the House the opportunity to make an imprint on the  nature of this bill.   The reason I have to take a moment is just to contrast that with what  has happened this year. Both the vote coming out of committee and the  fact that of the contested amendments--in other words, of those  amendments where there was some disagreement, some debate, and a  potential vote. There were about 60 Democratic amendments, and there  was exactly one Republican amendment.   That limits the ability of the minority to shape the outcome of the  final bill. So the gentleman's statement has led me to want to  emphasize the difference this year versus prior years. I think it is  too bad, but I hope that at some point in this process, we can return  to that collaborative process.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate the comments of Chairman Smith about the  bipartisan contributions in the past, and that was the primary point I  wanted to make.   I do disagree with him about one key point. It was certainly never my  intention, and I do not believe the intention of any member of the  Armed Services Committee, to oppose this bill from the beginning.   As a matter of fact, as I indicated yesterday, for many of us, it was  a very challenging decision on how to vote with the bill coming out of  committee, not because there weren't serious, substantive  disagreements--there were--but there was hope that it was possible to  bridge those disagreements so that there could be some bend on both  sides to get to our traditional sort of bipartisan vote on the floor.   What definitely changed and is unprecedented is to have one  substantive, contested Republican amendment allowed on the floor--one-- versus 60 Democratic amendments. Those numbers speak for themselves.  There has been, other than the one amendment on low yield--Mr. Turner  yet to come--no other opportunity by Republicans on a contested issue.   There have been en blocs, Republican and Democratic, absolutely. That  is the way it is every year. But as far as standalone debates where it  is contested, there has been one opportunity for Republicans to improve  this bill. That has been disheartening because it makes it much more  difficult for people on this side of the aisle to get to where we can  support this bill.   I share the chairman's commitment. This is not about us. This is  about the troops. Our commitment is to work through every step of  whatever it takes to get to a point that we can do good by the men and  women who serve. That is the objective here.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have no further speakers at this time,  and I yield back the balance of my time.

Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. McCaul), the distinguished ranking member of the Foreign  Affairs Committee.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have only myself to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul).    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Chair, I am very sympathetic to the idea that Congress has  neglected to fulfill its responsibilities under the Constitution in  this area for many years, with Presidents of both parties and with  congressional majorities of both parties.   Unfortunately, I believe that this amendment goes way too far in  restricting the ability of the President to exercise his  responsibilities under Article II.   I note that one of the most recent speakers referenced President  Obama. It was President Obama who used force in Libya with no  authorization from this Congress. As a matter of fact, every President  since Truman has done so. The notion that it is either all-out war or  nothing does not reflect the way the world is or has been for the last  70 years.   I also have to note that it is somewhat concerning to me that much of  this amendment seems focused personally at President Trump, who is  bending over backward not to use military force and has campaigned  against some of the uses in the past. It does not seem to me to be  appropriate.   On the substance of the amendment, we have asked senior general  officers with responsibility for operations on the Joint Staff and  CENTCOM to look at this language. What they tell us is that they are  concerned with this language. I understand the representations that  have been made, but the people who have to live under it believe it  would foreclose the inherent right of self-defense at a time when we  have specific, detailed, and credible threats against 65,000 military  personnel in the CENTCOM region. They believe it would immediately stop  purely defensive intelligence-sharing and defensive border security we  are doing with partners in the region. They believe it would halt  orders with options to strike back proportionally against Iran in order  to limit escalation and would stop active information- related capabilities directly countering Iranian threat networks.    Furthermore, they believe that there is enough concern about this  language that it would at least throw doubt on our ability to come to  the defense of Israel if it were under attack from Iran, Iranian  proxies, or the Iranian threat network. They believe it would cast  doubt on our ability to come to the defense of a ship or vessel in the  Strait of Hormuz if an ally comes under attack.   I would point out that just within the last 2 days, an allied tanker  was at least threatened by Iranian boats coming through the strait.   Senior general officers at the Joint Staff and CENTCOM believe it  would threaten continued Seventh Fleet interdiction efforts in the  Indo-Pacific to thwart Iranian sanctions evasion.   We have a number of ways that are not war but legitimate use of  force.  [[Page H5718]]  People who have to live under it believe this goes too far and prevents  them from doing what they are doing, which gets back to what Mr. McCaul  was talking about. That is, this is only good news for Iran and the  threat that they pose.   It uses a powerful funding mechanism to tie the President's hands,  and they can only be untied after the House and Senate take action. We  know that we often don't move too quickly in these areas.   Again, I am sympathetic with the idea that Congress needs to stand up  and do our job. We need to do it responsibly, not the kind of overreach  that gives assistance to adversaries and makes our allies much more  concerned about whether we will stand with them or not.   Madam Chair, I believe this amendment should be rejected, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   Mr. McGovern. Madam Chair, I rise in support of the bipartisan  amendment offered by Representatives Khanna, Gaetz, Engel, Smith (WA),  Brown, Levin (MI) and me, along with 80 other cosponsors, to prohibit  funding for any engagement in military hostilities in or against Iran  without explicit authorization by Congress.   I want to thank my good friend, Congressman Khanna, for his  leadership on this issue. I especially want to thank Armed Services  Committee Chairman Smith, Foreign Affairs Chairman Engel and their  excellent staff, who worked tirelessly to ensure that this amendment  reflected a broad, bipartisan range of concerns on how best to respond  to the relentless march to war with Iran that is happening under  President Trump and his bellicose advisors.   Madam Chair, our nation almost went to war with Iran just a couple of  weeks ago.   Think about this. We were apparently only moments away from the  president launching an attack against Iran that could have quickly  snowballed out of control into a major conflict. There was no  consultation with Congress. No debate on this floor. No input at all  from this House whose Members represent the servicemen and women who  would be put in harm's way. Let alone a vote.   Democrats don't want war with Iran. Most Republicans don't want war  with Iran. The American people certainly don't want a war in Iran.   But this president was apparently about to use an AUMF passed nearly  two decades ago to fumble us into another conflict in the Middle East.   I'm glad the president backed off bombing Iran. But I'm terrified  about the lack of thoughtful leadership coming from the Oval Office.   We need to make clear to this administration that the president  cannot use an old AUMF to initiate hostilities against Iran.   Nor can he engage in military hostilities in or against Iran without  first coming to Congress and getting a specific authorization for the  use of such force. Period.   It's long past time for Congress to step up to the plate and carry  out its constitutional responsibilities on matters of war and peace.   I urge all my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to support this  amendment.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
