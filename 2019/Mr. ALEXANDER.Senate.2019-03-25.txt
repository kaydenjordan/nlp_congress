 Mr. President, I believe climate change is real. I  believe that human emissions of greenhouse gases are a major cause of  climate change, and I believe the Democratic plan for climate change,  which the Senator from Texas just spoke about--the Green New Deal--is  so far out in left field that not many are going to take it seriously.   So as one Republican, I am here today to propose this response to  climate change, which is that the United States should launch a New  Manhattan Project for Clean Energy, a 5-year project with 10 grand  challenges that will use American research and technology to put our  country and our world firmly on the path for cleaner, cheaper energy.   Meeting these grand challenges would create breakthroughs in advanced  nuclear reactors, natural gas, carbon recapture, better batteries,  greener buildings, electric vehicles, cheaper solar power, and fusion.  To provide the tools to create these breakthroughs, the Federal  Government should double its funding for energy research and keep the  United States No. 1 in advanced computing. This strategy takes  advantage of the United States' secret weapon--our extraordinary  capacity for basic research and especially in our 17 National  Laboratories. It will strengthen our economy. It will raise family  incomes.   This strategy also recognizes that when it comes to climate change,  China, India, and other developing countries are the problem. American  innovation is the answer. According to the Global Carbon Project, over  the last 13 years the United States has reduced production of  greenhouse gases more than any other major country. Let me say that  again. According to the Global Carbon Project, over the last 13 years  the United States has reduced production of greenhouse gases more than  any other major country. But over the last 5 years, China and its  carbon emissions have risen. The U.S. reduction is largely thanks to  conservation and switching from coal to natural gas in the production  of electricity.   This is the way a California physicist explains it: Our mothers told  us as children to clean our plates because children in India were  starving. Now, cleaning our plates was a good thing for us to do, but  it didn't do much for starving children in India. In the same way,  reducing carbon emissions in the United States is a good thing to do,  but it doesn't do much to address climate change because most of the  increase in greenhouse gases is in developing countries. If we want to  do something about climate change, we should use American research and  technology to provide the rest of the world with tools to create low- cost energy that emits fewer greenhouse gases.   The purpose of the original Manhattan Project during World War II was  to find a way to split the atom and build a bomb before Germany could.  The New York Times described this as the ``most concentrated  intellectual effort in history.'' Instead of ending a war, the goal of  the New Manhattan Project will be to minimize the disruption on our  lives and our economies caused by climate change, to clean the air, and  to raise family incomes, both in our country and in the rest of the  world, by creating large amounts of reliable, clean, inexpensive  energy.   Can a New Manhattan Project accomplish such bold breakthroughs in  just 5 years? Well, take a look at the last 5 years. Carbon emissions  from energy consumption are down by 230 million metric tons. The number  of electric vehicles has doubled and so has the median driving range  per charge. The utility scale cost of solar power has been nearly cut  in half. The number of homes has risen by 4 percent, but household  energy usage has decreased by 10 percent. We lost and then we reclaimed  the No. 1 spot in supercomputing. The cost of natural gas has been cut  in half, and the percent of electricity provided by natural gas has  increased from 27 percent to 35 percent. And that is all in the last 5  years.   I will not spend time in these remarks debunking the Green New Deal  because so many others have so effectively already done that.  Basically, the Green New Deal is an assault on cars, cows, and  combustion. With nuclear power available, its strategy for fighting  climate change with windmills makes as much sense as going to war in  sailboats. As a bonus, and as the Senator from Texas outlined, it  throws in free college, a guaranteed job with a government-set wage,  and it would take away private health insurance on the job from 170  million Americans, and no one has any earthly idea what it will cost  taxpayers.   You don't have to believe that humans cause climate change to believe  in the New Manhattan Project for Clean Energy, and you don't have to be  a Republican. Hopefully, the New Manhattan Project for Clean Energy can  become a bipartisan proposal. Many of its 10 grand challenges have been  proposed by the National Institute of Engineering and the National  Academy of Sciences. At different times, Barack Obama, John McCain,  Newt Gingrich, and Howard Dean have all called for a Manhattan Project  for new energy sources.   These are the 10 grand challenges:   First is advanced nuclear. Ninety-eight nuclear reactors produce 60  percent of all carbon-free electricity in the United States. There has  never been a death as a result of an accident at one of these reactors.  The problem is that in competition with natural gas and coal, these  reactors cost too much to build and some of them cost too much to  operate. According to the Energy Information Administration, 11  reactors may shut down over the next 5 years. Building the Vogtle  nuclear plant in Georgia--the only two new reactors being built in the  United States--could cost as much as $27.5 billion. Building two  natural gas plants to  [[Page S1923]]  create the same amount of electricity would cost less than $2 billion.  We need to stop talking about advanced reactors and actually build  something. Within the next 5 years, we need to build one or more  advanced reactors to demonstrate the capabilities they may bring--lower  costs, increased safety, and less nuclear waste.   Natural gas. During the 1980s, American enterprise and technology  created a new, cheaper way to produce natural gas in the United States.  This helped our country lead the world in reducing carbon emissions  because natural gas has about half the carbon emissions as a typical  coal plant. Continuing to develop new combustion technologies will make  natural gas-fired electric generation more efficient and further reduce  carbon emissions.   Next is carbon capture. This is really the holy grail of clean  energy. Coal is cheap. There is a lot of it. Already we know how to  capture sulfur, nitrogen, and mercury from coal plants to clean the  air. We have seen that happen in Tennessee. If we can figure out a way  also to capture carbon at a cheaper cost and find large-scale uses for  its byproduct--for example, CO2 to ethanol--coal could be  used everywhere in the world. The Natural Resources Defense Council has  argued that after conservation, coal with carbon capture is the best  option for clean energy.   Next is better batteries. The all-electric Nissan Leaf that I bought  in 2011 had a hard time getting me from the Capitol to Dulles airport  and back. Its range was about 70 miles. Today, the Nissan Leaf can  travel 226 miles on one charge. A Tesla Model S can travel 335 miles on  one charge. The price of lithium-ion batteries should fall another 45  percent during the next 5 years. Better batteries can also one day  allow utilities and their customers to store large amounts of  electricity during nonpeak hours.   Greener buildings. Despite considerable recent progress, this is  still the real low-hanging fruit. Residential and commercial buildings  still consume 39 percent of U.S. energy.   The next grand challenge is electric vehicles. Ten years ago there  were no mass-produced electric cars on United States highways. Today  there are 1 million, and you read in the paper almost every day about a  major automaker making a large investment to make millions more.   Cheaper solar. Solar power has grown by 1,500 percent since 2011, but  it still accounts for only about 2 percent of U.S. electricity. The new  goal for the Department of Energy's SunShot Initiative is to lower the  cost of solar another 50 percent to 3 cents per kilowatt hour for  utility scale solar.   Then there is fusion. This is the ultimate green energy dream--to  make electricity on Earth the way the Sun makes it. Instead of  splitting elements, combine them and make clean, almost limitless  energy without waste. This is still a dream, but there can be  meaningful progress in the next 5 years.   Advanced computing. China, Japan, the United States, and the European  Union--all want to be first in advanced computing. The stakes are high  because the winner has an advantage in such things as advanced  manufacturing, simulating advanced reactors and weapons before they are  built, finding terrorists, saving billions of Medicaid waste, and  simulating the electric grid in a natural disaster.   The United States regained the No. 1 spot last year in advanced  computing, thanks to sustained funding by Congress during both the  Obama and Trump administrations, and we need to keep that position.   The final grand challenge is to double energy research funding.  Advanced computing is the first tool the New Manhattan Project needs to  meet its grand challenges. The second tool is money. It would take $6  billion annually to double funding for the Department of Energy's  Office of Science and its 17 National Laboratories, which is where most  of our Nation's basic energy research is done. By comparison, many  estimate the cost of the Green New Deal in the trillions.   This is a bold agenda and, hopefully, a bipartisan agenda. It is an  agenda that can, over the next 5 years, place Americans firmly on the  path toward dealing with climate change and at the same time produce  large amounts of reliable, clean energy that lifts family incomes in  our country and around the world.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a 2012 op-ed in the New  York Times, entitled ``The Conversion of a Climate-Change Skeptic,''  authored by Richard Muller, a professor of physics at the University of  California, Berkeley, and, second, an address I made in Oak Ridge, TN,  in 2008, which called for a New Manhattan Project for Clean Energy  Independence, be printed in the Record following my remarks.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, July 28, 2012]                 The Conversion of a Climate-Change Skeptic                           (By Richard A. Muller)         Call me a converted skeptic. Three years ago I identified       problems in previous climate studies that, in my mind, threw       doubt on the very existence of global warming. Last year,       following an intensive research effort involving a dozen       scientists, I concluded that global warming was real and that       the prior estimates of the rate of warming were correct. I'm       now going a step further: Humans are almost entirely the       cause.        My total turnaround, in such a short time, is the result of       careful and objective analysis by the Berkeley Earth Surface       Temperature project, which I founded with my daughter       Elizabeth. Our results show that the average temperature of       the earth's land has risen by two and a half degrees       Fahrenheit over the past 250 years, including an increase of       one and a half degrees over the most recent 50 years.       Moreover, it appears likely that essentially all of this       increase results from the human emission of greenhouse gases.        These findings are stronger than those of the       Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations       group that defines the scientific and diplomatic consensus on       global warming. In its 2007 report, the I.P.C.C. concluded       only that most of the warming of the prior 50 years could be       attributed to humans. It was possible, according to the       I.P.C.C. consensus statement, that the warming before 1956       could be because of changes in solar activity, and that even       a substantial part of the more recent warming could be       natural.        Our Berkeley Earth approach used sophisticated statistical       methods developed largely by our lead scientist, Robert       Rohde, which allowed us to determine earth land temperature       much further back in time. We carefully studied issues raised       by skeptics: biases from urban heating (we duplicated our       results using rural data alone), from data selection (prior       groups selected fewer than 20 percent of the available       temperature stations; we used virtually 100 percent), from       poor station quality (we separately analyzed good stations       and poor ones) and from human intervention and data       adjustment (our work is completely automated and hands-off).       In our papers we demonstrate that none of these potentially       troublesome effects unduly biased our conclusions.        The historic temperature pattern we observed has abrupt       dips that match the emissions of known explosive volcanic       eruptions; the particulates from such events reflect       sunlight, make for beautiful sunsets and cool the earth's       surface for a few years. There are small, rapid variations       attributable to El Nino and other ocean currents such as the       Gulf Stream; because of such oscillations, the ``flattening''       of the recent temperature rise that some people claim is not,       in our view, statistically significant. What has caused the       gradual but systematic rise of two and a half degrees? We       tried fitting the shape to simple math functions       (exponentials, polynomials), to solar activity and even to       rising functions like world population. By far the best match       was to the record of atmospheric carbon dioxide, measured       from atmospheric samples and air trapped in polar ice.        Just as important, our record is long enough that we could       search for the fingerprint of solar variability, based on the       historical record of sunspots. That fingerprint is absent.       Although the I.P.C.C. allowed for the possibility that       variations in sunlight could have ended the ``Little Ice       Age,'' a period of cooling from the 14th century to about       1850, our data argues strongly that the temperature rise of       the past 250 years cannot be attributed to solar changes.       This conclusion is, in retrospect, not too surprising; we've       learned from satellite measurements that solar activity       changes the brightness of the sun very little.        How definite is the attribution to humans? The carbon       dioxide curve gives a better match than anything else we've       tried. Its magnitude is consistent with the calculated       greenhouse effect--extra warming from trapped heat radiation.       These facts don't prove causality and they shouldn't end       skepticism, but they raise the bar: to be considered       seriously, an alternative explanation must match the data at       least as well as carbon dioxide does. Adding methane, a       second greenhouse gas, to our analysis doesn't change the       results. Moreover, our analysis does not depend on large,       complex global climate models, the huge computer programs       that are notorious for their hidden assumptions and       adjustable parameters. Our result is based simply on the       close agreement between the shape of the observed temperature       rise and the known greenhouse gas increase.        It's a scientist's duty to be properly skeptical. I still       find that much, if not most, of what is attributed to climate       change is speculative, exaggerated or just plain wrong. I've  [[Page S1924]]       analyzed some of the most alarmist claims, and my skepticism       about them hasn't changed.        Hurricane Katrina cannot be attributed to global warming.       The number of hurricanes hitting the United States has been       going down, not up; likewise for intense tornadoes. Polar       bears aren't dying from receding ice, and the Himalayan       glaciers aren't going to melt by 2035. And it's possible that       we are currently no warmer than we were a thousand years ago,       during the ``Medieval Warm Period'' or ``Medieval Optimum,''       an interval of warm conditions known from historical records       and indirect evidence like tree rings. And the recent warm       spell in the United States happens to be more than offset by       cooling elsewhere in the world, so its link to ``global''       warming is weaker than tenuous.        The careful analysis by our team is laid out in five       scientific papers now online at BerkeleyEarth.org. That site       also shows our chart of temperature from 1753 to the present,       with its clear fingerprint of volcanoes and carbon dioxide,       but containing no component that matches solar activity. Four       of our papers have undergone extensive scrutiny by the       scientific community, and the newest, a paper with the       analysis of the human component, is now posted, along with       the data and computer programs used. Such transparency is the       heart of the scientific method; if you find our conclusions       implausible, tell us of any errors of data or analysis.        What about the future? As carbon dioxide emissions       increase, the temperature should continue to rise. I expect       the rate of warming to proceed at a steady pace, about one       and a half degrees over land in the next 50 years, less if       the oceans are included. But if China continues its rapid       economic growth (it has averaged 10 percent per year over the       last 20 years) and its vast use of coal (it typically adds       one new gigawatt per month), then that same warming could       take place in less than 20 years.        Science is that narrow realm of knowledge that, in       principle, is universally accepted. I embarked on this       analysis to answer questions that, to my mind, had not been       answered. I hope that the Berkeley Earth analysis will help       settle the scientific debate regarding global warming and its       human causes. Then comes the difficult part: agreeing across       the political and diplomatic spectrum about what can and       should be done.                                   ____            A New Manhattan Project for Clean Energy Independence    Seven ``grand challenges'' for the next five years: Plug-in electric   cars and trucks, carbon capture, solar power, nuclear waste, advanced                     biofuels, green buildings, fusion                               May 9th, 2008       History        In 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked Sen. Kenneth       McKellar, the Tennessean who chaired the Appropriations       Committee, to hide $2 billion in the appropriations bill for       a secret project to win World War II.        Sen. McKellar replied, ``Mr. President, I have just one       question: where in Tennessee do you want me to hide it?''        That place in Tennessee turned out to be Oak Ridge, one of       three secret cities that became the principal sites for the       Manhattan Project.        The purpose of the Manhattan Project was to find a way to       split the atom and build a bomb before Germany could. Nearly       200,000 people worked secretly in 30 different sites in three       countries. President Roosevelt's $2 billion appropriation       would be $24 billion today.        According to New York Times science reporter William       Laurence, ``Into [the bomb's] design went millions of man-      hours of what is without doubt the most concentrated       intellectual effort in history.''      The goal: victory over blackmail        I am in Oak Ridge today to propose that the United States       launch a new Manhattan project: a 5-year project to put       America firmly on the path to clean energy independence.        Instead of ending a war, the goal will be clean energy       independence--so that we can deal with rising gasoline       prices, electricity prices, clean air, climate change and       national security--for our country first, and--because other       countries have the same urgent needs and therefore will adopt       our ideas--for the rest of the world.        By independence I do not mean that the United States would       never buy oil from Mexico or Canada or Saudi Arabia. By       independence I do mean that the United States could never be       held hostage by any country for our energy needs.        In 1942, many were afraid that the first country to build       an atomic bomb could blackmail the rest of the world. Today,       countries that supply oil and natural gas can blackmail the       rest of the world.      Not a new idea        A new Manhattan Project is not a new idea--but it is a good       idea and fits the goal of clean energy independence.        The Apollo Program to send men to the moon in the 1960s was       a kind of Manhattan Project. Presidential candidates John       McCain and Barack Obama have called for a Manhattan Project       for new energy sources. So have former House Speaker Newt       Gingrich, Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean,       Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Kit Bond of Missouri--      among others.        And, throughout the two years of discussion that led to the       passage in 2007 of the America COMPETES Act, several       participants suggested that focusing on energy independence       would force the kind of investments in the physical sciences       and research that the United States needs to maintain its       competitiveness.      A new overwhelming challenge        The overwhelming challenge in 1942 was the prospect that       Germany would build the bomb and win the war before America       did.        The overwhelming challenge today, according to National       Academy of Sciences president Ralph Cicerone, in his address       last week to the Academy's annual meeting, is to discover       ways to satisfy the human demand for and use of energy in an       environmentally satisfactory and affordable way so that we       are not overly dependent on overseas sources.        Cicerone estimates that this year Americans will pay $500       billion overseas for oil--that's $1,600 for each one of us--      some of it to nations that are hostile or even trying to kill       us by bankrolling terrorists. Sending $500 billion abroad       weakens our dollar. It is half our trade deficit. It is       forcing gasoline prices toward $4 a gallon and crushing       family budgets.        Then there are the environmental consequences. If worldwide       energy usage continues to grow as it has, humans will inject       as much CO2 into the air from fossil fuel burning between       2000 and 2030 as they did between 1850 and 2000. There is       plenty of coal to help achieve our energy independence, but       there is no commercial way (yet) to capture and store the       carbon from so much coal burning--and we have not finished       the job of controlling sulfur, nitrogen, and mercury       emissions.      The Manhattan Project model fits today        In addition to the need to meet an overwhelming challenge,       other characteristics of the original Manhattan Project are       suited to this new challenge:        It needs to proceed as fast as possible along several       tracks to reach the goal. According to Don Gillespie, a young       engineer at Los Alamos during World War II, the ``entire       project was being conducted using a shotgun approach, trying       all possible approaches simultaneously, without regard to       cost, to speed toward a conclusion.''        It needs presidential focus and bipartisan support in       Congress.        It needs the kind of centralized, gruff leadership that       Gen. Leslie R. Groves of the Army Corps of Engineers gave the       first Manhattan Project.        It needs to ``break the mold.'' To borrow the words of Dr.       J. Robert Oppenheimer in a speech to Los Alamos scientists in       November of 1945, the challenge of clean energy independence       is ``too revolutionary to consider in the framework of old       ideas.''        Most important, in the words of George Cowan as reported in       the excellent book edited by Cynthia C. Kelly, ``. . . The       Manhattan Project model starts with a small, diverse group of       great minds.''        I said to the National Academies when we first asked for       their help on the America COMPETES Act in 2005, ``In       Washington, D.C., most ideas fail for lack of the idea.''      The America COMPETES model fits, too        There are some lessons, too, from America COMPETES.        Remember how it happened. Just three years ago--in May       2005--a bipartisan group of us asked the National Academies       to tell Congress in priority order the 10 most important       steps we could take to help America keep its brainpower       advantage.        By October, the Academies had assembled a ``small diverse       group of great minds'' chaired by Norm Augustine which       presented to Congress and to the President 20 specific       recommendations in a report called ``Rising Above the       Gathering Storm.'' We considered proposals by other       competitiveness commissions.        Then, in January 2006, President Bush outlined his American       Competitiveness Initiative to double over 10 years basic       research budgets for the physical sciences and engineering.       The Republican and Democratic Senate leaders and 68 other       senators sponsored the legislation. It became law by August       2007, with strong support from Speaker Pelosi and the       President.      Not elected to take a vacation this year        Combining the model of the Manhattan Project with the       process of the America COMPETES Act has already begun. The       National Academies have underway an ``America's Energy       Future'' project that will be completed in 2010. Ralph       Cicerone has welcomed sitting down with a bipartisan group to       discuss what concrete proposals we might offer earlier than       that to the new president and the new Congress. Energy       Secretary Sam Bodman and Ray Orbach, the Energy Department's       Under Secretary for Science, have said the same.        The presidential candidates seem ready. There is bipartisan       interest in Congress. Congressman Bart Gordon, Democratic       Chairman of the Science Committee in the House of       Representatives--and one of the original four signers of the       2005 request to the National Academies that led to the       America COMPETES Act--is here today to offer his ideas.       Congressman Zach Wamp, a senior member of the House       Appropriations Committee who played a key role in the America       COMPETES Act, is co-host for this meeting.        I have talked with Sens. Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici,       the chairman and senior Republican on the Energy Committee       who  [[Page S1925]]       played such a critical role in America COMPETES, and to Sen.       Lisa Murkowski, who likely will succeed Sen. Domenici as the       senior Republican on the Energy Committee.        Some say a presidential election year is no time for       bipartisan action. I can't think of a better time. Voters       expect presidential candidates and candidates for Congress to       come up with solutions for $4 gasoline, clean air and climate       change, and the national security implications of our       dependence on foreign oil. The people didn't elect us to take       a vacation this year just because there is a presidential       election.      So, how to proceed?        A few grand challenges--Sen. Bingaman's first reaction to       the idea of a new Manhattan Project was that instead we need       several mini-Manhattan Projects. He suggested as an example       the ``14 Grand Challenges for Engineering in the 21st       Century'' laid out by former MIT President Chuck Vest, the       president of the National Institute of Engineering--three of       which involve energy. I agree with Sen. Bingaman and Chuck       Vest.        Congress doesn't do ``comprehensive'' well, as was       demonstrated by the collapse of the comprehensive immigration       bill. Step-by-step solutions or different tracks toward one       goal are easier to digest and have fewer surprises. And, of       course, the original Manhattan Project itself proceeded along       several tracks toward one goal.      Here are my criteria for choosing several grand challenges:        Grand consequences, too--The United States uses 25 percent       of all the energy in the world. Interesting solutions for       small problems producing small results should be a part of       some other project.        Real scientific breakthroughs--This is not about drilling       offshore for oil or natural gas in an environmentally clean       way or building a new generation of nuclear power plants,       both of which we already know how to do--and, in my opinion,       should be doing.        Five years--Grand challenges should put the United States       within five years firmly on a path to clean energy       independence so that goal can be achieved within a       generation.        Family Budget--Solutions need to fit the family budget, and       costs of different solutions need to be compared.        Consensus--The Augustine panel that drafted the ``Gathering       Storm'' report wisely avoided some germane topics, such as       excessive litigation, upon which they could not agree,       figuring that Congress might not be able to agree either.      Seven grand challenges:        Here is where I invite your help. Rather than having       members of Congress proclaim these challenges, or asking       scientists alone to suggest them, I believe there needs to be       preliminary discussion--including about whether the criteria       are correct. Then, Congress can pose to scientists questions       about the steps to take to achieve the grand challenges.        To begin the discussion, I suggest asking what steps       Congress and the federal government should take during the       next five years toward these seven grand challenges so that       the United States would be firmly on the path toward clean       energy independence within a generation:        1. Make plug-in electric cars and trucks commonplace. In       the 1960s, H. Ross Perot noticed that when banks in Texas       locked their doors at 5 p.m., they also turned off their new       computers. Perot bought the idle nighttime bank computer       capacity and made a deal with states to manage Medicare and       Medicaid data. Banks made money, states saved money, and       Perot made a billion dollars.        Idle nighttime bank computer capacity in the 1960s reminds       me of idle nighttime power plant capacity in 2008. This is       why:        The Tennessee Valley Authority has 7,000-8,000 megawatts--      the equivalent of seven or eight nuclear power plants or 15       coal plants--of unused electric capacity most nights.        Beginning in 2010 Nissan, Toyota, General Motors and Ford       will sell electric cars that can be plugged into wall       sockets. FedEx is already using hybrid delivery trucks.        TVA could offer ``smart meters'' that would allow its 8.7       million customers to plug in their vehicles to ``fill up'' at       night for only a few dollars, in exchange for the customer       paying more for electricity between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. when       the grid is busy.        Sixty percent of Americans drive less than 30 miles each       day. Those Americans could drive a plug-in electric car or       truck without using a drop of gasoline. By some estimates,       there is so much idle electric capacity in power plants at       night that over time we could replace three-fourths of our       light vehicles with plug-ins. That could reduce our overseas       oil bill from $500 billion to $250 billion--and do it all       without building one new power plant.        In other words, we have the plug. The cars are coming. All       we need is the cord.        Too good to be true? Haven't U.S. presidents back to Nixon       promised revolutionary vehicles? Yes, but times have changed.       Batteries are better. Gas is $4. We are angry about sending       so many dollars overseas, worried about climate change and       clean air. And, consumers have already bought one million       hybrid vehicles and are waiting in line to buy more--even       without the plug-in. Down the road is the prospect of a       hydrogen fuel-cell hybrid vehicle, with two engines--neither       of which uses a drop of gasoline. Oak Ridge is evaluating       these opportunities.        Still, there are obstacles. Expensive batteries make the       additional cost per electric car $8,000-$11,000. Smart       metering is not widespread. There will be increased pollution       from the operation of coal plants at night. We know how to       get rid of those sulfur, nitrogen, and mercury pollutants       (and should do it), but haven't yet found a way to get rid of       the carbon produced by widespread use in coal burning power       plants. Which brings us to the second grand challenge:        2. Make carbon capture and storage a reality for coal-      burning power plants. This was one of the National Institute       of Engineering's grand challenges. And there may be solutions       other than underground storage, such as using algae to       capture carbon. Interestingly, the Natural Resources Defense       Council argues that, after conservation, coal with carbon       capture is the best option for clean energy independence       because it provides for the growing power needs of the U.S.       and will be easily adopted by other countries.        3. Make solar power cost competitive with power from fossil       fuels. This is a second of the National Institute's grand       challenges. Solar power, despite 50 years of trying, produces       one one-hundredth of one percent of America's electricity.       The cost of putting solar panels on homes averages $25,000-      $30,000 and the electricity produced, for the most part,       can't be stored. Now, there is new photovoltaic research as       well as promising solar thermal power plants, which capture       the sunlight using mirrors, turn heat into steam, and store       it underground until the customer needs it.        4. Safely reprocess and store nuclear waste. Nuclear plants       produce 20 percent of America's electricity, but 70 percent       of America's clean electricity--that is, electricity that       does not pollute the air with mercury, nitrogen, sulfur, or       carbon. The most important breakthrough needed during the       next five years to build more nuclear power plants is solving       the problem of what to do with nuclear waste. A political       stalemate has stopped nuclear waste from going to Yucca       Mountain in Nevada, and $15 billion collected from ratepayers       for that purpose is sitting in a bank. Recycling waste could       reduce its mass by 90 percent, creating less stuff to store       temporarily while long-term storage is resolved.        5. Make advanced biofuels cost-competitive with gasoline.       The backlash toward ethanol made from corn because of its       effect on food prices is a reminder to beware of the great       law of unintended consequences when issuing grand challenges.       Ethanol from cellulosic materials shows great promise, but       there are a limited number of cars capable of using       alternative fuels and of places for drivers to buy it.       Turning coal into liquid fuel is an established technology,       but expensive and a producer of much carbon.        6. Make new buildings green buildings. Japan believes it       may miss its 2012 Kyoto goals for greenhouse gas reductions       primarily because of energy wasted by inefficient buildings.       Many of the technologies needed to do this are known.       Figuring out how to accelerate their use in a decentralized       society is most of this grand challenge.        7. Provide energy from fusion. The idea of recreating on       Earth the way the sun creates energy and using it for       commercial power is the third grand challenge suggested by       the National Institute of Engineering. The promise of       sustaining a controlled fusion reaction for commercial power       generation is so fantastic that the five-year goal should be       to do everything possible to reach the long-term goal. The       failure of Congress to approve the President's budget request       for U.S. participation in the International Thermonuclear       Experimental Reactor--the ITER Project--is embarrassing.      Anything is possible        This country of ours is a remarkable place.        Even during an economic slowdown, we will produce this year       about 30 percent of all the wealth in the world for the 5       percent of us who live in the United States.        Despite ``the gathering storm'' of concern about American       competitiveness, no other country approaches our brainpower       advantage--the collection of research universities, national       laboratories and private-sector companies we have.        And this is still the only country where people say with a       straight face that anything is possible--and really believe       it.        These are precisely the ingredients that America needs       during the next five years to place ourselves firmly on a       path to clean energy independence within a generation--and in       doing so, to make our jobs more secure, to help balance the       family budget, to make our air cleaner and our planet safer       and healthier--and to lead the world to do the same.     I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, along with my colleague, the ranking  member on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Senator  Murray, I wish to pay tribute to Denise Lowery. Ms. Lowery is a  nondesignated employee on the HELP Committee staff and is retiring at  the end of this month after almost 16 years of distinguished service to  the HELP Committee.   Ms. Lowery has served as editor for the committee since 2003,  compiling and sending to print all our committee reports and materials  for the Congressional Record.   Ms. Lowery is well regarded by all Members and staff of the  committee, having proven her professionalism, courtesy, and substantial  expertise over almost 16 years. Without the support of Ms. Lowery and  the rest of the nondesignated staff, the committee could not accomplish  the important work the American people expect us to get done on their  behalf. I, the ranking member, and the rest of the committee's members  want to recognize Ms. Lowery for that tremendous contribution to the  Committee as she exits her time in the Senate.   I wish Ms. Lowery the best and hope retirement from the Senate will  allow her time for hobbies such as working on home improvement projects  and spending time with her friends and family.   I would like to yield now to my colleague, the ranking member,  Senator Murray, for her remarks.
