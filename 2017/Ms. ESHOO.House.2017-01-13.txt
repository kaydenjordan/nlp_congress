 Mr. Chair, I rise today to express my grave concerns with  the Republican budget proposal for 2017. The budget before us today is  a disaster for the American people. Not only does it add $9 trillion to  the national debt and put our nation on the path to fiscal ruin, it  begins the process of dismantling the Affordable Care  [[Page H510]]  Act, taking health insurance away from 30 million Americans.   Our national budget is not just pages of numbers. It is a statement  of our nation's values. By that measure, this budget is morally  bankrupt.   The Affordable Care Act became law in March 2010, yet despite their  condemnations of the law, Republicans have failed to present any  comprehensive alternative in the nearly seven years since it was signed  into law. Not one single proposal. The Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy  said it best at the Washington Post's Daily 202 interview on November  29th last year when he suggested our healthcare system should look more  like the cable industry because of all the choices consumers have in  that market. He said, ``I always use the analogy, would I want to pick  a cable company to watch what I want to watch on TV? I love the options  that I have, I love the ability to switch, I love the different  packages that I can pick if I like a certain sports team, or I want to  watch HBO or something else. Why can't we have health care in a manner  that we can do something to that extent?''   If Republicans think the American people want the cable industry to  serve as a model for the health insurance market, our Republican  colleagues are even more out of touch than I ever imagined.   After spending years and 65 votes to repeal the ACA, and warning  Americans about the dire threats of budget deficits and the national  debt, Republicans have suddenly done an about face. They no longer care  about the fiscal impact of this budget which adds $9 trillion to the  national debt over 10 years. Nor do they care about the fiscal impact  of repealing the Affordable Care Act which is estimated to cost $350  billion over 10 years according to the Congressional Budget Office.   The House majority has also set its sights on dismantling our  nation's premier social insurance program by including in the House  Rules package the unprecedented requirement that each standing  committee identify programs that can be moved from mandatory to  discretionary spending. This is a chilling and thinly veiled move to  begin dismantling the guarantee of Social Security, Medicare, and  Medicaid, and tie the future of these essential programs to the  uncertainty of the annual appropriations process.   I urge my colleagues to think long and hard about the far-reaching  consequences of this budget on the well-being of the American people  and the fiscal health of our nation and vote `No' on final passage.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        January 13, 2017, on pages H509/H510, the following copy was  typeset in Ionic font:  Mr. Chair, I rise today  toexpress my grave concerns with the Republican budget proposal  for 2017.
