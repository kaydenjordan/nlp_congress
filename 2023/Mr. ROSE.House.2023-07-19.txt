 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment, which  requires a GAO report on the recent mass flight cancellations and  delays that crippled our Nation surrounding the Fourth of July holiday.   Mr. Chair, listen to these headlines:   From Newsweek: ``July 4th Travel Chaos as Thousands of Airline  Passengers Face Cancellations.''   From the Associated Press: ``Travelers endure another day of airport  agony.''   From the Insider news site: ``Get ready for a flightmare: What to  expect if you are one of the 4 million Americans flying this  Independence Day weekend.''   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record each of these articles.                     [From Newsweek.com, June 29, 2023]       July 4th Travel Chaos as Thousands of Airline Passengers Face                               Cancellations                            (By Khaleda Rahman)         Hundreds of flights in the U.S. have been canceled       Thursday, a worrying indication of the chaos summer travelers       could endure as they prepare to fly during the busy July 4       weekend.        Airline passengers suffered through yet another day of       delayed and canceled flights on Wednesday, with the East       Coast continuing to be the hardest hit as storms pummel the       region.        Around 1,200 U.S. flights were canceled on Wednesday, while       nearly 7,000 were delayed, according to flight-tracking       website FlightAware.        By early Thursday, 344 flights within, into and out of the       U.S. had been canceled and at least 500 more were delayed. Of       the cancelled flights, 78 had been scheduled to fly in or out  [[Page H3813]]       of New Jersey's Newark Liberty Airport, 74 were at Denver       airport, and 62 at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental       Airport.        The Federal Aviation Administration expects Thursday to be       the busiest travel day of the long weekend, with more than       52,500 total flights.        United Airlines, which uses Newark airport as its New York       area hub, canceled 263 flights on Thursday, the most among       U.S. airlines for a sixth straight day.        ``We're beginning to see improvement across our operation.       We expect to cancel far fewer seats today compared to       yesterday and our baggage backlog at Newark has dropped more       than 30 percent since Tuesday, and off-duty flight attendants       are calling in from across the country to staff open trips,''       United said in a statement to Newsweek on Wednesday night.        ``It's all-hands-on-deck as our pilots get aircraft moving,       contact center teams work overtime to take care of our       customers, and our airport customer service staff works       tirelessly to deliver bags and board flights. As our       operation improves in the days ahead, we will be on track to       restore our operation for the holiday weekend.''        Many passengers who were left stranded have taken to social       media to express their anger, with some saying they were       forced to sleep in airport terminals.        ``My wife & 2 toddlers are sleeping in an airport terminal       tonight because @united bumped the flight three times, put on       standby for a midnight flight, then bumped again until       tomorrow morning,'' a Twitter user named John wrote.        ``On hold w a rep since 3 pm today. Nobody at counters.       They don't care.''        Some, including Margo Osborne, said they would never fly       with certain airlines again.        ``Will never fly @united again!'' Osborne tweeted. ``1000s       stranded at Newark, after countless flights canceled. No one       allowed to retrieve checked bag, even if u have medical equip       packed inside. Customer service was worst I've seen.''        United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has blamed a shortage of       federal air traffic controllers for massive disruptions at       its Newark hub last weekend.        Over 150,000 customers in the New York City area were       impacted because of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)       ``staffing issues and their ability to manage traffic,''       Kirby wrote in a memo to employees on Monday night, according       to Fox Business. ``The FAA frankly failed us this weekend.''        ``We will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing       to join us to solve a problem,'' an FAA spokesperson told       Newsweek.        The spokesperson said the FAA is ``working closely with       airlines to keep aircraft moving safely and efficiently over       the Fourth of July travel period.''        They also pointed to weekly updates on the FAA's website       with preliminary data on the causes of delays.        ``Current delay data shows the vast majority are due to       weather and volume,'' the spokesperson said.        Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whose department       includes the FAA, took to social media on Wednesday to       reassure travelers that the FAA is working to ``find       solutions.''        ``We are closely watching air travel this week. Weather has       been rough, especially in the last four or five days, it's       caused a lot of cancellations and delays for many passengers       around the country,'' he said in a video posted on Twitter.        ``We've known that summer is going to be a stress test on       the system. The good news is we've seen a lot of progress       this year through Memorial Day and also a major improvement       to passenger rights compared to a year ago . . . FAA is       continuing to work around the clock with airlines and within       FAA's own operations to find solutions, get creative, make       sure the system is as resilient as possible.''        Last week, Buttigieg issued a new warning to airlines,       telling them that flights could be disrupted because some       planes lack updated equipment to prevent interference from       new 5G wireless service. He said only planes retrofitted with       the right equipment will be allowed to land when visibility       is poor, such as during bad weather.                                   ____                       [From apnews.com, June 27, 2023]   Travelers Endure Another Day of Airport Agony. One Airline Has by Far                           the Most Cancellations                             (By David Koenig)         Dallas (AP).--Air travelers endured another wave of flight       disruptions Thursday despite better weather along much of the       East Coast, while United Airlines continued to account for       the majority of canceled flights nationwide.        United vowed to get back on track over the July 4 holiday       weekend, when the number of air travelers could set a       pandemic-era record.        Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans       thrown in the air after a wave of storms raked the Northeast       over the past few days and frustrations are running high.        Airports in Chicago, Denver and Newark, New Jersey--all       hubs for United--were seeing the most delays on Thursday,       according to FlightAware.        By early evening on the East Coast, United had canceled       more than 400 flights, the bulk of the 600-plus cancellations       toted up by FlightAware. The Chicago carrier was poised to       lead all U.S. airlines in cancellations for a sixth straight       day.        United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airline's struggles       in Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New       York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg       pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key       Federal Aviation Administration facility in New York is       severely understaffed.        ``United Airlines has some internal issues they need to       work through. They have really been struggling this week,       even relative to other U.S. airlines,'' Buttigieg told CNN.       ``But where we do agree is that there need to be more       resources for air traffic control.''        The FAA plans to hire 3,300 controllers over two years, but       they won't be ready to help this summer, much less this       weekend.        The leader of United's union pilots--who are locked in       difficult contract negotiations--blamed management for the       disruptions, saying the company failed to upgrade a       crewscheduling system.        ``While Scott Kirby attempts to deflect blame on the FAA,       weather and everything in between, further flight delays are       a direct result of poor planning by United Airlines       executives,'' Garth Thompson said.        United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are       scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra       flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight       Attendants also said crews calling in for assignments have       been put on hold for three hours or longer.        ``The airline actually `lost' crews in the system for days       on end because there was such a significant breakdown in       running the operation,'' said Ken Diaz, president of the       flight attendants' group at United. He said the company       scheduled summer flights ``to the max'' even knowing about       air traffic control limits in the Northeast.        United said it was getting a handle on its problems.        ``We're seeing continued meaningful improvement today after       an overnight effort to further repair schedules and match       separated crews with aircraft,'' the airline said in a midday       statement. ``As the recovery progresses, delays and       cancellations will continue to decline as we head into what       we expect to be a very busy holiday weekend.''        Because planes are packed for the summer, it is hard for       airlines to rebook customers when flights are canceled--there       aren't many empty seats.        Ariana Duran of Orlando, Florida, said JetBlue rebooked her       for seven days later when her flight home from Newark was       canceled this week. So she got creative.        Her boyfriend spotted a $1,200 seat on another airline, but       it was gone before they could buy it. She looked into Amtrak.       Duran, who does marketing for an insurance company, wound up       paying about $640 for a one-way ticket to Orlando--with a       stop in the Florida Keys--on United Express and Silver       Airways.        Duran didn't care when they told her it would be a very       small plane. ``Just put me on a boat at this point,'' she       said.        Sonia Hendrix, who runs a public-relations firm in New       York, took four days to get home from a business trip to       Colorado. She was stranded one night in Atlanta and two in       Orlando, when connecting flights were canceled. She woke up       some mornings not knowing where she was.        Hendrix said a Delta agent threatened to cancel her       reservation when she complained about being offered only a       $50 voucher for her trip troubles. On the other hand, her       pilot, ``Captain Dan,'' waited in the airport and helped       passengers after the flight was canceled.        ``This is not all Delta's fault. Their pilots and flight       crews were working very hard,'' she said. ``I blame the FAA.       I blame Buttigieg for sitting on his hands'' and not staffing       up air traffic control centers sooner.        Hendrix said she lost working time and spent $700 out of       pocket. She is so worried it could happen again that she is       reconsidering a business trip next month to Los Angeles.        The FAA said Thursday would be the busiest day of the       holiday stretch by number of flights. The Transportation       Security Administration said it expected to screen the most       travelers on Friday--a predicted 2.82 million people.        Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive later       Thursday in the Northeast, and storms were also forecast       farther south along the East Coast through Saturday. The West       is under threat of unstable weather for the next several       days.        Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could       add to travelers' difficulties. Federal officials say some       airline planes may be unable to fly in bad weather starting       Saturday because of possible interference from new 5G       wireless service.        American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all       their planes have been retrofitted with new radio       altimeters--those are devices that measure the plane's height       above the ground--and they do not expect disruptions due to       5G service.        However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet       of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can't       get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will       schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility       while it works to upgrade them through the summer.        The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that       Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all       its Airbus A220s and most of its Airbus A319 and A320 jets.        Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also       be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights       operated to the United States by foreign carriers.  [[Page H3814]]         By early evening in the East, about 5,300 flights had been       delayed, down from an average of 8,000 a day over the first       three days of the week.                                   ____                              [From insider.com]     Get Ready for a `Flightmare' if You're Flying This July 4 Holiday                      (By Hannah Towey and Pete Syme)         Imagine the entire population of Los Angeles heading to an       airport--and then throw in Cincinnati, just for fun.        That's how many Americans are expected to fly over this       Independence Day weekend, which travel organization AAA       predicts will break records for car and air travel.        And the Transportation Security Administration says 17.7       million people will travel across the country from Thursday       through July 5.        It expects Friday to be the busiest day, projecting 2.82       million people will pass through TSA checkpoints--which would       beat its all-time single-day record of 2.8 million on June       16.        It's a huge test for the country's strained aviation       system, and the results aren't inspiring much confidence so       far.        Hundreds of thousands of people have had travel plans       thrown into chaos after a wave of storms raked the Northeast       in the last week of June and frustrations are running high,       with some stranded passengers resorting to sleeping on tables       and luggage carts.        One United passenger told Insider they were stuck in Newark       Liberty International Airport for two-and-a-half days waiting       for their flight to South Africa, ultimately causing them to       cancel their trip. Another United passenger said she had to       drive hundreds of miles and take another flight to meet up       with her bags--and she still couldn't get a hold of her       luggage.        On Thursday--which the Federal Aviation Administration       predicted to be the busiest day--7,845 flights within, into,       or out of the US were delayed or canceled, according to       flight tracker FlightAware.        Scattered showers and thunderstorms may arrive in the       Northeast, and storms were also forecast farther south along       the East Coast through Saturday. The West is also under       threat of unstable weather for the next several days.        ``Storms are hitting the East Coast at the worst time:       right as the July 4th travel weekend begins to takeoff,''       Scott Keyes, the founder and chief flight expert of       Going.com, told Travel + Leisure magazine.        ``Expect long lines, few empty seats, and lengthy hold       times to get ahold of customer service phone agents,'' he       added.        Chris Citrola, an FAA spokesman, said storms on the East       Coast had ``positioned themselves in the perfect spot.''        ``What happens is a domino effect of issues,'' he added.       ``We have crews that can't get to where they need to, we       can't get crews out of where they need to go to, and that       starts turning into a lot of issues at the airport itself.''        Along with big crowds and storms, a technology issue could       add to travelers' difficulties.        Federal officials say some airline planes may be unable to       fly in bad weather starting Saturday because of possible       interference from new 5G wireless service.        There's concern that boosted 5G signals could interfere       with radar altimeters--sensors which measures how high an       aircraft is above the ground, and are essential for flying in       low-visibility conditions.        Buttigieg warned of ``a real risk of delays or       cancellations,'' because hundreds of planes have yet to be       retrofitted with updated sensors.        American, United, Southwest, Alaska and Frontier say all       their planes have been updated, and they do not expect       disruptions due to 5G service.        However, Delta Air Lines has about 190 planes in its fleet       of more than 900 that have not been updated because it can't       get enough altimeters from its supplier. Delta says it will       schedule those planes to avoid landing in poor visibility       while it works to upgrade them through the summer.        The issue affects several types of single-aisle planes that       Delta uses on routes within the United States, including all       its Airbus A220s and most of its A319 and A320 jets.        And JetBlue said it expects its 17 A220 planes won't be       upgraded until October, The Wall Street Journal reported.        Smaller airlines that operate regional flights could also       be affected by the radio interference issue, as could flights       operated to the United States by foreign carriers.        Buttigieg said that around 20 percent of domestic planes       and 35% of international ones which fly to the US aren't yet       fitted with the updated equipment, per the Journal.        Backups are easing thanks to a break in the weather, but       United Airlines continues to bear the brunt of the       disruptions. The airline accounted for approximately 69% of       canceled flights in the US on Thursday, per FlightAware. The       Chicago-based carrier is poised to lead all airlines in       cancellations for a sixth straight day.        Airports in Chicago, Denver, and Newark, New Jersey--all       hubs for United--were seeing the most delays on Thursday,       according to FlightAware.        United CEO Scott Kirby blamed the airline's struggles in       Newark on a shortage of air traffic controllers in the New       York City area. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg       pushed back against the criticism while conceding that a key       FM facility in New York is severely understaffed.        ``United Airlines has some internal issues they need to       work through. They have really been struggling this week,       even relative to other U.S. airlines,'' Buttigieg told CNN.       ``But where we do agree is that there need to be more       resources for air traffic control.''

United is offering triple pay to flight attendants who are       scheduled off this weekend but agree to pick up extra       flights, according to their union. The Association of Flight       Attendants also says crews calling in for assignments have       been put on hold for three hours or longer.        A spokesperson for United Airlines told Insider that the       carrier has seen ``meaningful improvement today after an       overnight effort to further repair schedules and match       separated crews with aircraft.''        ``As the recovery progresses, delays and cancellations will       continue to decline as we head into what we expect to be a       very busy holiday weekend,'' the spokesperson added. ``We're       closely watching the weather, especially in Denver and       Chicago today, and are hopeful our customers will still see       fewer last-minute cancellations--which will reduce lines at       the airport.''    Mr. Chair, with thousands of Fourth of July vacations lying  in ruins, it is vitally important for accountability as to what went so  catastrophically wrong with our Nation's aviation transportation  system.   That is why I was proud to author my amendment to require the GAO to  report to Congress on the actions of the Secretary of Transportation  and the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration related to  this travel nightmare.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.    Madam Speaker, the Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in  American Aviation Act will impact anyone boarding a plane in the United  States.   The bill improves runway safety, enhances cybersecurity, and upgrades  the all-important air traffic control system. It also works to address  staffing  [[Page H3855]]  shortages facing the airlines, the FAA, and the NTSB.   House Republicans have crafted an FAA authorization bill of  substance, one that makes critical improvements in aviation and  promotes oversight over the agencies regulating the industry, and we  will see even more oversight if my amendment is passed. It requires the  Government Accountability Office to issue a report explaining what  caused the thousands of flight cancellations around the July Fourth  holiday.   Madam Speaker, you won't find many existing diversity and inclusion  programs in this legislation, but you will find policies that make the  skies safer for all passengers no matter their race or their  background.                            ____________________
