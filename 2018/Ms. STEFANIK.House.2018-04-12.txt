 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  urgent crisis facing dairy farmers across my district.   The low price of milk, labor shortages, and dwindling access to new  markets are just some of the many challenges faced by the hardworking  family farms in my district. Additionally, the Margin Protection  Program has failed North Country dairy farmers by providing little to  no return on our farmers' buy-in.   Recently, I was pleased to support the Bipartisan Budget Act, which  contained many urgent reforms to this program, such as raising  catastrophic coverage for the first tier of covered production for all  farmers, reducing premium rates to help farmers buy coverage, and  waiving costly administrative fees for underserved farms.   Agriculture is truly the backbone of our North Country economy, and  generations of farmers have helped make dairy production a way of life  for many families that I represent.   In Congress, I will keep fighting every day to strengthen our family  farms for future generations.                            ____________________
