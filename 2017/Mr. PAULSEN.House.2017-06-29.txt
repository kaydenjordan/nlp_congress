 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Eden Prairie  Boys Baseball team on becoming high school State champs recently. They  secured a 5-1 win over Forest Lake.   After a challenging first four innings, the Eagles, led by senior  pitcher Jack Zigan, came back to win their very first State  Championship since 2010. Jack threw a complete game, surrendering only  three hits and one unearned run, with an impressive 11 strikeouts.   This marked the end of a fantastic season for the Eagles, who  finished the year 18-9 after entering the State tournament without a  seed. They were never expected to get this far. They  [[Page H5359]]  were never expected to win, but they defeated the number 1, the number  2, and the number 4 seed teams by a combined score of 25-2.   So, Mr. Speaker, once again, I would just like to congratulate this  hardworking team of student athletes, their coaches, and their parents  for their State Championship win. This really does go to show that  perseverance and hard work pay off.                            ____________________
