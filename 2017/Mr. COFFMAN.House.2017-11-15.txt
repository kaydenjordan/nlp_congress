 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4374,  having served in the first Gulf war when military analysts were saying  or predicting that there could be 30,000 coalition casualties in a  ground war with Iraq.   We knew that Saddam Hussein had both chemical and biological  stockpiles, and, at that time, there was an experimental drug given for  the pretreatment to increase the survival after the exposure to nerve  gas. It was untested in terms of the FDA, did not go through their  lengthy bureaucratic process, but it was, I think, correctly assumed by  military leaders that the risk of giving this drug that didn't go  through all the bureaucratic processes that I think are important, that  the risk of nerve gas exposure outweighed those risks.   So I just want to commend the Energy and Commerce Committee as well  as the leadership of the Armed Services Committee, the leadership of  both committees, for working together with the Department of Defense  and the FDA to find that middle ground where the military can have  access to drugs and medical devices expeditiously in order to meet the  rapidly changing threats on the battlefield.   I again thank Chairman Thornberry for his unyielding support on this  issue. I also thank Chairman Walden for offering legislation that seeks  to put this process on the right path.
