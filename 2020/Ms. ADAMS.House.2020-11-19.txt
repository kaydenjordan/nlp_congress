 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Scott), our distinguished Education and Labor Committee chair, as well  as the Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Investment chair,  Mrs. Davis, for this bill and for all of their support.   I rise today in strong support of the National Apprenticeship  Reauthorization Act. By creating 1 million new apprenticeship  opportunities and yielding over $10 billion in net benefits, this  legislation is a lifeline for our economy and for countless Americans,  including those in my home State of North Carolina.    With a proven track record of success, we know this is a safe and  smart investment.   I am also pleased that this legislation includes my bill, the  Apprenticeship Access for All Act. This language will advance programs  that promote the recruitment, employment, and retention of people of  color, individuals with disabilities, and individuals facing barriers  to employment, especially in high-skill, high-wage, and in-demand  sectors and occupations. After all, we must be sure that everyone has  access to opportunity.    Mr. Speaker, to my colleagues, especially those on the  other side of the aisle, I want to be clear about what we are voting to  do here.   We are voting to ensure our workforce gets the investment it needs  and the support it deserves. We are voting to show the American people  that they are seen, that they are heard, and that we care deeply about  providing them pathways to a stable future. And we are voting to uphold  Congress' commitment and obligation to serve every American.
