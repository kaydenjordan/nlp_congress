 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mourn the loss of  Christopher Risner, a friend and constituent of mine from Jackson,  Michigan. He died last week at the age of 29, truly heartbreaking and  far too soon.   I met Chris through a group called Andy's Angels, which fights the  opioid epidemic in our communities.   A star basketball player in high school, Chris battled his own  addiction as a young adult. He bravely and openly shared his personal  struggles in recovery to educate young people and their families about  drug addiction. By doing so, he touched many lives and inspired them to  follow the right path.   Mr. Speaker, we have lost too many lives of sons and daughters to  this devastating epidemic. That is why earlier this year we enacted a  bipartisan law to combat the opioid crisis in a comprehensive way. Yet  in memory of Chris and so many others, we still have more work to do.   May all of us commit to redoubling our efforts in this year ahead,  and may God provide His peace and comfort to Chris' parents, Julie and  Dan; his sister, Angela; and the entire Risner family.                            ____________________
