 Mr. Speaker, March Madness is among us, and I am  thrilled to say that the University of Iowa, Iowa State University, and  my own Drake Bulldogs have made it.   Unfortunately, most of us are now out of our brackets and trying to  pick up the pieces.   I recognize that today, the University of Iowa women's basketball  team with Coach Lisa Bluder, along with Caitlin Clark, a standout  college basketball player with the Iowa Hawkeyes, is ready to take it  to the court tonight.   Iowa is ready to cheer on our Hawkeye women in the Sweet 16  tournament, and we wish them the very best of luck in their game today.   The coaches, staff, parents, alumni, and all Iowans who are watching  across the country and the world tonight have been there from the  beginning. Thank you for your dedication to making this happen.   I also send a shout-out to a very special player from West Des  Moines, Iowa, Caitlin Clark. She is a favorite for National Player of  the Year.   On March 5, 2023, Caitlin put up 30 points, 17 assists, and 10  rebounds, leading her team to clinch its second straight Big 10  tournament title.   You can tell I have been screaming and cheering her on from the  sidelines the whole way through.   Caitlin is the only player, male or female, in the past 20 seasons to  achieve 25 points, 15 assists, and 10 rebounds in a single game, and  she did it not once but twice.   Caitlin has made Iowa so proud. She is in a league of her own with  her record-setting career, and it is only just beginning. We look  forward to watching Caitlin and the Hawkeye women do what they do best  on the court tonight.   Go Hawks.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I  been present, I would have voted ``aye'' on rollcall No. 161.   Stated against:
