 Madam Speaker, I have amendments en bloc at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I intend to speak in opposition to the  amendment, so I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I will be speaking in opposition to this bloc of amendments.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have argued that this  legislation picks winners and losers, and that amendments such as these  might help level the playing field. But I don't think that is the case.   The Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation Act authorizes investments in a  broad range of programs to unleash American energy innovation and  reform outdated policies that govern how we produce, distribute, and  consume energy. Rather than picking winners and losers, this bill takes  a portfolio approach to supporting the transition to a clean energy  economy--a transition that is already underway, but not at the pace  needed to avoid the worst and most costly consequences of climate  change.   For years, rapidly declining costs for solar, wind, storage, and  other technologies have made them cost-competitive with and, in many  cases, more cost-effective than conventional technologies.   The Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation Act doubles down on these  market trends, providing the tools, investments, and policy reforms  needed for the United States to lead the world in transitioning to a  cleaner future.   At the same time, the legislation invests in research, development,  and deployment of technologies to reduce emissions from traditional  sources of pollution. Importantly, it invests in carbon capture,  utilization, and storage to help reduce emissions from existing  facilities that are particularly challenging to decarbonize, especially  in the industrial sector.   So rather than picking winners and losers, the Clean Economy Jobs and  Innovation Act includes a broad array of tools to modernize our energy  system. Taken together, these tools will help make our energy system  cleaner, more efficient, more resilient, and more reliable.   That is why many pieces of this legislation have enjoyed such strong  bipartisan support, because they are commonsense investments that will  create jobs, protect consumers, and reduce pollution.   But these proposed amendments are not good faith efforts to build on  this bipartisan foundation. They are an attempt to water down this  legislation and slow the transition to a clean economy.   When we look across the globe, we see that this transition is already  underway, but that the United States is falling behind. The real  question is whether we want to regain our competitive edge and global  leadership in technology and innovation or whether we cede to the  competition.   I urge my colleagues not to be distracted by talking points about  picking winners and losers and focus on who actually wins when we  invest in innovation. Consumers win, workers win, and our environment  wins.   For these reasons, Madam Speaker, I oppose the en bloc amendments,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record letters that we received in  support of the legislation from U.S. PIRG and the League of  Conservation Voters.        Dear Katie: On behalf of the U.S. Public Interest Research       Group, Environment America and our tens of thousands of       members, we urge you to support the Clean Economy Jobs and       Innovation Act (H.R. 4447). U.S. PIRG and Environment America       will consider scoring final passage and certain amendments on       our annual scorecard.        The American West is on fire, East Coast and Midwest       communities are facing major flooding, and southern states       are being battered with hurricanes. The climate crisis is       here and if we want to have any chance of avoiding its worst       impacts, it is imperative that we take swift action. The       ``Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation Act'' marks significant       progress in the transition to a clean energy future and in       the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.        Among the most impactful pieces, the legislation includes       provisions that:        Phase out the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are       extraordinarily potent climate pollutants, with hundreds to       thousands of times the heat-trapping power of CO2;        Reauthorize the Energy Efficiency Conservation and Block       Grant (EECBG) program, which provides $17.5 billion in       funding for schools, homes, government buildings, and       manufacturing facilities to improve efficiency and deploy       energy-efficient technologies;        Invest over $36 billion for transportation electrification,       including grants and rebates to deploy electric vehicles and       related charging infrastructure;        Direct DOE to establish new model building codes for states       to improve energy efficiency;        Preserve a policy that will eliminate all fossil fuel-      generated energy from federal buildings by the year 2030.        In addition to supporting the overarching bill, U.S. PIRG       and Environment America urge the following votes on       amendments:        Yes on Amendment 32. This amendment, sponsored by Reps.       Haaland, Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez increases authorizations for       renewable energy R&D accounts by 50% and adds an       authorization for total funding for research, development,       demonstration and commercialization activities for energy       efficiency and renewable energy R&D.        Yes on En Bloc 1, Yes on En Bloc 2, No on En Bloc 3, YES on       En Bloc 4.            Sincerely,      Katie Murtha,        Vice President of Government Affairs, U.S. PIRG and       Environment America.                                   ____                                                              LCV,                             Washington, DC, September 24, 2020.       Re Support H.R. 4447 and its pro-environment amendments.         Dear Representative: The League of Conservation Voters       (LCV) works to turn environmental values into national       priorities. Each year, LCV publishes the National       Environmental Scorecard, which details the voting records of       members of Congress on environmental legislation. The       Scorecard is distributed to LCV members, concerned voters       nationwide, and the media.        As the House debates H.R. 4447, the Clean Economy Jobs and       Innovation Act, LCV urges you to support the pro-environment       amendments and reject weakening or anti-environment       amendments, as listed below, and vote YES on final passage.       This bill includes many great provisions to develop and       deploy renewable and distributed energy resources; improve       the efficiency of our homes, schools, and businesses;       electrify our transportation sector; modernize the grid and       enhance its resiliency; prioritize the needs of environmental       justice communities; reduce climate pollution from industrial       and traditional sources, and from ambient air. Though we do       not support increased funding for projects that could extend       the life of fossil fuel-burning power plants or aging nuclear       power infrastructure or prop up undemonstrated new nuclear       projects, many of the amendments would improve those areas       and build upon the significant positive environmental aspects       of the bill. We urge support for amendments listed below       offered singly or en bloc that will make the bill even       stronger by protecting our communities and environment while       investing in clean energy research, development, and       deployment. And we urge you to reject anti-environment       amendments listed below offered singly or en bloc.                      Pro-environment Amendments Include       Haaland (NM), Tlaib (MI), Ocasio-Cortez (NY) #169        This amendment would increase the authorization amounts for       renewable energy research and development by 50 percent such       that the total renewable energy innovation funding in the       package would exceed that of fossil fuel programs authorized       in the bill.

This amendment would add agricultural, grazing, and       forestry practices to DOE's priorities in its carbon removal       research and development, in order to advance natural       systems' ability to capture and store carbon.                     Anti-Environment Amendments Include                                 En Bloc #3       91. Wilson, Joe (SC) #40--Vote No.        This amendment would require DOE to evaluate potential       sites in the DOE footprint for advanced nuclear research and       demonstration programs.        We urge you to SUPPORT H.R. 4447 and the pro-environment       amendments listed above, and oppose anti-environment       amendments. We will strongly consider including votes on this       legislation in the 2020 Scorecard. If you need more       information, please call my office at (202) 785-8683 and ask       to speak with a member of our government relations team.            Sincerely,                                                    Gene Karpinski,                                                         President.     Madam Speaker, I wanted to reference some parts of this.   With regard to the League of Conservation Voters, they specifically  say that, with regard to H.R. 4447, they urge support for the  legislation in general and specifically ask that we reject weakening  the antienvironmental amendments as listed below, and that includes  this amendment en bloc No. 3. They say that we should vote ``no''  because the amendment would require the Department of Energy to  evaluate potential sites in the DOE footprint for advanced nuclear  research and demonstration programs.   In addition to that, in the letter from U.S. PIRG, it says: ``On  behalf of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, Environmental  America, and our tens of thousands of members, we urge you to support  the Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation Act.''   It talks about how the West is on fire and the hurricanes. ``The  climate crisis is here, and if we want to have any chance of avoiding  its worst impacts, it is imperative that we take swift action. The  Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation Act marks significant progress in the  transition to a clean energy future and in the reduction of greenhouse  gas emissions.''   It goes on to talk about the various provisions and how they are  helpful during the climate crisis. Then, it also specifically asks and  urges a ``no'' vote on this en bloc amendment No. 3 because they do not  consider that useful in terms of addressing the climate crisis, and it  is actually counter to environmental concerns.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, first of all, I wanted to rebut what was just said by  my colleague on our committee from the other side. The reality is that  this bill is designed with the hope that we can come to a consensus on  an energy package with the Senate on a bipartisan basis.   In fact, Senator Lisa Murkowski and Senator Joe Manchin are putting  together an emergency package, which is not exactly the same as this,  but the idea would be that we would have some kind of informal  conference and actually adopt a bill that we have a consensus on before  the end of this session. I will point out that we actually worked very  hard to try to do that 2 years ago and came very close to accomplishing  it.   So I don't want anyone here to think that this is a message vehicle.  This is a vehicle that is exactly designed to try to reach an agreement  on an energy package, albeit not a big one, that we could actually get  signed into law by the end of the year.   Madam Speaker, I also want to rebut the idea--somehow there is always  this suggestion that when you do anything on our side of the aisle that  it is not helping create more jobs. The reality is this bill is  designed to do exactly that, to create more jobs. The bill supports the  energy industry by providing resources for projects, jobs, and  technology interests, which are looking forward and necessary for the  energy transition.   Clean energy, renewables, and energy efficiency sectors employ  millions of Americans. As demand for these technologies increases and  as prices decrease, these sectors will continue to grow. However,  COVID-19 has harmed energy jobs across the board. Delayed or canceled  projects, as well as social distancing, have particularly affected  clean energy jobs and energy efficiency jobs. So this bill supports the  necessary sectors by investing in technologies and jobs that are  future-looking and can meet the challenge of climate change.   My colleagues on the other side keep thinking of the energy sector as  something that is totally oriented toward fossil fuels. The reality is  that other countries, and us, we have to move toward a clean energy  economy that creates jobs. This bill includes workforce provisions that  help provide training and transition resources for the energy sector.    The bill includes Chairman Rush's Blue Collar to Green Collar Jobs  Development Act that establishes a nationwide program at the Department  of Energy to improve education and energy-  [[Page H4937]]  related industries. It trains underserved groups, including women,  minorities, veterans, and unemployed energy workers, for energy  careers. It supports the industries and jobs we need to navigate the  energy transition.   Again, I am not someone who says that we are only going to have  certain energy sectors. We are going to need everything. But the bottom  line is, we do have to think that, in the future, there is going to be  a lot more in the clean energy sector than solar and wind. If we don't  start investing in and promoting the technologies, we are going to be  left behind, and we are going to lose jobs. This helps us gain those  jobs.   I reserve the balance of my time, Madam Speaker.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, what I get from the other side of the aisle is that  somehow they think we are going to live in splendid isolation here. I  mean, that might have been nice in the 19th century or the 18th  century, or whenever, but that is not the reality of today. The reality  is we are in constant competition around the world.   And while other countries move towards a clean economy--whether it is  Europe, Japan, whatever it is--they are then investing--not just them,  China, India--they are then investing in these new technologies. And if  I could use solar energy as an example: If we had taken the initiative  a few years ago to actually invest in solar panels and wind turbines  and the technologies that were coming about, we would have been able to  sell a lot more of those panels and those turbines around the world and  also use them for our own clean economy or clean initiatives.   Instead, we didn't, and now most of the solar panels are built in  China, exported to the United States.   You cannot fall behind. If you fall behind in these technologies,  then you are not going to be competitive, and you are going to lose out  on this race, and you are going to have fewer jobs. You can't just put  your head in the sand, like some kind of ostrich, and say to the rest  of the world, We don't care, it doesn't matter. It does matter.   And all we are saying in this bill--and this is not the type of  overall major climate bill that we would have to do eventually--this is  a down payment. And the idea is to look at certain things that we can  do now to invest in technology, to look at innovation so that we don't  fall behind, and we create the clean jobs of the future.   In addition to that, the bill deals with energy efficiency, which is  something that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have never  opposed--more resiliency. These are things that are important to deal  with the climate changes that have occurred, to deal with the  wildfires, to deal with the hurricanes, so that our grid and everything  is more resilient and we can deal with the impact of the climate  crisis.   Madam Speaker, I know that I am not going to be able to convince most  Republicans to support this. I am hoping that some will, and I am  hoping that when we get this passed and we have conversations with the  Senate, that we can actually do some kind of down payment in terms of  creating the clean jobs of the future. And then in the next session of  Congress, we will do a much larger initiative dealing with climate  change.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I am certainly sympathetic to this idea that we have  to do more manufacturing here and not rely on overseas, but I believe  very strongly that is what this bill is all about. It accomplishes the  goal of moving forward with clean energy innovation and technology and  bringing more manufacturing here. And I believe the amendment, this en  bloc amendment, will not help in that regard and, in fact, makes this a  bill less prone to accomplish the goal of clean energy and job  creation.   Madam Speaker, I would urge opposition to the en bloc amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that in the  engrossment of H.R. 4447, the Clerk be authorized to correct section  numbers, punctuation, spelling, and cross-references and to make such  other technical and conforming changes as may be necessary to reflect  the actions of the House.
