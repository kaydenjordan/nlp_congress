 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Barrio Station in  recognition of the 50th anniversary of their creation.   Barrio Station is a community-based organization in the Barrio Logan  community of San Diego, California. It was established in 1970 by Ms.  Rachael Ortiz to provide underserved youths and their families with  resources that they need to succeed.   This organization has continuously provided youth with access to  individual counseling, referrals to vocational and higher education,  and exposure to scholarships.   Barrio Station has worked toward revitalizing the community by  pushing for the development of low-income housing and opportunities  there.   Families and senior citizens are assisted with completing forms which  give them access to the benefits that they have earned.   For over 50 years, Barrio Station has provided resources to  approximately 3,500 youths, families, and seniors every year.   I thank Barrio Station and, especially, Director Rachael Ortiz, for  their exceptional dedication to the youth and families of the 51st  Congressional District and all of California.                            ____________________
