 Madam Chair, I thank my good friend and I thank, too, Mr.  Quigley, who just spoke, as the two of us are the bipartisan sponsors  of the Great Lakes Fisheries Authorization Act, and we are glad that it  is part of this package.   And I rise, obviously, in support, Madam Chair, today for this  package of bills to help protect our coast and the Great Lakes.   You know, in the southwest there is a saying, ``Don't mess with  Texas.'' Well, as one that grew up on the shores of Lake Michigan,  there is a saying that we have, too, ``Don't mess with the Great  Lakes.''   This issue is deeply personal. It is one of great importance to the  Nation. Our Great Lakes hold 18 percent of the world's fresh water  supply, covers some 9,000 miles of shoreline, and this helps generate  over $7 billion a year in sport and commercial fishing industry alone.  This bill would authorize the U.S. Geological Survey Great Lakes  Science Center to conduct science and research activities to support  fishery management decisions in the Great Lakes.   Funds are going to be used to restore the loss of basic fishery  science capabilities, accelerate the development of invasive species  controls and the restoration of native species, and implement advanced  autonomous and remote sensing technologies. Current authorizations for  the U.S. Geological Survey Great Lakes Science Center is confusing and  funding is often piecemeal. In the past, the funds have been diverted  to other unrelated purposes and disrupted ongoing research. That has  got to change.   With dedicated funding and clear authorization, the U.S. Geological  Survey Great Lakes Science Center will, in fact, be able to better  ensure the health of the Great Lakes ecosystem. This is going to help  enhance our coastal resilience, restore fish habitat, and protect our  important coastal economies.   I support the legislation.
