 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 264) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 1101 Charlotte Street in Georgetown, South Carolina,  as the ``Joseph Hayne Rainey Memorial Post Office Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 264         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. JOSEPH HAYNE RAINEY MEMORIAL POST OFFICE BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 1101 Charlotte Street in Georgetown, South       Carolina, shall be known and designated as the ``Joseph Hayne       Rainey Memorial Post Office Building''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Joseph Hayne Rainey Memorial Post Office       Building''.     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H553]]    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues here in the House  in consideration of H.R. 264 to designate the facility of the United  States Postal Service located at 1101 Charlotte Street in Georgetown,  South Carolina, as the Joseph Hayne Rainey Memorial Post Office  Building.   Joseph Rainey was the first African-American Member of the United  States House of Representatives and one of 14 Black Representatives  elected before the end of Reconstruction in 1877.   Joseph Rainey was born into slavery in Georgetown, South Carolina, in  1832. His father was a barber and used his earnings to buy freedom for  himself and his family and, yes, including Joseph. Later, during the  Civil War, Joseph was drafted by the Confederacy, but he escaped to  Bermuda and his wife and he there started a business.   In 1866, he returned to Georgetown where he became the county's  Republican Party chairman. Just a few years later, in 1870, he was  elected to the United States Congress where he served until 1879,  making him the longest serving African-American Member of Congress in  the 19th century.   Following his time in Congress, Rainey was appointed as a Federal  agent of the U.S. Treasury Department. He returned to South Carolina in  1886 and, unfortunately, passed away the following year in Georgetown.   Representative Joe Rainey fought tirelessly for civil rights,  education, and economic opportunity for all people. He left behind a  legacy that will never be forgotten. So, at the very least, naming a  post office in his honor will continually help all of us to remember  the contributions of this remarkable trailblazer.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield).    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on H.R. 264.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the distinguished whip of  the House of Representatives.                                time  1615     Madam Speaker, I want to make sure that I mention my  appreciation to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn) and the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield) for the way they  succinctly captured a great swath of American history over the period  of time that followed Lincoln's signing of the Emancipation  Proclamation in 1863 all the way up to the beginning of the Black Codes  and the failing of Reconstruction, an era that held great hope for this  country but did not come to pass and really was not evidenced until  many, many decades later, as Mr. Clyburn pointed out.   I am happy and honored to bring this measure forward. I want to thank  the gentlewoman from South Carolina for all of her efforts and the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Rice) for their work advancing this.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge the passage of H.R. 264. I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 772) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 229 Minnetonka Avenue South  [[Page H555]]  in Wayzata, Minnesota, as the ``Jim Ramstad Post Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 772         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. JIM RAMSTAD POST OFFICE.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 229 Minnetonka Avenue South in Wayzata,       Minnesota, shall be known and designated as the ``Jim Ramstad       Post Office''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Jim Ramstad Post Office''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 772 to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service  located at 229 Minnetonka Avenue South in Wayzata, Minnesota, and I  hope I am pronouncing that correctly, as the Jim Ramstad Post Office.   Jim Ramstad was born in Jamestown, North Dakota, on May 6, 1946. He  was a graduate of the University of Minnesota and the George Washington  University Law School, as well as a member of the Army Reserve from  1968 until 1974.   Jim became a State senator in 1981. There, he began shaping his  personal and political life around the principles of recovery, honesty,  resilience, transparency, and accountability.   Jim Ramstad would then go on to serve in the Minnesota State Senate  for 10 years before ultimately becoming a Member of this body, the  United States House of Representatives, representing Minnesota's Third  District.   In the Congress, he was a consensus builder, championing the  bipartisan policies needed to reduce discrimination against those  suffering from mental health and addiction problems.   His signature legislation, the Paul Wellstone Mental Health Treatment  Act, was enacted in 2008 just before Jim retired from Congress. After  retiring, he served as a fellow at Harvard University and as an adviser  to Minnesota's Hazelden treatment center.   Representative Ramstad lived the final 39 years of his life in  absolute and complete sobriety. His story is the story of recovery,  impacted in a way that many of us will not understand, but impacting  the lives of Minnesotans and Americans. He died November 5, 2020, after  battling Parkinson's disease for some time.   Naming a post office for Jim Ramstad is an entirely appropriate  measure, given his distinguished political career and contributions to  his State and to his country.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  distinguished gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Phillips).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Phillips) for his leadership on this effort, for his leadership in the  House, and for reminding me, especially, that the post office will  reside in Wayzata, appropriately.   Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers on this side. I urge  passage of this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 813) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 1050 Sunset Road Southwest in Albuquerque, New  Mexico, as the ``Jose Hernandez Post Office Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 813         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. JOSE HERNANDEZ POST OFFICE BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 1050  [[Page H556]]       Sunset Road Southwest in Albuquerque, New Mexico, shall be       known and designated as the ``Jose Hernandez Post Office       Building''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Jose Hernandez Post Office Building''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 813, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service  at 1050 Sunset Road Southwest in Albuquerque, New Mexico, as the Jose  Hernandez Post Office Building.   Jose Hernandez was born in 1971, in Arizona. He enlisted in the Army  after graduating from Arizona State University and was stationed in  Germany. In 2003, he deployed to Iraq for 1 year. When he was  discharged from the Army, Mr. Hernandez moved to New Mexico with his  wife and continued his career in public service at the U.S. Postal  Service.   New Mexicans on his mail route remember the days when they were in a  rush and Mr. Hernandez would quickly go through his mailbag just to get  them their mail before they had to rush on their way. And they  remembered the slower days when he would join them for a short chat or  simply sit for a moment to enjoy the weather.   In April of 2019, letter carrier Jose Hernandez was tragically killed  while protecting a mother in an argument with her son. Mr. Hernandez  intervened to try to peacefully end the dispute, but was, instead, shot  and killed by the young man.   Mailboxes along his former route quickly became memorials, while his  colleagues made their own memorial at his former post office.   So naming a post office after this distinguished public servant, who  gave his life in the line of duty trying to protect an innocent woman,  I think is the very least that this body can do.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  distinguished gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Haaland).    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers on this side. I  thank the gentlewoman from New Mexico for being here as the Secretary- Designate of the Interior Department. This is a confirmation day. So to  be at both places at the same time is very important, and I think it  underscores her real heartfelt appreciation with respect to this  legislation and its passage.   Having said that, I urge passage of H.R. 813, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 208) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 500 West Main Street, Suite 102 in Tupelo,  Mississippi, as the ``Colonel Carlyle `Smitty' Harris Post Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 208         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. COLONEL CARLYLE ``SMITTY'' HARRIS POST OFFICE.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 500 West Main Street, Suite 102 in Tupelo,       Mississippi, shall be known and designated as the ``Colonel       Carlyle `Smitty' Harris Post Office''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Colonel Carlyle `Smitty' Harris Post       Office''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of  H.R. 208, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service  located at 500 West Main Street, Suite 102 in Tupelo, Mississippi, as  the Colonel Carlyle ``Smitty'' Harris Post Office.   Smitty Harris entered the Air Force on January 2, 1951, and served  through the rank of sergeant before being commissioned. He retired from  the Air Force in 1979 as a colonel.   In his career, he flew fighter aircraft and was an instructor and  operations officer and a faculty member at the Air War College.  [[Page H557]]    On April 4, 1965, just a week before his 36th birthday, he was on a  combat mission over North Vietnam to bomb the Thanh Hoa Bridge.   Smitty was successful in destroying the bridge, but his F-105 fighter  plane was hit and Smitty was forced to bail out over North Vietnam. He  was captured immediately and spent the next 8 years as a prisoner of  war in various prisons, where he was confined, mistreated, and  tortured.   He is credited with introducing the tap code to POWs so that they  could communicate surreptitiously between their cell walls.   During his distinguished Air Force career, Smitty earned two Silver  Medals, three Legion of Merits, the Distinguished Flying Cross, two  Bronze Stars for valor, two Purple Hearts, and two Air Medals as well.   Smitty retired from the Air Force in August of 1979, and entered  directly into the University of Mississippi School of Law, joining the  Mississippi bar in December of 1981. His post-Air Force employment  included banking law and marketing. In October of 2012, Colonel Harris  was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Air Force  Association.   Tupelo, Mississippi, is the home to Smitty and to Louise, their two  daughters, and a son who was born in Okinawa shortly after Smitty was  shot down. Their spouses, as well as others in their family, reside in  Tupelo.   Madam Speaker, we are urging today an extra honor for Smitty Harris,  a true American, by naming this postal facility after him.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman for his remarks,  and I thank him for his service, as well. The distinguished gentleman  also is a Major General of the Army National Guard Element, Joint Force  in Mississippi. I don't take that lightly. I appreciate all he has  done, and I appreciate him calling the name of Sam Johnson, who I  served with previously in this body.   Madam Speaker, I went to the Hanoi Hilton as a tourist, and stood  there in pain looking at what he and Senator McCain, and so many others  went through in that facility. I mean, it just brings you back to  Earth. And sometimes we take lightly the service. Sometimes, we take  lightly the fact that some of our servicemen and women were captured.  And sometimes, we take lightly the fact that war can happen at any  time. And when it does happen, we hope that it will continue to always  bring out the best in all of us.   Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to stand here and to give these  remarks from our side of the aisle about Smitty. I talk about him as if  I know him, but when I read about him, I feel like I do know him.   My thanks to the gentleman from Mississippi and the gentlewoman from  South Carolina for leading this discussion on the other side.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
