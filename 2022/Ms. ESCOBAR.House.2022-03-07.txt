 Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise  today to honor the life of Ingeborg Heuser, who passed away after a  lifetime in the arts.   Ingeborg immigrated to the United States from Germany after World War  II, arriving to El Paso in 1953 as the wife of a servicemember.   As a classical ballet dancer, she opened her first studio that year  and became ballet director of the Texas Western Civic Ballet. Over the  next 47 years, she would establish and direct Ballet El Paso, Ballet of  the Americas, and the University of Texas El Paso ballet. Thousands of  students passed through her studio doors, and countless audience  members were exposed to a wide range of classical ballet through her  service.   Her cross-border collaborations with companies in Europe, Mexico, and  Latin America contributed to the exchange of international artistic  endeavors, including the first U.S.-Mexico repertory exchange in 1977.   Madam Speaker, we have lost one of El Paso's shining stars, a  trailblazer of the arts for our region. I ask you to join me in paying  tribute to the life of Ingeborg Heuser. May her legacy and commitment  to the arts continue to be an inspiration to us all.                            ____________________
