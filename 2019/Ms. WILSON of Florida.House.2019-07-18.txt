 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter  in support of H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act of 2019, from the U.S.  Women's Chamber of Commerce.                                                U.S. Women's Chamber                                                     of Commerce,                                      Washington, DC, July 15, 2019.       Letter in Support of H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act of 2019         My name is Margot Dorfman and I am the CEO of the U.S.       Women's Chamber of Commerce. I represent women business       owners across America, who support raising the minimum wage.                                 Introduction         The U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce was founded to support       the continued economic advancement of women in America. The       Women's Chamber has more than 500,000 members--most of them       small business owners. We have members in every state.        The business owners with whom I talk every day believe       that, far from hurting their businesses, raising the minimum       wage in fact helps small businesses, women workers and the       broader economy. Raising the minimum wage reinforces their       business strategies, while an inadequate minimum wage       undermines them.        It is vitally important to understand that the number one       problem I hear from my members is that consumer demand is       still weak. Raising the minimum wage helps directly with that       by putting more money in the pockets of customers who will       spend it at our local businesses.        The migration of women from the workforce into business       ownership has been one of the great economic achievements of       the American dream. As women moved from employees to business       owners, we have brought a new perspective to America's       business leadership. Women now own about 40 percent of all       privately held firms in the United States and are exercising       the decision-making authority that comes with that role to       effect positive changes in the workplace.        My member business owners realize that most of the people       working for low pay across the country--the waitresses, the       health aides and the cashiers--are women. Many of my members       were once employees themselves. They know that raising the       minimum wage helps working women and families in their       struggle to make ends meet. Our members know that a minimum       wage of $7.25 an hour is much too low.        As a matter of fact, large national chains that pay low       wages may actually be competing unfairly with women-owned       small businesses that work hard to assure that their       employees receive fair pay. In short, keeping the minimum       wage low keeps women and families down.        For these reasons and more, the U.S. Women's Chamber of       Commerce supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per       hour by 2024 and then indexing it to median hourly wages so       that it doesn't erode again. And we also support gradually       raising the minimum wage for tipped workers until it equals       the regular minimum wage as called for in the Raise the Wage       Act.       Small Businesses Show That Paying Higher Wages Is Economically                                 Realistic         There are two roads to profitability: the high road and the       low road. Businesses can invest in their workforces with       decent wages and benefits, and enjoy the benefits of a       dedicated workforce with lower turnover, higher productivity       and better customer service. Or businesses can pay poverty       wages and churn through employees. These businesses may save       on immediate payroll, but they experience the significant       expense of higher turnover, constant recruitment and       training, higher absenteeism, and a less experienced, less       productive workforce.        Only one road to profitability delivers us a strong floor       under our economy, a growing middle class, upward mobility       and the promise of the American Dream. The business owners       supported by the U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce have chosen       the high road strategy for building their businesses: they       pay better wages and their businesses benefit as a result.       They report to me that this approach attracts more stable,       dependable, productive employees. That's not surprising since       better wages enable workers to concentrate on their job       without continually worrying about how they will put gas in       their cars, pay for day care or keep up with their rent.        At small businesses, the owners and employees work side by       side on a daily basis, working together to offer the best       goods and services to their customers. My members know they       cannot generally compete with the big box stores or the chain       restaurants on price. Instead, their competitive advantage is       higher quality service and a real connection to the community       and its residents.        The reality is that my members and other Main Street       businesses have a lot in common with low-wage workers: both       are being squeezed by big corporations. The low wages that       big retailers and restaurant chains pay are one of many       factors that contributes to their price advantage over small       and local businesses. Indeed, low-paying big chains count on       responsible employers and taxpayers to subsidize them by       providing food stamps and public health assistance to their       workers who can't make ends meet on poverty wages.        Raising the minimum wage to a more realistic level helps       level the playing field for businesses like my members who       believe in treating their workers fairly and investing in the       communities they are rooted in.     Weak Consumer Spending Is Hurting Small Businesses and Raising the                      Minimum Wage Can Give It a Boost         My members see the stagnant wages and economic anxiety that       most American families are facing as one of the major factors       weakening the economy a decade after the Great Recession. And       economists recognize that until we restore real wage growth       for working and middle-class Americans, consumer spending       will not be where we need it to be to help businesses thrive       and grow into the future.        Too many people forget that workers are also consumers.       Consumer spending drives 70 percent of our economy, and we       must repower broad-based consumer spending--backed by       adequate wages rather than unaffordable debt--if we are going       to repower our economy, create good jobs and reverse the       decline in our middle class. Raising the minimum wage boosts       the economy from the bottom up, which is exactly what we       need.        That's why local businesses support raising the minimum       wage--because that additional money in the pockets of the       lowest paid workers will be spent immediately in the local       economy. These workers are not taking fancy trips abroad or       speculating on Wall Street. They are spending pay increases       at the grocery store, the pharmacy and the auto-repair in       their communities.  [[Page H7100]]                      Raising the Minimum Wage Helps Working Women         Finally, as a representative of women-owned businesses, I       want to emphasize that working women represent the greatest       percentage of workers to benefit from increasing the minimum       wage. The typical low-wage worker is an adult woman. Think of       your waitress at Applebee's, or the cashier who rings you up       at the supermarket. Think of the childcare center worker who       takes care of your son or daughter, or the health aide who       helps your mother or grandfather.        Many of the women business owners who belong to the U.S.       Women's Chamber of Commerce left the workforce to start their       own businesses because they felt that the jobs where women       worked were not being fairly paid. In building their own       companies and becoming employers, they have created working       environments where they try to do better by paying and       playing fairly. That's why women-owned businesses tend to pay       above minimum wage. Women business owners understand and       value security for families.        In sum, a $15 minimum wage by 2024 would offer all of the       benefits that I have outlined: it will help small businesses       like my members by putting more money in the pockets of       workers, which will boost spending and job creation on Main       Street; it will help level the playing field for small       businesses and big businesses; and it will bring fairer pay       to American women, who hold the majority of the low-wage jobs       that will see a raise.        While some try to portray a minimum wage increase as a       fight between business and workers, raising the minimum wage       is in reality good for both.        It is for these reasons that the U.S. Women's Chamber of       Commerce supports the Raise the Wage Act of 2019.        Thank you.                                                    Margot Dorfman,                  Chief Executive Officer, U.S. Women's Chamber of                                              CommerceTM.     Mr. Speaker, it is amoral that millions of  people in this country are forced to work so hard for so little in  return.   Believe me, Congress knows, because there is a serious bipartisan  movement afoot to provide Members of Congress with a cost-of-living  raise. Congress realizes that they do not earn enough and, hopefully,  they realize that people earning $7.50 an hour are definitely not  earning enough.   So today, I call on CNN, MSNBC, FOX News, to let the American people  know that we are attempting to raise the minimum wage. Herald it from  the loudest bully pulpit you have. Listen to the facts given today by  Chairman Scott and my colleagues and share them.   News outlets all over America, you have a responsibility to let the  American people know that we hear them, we support them, and we  understand. We are doing our very, very best to help them. We are  fighting for them.   Raise the wage, colleagues. Raise the wage today.
