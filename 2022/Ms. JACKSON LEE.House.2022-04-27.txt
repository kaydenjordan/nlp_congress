 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4693,  Global Malnutrition Prevention and Treatment Act of 2021, which will  establish programs and direct the U.S. Agency for International  Development (USAID) to carry out activities to prevent and treat  malnutrition globally.   This bill would advance targeted and evidence-based interventions for  the prevention and treatment of global malnutrition and to improve the  coordination of such programs.   Under this bill, USAID must leverage resources to address  malnutrition through the Global Nutrition Coordination Plan and its  role on the board of directors of the International Development of  Finance Corporation.   The Global Nutrition Coordination plan is an interagency effort to  strengthen the impact of U.S. investments in nutrition.   USAID must also select countries based on specific malnutrition- related indicators for the purpose of targeting malnutrition prevention  and treatment programs.   The plan will prioritize high-need, underserved, marginalized or  impoverished communities.   However, countries must display strong political commitment and have  existing nutrition strategies already in place, which ensures that the  plan to combat malnutrition in a select country will be effective and  impactful.   Additionally, USAID may:   establish the Nutrition Leadership Council to coordinate activities  to prevent and treat malnutrition;   target resources and nutrition interventions to the populations most  susceptible to severe malnutrition, and otherwise support efforts to  prevent and treat malnutrition globally;   coordinate activities among partner countries, United Nations  agencies, civil society, private sector actors, and others to, for  example, build capacity in partner countries to sustain nutrition  interventions.   USAID would also be required to provide Congress with an  implementation plan and annual reports concerning the programs for  treating and preventing malnutrition.   As a senior Member of the House of Representatives and the founding  chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I believe this bill is  vital for preventing and treating malnutrition around the world.   We must ensure continued focus on multi-sectoral nutrition programs,  while monitoring these interventions to ensure effective use of  American taxpayer dollars.   I commend the USAID maternal and child nutrition programs that seek  to improve health outcomes by implementing nutrition-specific  interventions, and those that address the immediate, health-related  determinants of undernutrition.   It is no secret that poverty amplifies the risk of malnutrition.   People who are poor are more likely to be affected by different forms  of malnutrition.   Furthermore, malnutrition increases health care costs, reduces  productivity, and slows economic growth, which can perpetuate a cycle  of poverty and ill-health.   Malnutrition can have several negative and deadly effects such as  decreased cognitive development in newborns, greater vulnerability to  disease and other issues.   Optimizing nutrition early in life, especially from the 1,000 days  from conception to a child's second birthday ensures the best possible  start in life, with long-term benefits.   According to UNICEF, nearly half of all deaths in children under 5  are attributable to undernutrition.   Every year, the world loses hundreds of thousands of young children  and babies to hunger-related causes.   Women, infants, children, and adolescents are at particular risk of  malnutrition.   I would be remiss if I stood here today without addressing the global  impact of COVID-19 on malnutrition.   The significant and life-altering shocks created by the pandemic and  efforts to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19 have resulted in the  disruption of food systems.  [[Page H4550]]    This has also upended health and nutrition services which has  devastated livelihoods, as well as threatened food security.   These necessary containment measures have unfortunately caused more  vulnerable children to face malnourishment.   By the end of this year nearly 14 million more children are likely to  be severely malnourished because of the pandemic's impacts.   This means that 58.9 million young children--or almost the whole  population of South Africa--will likely face life-threatening  malnutrition if the global community doesn't act.   The pandemic revealed the already existing brutal food insecurity  struggles in many nations while triggering economic recessions and  jeopardizing access to food.   The combined impacts of environmental factors, COVID-19 and political  conflicts place malnutrition as an overwhelming concern in the global  community.   I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 4693 because with  this bill we are committing ourselves to improving the health of women  and children in impoverished areas, helping prevent illness, and  improving economic conditions in poorer countries.   Every parent deserves the opportunity to put nutritional food on the  table to take care of their families.   By supporting these effective nutrition interventions, we unlock the  ability to begin investing in the well-being, growth, and productivity  of our generations to come.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 812, a  bill to direct the Secretary of State to develop a strategy to regain  observer status for Taiwan in the World Health Organization (WHO), and  for other purposes.   This bill directs the Department of State to include additional  information in its annual reports concerning Taiwan's participation at  the WHO's World Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer.   The report shall describe changes and improvements to the State  Department's plan to support Taiwan's observer status at the WHA,  following any meetings at which Taiwan did not participate under such  status.   The measure also directs the Secretary of State to establish a  strategy for obtaining observer status at the WHA, the decision-making  body of the WHO.   Taiwan is excluded from most global organizations such as the WHO,  the U.N. health agency, because of the objections of China, which  considers the island one of its provinces and not a separate country.   Taiwan cannot be excluded from the global health body because as we  have seen, infectious viruses like the COVID-19 pandemic, have the  ability to transcend all borders.   Taiwan has contributed more than $6 billion in international medical  and humanitarian aid efforts to over 80 countries since 1996 and  donated millions of personal protective and testing equipment during  the COVID-19 crises.   After successfully suppressing the spread of COVID within its  borders, Taiwan also generously donated millions of pieces of personal  protective equipment and testing reagents to countries in need.   Taiwan is an important partner to the United States, and we must  assist their effort to participate at the W.H.O.   Taiwan's absence from the World Health Assembly over the last several  years may negatively impact us all, since public health is safeguarded  when everyone is engaged.   In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic it is now more important than  ever for all nations to come together and share information regarding  public health.   I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for S. 812 because the U.S.  should support Taiwan's involvement with the international community on  all matters regarding public health.   These efforts will benefit global public health, and potentially save  many lives.    Madam Speaker, today, former Secretary Madeleine  Albright was funeralized at the National Cathedral.   I rise today to pay tribute to a great American and a woman who  exuded confidence and knowledge of worldwide diplomacy. She was  appointed by President Clinton and became a champion for women's rights  around the world.   I remember meeting her on the border of Bangladesh, meeting with  young girls who had just been trafficked and returned to their native  land. How empathetic she was to these young girls who had been  traumatized and were Bangladesh citizens.   I understand, as well, that she cared about ensuring that human  rights was heard around the world. She was a fighter against anti- Semitism because of the history of her own life and family, fleeing  Europe during that time.   As we stand against the ideals of hatred and anti-Semitism, we stand  in honor of former Secretary Madeleine Albright.   May she rest in peace, and may her legacy be one of worldwide  diplomacy, the rights of women, peace, and solutions to hatred. We  never hope to have hatred in this land and in this world. May she rest  in peace and rest in power.                            ____________________
