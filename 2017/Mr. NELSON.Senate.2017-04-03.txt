 Mr. President, today I want to join my friend Susan  Collins and talk about why I support the Main Street Fairness Act. I am  glad to partner on this bill with the Senator from Maine.   The bill does one simple thing: It ensures small businesses don't  have to pay higher taxes than the largest corporations. This is the  type of common sense that we need more of in Washington.   There are 2.3 million small businesses in Florida, employing around  43.2 percent of the State's workforce. They are the primary engine of  job growth in the country, and are a proven means for economic  mobility.   Under most circumstances, small businesses are subject to the same  rules as large corporations but are treated differently under the Tax  Code. They already have a hard enough time competing with large  multinational corporations, which can hire an endless stream of high- priced tax lawyers to shift their income abroad and avoid U.S. taxes.   We should be doing all we can to put small businesses on a more level  playing field. Part of that starts with this bill, but it doesn't end  here. We need to do comprehensive tax reform.   This bill should be part of that conversation, as one way we could  help small businesses. It is not the only way, and I am certainly open  to other ideas, but we need to have a serious talk about how we are  going to freshen up the Tax Code and help the economy grow.   I know a lot of my colleagues have different ideas about what tax  reform should look like, but I think we should all be able to agree  that it needs to be real reform, not just a temporary tax cut. It needs  to support a technology-driven economy and help us transition to a  greener, fairer economy--with a lot less disparity.   Tax reform should also generate enough added revenue to pay for the  infrastructure we desperately need. That includes the crumbling roads  and bridges that threaten the safety of millions of Americans and are a  tax on small businesses. We also need to invest in our water  infrastructure, energy infrastructure, ports, railways, public schools,  and affordable housing infrastructure.   At the same time, tax reform needs to be deficit neutral. You might  ask, how are we going to pay for all this? Well, we can start by  getting rid of outdated special interest tax breaks that are no longer  needed or don't make sense in the 21st century.   We can also eliminate tax loopholes that allow companies to shift  profits abroad and lead to corporate inversions.   This bill, the Main Street Fairness Act, is a good start, but it  shouldn't end here. We need to have a serious, deliberative effort to  develop a bipartisan tax reform package.                            ____________________
