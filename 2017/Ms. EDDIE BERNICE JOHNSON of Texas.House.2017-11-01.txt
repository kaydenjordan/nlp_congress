 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to  host Reverend Waters as our guest chaplain today.   Reverend Waters is a true community servant and a man of God. He is  the founding pastor of Joy Tabernacle African Methodist Episcopal  Church--AME--of Dallas, Texas.   Reverend Waters is a pastor, a professor, an award-winning author, a  community leader, and a social commentator. Reverend Waters' words of  hope and empowerment inspire national and international audiences.   As a notable friend of the community, Reverend Waters served as a  keynote speaker at my Annual Dallas Prayer Breakfast this year. His  engaging personality and purposeful speech captivated the attention of  all those who attended.   As a strong leader, Reverend Waters is able to understand the unique  needs of our community. He knows no stranger when he walks into the  room, and his charismatic nature allows him to connect with everyone he  meets.   It is my pleasure that he has come today to be our guest chaplain.  May God continue to bless him.                            ____________________
