 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for  this resolution to terminate the President's declaration of a national  emergency on February 15, 2019. No such emergency exists on the U.S.- Mexico border. The President is using this declaration as a false  pretense to divert taxpayer money, primarily away from the Department  of Defense, toward the construction of a wasteful, ineffective wall  along the southern border. This declaration is an unacceptable abuse of  power that circumvents the constitutional authority of Congress. For  these reasons, I am a cosponsor of this resolution to terminate the  declaration pursuant to the provisions of the National Emergencies Act.   I support taking action to make sure we have the appropriate  personnel, equipment, facilities, and resources to protect our borders  from criminal activity like trafficking in drugs or people. Building  this wall is not a good investment and it will not stop crime or  illegal immigration along our southern border. Instead of building  walls, we should instead build bridges to those who are fleeing  violence and legally seeking asylum in our country. I urge my  colleagues to join me in rejecting the President's abuse of power by  supporting this resolution.
