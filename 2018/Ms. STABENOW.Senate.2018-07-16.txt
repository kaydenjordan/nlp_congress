 Mr. President, due to travel issues, I was  unable to attend today's rollcall vote on the nomination of Scott Stump  to be Assistant Secretary for Career, Technical, and Adult Education at  the Department of Education.   Had I been able to attend, I would have supported his  nomination.                            ____________________
