 Madam Speaker, people at home who might be listening  to this may be wondering: Why is it so important that Speaker McCarthy  pay our Nation's bills on time?   Why does Speaker McCarthy need to do that? It is because of what can  happen if he doesn't.   It isn't just that seniors won't get their Social Security checks on  time. It isn't just that veterans won't get their medical care at VA  hospitals. It isn't just that Medicare and Medicaid bills won't get  processed. It is that interest rates will immediately go up because  interest rates reflect the risk of non-repayment.   If we don't repay our national debt, then interest rates will go up  on this country. We fall into a recession, and millions of jobs will go  away. It is a horrible situation.   Speaker McCarthy needs to pay our bills on time.   This is a grotesque negotiation he has going on over at the White  House even as we speak because whoever cares least about the well-being  of America and America's standing in the world in that negotiation wins  the negotiation.    I say to Speaker McCarthy: Do your job.                            ____________________
