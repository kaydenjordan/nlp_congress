 Mr. President, as the Senate wraps up its work this  week, I have been in multiple discussions with my friend the majority  leader about clearing nominations with bipartisan support, and we have  made significant progress. Now that we have moved past the terrible  process used on healthcare, I hope we can get back to our normal way of  legislating and clearing noncontroversial nominees. The two are tied  together. They can't avoid regular order when they want to and say that  Democrats should use regular order whenever they want us to.   Now that healthcare is done, I think we can tie the two together--the  normal way of legislating, clearing noncontroversial nominees as we  move forward in September. Of course, controversial nominees will still  require the proper vetting, but I am committed to help move  noncontroversial, bipartisan nominees forward.   I hope the fever is breaking. There is a real desire in this body to  move past the acrimony of the healthcare debate and get to a place  where we can work together to advance legislation that helps the  American people. I am hopeful that the discussions between the  Republican leader and me will produce a package of nominees we can  confirm today.                                  Tax Reform    Mr. President, the Republican leader has said that the next big issue  this body will take up is taxes. Democrats were excluded from even  participating in healthcare discussions from the very first day of  Congress, a process that ultimately ended in failure. So we have made  the first overture this time to show our Republican friends we are  serious about a bipartisan process on tax reform. We sent them a letter  outlining three very basic principles. This is a guideline for our  Republican colleagues to come work with us. These are very simple  principles that I think the vast majority of Americans would support.  Let me say what they are.   First, the Republican leader has said that he would pursue  reconciliation again, a process that purposefully excludes Democrats  almost again on the first day we begin to talk about tax reform. The  majority leader brought down the curtain on bipartisan tax reform  before a discussion between our two parties could even begin. He says  that Democrats don't want to have a bipartisan discussion. Of course we  do. We have said this over and over again until we are blue in the  face, but I guess the majority leader somehow didn't like the three  principles we laid out, and I would like him to specifically answer  what it was.   We know he probably agrees, so which of these three principles does  the majority leader disagree with? Tell us. Which of the three? We know  he probably agrees with the third. Surely he can't think that a blunt  budget tool that excludes 48 Members of the Senate is a good way to  write legislation. He has said so many times himself. I quoted him  yesterday.   He warned the Senate about becoming ``an assembly line for one  party's partisan legislative agenda.'' Those are Senator McConnell's  words. The Senate should not become ``an assembly line for one party's  partisan legislative agenda.'' That is what he did on healthcare. Is he  doing it again on tax reform? I hope not.   Well, we know he probably agrees with the second principle: no  increase to the debt and deficit. We know he agrees because he has said  so before. The Republican leader and Members of his party have spent  decades assailing the debt and deficit. As recently as May 16, the  Republican leader told  [[Page S4785]]  Bloomberg TV that tax reform will have to be revenue-neutral, so that  one doesn't seem to be it. Again, I would like to hear what he has to  say explicitly so that we can work together.   It leaves us with the first principle: no tax cuts for the top 1  percent. Here again, I understand why the majority leader and my  Republican friends don't want to come out and say that this is the  reason they have decided to pursue a tax bill on their own, but it  almost certainly is.   Tax cuts for the wealthy are extremely unpopular with the American  people--and for good reason. The top 1 percent of this country takes 20  percent of our income, a great percentage of its wealth. The wealthy  are doing well. God bless them. Their incomes are going up at a faster  rate than those of anybody else, but when we are talking about our Tax  Code and rewriting it, we shouldn't be focused on giving the 1 percent  another tax break while millions of working families struggle to afford  the cost of college, prescription drugs, food, and healthcare.   I am afraid the majority is in the same boat as they were with  healthcare. They don't want to say that their real reason for changing  healthcare is wanting to slash Medicaid. A good number of courageous  Members on the other side said: We won't do that. But that was the core  of the Senate bill. They knew it was unpopular with the American  people, so they didn't talk about it. They entered into a process that  hid it from the American people.   I think, unfortunately, history is repeating itself. They know how  unpopular cutting taxes on the top 1 percent is, but for the special  interest, Koch brother wing of their party, that is their No. 1 goal.  All they talk about is cutting taxes on the wealthy. So they are stuck.  When will my colleagues have the courage to break free from the Koch  brothers and special interests?   Don't give breaks to the top 1 percent. Everyone knows they don't  need it. It is an old, discredited idea that has lost its steam except  among the hard-right, Koch brother wing of the Republican Party. Most  Americans--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--don't go for it.  So break free.   If our Republican colleagues' whole basis for doing tax reform is  cutting taxes on the top 1 percent, we are going to send that message  from one end of America to the other, and their ideas will certainly  fail, as they did with healthcare.   In a related point, I saw this morning that President Trump has been  bragging about the success of the stock market, which, by the way, was  already going up. It went up more points under President Obama than  under President Trump. It started going up years ago. It is just  continuing. Most economists would give President Obama at least as much  credit as President Trump. But that is not the point I wish to make.   The stock market is mainly owned by the wealthy. As of 2013, the top  20 percent own 92 percent of all stock shares. So when the stock market  is going up, it is helping the 1 percent.   Average Americans are not looking for stocks to go up, not looking  for corporate profits to hit record levels, as much as they are looking  at how are their paychecks, how are their expenses. That is why we have  a better deal for them. We want paychecks for average Americans to go  up. We want expenses for average Americans to go down. We want them to  have better tools, so they and their kids can make a better living in  the 21st century.   The focus of the stock market is on people at the highest end. Many  will dispute whether President Trump deserves credit for it, but  whether you think so or you don't--I don't, by and large--it is not  what the American people are looking for, and it is not a basis for  bragging about the economy.   Well, going back to taxes--the American people will rebel against a  tax cut for the wealthy, so the Republicans clearly will not talk about  it in their plan. They will give a crumb to the middle class and try to  hide a massive giveaway to the already fortunate. I can see no other  reason why they object to these three very reasonable, very popular  principles other than that, and we hope they will not try to sneak it  through in the same partisan process.                                 Immigration    Finally, Mr. President, a word on immigration: Yesterday, I heard the  President railing against migrant workers and wrapping his arms around  the Cotton-Perdue bill. The bill goes after hard-working people who  want to play by the rules, contribute to our economy, and earn  citizenship, while doing nothing to address the unscrupulous practices  of employers who abuse our visa programs to outsource jobs and displace  American workers.   Here is what I would like to focus on. The President has this nice  announcement that he is cutting back on immigration, but a month ago he  actually increased the number of H-2B visas--a program the President  knows well. Why? A lot of those with H-2B visas work in hotels. I don't  know how many, but I bet a good number are in Trump Hotels. So when the  President actually looks at immigration in his own businesses, he says:  We need more immigrants. When asked before, he has said: Well, we  couldn't get American workers. But when he comes up with his big  immigration plan--I think not appealing to the higher instincts of  Americans--he says: Slash it. Those two are complete contradictions. To  hold both of those views is to hold hypocritical views.   The President wants to talk about immigration because he thinks the  politics are to his advantage, but, in truth, his immigration policy  has a stunning hypocrisy at the core of it. The President criticizes  and seeks to limit almost every immigration program except the one that  benefits his own business.   I yield the floor.
