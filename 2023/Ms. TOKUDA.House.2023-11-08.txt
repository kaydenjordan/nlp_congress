 Mr. Speaker, today marks the 3-month anniversary of the  Maui wildfires that destroyed Lahaina and took its somber place in  history as the deadliest wildfire in the United States in over a  century.   As the sole Representative of the people for Maui in the United  States House of Representatives, I have traveled there every week since  the fires first broke, sometimes three or four times a week, to connect  people with the services and support that they need, to advocate for  Federal assistance, and to receive and listen to their stories.   These are stories of loved ones lost, homes burned, businesses in  limbo, victims and first responders alike dealing  [[Page H5650]]  with grief and anguish, but these are also the stories of hope, the  aloha, the gratitude, and the ability of a community coming together to  find the strength to heal.   This is the story of Maui.   Today and every week, I will come to the House floor to uplift their  voices, the voices of her people, so that you know what help is still  very much needed and understand the important role each Member of  Congress can play in rebuilding this beautiful place that we love.                            ____________________
