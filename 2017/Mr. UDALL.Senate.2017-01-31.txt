 Mr. President, thank you for the recognition, and I thank  Senator Merkley very much for yielding.   I have been here on the floor, listening to Senators Kaine and  Merkley, and I saw Senator Cardin speaking earlier from my office. We  can see that for many of us who sat through these hearings and heard  the answers, it didn't give us a lot of confidence that Rex Tillerson  was going to be able to step in and be the top diplomat for the United  States of America. So I join in all the comments that have been made  earlier.   I want to talk about one of the issues that has developed over the  last couple of days and that really has bearing on this. For the last  century, the United States has led the world stage. We are the  inspiration for countless nations as they nurture hopeful democracies-- democracies that respect human rights and individual liberties. We are  a nation of freedom, where men and women can work hard, build a happy,  healthy life, and live the American dream. That is what makes President  Trump's anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant actions last week so repugnant.   I believe his actions violate the Constitution. They also violate  everything we stand for as a country. Turning our backs on refugees and  those seeking a better life doesn't project strength. It shows  weakness. It fuels anti-American rage around the world. Our Nation  doesn't punish innocent people because of what they believe and who  they pray to. We don't slam the door in the faces of those who need  help the most.   I call on all of us, especially my colleagues across the aisle, to  denounce this action and the people behind it. I am relieved that  Federal judges around the nation are blocking the President's  unconstitutional order, and I am also very proud of our strong  constitutional system of checks and balances.   I can't express adequately how proud I am of Sally Yates, the Acting  Attorney General who was fired by President Trump. Now you have to know  something about her. This is a very courageous person who stood up and  did the right thing. Sally Yates is a career prosecutor. She has served  as a U.S. attorney in the U.S. attorney's office under Democrats and  Republicans--a career prosecutor. When she was put up for a vote in the  Senate, she got 84 votes when she was approved for Deputy Attorney  General of the United States. This is someone who understands what is  going on, understands the Constitution, and understands her legal  obligations. She stood up and said that she wasn't going to represent  in court the President on this Muslim ban, and he fired her. He fired  her.   These kinds of actions are disturbing. They are un-American acts, and  they are the most urgent reason I rise today to state that I cannot  support confirming Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State.   There is no doubt that Mr. Tillerson was qualified to run ExxonMobil.  Exxon was his first job out of college, and the only company he worked  for during his 40-year career in the oil and gas industry. There is no  doubt that Mr. Tillerson, as CEO and chairman of ExxonMobil, was 100  percent committed to making sure the best interests of the company's  shareholders were served. But with no diplomatic experience or history  of public service, I am not confident that Mr. Tillerson is qualified  to serve as the United States' chief diplomat.   After studying his work and studying the history and his responses at  the confirmation hearing and looking at his answers in writing, I do  not believe that Mr. Tillerson is able to commit 100 percent to serving  the best interests of the American people. Negotiating the complexities  of oil and gas deals is not the same as negotiating the complexities of  treaties and agreements with foreign governments.   ExxonMobil's top priority is profit. That is its reason for  existence. Leaders negotiate business deals over money and access to  resources. The United States and the American people have different  priorities--sometimes conflicting priorities.   Our Nation is economically successful, for sure, and we value  business and we value making money, but our core values go way beyond  economics. We value representative government, we value human rights,  and we value freedom of speech. We value the four freedoms that  President Roosevelt talked about when we entered into international  agreements to spread the four freedoms around the world.   An incoming Secretary of State should not be learning on the job. He  or she should already have substantial relevant experience. He or she  should already have proven experience fighting for our Nation's core  values, for human rights. Mr. Tillerson made it clear during his  hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he lacks  substantive foreign policy experience and knowledge. He told the  committee many times that he was not familiar with the issues at hand  or needed briefing. He must have said that a number of times. As just  one example, Mr. Tillerson was unfamiliar with Russia's role in the  indiscriminate slaughter of civilians in Syria. He had no opinion of  the legality of the slaughter under international law. These are some  of the most important, most urgent foreign policy matters we face, but  he was unprepared to answer them.   Like Senators on both sides of the aisle, I am concerned about Mr.  Tillerson's close personal business ties to the Russian Government. I  am concerned about those. They may color his view of Russia. He has  been long friends with Vladimir Putin. He has a highly profitable  relationship with Igor Sechin, the head of the state-owned oil company  Rosneft. I worry that these ties make it difficult or maybe even  impossible for him to objectively evaluate Russia's actions and to act  in America's best interests.   Are his close ties to Russia why he does not condemn Russia's actions  in Syria? We cannot be sure. Mr. Tillerson also will not confirm  whether he will advocate maintaining sanctions against Russia for  invading Crimea. We know that the sanctions also continue to cost  ExxonMobil because it is not able to drill for oil in Russia's Arctic.   Will Mr. Tillerson not commit to maintaining sanctions because of his  ties to Russia? We cannot be sure.   In a third example, Mr. Tillerson would not commit to sanctions  against Russia for its interference in our Presidential election. He  said he didn't have enough information. Well, every U.S. security  agency--all 17 of them--has concluded that the Russian Government  hacked the Democratic National Committee, disclosed email from the hack  from getting in there, and tried to influence our election. They agreed  that these actions were authorized at the highest levels of the Russian  Government, with fingers pointing right at Vladimir Putin. The  intelligence community's public reports stated it this way:         We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an       influence campaign in 2016  [[Page S522]]       aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia's goals were       to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process,       denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and       potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian       Government developed a clear preference for President-elect       Trump--    Now President Trump--         We have high confidence in these judgments.    So 17 of our intelligence agencies pooled together all of their  information, and they had high confidence in what they concluded there.   Mr. Tillerson had adequate information to make a strong statement  against this attack, against this hacking, and in favor of American  democracy. He did not make such a statement.   We must have a Secretary of State whose allegiance is 100 percent  committed to U.S. interests. Mr. Tillerson's equivocating testimony on  Russia did not convince me that he can be counted on to serve America's  interests and America's interests only. Mr. Tillerson's equivocations  mirror the Republicans' record on Russian interference in our  democracy.   While the President has plans to dismantle the post-World War II  international order, Republicans have done nothing to address Russia's  attempt to dismantle our democracy.   I was also unsatisfied by Mr. Tillerson's answers on climate change.  While he acknowledges the existence of climate change, he testified  that ``our ability to predict that effect is very limited'' and that  what action to take ``seems to be the largest area of debate existing  in the public discourse.'' That is not what the overwhelming majority  of scientists tell us. Our ability to predict what is happening to the  planet's climate is not ``very limited,'' and there is international  consensus written into the Paris Agreement as to what actions nations  agree they must take. Scientists from all over the world have joined  together through the United Nations and said that climate change is  real and we have to take specific actions.   I appreciated that Rex Tillerson at least said that he believes the  United States should remain at the table, but he questioned a key part  of the Paris Agreement: the nationally determined contribution, or what  is called the NDC. Without the NDC from the United States, the  agreement is likely to fall apart, and his claimed support for the  Paris Agreement becomes meaningless.   I cannot be clearer: Ignoring the threat of climate change is a  direct threat to the United States. We have heard other Senators talk  about the threat to their States, and it is a direct threat to my home  State of New Mexico.   While President Trump may be trying to quiet our climate scientists,  the science is clear. Climate change is real. We just finished the  hottest year in recorded history. We know we must act, and we know  there will be devastating impacts if the United States does not lead on  this issue.   No matter what one believes about science or foreign policy, we  should all be alarmed at the lack of transparency in the new  administration, especially the unwillingness of our President and key  Cabinet members to be open and honest with taxpayers about their  finances and potential conflicts.   While Mr. Tillerson has divested from ExxonMobil, we still don't have  copies of his tax returns. Mr. Tillerson's ties to ExxonMobil are  decades old. Yet he has said he will recuse himself from matters  related to ExxonMobil for only 1 year. For only 1 year will he recuse  himself. He has worked for this company his entire life. He should  refrain from taking calls from his old company for as long as he serves  as Secretary of State. He is serving the country. He is serving in a  taxpayer-funded job. I don't understand why he cannot agree to this  simple standard to avoid the appearance of any conflict. If he deals  favorably with ExxonMobil, how can the American people know he is  working for us or for his former employer, which made him an extremely  wealthy man?   But most concerning to me is whether Mr. Tillerson will be able to  speak truth to power. We have just seen this weekend how vital that  will be in this administration, where it appears that there is no  unifying vision, and different factions of President Trump's Cabinet  are competing for his attention. We need a leader with a clear vision  for America's role in the world, someone who will put American values  ahead of everything else.   Too many times, when pressed during his confirmation hearing about  U.S. interests and values, Mr. Tillerson did not give straight answers.  On questions such as human rights violations in the Philippines and  Syria, he did not call out these offenses for what they were. On  questions about whether we should maintain sanctions against Russia for  illegally invading Crimea or for interfering with our electoral  process, he deferred; he wavered; he said he would decide at a later  date when he can be briefed or meet with the President. If Mr.  Tillerson can't give straight answers, from the heart, about the most  pressing human rights issues, on violations of international law, on a  foreign power's interference with our Presidential election, how can we  expect him to speak up and temper the worst angels in the Trump  administration?   If Mr. Tillerson were the nominee for a more conventional Republican  President, these concerns would not be as serious. But I think every  Senator can agree that Donald Trump is not a conventional President. He  is offending allies and upending alliances on a nearly daily basis. He  has made negative statements about the German Chancellor's domestic  policies. He is threatening to extort the Mexican Government to pay for  an offensive and ineffective wall on America's southern border. He has  repeatedly questioned NATO, the fundamental alliance that has secured  peace between major powers since World War II. He is threatening to  slash funding for the United Nations, including the World Health  Organization, which fights global pandemics.   While addressing employees of the Central Intelligence Agency,  standing in front of a wall honoring professionals who have made the  ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms, President Trump threatened to take  Iraq's oil--that he wanted to take another look at taking Iraq's oil-- and he said: ``To the victor go the spoils.'' This is a line attributed  to Julius Caesar, who decreed himself Emperor. He began rattling the  saber with China before he was sworn in.   The President has done all of this while repeatedly praising Vladimir  Putin as a strong leader and proposing to improve relations there,  while making them worse nearly everywhere else.   This weekend, he closed America's doors to Muslim refugees trying to  escape the very evil our government is fighting against. He not only  closed the doors to people who believe in our democratic institutions  and the freedoms we enjoy, he closed the doors to people who have  risked their lives in service of our ideals.   These are not normal changes in foreign policy between  administrations. I would change many aspects of U.S. foreign policy if  I could. But President Trump's approach to foreign policy so far is one  of reckless change that is frankly scaring the American public and our  allies around the world. In such a foreign policy environment, we need  experienced, skilled hands, people who understand these allies and who  understand our longstanding alliances and why we have them. But the  President has fired all U.S. Ambassadors, and most high-level State  Department employees have resigned or been forced out.   Mr. Tillerson, there is no doubt, is a talented businessman. He loves  his country. He has devoted himself to other worthy causes, like the  Boy Scouts. It is no exaggeration to say that the post-World War II  international order is under attack by the President, endangering U.S.  leadership in the world. As a result, our national security and place  in the world are threatened like never before. During such tenuous  times, we need a leader as our chief diplomat who is prepared to take  the reins and calm the waters. But I do not have confidence that Mr.  Tillerson has the experience, knowledge, values, or temperament to  stand up to the President, to be a voice of reason, or to moderate the  President's extreme views and actions. For these reasons, I oppose Mr.  Tillerson's confirmation as Secretary of State, and I urge my fellow  Members, including those who claimed the mantle of President Reagan, to  do the same.  [[Page S523]]    I know my good friend Senator Markey, a member of the Foreign  Relations Committee, is here on the floor, as well as Senator Coons,  another member of the committee, and I think both of them will speak on  the Tillerson nomination.   I yield to the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Coons.
