 Mr. President, today, May 14, 2023, I want to  recognize our great friend and ally, Israel, on the 75th anniversary of  its independence. Israel's everlasting commitment to freedom and  democracy serves as a beacon of light to freedom-loving people around  the world. I am proud to support the expansion and solidifying of the  Abraham Accords, to encourage normalized relations with Israel,  economic prosperity, and safety for all citizens in the region. The  United States and Israel share a unique bilateral relationship, and I  look forward to many more years of a flourishing friendship between our  two countries.                            ____________________
