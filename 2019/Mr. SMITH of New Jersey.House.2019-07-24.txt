 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Dr.  Burgess.   Mr. Speaker, the Autism CARES Act of 2019, I say to my colleagues, is  a comprehensive reauthorization and strengthening of America's whole- of-government autism spectrum disorder initiative.   As the prime author of the bill, let me extend very special thanks to  cosponsor Mike Doyle from Pennsylvania for his extraordinary  leadership, his partnership, and his friendship over these many years;  to Health Subcommittee Chairwoman Anna Eshoo for expertly shepherding  this bill through her subcommittee with Ranking Member Dr. Burgess; and  my deep  [[Page H7306]]  gratitude to the full committee Chair Frank Pallone and Ranking Member  Greg Walden.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank staff, including Kelsey Griswold, Kate  Werley, Rachel Fybel, Dr. Kristen Shatynski, and Stephen Holland, for  their tremendous help and assistance on this legislation.   Frankly, we couldn't have done this without so many autism advocates,  including and especially Stuart Spielman of Autism Speaks and Scott  Badesch of the Autism Society.   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legislation powerfully supports and  pursues durable remedies and effective interventions for the  approximately 1.5 million children with ASD. That is an estimated 1 in  59 children in the U.S. In my home State of New Jersey, that is 1 in  34. We do have the highest rate, according to the CDC.   This bill also helps adults with autism who were and are today often  misdiagnosed, underdiagnosed, and overlooked. Language throughout the  bill emphasizes that causes, diagnosis, detection, prevention, and  treatment of autism spectrum disorder must be throughout the lifespan  of that person.   According to Drexel University's autism center--and this is a very  important number--in our last bill that the gentleman, Mike Doyle, and  I did just 5 years ago, it pointed out that the number of young people  who become adults is increasing every year. Now, it is about 50,000 to  60,000 children who age out every year, creating challenges for  education, housing, employment, and access to healthcare.   This legislation also assists parents, families, and caregivers who  deeply love and cherish their children and want the brightest future  for them. In addition to its groundbreaking prevalence studies and  crafting a whole myriad of intervention work, CDC's ``Learn the Signs.  Act Early.'' program is just one more amazing tool for parents.   At its core, the bill authorizes a little over $1.8 billion over 5  years for NIH, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and  HRSA.   Looking back, Mr. Speaker, it was two dedicated parents from New  Jersey who helped launch the comprehensive Federal policy we are now  reauthorizing. In September 1997, Bobbi and Billy Gallagher of Brick,  New Jersey, my constituents, parents of two constituent autistic  children, walked into my Ocean County office looking for help.   They believed that Brick had a disproportionate number of students  with autism and wanted action, especially for their son Austin and  daughter Alana.   I invited the CDC, the ATSDR, and other Federal agencies to Brick for  an investigation, only to learn when they did the study that prevalence  rates were high in other communities as well.   Believing we had a serious spike in prevalence everywhere, I  introduced the ASSURE Act, cosponsored by 199 Members, which was  incorporated as title I of the Children's Health Act of 2000.   Progress, Mr. Speaker, has been made over the many years,  particularly in the area of looking at risk factors, but also the  overwhelming importance of early intervention.   Mr. Speaker, as my colleagues have pointed out, this legislation  reauthorizes and expands the interagency coordinating committee, or  IACC, managed so effectively and professionally by Dr. Susan Daniels,  the director of the Office of Autism Research Coordination.   Speaking to this, the Director of the National Institute of Mental  Health, Dr. Joshua Gordon, said yesterday:         The National Institutes of Health is proud to work hand-in-      hand with the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee to       ensure the coordination of research efforts focusing on       critical topics related to autism, such as developing early       detection and screening tools, understanding the genetic and       biological underpinnings of autism, and developing and       testing the effectiveness of services and supports to improve       functional and health outcomes of individuals with autism.    As my colleague, Mr. Doyle, said a moment ago, we have expanded IACC.  The Departments of Labor, Justice, Veterans Affairs, and HUD are now  part of it, and there has been an expansion from two to three members  for self-advocates, parents, legal guardians, and advocates.   Let me remind Members, and I encourage them even to go online and  check this out.    Mr. Speaker, IACC has a strategic plan that  is updated every year, so there is no duplication of efforts. They ask  several essential questions, and all the research revolves around  trying to find answers to those seven questions.   HRSA is all about helping the geographically isolated and  economically or medically vulnerable. There are 52 Leadership Education  in Neurodevelopmental and Other Related Disabilities, or LEND, training  programs and 10 developmental-behavioral pediatric training programs.   They are reauthorized, and we have one at Rutgers right in my home  State. They are doing an amazing job. There are 38 organizations that  support this, and I hope all Members will support it as well.   Mr. Speaker, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is ``a  neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent impairments in  social communication and social interaction, as well as restricted and  repetitive patterns of behavior, leading to difficulty in developing,  maintaining and understanding relationships with others.''   As Autism Speaks notes ``it is often accompanied by sensory  sensitivities and medical issues such as gastrointestinal (GI)  disorders, seizures or sleep disorders, as well as mental health  challenges such as anxiety, depression and attention issues.''   The Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education and  Support Act--or simply the Autism CARES Act of 2019--is a comprehensive  reauthorization and strengthening of America's whole-of-government  Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) initiative.   As prime author of the bill let me extend special thanks to cosponsor  Mike Doyle of Pennsylvania for his extraordinary leadership,  partnership and friendship and to the Chairwoman of the Health  subcommittee Anna Eshoo for expertly shepherding this through the  committee with ranking member Dr. Michael Burgess and my deep gratitude  to full committee chair Frank Pallone and ranking member Greg Walden.   I also want to thank staff including Kelsey Griswold, Kate Werley,  Rachel Fybel, Dr. Kristen Shatynski, and Stephen Holland for their  tremendous help and assistance.   And frankly, we couldn't have done this without so many autism  advocates especially Stuart Spielman of Autism Speaks and Scott Badesch  of Autism Society.   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan, bicameral legislation powerfully  supports and pursues durable remedies and effective interventions for  the approximately 1.5 million children with ASD,--that is an estimated  1 in 59 children in the United States, in my home State of New Jersey,  1 in 34 children, the highest rate in the CDC study.   This bill also helps adults with autism who were and are today often  misdiagnosed, underdiagnosed and overlooked. Language throughout the  bill emphasizes that causes, diagnosis, detection, prevention and  treatment of autism spectrum disorder must be throughout the lifespan  of a person.   According to Drexel University's AJ Drexel Autism Center, about fifty  to sixty thousand children ``age out'' to adulthood each year creating  challenges for education, housing, employment and access to health  care. Autism CARES of 2019 continues the work on aging out begun under  the Autism CARES Act of 2014.   The Autism CARES Act of 2019 assists the parents, families and  caregivers who deeply love and cherish children with ASD and want the  brightest future possible for them. In addition to its groundbreaking  prevalence studies and early intervention work, CDC's Learn the Signs.  Act Early is an amazing tool for parents.   The legislation also robustly supports the dedicated physicians,  scientists and support teams who daily strive to treat, research and  provide meaningful answers.   The Autism CARES Act of 2019 authorizes a little over $1.8 billion  over five years for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Health  Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).   Looking back, Mr. Speaker, it was two dedicated parents from New  Jersey who helped launch the comprehensive Federal policy we seek to  reauthorize today.   In September of 1997, Bobbie and Billy Gallagher of Brick, New  Jersey--parents of two small autistic children--walked into my Ocean  County office looking for help.   They believed Brick had a disproportionate number of students with  autism and wanted  [[Page H7307]]  action, especially for their son Austin and daughter Alana, so I  invited the CDC, ATSDR and other Federal agencies to Brick for an  investigation, only to learn that prevalence rates were high not only  in Brick, but in nearby communities as well.   Believing we had a serious spike in prevalence, I introduced the  ASSURE Act, cosponsored by 199 members, which was incorporated as title  I of the Children's Health Act of 2000.   Mr. Speaker, much progress has been made since. Today, the evidence  suggests there is no single cause of autism or type. Genetic risk,  coupled with environmental factors, including advanced parental age,  low birth weight, and prematurity--among other factors--may be  triggers. Other studies have identified ASD risk factors including  pesticides, air pollutants, dietary factors.   Early intervention is making a major positive impact in the lives of  children with ASD but parents need more support. In 2016, Bobbi  Gallagher wrote a book: A Brick Wall--How a Boy with No Words Spoke to  the World. In this highly personal, extraordinarily moving must read  account of raising two children with autism, Bobbi writes: ``This mom  thing is hard.''   Mr. Speaker, Autism CARES Act of 2019 ensures that the federal  government continues to help hundreds of thousands of parents like the  Gallaghers--funding research and support programs and sharing best  practices. The bill reauthorizes and expands the lnteragency  Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) managed so effectively and  professionally by Dr. Susan Daniels, Director of the Office of Autism  Research Coordination (OARC).    Coordination is key to maximizing outcomes. The Director of the  National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) Dr. Joshua Gordon--who also  serves as IACC chair said yesterday:   ``The National Institutes of Health is proud to work hand-in-hand  with the lnteragency Autism Coordinating Committee to ensure the  coordination of research efforts focusing on critical topics related to  autism, such as developing early detection and screening tools,  understanding the genetic and biological underpinnings of autism, and  developing and testing the effectiveness of services and supports to  improve functional and health outcomes of individuals with autism.''   New members of IACC added by our new bill are representatives from  the Departments of Labor, Justice, Veterans Affairs and Housing and  Urban Development as well as raising from two to three members who are  self-advocates, parents or legal guardians and advocacy/service  organizations.   IACC not only includes a cross section of knowledgeable stakeholders,  but periodically develops the IACC Strategic Plan for ASD and most  recently the 2018 update.   The IACC strategic plan asks the seven most essential questions and  helps steer research projects and resources to find answers including:  How can I recognize the signs of ASD, and why is early detection so  important?; What is the biology underlying ASD?; What causes ASD, and  can disabling aspects of ASD be prevented or preempted?; Which  treatments and interventions will help?; What kinds of services and  supports are needed to maximize quality of life for people on the  Autism spectrum?; How can we meet the needs of people with ASD as they  progress into and through adulthood?; and How do we continue to build,  expand, and enhance the infrastructure system to meet the needs of the  ASD community?   Also, each year since 2007, IACC has published a Summary of Advances  in Autism Spectrum Disorder Research.   Dr. Ann Wagner does an extraordinary job as National Autism  Coordinator--created by Autism CARES Act of 2014--ensuring the  implementation of national autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research,  services, and support activities across federal agencies.   As my colleagues know, the Health Resources and Services  Administration (HRSA) is the ``primary federal agency for improving  healthcare to people who are geographically isolated, economically or  medically vulnerable.'' The work begun under Autism CARES Act of 2014  continues and is expanded with this legislation including the training  of health care professionals ``to provide screening, diagnostic and  early, evidence-based intervention services . . . ''. This includes the  52 Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental and other Related  Disabilities (LEND) training programs like the one at Rutgers in my  state and 10 Developmental-Behavior Pediatric (DBP) training programs.   The HHS Secretary is empowered by the new legislation to prioritize  DBP grants to ``rural and underserved areas.''   According to the April 2019 Report to Congress, most children who  have autism are not diagnosed until after they reach age 4 years--or  later--even though many children can be identified before age 2 years.  Recent studies supported by NIH have uncovered distinct differences in  the brain development of children with ASD, as early as 6 months. The  earlier ASD is found, the earlier interventions can begin.   Finally, not later than 2 years after enactment, the Autism CARES Act  requires a comprehensive report on the demographic factors associated  with the health and well-being of individuals with ASD, recommendations  on establishing best practices to ensure interdisciplinary  coordination, improvements for health outcomes, community based  behavioral support and interventions, nutrition and recreational and  social activities, personal safety and more.   Mr. Speaker, more than three dozen major organizations have helped  shape this legislation and strongly support passage including: Autism  Society of America, Autism Speaks, Autism New Jersey, American Academy  of Neurology, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Association on  Health and Disability, American Psychological Association, American  Therapeutic Recreation Association, Association of Maternal & Child  Health Programs, Association of Special Children and Families,  Association of University Centers on Disability, Autism Science  Foundation, Children's Hospital Association, Council on Exceptional  Children, Easterseals, EveryLife Foundation, Family Voices, Family  Voices New Jersey, Family Voices North Dakota, Lakeshore Foundation,  Madison House Autism Foundation, Maine Parent Federation, Marcus Autism  Center, National Alliance on Mental Illness, National Association of  Councils on Developmental Disabilities, National Association of  Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, National Association of State Directors  of Developmental Disabilities Services, National Center for Learning  Disabilities, National Council on Severe Autism, National Down Syndrome  Congress, National Down Syndrome Society, National Fragile X  Foundation, Network of Jewish Human Service Agencies, SPAN Parent  Advocacy Network, TASH, The Independence Center, The Jewish Federations  of North America, Thompson Center for Autism & Neurodevelopmental  Disorders.
