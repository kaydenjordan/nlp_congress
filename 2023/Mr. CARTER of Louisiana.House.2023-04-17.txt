 Mr. Speaker, I thank my esteemed colleagues,  Congresswoman Cherfilus-  [[Page H1749]]  McCormick from Florida and Representative Jackson from Illinois, for  their leadership, their commitment, and for allowing us to have this  opportunity to speak on such an important, important measure.   I was outraged by what we all witnessed in Tennessee at the beginning  of April. Following the tragic mass shooting at The Covenant School,  the Republican majority in the State legislature chose to avoid passing  any meaningful gun reform or even having any meaningful discussion  about gun reform. Instead, they sought to thwart democracy and to  silence the critics who stood with the community and who demanded  action. Prayers are wonderful. I subscribe to them daily. Well-wishing  is a wonderful thing, and it make us feel good. That alone without  action is not enough.   We as elected officials are sworn to a task and to a duty to serve  and to provide. In Tennessee that day, we failed the people of  Tennessee. We failed the people of America. Instead of action, they  expelled two Black American members of the Democratic Caucus who stood  with parents, teachers, and students to demand action and to speak  truth to power about the reality of gun violence.   This was an attack on our democracy, and all of us, Republican,  Democrat, and other, should be outraged with such an attack on  democracy because this issue today may have been an issue that the  majority ruling party didn't like.   What happens tomorrow when we unilaterally seek to silence the voices  of duly elected people in a democratic society?   Stop and think about that for a second. Stop and think about it. Stop  and think about the threat to our democracy. The cornerstone and the  pillar of our society is freedom of speech, freedom of expression, and  the ability to disagree and to have meaningful discourse. That is what  we all ran on. That is what the mighty Constitution protects.   Yet, in Tennessee that was ignored. It was ignored. It was defiled.  Everyone, of every race and party, should find disdain and pain with  that kind of treatment in the democratic process.    In the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, four Members of the House,  James Lewis, John Willis Menard, P.B.S. Pinchback, and Josiah Thomas  Walls, were wrongly denied the right to take their seats.   These egregious actions in Tennessee show us that the fight for Black  representation in the United States is still an ongoing battle.   Our democracy is built on the freedom of speech and the freedom to  protest. To expel elected representatives for standing with their  neighbors after an horrific act of gun violence against children is  appalling. I am enraged that it was two Black lawmakers who were  expelled.   Black people in the United States have historically been vilified for  speaking up. We have been beaten. We have been attacked by dogs. We  have been hosed with powerful water hoses. We have been hanged from  trees. Yet, in 2023, two duly elected members of a State legislature  were unilaterally dismissed and removed from service for standing up  with the people. There were no guns. There were no spears. There were  no choke holds. There was no fighting. There was no profanity. There  were no broken windows or broken arms. It was mere words--mere words-- that defended the Constitution of our land and that defended the people  to protest against something as egregious as the death of children. And  we say we don't need to do anything with gun control?   You can't find one thing, Mr. Speaker?   Can we find any one thing that we can come together on that would  suggest that we hear the pain? We hear the cries? We see the eyes of  Black and White mothers and fathers who will never see their children  again?   Yet, we continue to find a comfortable place in the shade and hide  behind rhetoric.   The time has come for us to do something, to act, to move, and to  show the American people that we will not continue to sit back and  watch senseless killings on our streets. Look at the statistics. We  have more mass murders in a year than we have days in this year.   Doesn't that mean anything?   Doesn't that cause you to cringe and say no more?   Black, White, Republican, and Democratic, there are lots of things  that we can agree to disagree on. Public safety should not be one of  them, particularly when it comes to standing up for our young people.   Today, Mr. Speaker, we send a promise of action, and we ask you to  join us in delivering on that promise of action.   Today I stand for justice. Today I stand with the Justins. Today I  stand with the Tennessee Three. Today and every day I invite you, Mr.  Speaker, to join me and others in supporting the bare principle of  democracy and protecting its people.                                time  2030    Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is  remaining.
