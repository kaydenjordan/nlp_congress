 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the  extraordinary life of Rochester's own Pete DuPre, fondly known as  Harmonica Pete, who died peacefully at the venerable age of 98 earlier  this year.   Harmonica Pete served our Nation as a combat medic during World War  II. When he returned home, he began volunteering with the Greatest  Generation Foundation, playing the harmonica for veterans groups.   His heartfelt rendition of ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' onboard the  USS Arizona and his performance before the U.S. Women's National Soccer  Team in 2019 turned Harmonica Pete into a worldwide viral sensation.   He chose to heal our Nation's veterans through music and brought joy  to all who knew him.   Pete once said, ``History books fade, and so do we,'' but his memory  will never fade from our hearts and minds.   May you rest in peace, Harmonica Pete.
