 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, all postcloture time on the House message to  accompany S. 139 expire at 12:15 p.m. on Thursday, January 18.    Mr. President, a few days ago, our Nation stopped and  remembered Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. It is entirely appropriate for  us to do so. It is a holiday set aside to be able not only to remember  but to reflect and try to figure out: Where are we now?   This year is especially significant. Fifty years ago this year, Dr.  King was assassinated in April 1968. A lot of things have changed in  that time period. Quite frankly, as a nation, we have learned a lot  about race. We no longer as a nation talk about three-fifths of a man  anymore--rightfully so, and we are appalled by our history in that. We  no longer have separate water fountains set up in restaurants or tell  certain people because of their background, their family, or their skin  color that they can take food to go but they can't come in and sit  down.   We have come a long way in hiring. We have come a long way in just  our communities and our schools. The work is not done. We still have a  long way to go, quite frankly.   Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was bold enough to be able to challenge  the church first, then the Nation, and then the world that we have an  issue around the issue of race. He was going to challenge us to  confront it--rightfully so. He challenged us on the issue of racial  justice, on poverty, on education, but he also challenged us on the way  that we speak out on issues, and I think we lose track of that as a  culture.   Quite frankly, as a Senate and as a Nation, we are losing track of  one of the things Dr. Martin Luther King challenged us on: There is a  right way to confront issues and a wrong way to confront issues. Dr.  King did something revolutionary. He pushed a community to confront  injustice the right way, and he won.   He made radical statements like this:         Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.       Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.    Dr. King said:         I have decided to stick with love. Hate is too great a       burden to bear. Love is the only force capable of       transforming an enemy into a friend.    For whatever reason, we lose track of Dr. King's statements about  ``love is a powerful thing.'' We start as a culture responding with  hate to respond to hate. When someone says something hateful, we  respond back with something more hateful back at them. It doesn't  actually solve anything, and we lose the great model that he really set  for us in that.   If we want to make enemies friends, only love can do that, only  relationships can do that, only pressing a friend to do the right thing  can do that. Now, is that happening in our culture? No. It is in spots,  but it is not hard to go on any of our social media sites at any moment  and be able to see the challenge in our social media sites, where it is  not love driving out hate. It is hate attacking hate.   It is remarkable to me. I just glanced at some of the things just of  late as I was preparing for this conversation. I look backward at a few  of the posts that are on my own social media sites--controversial  statements that I made, like, on the 1st when I did a post that just  said ``Happy New Year.'' It was a stinging controversial post that was  responded to by someone saying: Loser. Liar. Traitor. How much money  did you take from Russia, comrade?   That was to my statement of ``Happy New Year.''   I made a statement about how kids who came in under DACA should be  treated differently. These are kids who didn't break the law. These are  kids who are like the 4-year old riding in the backseat of the car when  their parent was speeding. When the parent is pulled over, they don't  give the kid a ticket. I made just a quick post about that, and the  response to that, among many, was this: What is with his hair color?  Dude, get it done professionally. You look terrible.   I just have to say to you: Dude, this is done by a professional. God  gave me this hair color, and so there is no bottle involved in this  one. It is His work, and I would call Him a pro.   There is all of this talk back and forth about where we are going to  go as a culture, and we are losing Dr. King's legacy that hate doesn't  drive out hate, that only love does that.   Now, there is a lot of conversation in this body, as well, saying  things have never been worse in the Senate and in Congress. I would  disagree. Just after Vice President Burr left office, he challenged the  Secretary of the Treasury to a duel where he shot the Secretary of the  Treasury dead in a duel. In 1850, in the Chamber just right down the  hallway here, in what is called the Old Senate Chamber, they were  working on a compromise and Senator Foote and Senator Benton were in an  argument, and so Senator Foote reached into his desk in the middle of  the argument and pulled out his pistol while screaming at Senator  Benton, to which Senator Benton jumped on one of the desks that is in  this room still today. He jumped on the desk and pulled open his coat,  revealing: I don't have a weapon. Shoot me. Shoot me. That was on the  Senate floor, and they wrestled Senator Foote to the floor and took his  gun away from him.   People can say it has never been worse. I can assure you it has been  worse. But what we do have responsibility for is in our time and  setting the tone for difficult debate in this moment.   The arguments that happen on the Senate floor and the violence on  this  [[Page S246]]  Senator floor, including Senator Sumner being almost beaten to death  with a cane just before the Civil War, set a path into the Civil War  for the Nation. What is the path we are taking the Nation on right now  in our debate?   As a nation, I have a simple reminder that is not mine. It is from a  powerful American leader named Dr. King, who said: ``Hate does not  drive out hate.'' For anyone who is looking at what is happening in our  culture and in politics right now saying ``if only I say something more  hateful than the last guy, this will get better,'' you have missed his  point.   Dr. King was deeply moved by Scripture, and there are multiple  examples of it in his writings and in his speeches. He quoted passages  over and over again, like from 1 John, Chapter 4: ``Dear friends, since  God so loved us, we also ought to love one another''; Psalm 34: ``Taste  and see that the Lord is good.'' Over and over again, he came back to  Scripture as just a simple reminder that things can be different for  us.   He challenged the church at moments, like in his letter from  Birmingham jail, and he challenged culture. In fact, we lose track of  the fact that during the civil rights movement, Dr. King was working  with both parties to establish platforms for both parties that would  respect the dignity of all Americans. It is a good path that has been  set for us. In the middle of our conversation about Dr. King, I would  hope that we would remember it.   Let me make one quick side note, as well. It is kind of a fun note  for those of us from Oklahoma. The story of Dr. King, as many people  may know, almost didn't happen the way that it did. In 1953, just  finishing up seminary and in the middle of his doctoral work, when he  was just Martin Luther King, not Dr. Martin Luther King yet--he was  still doing his doctoral work at Boston University. He came to a small  church in Oklahoma City that was well respected in the civil rights  movement--Calvary Baptist Church. In fact, in 1952, Calvary Baptist  Church hosted the national conference of the NAACP and had Thurgood  Marshall there as a speaker. In 1953, Dr. King was interviewed there to  be one of the pastors at Calvary Baptist Church. The elders in the  church heard him, read about him, met him, and then turned him down.  This is my favorite quote from one of the elders of the church. They  said they didn't think he had enough gravy on him yet. He was too  young, not experienced enough. That was in 1953. Ten years later, he  was standing on the Mall right down the street saying ``I have a  dream,'' leading the entire country.   I say that to say that sometimes we have this assumption that we are  in control. We are not. God is in control. He has a path and a plan.  Sometimes when we hear no and when we hear hard things, we find out He  has a path and plan that may look different from ours.   I would only challenge us as a body to do the right thing the right  way and to see where that takes us. As it says in Psalm 34, ``Taste and  see that the Lord is good.'' Do it the right way, and let's see how  this works out together.   It is a simple reminder and a simple admonition to a body that could  use some words from Dr. King and see if we can put them into practice  together.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
