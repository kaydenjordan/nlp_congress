 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2339. While I don't doubt  the majority's sincere interest in reducing nicotine use among minors,  this bill is a premature and poorly thought-out attempt to do so.   Instead of building on bipartisan efforts to address teenage smoking,  such as raising the age to purchase tobacco to 21, H.R. 2339 broadly  overreaches and contains provisions that would unacceptably restrict  the choice of adult consumers. It would have a negligible impact on  teenage tobacco use and, instead, could actually increase the use of  illicit and more dangerous tobacco products.   As my colleagues have pointed out this morning, most on the other  side of the aisle favor legalizing marijuana, which has proven to be  harmful and leads to worse drugs, but will vote for this bad bill. If  one is concerned about teenagers, don't push marijuana.   This bill does nothing to address the actual injuries we do see from  vaping products, which are typically associated with illegal THC vapor  products and not the products covered under H.R. 2339.   This is a bad bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
