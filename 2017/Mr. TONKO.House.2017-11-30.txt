 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey, our  ranker, who has done great work on this bill, for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today represents what we can  accomplish when we work together for the good of our local communities.   My district includes the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers.  These rivers were at the heart of our Nation's early industrialization.  Along the river banks, factories manufactured carpets, collars, leather  goods, and many other products.   Many of those manufacturers have since left these mill towns, but the  legacy of contaminated land continues, and many of those sites remain  vacant. The contamination, or the perception of contamination, makes  developers avoid investing in these very important parcels and  properties. Assessing and remediating these sites is critical for  environmental revitalization and economic redevelopment.   The Brownfields Enhancement, Economic Redevelopment, and  Reauthorization Act would improve an already successful EPA program.  This legislation would reauthorize EPA's brownfields program, which  expired in 2006. This would extend the program through 2022.   Since 2002, with EPA's support, tens of thousands of acres of idle  land have been made ready for productive use, increasing nearby  property values and helping to preserve greenfields. These properties  have been brought back onto local tax rolls, helping to support local  economic development. In the process, more than 130,000 jobs have been  created and some $24 billion has been leveraged from this Federal  investment.   Local governments are realizing that, through this program, we can  turn a liability into a golden opportunity; but, unfortunately, there  are many more sites yet to be assessed or remediated.   More than 450,000 brownfields exist across our great country. Many of  the easiest, low-hanging fruit sites have already been cleaned up. The  more difficult ones will require more funding. In recognition of this,  the bill increases the maximum individual grant from $200,000 to  $500,000, which will enable more complex sites to be remediated.   The bill creates multipurpose grants, enables nonprofits to receive  grants, allows a small portion of grants to be used to cover  administrative costs, and makes certain publically owned sites eligible  for funding. These are important improvements to the program, supported  by a wide array of stakeholders.   Strengthening EPA's brownfields program will continue to create jobs,  remediate contaminated land, and promote sustainable economic  development. It is also a key factor in creating aesthetics for  neighboring parcels, thereby enhancing the entire regional aspect of  certain given regions across our communities. This reauthorization will  give communities the resources, the capacity, and, indeed, the  flexibility to turn more liabilities into opportunities.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the members of the majority, including Mr.  McKinley; Chairman Shimkus, who is the Environment Subcommittee chair;  and Chairman Walden, who is the Energy and Commerce chair; as well as  our colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for  working with us to produce this bipartisan bill, a golden opportunity  for us to come together, work together, and accomplish.    Finally, I want to thank the efforts of our Energy and Commerce  ranker, Representative Frank Pallone. It was his great work that helped  us get here also.   I want to also acknowledge the tremendous work done by staff on both  sides of the aisle. In particular, let me please recognize the efforts  of Jackie Cohen, Rick Kessler, and Jeff Carroll, along with other  members of the Energy and Commerce minority staff who worked so  diligently on behalf of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the life of Maurice  Hinchey, a beloved friend and an awesome colleague.   I entered into the New York State Assembly when he was the  environmental conservation chair for the New York State Assembly. I  witnessed his fight to expose toxic contamination of Love Canal where  he worked against illegal waste dumping by organized crime. I watched  as he worked so hard to protect the Catskills and the Adirondacks from  acid rain. It was there that I witnessed his integrity, his intellect,  his compassion, and his passion to make a difference.   Then he came to Washington to serve this Nation. He worked hard to  establish the Hudson River Valley Greenway. He worked hard to fight  against PCB contamination of the Hudson River. He made certain that  hydrofracking would not destroy our environment. He made certain that  he spoke out against the Iraq war and spoke out against NAFTA and the  damage it could do to American jobs.   This was a person who was principled. He acted with those principles  with every fiber of his being. Today I want to recognize that person,  our voice for the environment, a principled individual that the late  Governor Mario Cuomo called the environmental conscience of New York  State.   I extend my deepest condolences to his wife, Ilene Marder Hinchey;  and his children, Reese, Josef, and Michelle.   I know that, in the last year of his life, Maurice and his family  worked to raise awareness for frontotemporal degeneration. I am hoping  that their fight will continue so that others impacted by this disease  will be able to conquer that situation.   Maurice, rest in peace. You are a champion.   We don't live in a perfect world, perhaps we never will. But those  who are disadvantaged and those who are in need will need a champion.  That champion was Maurice Hinchey, and he will continue to inspire.  [[Page H9563]]                                ____________________
