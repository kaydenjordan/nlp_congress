 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2959, the Supplemental  Impact Aid Flexibility Act. This bill would allow school districts  participating in the Impact Aid program to use previously reported  student headcounts on their Impact Aid applications for the 2022-2023  school year.   Impact Aid supplements funding for schools and students in areas that  collect less in local property taxes due to the Federal Government's  presence. School districts that receive Impact Aid payments include  those with military bases, Indian reservations, and Federal low-income  housing in or near the school district.   The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a big toll on school districts and  communities across the country. It is especially difficult for  federally impacted school districts to calculate headcounts due to  fluctuations during the pandemic.   Headcounts determine how much aid more than 1,000 federally impacted  school districts receive. That aid helps pay for staff salaries,  bussing, technology, and other educational supports and services for  students. This bill ensures the Impact Aid recipients will not be  affected negatively by the pandemic and temporary falling enrollment  that have resulted. This frees up valuable time and resources to help  students, while schools maintain a reliable source of funding as they  address the academic, social, emotional, and safety needs of the  students.   This bill will have no impact on government spending because Impact  Aid is a discretionary program, and its funding level is established  through the annual appropriations process.   The trade association for Impact Aid school districts, the National  Association for Federally Impacted Schools, is strongly supportive of  this bill.   This bill is similar to the one signed into law by President Trump on  December 4, 2020.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 2959, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Wilson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The Supplemental Impact Aid Flexibility Act ensures that students and  schools relying on Impact Aid will not be affected negatively by the  pandemic.   Specifically, the bill allows schools to use their previously  reported headcounts so that services students rely on will continue.  This frees up administrators to use their valuable time and resources  addressing the educational needs of the students.   Students in over 1,000 federally impacted districts deserve the  resources they receive from the Impact Aid program. This aid helps pay  for a wide range of services that students rely on from bussing and  technology to educational support services.   I encourage my colleagues to support S. 2959, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  1800
