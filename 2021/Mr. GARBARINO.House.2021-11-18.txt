 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this so-called  reconciliation bill. This Build Back Better bill is nothing more than a  sham to push far radical progressive policies on America, policies that  America doesn't want and doesn't need. This will be the largest  spending bill in our Nation's history, the largest tax increase in our  Nation's history, and it is going to fall on the backs of middle-income  and low-income families.   And for what, Madam Speaker?   A massive government takeover with 150 new programs when we can't  even work the programs we have now well. It would grant amnesty to 7  million illegal immigrants and put billions into the Green New Deal.   How do they plan to pay for it, Madam Speaker?   By weaponizing the IRS to go after small businesses and families. But  that won't be enough because of the price tag of this bill.   It will explode our national debt and my grandchildren will have to  pay for this.   This socialist spending spree is a bad bill. It is bad for Long  Island; it is bad for the Nation. I urge all of my colleagues to vote  against it.                                time  1045
