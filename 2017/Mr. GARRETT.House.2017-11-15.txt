 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, the last time this Nation passed major tax reform,  yours truly weighed 112 pounds at the beginning of wrestling season. I  had a full head of hair, I never set foot west of Mississippi, nor  outside the United States of America.   Madam Speaker, the last time this country addressed tax reform, the  Soviet Union was welcoming a new leader  [[Page H9363]]  named Mikhail Gorbachev. It has been too long.   It is an honor to represent the Fifth District of Virginia because I  think it is historically unique. I have spoken from this podium and  this floor about the amazing characteristics of that particular  historical region.   Among the great individuals from the Fifth District of Virginia was a  flawed man, an imperfect man, a slaveowner named Jefferson, who gave us  a near-perfect document, named the ``Declaration of Independence.''   While not perfect, Jefferson had perfect insight, and, perhaps, you  could argue he was prescient when it is said that he said: ``I predict  future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from  wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of  them.''   It has been enlightening tonight to stand on this floor. If you are  watching at home, I suppose that you can turn the volume down on C- SPAN, because I don't intend to yell, as so many others have before me.  And I will tell you that it is funny to listen to my colleagues across  the aisle who say: This is a 429-page bill.   I would point out that saying the number of pages doesn't actually  make the bill longer and that the Affordable Care Act, that they had us  pass, so that we could find out what was in it, was 2,300 pages with  over 20,000 pages of regulation. So there is a little disingenuity, at  the very least, for them to lament the first real overhaul in our  draconian tax structure in nearly two generations by suggesting that  429 pages is a long document, when such a hearty and robust undertaking  is afoot.   Madam Speaker, I would submit that the government needs the people  and not the other way around. That is what makes us the United States  of America.   It is a clever ploy to attack the rich and the job creators, but let  me point out the fact that 97.3 percent of taxes are paid by the top 50  percent of wage earners. So, therefore, when you attempt to cut taxes  for working class people, someone who is in the 51st percentile will,  indeed, receive a tax cut, but they are, by no means, rich.   It is a clever ploy to attack corporations, because corporations  don't have faces, but people do.   And who do corporations provide jobs for?   People.   President Obama acknowledged that our corporate tax structure was  among the most backward in the world, and it needed to be addressed,  but he didn't address it. President Obama acknowledged that the  Affordable Care Act had ``real problems,'' but no one on the other side  of the aisle will address them. So, too, did President Clinton. That is  two Presidents from the other side of the aisle in a row, but no one  will address them. Instead, we will create fear and demagoguery and  attack faceless corporations, because faceless corporations don't have  faces, but people do.   We need to stop destroying jobs and opportunity and prosperity  through the demagoguery of class warfare, attacking corporations,  without acknowledging that the very people who benefit from their  existence are the people who have the opportunity to send their  children to college, to make memories on a vacation, to pursue and  achieve dreams, to marry the love of their life with the very incomes  achieved by these corporations.    Now, let's talk a little bit about corporations, because I know  something about corporations, and we know something about corporations  in Virginia's Fifth District.   Dan River Mills stood in Danville, Virginia--a company started in  1881. It closed its doors in 2006. In 2008, the smokestacks from Dan  River Mills that had been a symbol not only of the skyline of that once  thriving town, but also an identifying factor in the landscape of the  city, were torn down as jobs went away.   Another corporation, Burlington Industries, Klopman Mills, in  Pittsylvania County, hurt Virginia, and prospered from 1940 through  2007. When they left, over 1,000 jobs went with them as well. And the  real estate for the property that once employed generation after  generation, sending innumerable children to college, and fulfilling the  humble dreams of working class Virginians, sold for a paltry $750,000.   Vaughan-Bassett Furniture--and I would commend to anyone watching at  home, the book ``Factory Man,'' by Beth Macy, which chronicles John  Bassett, III's struggle to keep 700 furniture jobs in this country, in  my district--that corporation changed people's lives and gave them  jobs.   Lane Manufacturing, for generations it was a tradition--in my part of  the world, at least--that a young woman, prior to being married, might  receive a Lane cedar chest--a hope chest. In fact, no less an  iconoclast than Shirley Temple was used to peddle Lane cedar chests as  something that would be an aspirational goal for a young, working class  woman, as she set forth on pursuing the dreams of her life. From 1902,  until just about 15 or 20 years ago, hundreds and hundreds of jobs, in  Alta Vista, Campbell County, Virginia, left.   Broyhill. So many companies--some still around--all shadows of their  former selves, as corporate money and jobs went offshore.   And why?   Because we have incentivized the departure of the very means by which  our families have prospered and done so in order to vilify an entity  incapable of defending itself, while neglecting to understand that the  beneficiaries of the opportunity created thereby were their very  neighbors and those who, in their demagoguery, they said they worked to  protect.   Last year, in Danville, Virginia, the Goodyear Tire and Rubber  Company, who is still there--God bless them--had a cookout for the  employees of Goodyear Tire, and the family members, thereof, and  anybody who had ever worked for Goodyear Tire. They thought maybe there  would be 800 or 1,000 people who attended this cookout. By the time it  was over with, you couldn't get a pack of hotdog buns from a Food Lion  within 30 miles, because that 1,000 people became 2,000 people, and  became 3,000 people, and became nearly 4,000 people. These people  didn't come to eat a hotdog with Goodyear Tire. They came to eat a  hotdog with their family, their friends, and their community.   I stood last week at Piedmont Precision Machine Company, in Danville  Pittsylvania. I looked at $1.6 million worth of new equipment that  allowed this American small business to continue to compete with  competitors abroad. And the rich man, who owned the company, said: Tom,  I am going to have to take a loan to pay my taxes. But if you pass this  bill, we will make some money, I will get more equipment, and we are  going to hire some more people.   So understand that people don't come to eat hot dogs with Goodyear  Tire and Rubber Company, they come to eat hot dogs with their family  members, their community, and people who have seen generation after  generation receive opportunity, by virtue of their hard work, and  opportunity provided by the very entities vilified by our opponents,  without acknowledging the beneficiaries of the opportunity they provide  are the very ones they purport to protect.   So Piedmont Precision Machine Company toils on. We work to attract  more employers in Danville and Pittsylvania, and Henry County, and  Martinsville area. Maybe Kyocera is going to come. We hope so. We think  that if we get those jobs, we think that we might be able to move  manufacturing jobs in high-tech to southside Virginia from Northern  Virginia and California. But what I am hearing from the job creators is  they want to see this thing get done. And when those jobs come from  California, Northern Virginia, China, and India to Campbell County,  Bedford County, Lunenburg County, and Mecklenburg County, it will be  because we acted in a brave, bold manner, despite the divisive rhetoric  that denies the reality that people benefit from opportunity, and  opportunity is best provided, not by the government, but by people of  initiative.   Now, I have heard so much rhetoric about what you oppose if you  support this tax bill, so let's see if we can't flip that shoe onto the  other foot. If you oppose this bill, you oppose lowering rates for  working and middle-income families, while retaining the highest rate.  That doesn't sound like a tax cut for the rich to me.    If you oppose this bill, you literally oppose doubling nearly the  standard  [[Page H9364]]  deduction from $6,350 to $12,000 for an individual filer; and you  oppose, if you oppose this bill, doubling the standard deduction from  $12,700 to $24,000 for a married couple.   Why would people oppose that? Do they think the government can make  better decisions with the money they earn than they can?   If you oppose this bill, then you oppose simplifying the Tax Code by  eliminating years of carve-out deductions made for special interests.   Quite literally, a convoluted Tax Code benefits who?   Tax attorneys and accountants.   I suppose that the other side of the Chamber is the party that has a  vested interest in keeping tax attorneys and accountants at work. I  want to see people in Mecklenburg County at work.   If you oppose this bill, you oppose establishing a family tax credit;  you oppose raising the child credit by $600 per child; and you oppose  establishing a new credit of $300 per family member so that you might  be able to help your mom, dad, aunt, uncle, or a disabled relative, who  you choose to help in your home.   Why would people oppose that?   If you oppose this bill, you oppose reducing small business taxes to  the lowest rate since the Second World War.   If you oppose this bill, you oppose establishing a super low  nonpercent rate for small startup businesses making less than $75,000 a  year in income.   Why would you oppose startups?   If you oppose this bill, you oppose removing incentives that drive  businesses to take money and jobs overseas. Don't talk to me about  that. We know something about that in Virginia's Fifth.   So, finally, let me submit this: for the folks at home, who are smart  enough to figure this out on their own, if you pay $100 more because a  deduction is eliminated and your taxes are cut by $1,000 or more, as  would be the case for a family of four making $58,000 a year, that is  not a tax increase.                                time  1945    I have never, to my knowledge, other than the United States Army,  worked for anything resembling a corporate entity in my life, but I  know a lot of human beings who have, and I have seen what happens when  we, through our divisive rhetoric, drive them away.   This isn't about corporations. This isn't about the rich. This is  about human beings.   I think it was succinctly summarized, if perhaps by accident, by my  colleague in the other Chamber, Senator Schumer, who said:         It is our research that indicates that if you pass this,       some people's taxes might go up by 2023.    Think hard. What that acknowledges is that between now and then,  people's taxes go down.   While Mr. Jefferson also said that:         The fruits of the working class are safest when the       assembly is not in session.    I would submit that if indeed these problems exist, they should work  with us to improve our Tax Code, which hasn't been touched since I  literally weighed 112 pounds and had a full head of hair, and to start  being part of the solution and stop being part of the problem.   Again, the government depends upon Americans, not Americans upon the  government.
