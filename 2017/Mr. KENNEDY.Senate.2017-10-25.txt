That obstacle I am referring to is our aging national infrastructure:  our roads, our bridges, our airports, our water systems, our sewage  systems, and our waterways that desperately need dredging, especially  in my State.   If our tax plan is going to be pro-growth, then we need to take  advantage of this once-in-a-generation chance to use Federal revenues  to invest meaningfully in our economy. Allow me to explain what I mean  by that. Federal investment in our roads, our bridges, our railways,  and our waterways would be a shot in the arm for the American economy.  It would pay dividends for decades. Companies need good roads and  bridges and shipping channels to transport their products and to ensure  that they aren't sitting in traffic for hours--sometimes it seems like  days--which eats away at profits and raises costs for our people. But  for too long, Washington's spending priorities have been to grow the  Federal bureaucracy instead of growing our capacity for economic  expansion and development through infrastructure upgrades. We know the  result. Our Department of Transportation now estimates that we have a  backlog of construction and repairs that would cost $926 billion to  clear. It would cost nearly a trillion dollars, and that is just the  backlog.   I have a simple solution that I would respectfully suggest to get us  back on track. According to the Congressional Research Service, $2.6  trillion in corporate profits made by American companies are parked  overseas, and some outside estimates say $4 or $5 trillion. This money  is overseas, and it will not be brought back to America as long as our  antiquated corporate tax system is going to charge those American  companies 35 percent in tax just to bring them back.   Congress is already discussing repatriation as a part of the move to  a territorial tax system, which would use a competitive tax rate to  encourage companies to bring their dollars back to the United States  and keep them here and invest them here in American products and  American businesses and American employees.   When tax reform passes--and it will--and we get a one-time surge in  tax revenue as a result of this $3 to $5 trillion being brought back to  the United States, we are going to get only one chance to spend that  money wisely. Instead of blowing those repatriated dollars on an  already bloated Federal bureaucracy, we ought to invest that money  solely and exclusively in desperately needed infrastructure upgrades.  Even a one-time target investment in clearing the industrial backlog  will create jobs and stimulate the economy for decades.   Let's face it, too many of American roads today are axle-breaking  insults to the 21st century. They are holding our economy back.   Let me be clear. We are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars  flowing into infrastructure if we just make good use of those  repatriated dollars. For example, just in my State of Louisiana, this  could mean building a new bridge through Lake Charles. It could mean  widening the interstate in Baton Rouge. It could mean closing the gaps  in I-49 between Lafayette and Shreveport and New Orleans. We have  neglected our highways and bridges for far too long, and this is our  chance to use tax reform to catch up, to boost our international  competitiveness, to lower costs for consumers, and to put our economy  back on track to 3 percent-plus growth, which the American people  expect and deserve.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
