 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor U.S. Navy Captain Dale  Doss of Tallahassee who proudly served his Nation and passed from this  life on December 11.   Captain Doss was flying off the USS Enterprise when he was shot down  during his 54th mission over North Vietnam in 1968. He was held as a  prisoner of war for 1,824 days before being released in March of 1973.   While in the infamous Hanoi Hilton, he formed a close relationship  with former Senator John McCain, communicating with him despite being  tortured for doing so. During the 2 years he spent in solitary  confinement, he never broke faith with his fellow POWs or his country.   Captain Doss retired from the Navy in 1983, but he never stopped  serving. As the director of veteran services in Leon County for 19  years, he was an integral part of our community.   Dale Doss will be remembered for his sacrifices and for his  courageous service to our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in recognizing a true American hero,  Captain Dale Doss.                            ____________________
