 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to  stay in the fight to make sure that we help this President deliver on a  promise that he made years ago.   I am sad that tonight we are here, and we are on a backdrop of a  potential government shutdown; but, really, what it is is more a  function of the fact that we have not done our job like we should have  done already.   The President, many, many months ago, said that he would not sign  another funding bill unless we gave him wall funding. So what did this  House do? It passed a bill to fund the Department of Defense and passed  a short-term CR. And they said: Do you know what? We are going to have  that fight, but we are going to have that fight after the midterms.   Well, Mr. Speaker, it is after the midterms, and we are here with a  number of my colleagues tonight to say that we are ready to fight on  behalf of all the freedom-loving Americans to make sure that we have  secure borders and that never again do we have to worry about  terrorists and drug traffickers coming across our southern borders.   So I have a number of my colleagues tonight, Mr. Speaker, who want to  speak on this to encourage the American people to stand with us in this  fight.   I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to another gentleman from Arizona  (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Jordan).    Mr. Speaker, I couldn't agree with the gentleman more.  It is time that we deliver on behalf of the American people and fulfill  the promises that the President made many months ago.  [[Page H10328]]    Mr. Speaker, I recognize the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce),  someone who has been key in that, who knows this problem better than  most, because he represents a district in New Mexico.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Mexico.   Mr. Speaker, I recognize the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B.  Hice).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, I recognize the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Norman).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I recognize the gentleman from Virginia  (Mr. Griffith), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, I recognize the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Budd), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, I recognize the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, I recognize the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cloud).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Babin).    Mr. Speaker, as I close out this particular Special  Order, I think it is appropriate for us to remind the American people  that there is a bad case of Potomac fever up here in Washington, D.C.  They forget what they promised the American people, yet what they must  do is not forget this time.   Mr. Speaker, we are going to back up the President. If he vetoes this  bill, we will be there. But, more importantly, the American people will  be there. They will be there to support him. Let's build the wall and  make sure that we do our job in Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
