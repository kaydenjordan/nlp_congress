 Mr. President, I agree with what my colleague from  South Dakota and my neighbor has had to say about the issues of the  spending bill.   I would also add that people all around the country are paying the  price right now with rising prices. They are getting hammered at the  grocery store and hammered at the gas station, and every month since  Joe Biden took the oath of office, prices have risen faster than wages.  People are feeling the pain and the bite taken out of their wallets.  Even without the specific raised taxes that the Democrats are  proposing, the American people have already taken a pay cut.   I note that the majority leader has arrived on the floor, so I am  going to delay the remainder of my remarks so he can continue with his  leader time at this point.   I thank the Acting President pro tempore.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  allowed to complete my remarks and then the Senator from Pennsylvania,  Mr. Toomey, be allowed to complete his remarks prior to the scheduled  rollcall vote.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about  what people in Wyoming are seeing every day, and that is rising prices  when they go to the gas station, when they go to the grocery store.  They are paying more and more.   Every month since Joe Biden took the oath of office, prices have been  rising faster than wages. People are feeling the bite in their wallets  of these higher prices. In effect, people all across the country and  certainly in my home State of Wyoming have suffered a paycheck cut  because the money just doesn't go as far. President Biden told us this  wouldn't happen. He actually said inflation was transitory. Well,  President Biden may still believe that. Yet, after 7 months in a row,  it doesn't look transitory to most Americans.   Now, economists have actually revised their expectations of  inflation, and they have revised them in ways that we are going to be  paying higher prices for longer periods of time. They have revised  their expectations about economic growth as well, and they have revised  those downward--inflation up; economic growth down.   Well, on Friday, the Commerce Department said one measure of  inflation has actually hit the highest that it has been in 30 years.  The company Salesforce now estimates that costs for Christmas shopping  will go up by 20 cents for every dollar you would spend on Christmas  presents. The store Dollar Tree has announced that it will start  selling items that cost more than a dollar. We have 10 Dollar Tree  stores in Wyoming. They are a very important part of our communities.  Many people in rural areas rely on dollar stores for their everyday  needs. In Joe Biden's economy, these people are getting hurt the most.   So why is it happening? Well, it is because the money supply hasn't  increased this fast in 75 years.   Last year, Congress spent trillions of dollars to respond to the  worst pandemic in our Nation's history--actually, in a century. With a  Republican majority in the Senate, we passed five relief bills, and  they were all done in a bipartisan, overwhelmingly majority vote. Much  of the money still hasn't been spent.   Then, this January, Democrats took over the White House as well as  the Senate. They got their hands on the Nation's credit card, and they  started swiping it.   In March, the President signed a $2 trillion spending bill that was  supposed to be about coronavirus. Yet only 9 percent of the money  actually went to public health. They cut Republicans out of the  negotiations completely. So much of the new spending went to the  Democrats' favorite groups--to labor unions, to union bosses, to  bankrupted blue States. They put the bill for all of that spending  entirely on the American credit card. The Federal Reserve started  printing money, and prices started going up.   Yet Democrats haven't learned their lesson. They want to keep  spending. Now they want to spend more than twice as much money as they  just spent in March, and they are also asking for the largest tax  increase in 50 years. Tax increases also raise prices.   Last week, the White House Press Secretary made a statement, and, to  me, it was one of the most irrational statements that some business  owners have ever heard. She said: It is ``unfair and absurd'' for  companies to raise prices in response to higher taxes. She  [[Page S6930]]  said it is absurd and unfair for companies to raise prices in response  to higher taxes. Well, it may be unfair, but it certainly is not  absurd; it is basic arithmetic. When the government raises taxes, the  cost of doing business goes up. Companies either have to cut costs or  increase their revenue. When Democrats raise taxes, it means higher  prices, fewer jobs, and in many cases, both.   It is why it is alarming that President Biden wants to raise taxes on  American energy. Energy prices have already gone up. Oil, yesterday,  was at a 7- or an 8-year high. Natural gas prices have doubled this  year. Democrats are now proposing a new fee on natural gas production.  According to one estimate, the new fee would cost our economy $9.1  billion and eliminate 90,000 good-paying American energy jobs. It would  also mean higher energy prices for people trying to heat their homes  and cool their homes. Higher energy prices also mean higher grocery  prices. They mean higher retail prices.   It may be unfair, according to the White House Press Secretary, but  it is not absurd because prices are rising for a reason. They are  rising because Democrats spent trillions of dollars that we cannot  afford.   Democrats need to learn their lesson before it is too late. Stop this  rush to more taxes and spending and borrowing. Stop cutting into  people's paychecks. American families are feeling the pain. Stop  pouring more fuel on this fire of inflation that is raging across the  country.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the  centennial celebration for the Niobrara County Courthouse in Lusk, WY.   Niobrara County residents are blessed to live in this special place.  Located on the plains and rolling hills of eastern Wyoming, the county  is a gateway to the Black Hills and Central Wyoming. Its 2,400  residents center around the communities of Lusk, Manville, and Van  Tassell. The county was created from eastern Converse County in 1911,  and Lusk was chosen as the county seat when Niobrara County was  organized in 1913. The name of the county comes from the Niobrara  River, which begins its journey east of Lusk.   Niobrara County's story is a collection of the determined and  persevering people that have called this place home for the past  century. Its establishment was given a physical monument when the  courthouse was built in 1920. The land on which the courthouse sits was  originally donated by early rancher Frank Lusk, as a site to build the  new town which bears his name. County business was first conducted in  the Odd Fellows Hall, followed by the Harmony Lodge. A fire in 1919  destroyed the lodge, but not the records kept in a steel vault.  Operations were moved to the basement of the First National Bank of  Lusk until a new courthouse was completed. A white schoolhouse was  built at the corner of 5th and Elm, believed to be the first in Lusk.  When the courthouse was planned for this location, the schoolhouse was  split up and moved to another block.   The economy of the new county experienced an unexpected boom when oil  was discovered in what became the Lance Creek Field. The increase in  taxable goods prompted the county commissioners to propose a bond  election to fund the construction of a courthouse. On election day,  November, 6, 1918, voters approved a $60,000 bond issue by only 29  votes. The commissioners chose architect George E. McDonald, designer  of courthouses in Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska, to design the new  building. The contracting bid was awarded to D.W. Woods. The building  came in $22,000 over budget, and the commissioners again proposed a  bond election for another $40,000. The vote passed by 30 votes this  time.   The building was finished in the winter and occupied in February  1920. It was the only courthouse in Wyoming with a bronze statue of  Justice placed on top of the courthouse dome. However, the statue only  stayed there for 10 years. Strong Wyoming winds caused the statue to  constantly vibrate and shift, which damaged the roof. In 1930,  commissioners voted to remove the statue and replace the roof. The  statue laid on the ground behind the courthouse, until 1 day it  disappeared, only to be placed a few days later on a hill overlooking  the town. It remained  [[Page S6940]]  there as a Lusk landmark until it vanished from that location as well.  Stories say that some delinquents moved it to the bottom of an  abandoned mine shaft. Rumors abounded in Lusk over the following years  as to the purpose of the statue's relocation. During World War II, the  statue resurfaced and was donated to a scrap metal campaign for the war  effort.   The courthouse was described as, ``Built of dark red brick with white  columned porticoes on the south and east entrances, and, of course,  with the white dome capped by the bronze statue, the courthouse was the  pride of the county's citizens.'' The Niobrara County Commissioners  inscribed on the cornerstone of the building were Fred S. Runser, M.J.  McCormick, and C.F. Calhoun, with E.M. Phillips as the county clerk.  One of the most prominent features of the building is the motto above  the door, ``A Public Office Is A Public Trust.'' This defining feature,  which remains there today, is an inspiring reminder to all those who  work in the county and in Wyoming. The current county commissioners  tasked with upholding this ideal are Patrick H. Wade, John Midkiff, and  Elaine B. Griffith, with Becky Freeman as county clerk.   On Friday, October 15, 2021, the Niobrara County Commissioners are  hosting a celebration for the courthouse's centennial. A dedication  ceremony will take place at this event as one was not preformed upon  its original construction. The Niobrara County Historical Society  purchased a sign commemorating the courthouse and providing historic  information. It will be a wonderful celebration of Lusk and the  Niobrara County community.   Niobrara County has a storied and colorful past. Its people stand as  an example of strong character and neighborliness and its courthouse a  symbol of their ideals. Bobbi joins me in celebrating the centennial of  the Niobrara County Courthouse and the citizens who make this county  special.                            ____________________
