 Madam Speaker, September 11, 2001, is one of those days  when everyone of age can remember where they were and what they were  doing when the first plane hit.   I was a police commander assigned to the Orlando International  Airport. It appeared to be a normal day, and then the events unfolded.  The planes hit. The towers collapsed. The Pentagon burned. The  passengers of Flight 93 mounted their heroic resistance.   It appeared time stood still as the world watched the results and the  actions of the hijackers, evil men who set out to attack America, to  kill Americans. But they could never have killed the idea of America.  You see, that idea belongs to us. It will endure as long as we continue  to believe in it, to perfect it, and to make it worth fighting for.   2,977 lives, 343 firefighters, 23 New York police officers, and 37  Port Authority officers--they took much from us that day.   As a mother, I think of the roughly 100 babies who will turn 18 this  year having never known their fathers.   Today, I remember the passengers and crew. I remember the first  responders who rushed into fire and smoke, dust and rubble in a  desperate fight to save whomever they could; who worked for weeks on  end, breathing deadly particles, trying to find survivors, or at least  identify the dead; heroes who died that day or from illnesses  contracted from the search, rescue, recovery; heroes who died as they  lived, in service to others, who believed in service above self. These  men and women didn't just save lives; they defined what it means to be  a hero for a generation.   On the day of the worst terrorist attack on American soil, our first  responders showed us the best of us. I am relieved that, earlier this  year, Congress passed lifetime funding for the 9/11 Victims  Compensation Fund.   Yes, evil men took much from us that day; but the heart and soul of  America, the courage and tenacity, the ability to endure and to stand  no enemy can take away from us.   The work of caring for those individuals who answered the call that  day must go on, just as our work will go on to secure our Nation, to  ensure that we will never again suffer the injury we did on that  morning.   But today, on September 11, we pause from that work to remember and  to honor the victims and to acknowledge the service of 9/11 is not just  something to be memorialized, but to be emulated, to put service above  self. May we stand united and serve in the people's House with courage,  devotion, gallantry, compassion, and grace.                            ____________________
