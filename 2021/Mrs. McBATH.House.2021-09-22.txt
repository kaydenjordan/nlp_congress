 Mr. Speaker, I come from a family of veterans. My  father, my brother, and nephew all served, and I am honored to fight  for our veterans and their families here in Washington.   Our servicemen and -women have sacrificed so much for this country.  And our community and our country are forever grateful to all who have  served, and we must always give back to those who have given us so  much.   I am proud of the funding that we have helped procure for the Veteran  Rapid Retraining Assistance Program. It gives veterans in my community  and the country the opportunity to receive a year of job training,  education, and housing costs.   This pandemic has been extraordinarily difficult for so many across  our country, and this is an important step toward serving the thousands  who have so bravely served our Nation.                            ____________________
