 Mr. President, I have, since the year 2014, come to the  Senate floor on numerous occasions, perhaps more than I hoped to, to  discuss the developing situation in the nation of Venezuela.   The reason why I have taken such an interest in this issue is because  of the impact it has, first and foremost, on my home State of Florida.  We are blessed in Florida, particularly in my hometown of Miami and in  South Florida, to have a vibrant and diverse community with people from  across the world and, particularly, from the Western Hemisphere. That,  of course, includes a very substantial number of people from Venezuela,  some who live in Florida for part of the year and some who have made it  their permanent home. They have contributed greatly to our economy, to  our culture, and to our lives.   It is through their eyes that I have witnessed the tragedy that has  unfolded in that nation over the last 5 years. I use the word  ``tragedy,'' but I don't use it lightly. Venezuela is one of the  richest countries in the world, blessed with natural resources that God  has blessed that nation with and the largest crude oil reserves on the  planet--certainly, more than the United States and Canada combined, as  an example. They have highly educated and capable people and a long  tradition of democracy. Venezuela has one of the oldest traditions of  democracy in the Western Hemisphere. As much as anything else, not only  is it a tragedy for the people of Venezuela--what has happened--but it  is a tragedy for the hemisphere and, ultimately, for the world. We look  at some of the great causes that the world is confronting and think  what a democratic and prosperous Venezuela could be contributing, what  its extraordinary people could be contributing. But the last 5 to 10  years--particularly the last 5--have largely been taken up by internal  strife.   At the end of the day, my interest on the issue of Venezuela has  never been the removal of anyone from power. It has been about the  restoration of the democratic order so that the people of Venezuela can  choose their path forward. We look at the history of our hemisphere,  here in the Western Hemisphere, and we see that up until about 25 years  ago, most of the nations in the Western Hemisphere were governed by  dictators and strongmen on both the left and the right, and few, if  any, people in our hemisphere had a role to play in choosing their  leaders. Today, but for the exception of a handful of places-- predominantly, Cuba and the Caribbean and some others--almost all of  the people of the region get to choose their leaders, and that has been  the story of Venezuela up until very recently. Sometimes they choose  leaders who agree with America, and sometimes they do not. But they  choose their leaders.   In the end, we know that democracies very rarely start wars because  their peoples do not tolerate it. Democracies always seek stability and  prosperity because their peoples demand it, and they get rid of leaders  who don't deliver.   So our goal from the beginning--my goal, in particular--has  consistently been the restoration of the democratic order and, through  that, the respect for basic rights and dignity of all people,  particularly in Venezuela. It is sad to see what has happened because I  think it is fair to say that the situation today in Venezuela is worse  than it has been at any point since 2014.   We saw about a week ago the horrifying images of armed thugs storming  the National Assembly--the democratically elected National Assembly-- and attacking members of that assembly. It would be the equivalent of  protestors storming the Capitol doors and attacking Senators and  Congressmen. We saw images of uniformed personnel, some of whom,  basically, are the equivalent of our Capitol Police, roughing up the  very members of that assembly whom they are supposed to be protecting.  We have seen the images of protests in the streets, of national guard  troops firing on people with tear gas and rubber bullets and, in some  instances, with guns.   We have seen these irregular groups called ``colectivos'' going after  people in the streets. By the way, in fairness, we have seen violence  on both sides of it, although the vast majority of people in the  opposition--the enormous majority--seek a peaceful resolution to this.  Anytime you put hundreds of thousands of people in the street, chaos  happens.   You think not just of the protestors, but you think of their family  members on the other side of it. We forget that these national guard  troops, holding up their shields and wearing the uniforms, have sisters  and brothers and husbands and wives and loved ones on the other side of  that barricade, deeply dividing this proud nation with an incredible  history of contributions that it has made.   The situation has now reached what I believe is the tipping point.  Later this month, the Government of Venezuela--I should say the  executive branch, under its current President--has scheduled an  unconstitutional assembly. They call it a constituent assembly. It  violates the very Constitution of the country, not to mention that the  supreme court has already kind of canceled the democratic order and  this adds to that. I just say this with deep  [[Page S3906]]  sadness. If that goes forward, I think it fundamentally changes the  situation permanently.   I had an occasion early this morning to speak to the President on  this topic for a few minutes, as I know he is headed overseas. He  expressed his continued dissatisfaction with the course of events. I  think it should be abundantly clear to everyone that this government in  the United States is prepared to take additional significant measures  if, in fact, that constituent assembly moves forward at the end of this  month--basically, all but admitting to the world what we already know;  that is, that the democratic order in Venezuela has ended.   I do believe that there is still a path forward--a path forward that  doesn't involve vengeance, that involves reconciliation; a path forward  designed to restore the democratic order. I believe deeply that all of  my colleagues here in the Senate and in the Congress and the President  of the United States are prepared to play whatever role they can to  help facilitate that. I think that, obviously, ultimately, it would  involve restoring democracy. It would involve respecting its own  Constitution. It would involve holding free and fair elections,  internationally supervised, not by the United States but by the United  Nations or by neighboring countries. I just left a meeting a few  minutes ago with the Foreign Minister of Mexico, a nation that has  shown that it is willing to step forward and be constructive and  productive in this endeavor.   That is the goal. The goal is to restore peace and order and to  restore democracy and to grant amnesty and freedom to those who have  been imprisoned because of their political views. Within that space,  there are those within the government who themselves perhaps seek the  same thing but feel trapped by the circumstances before the nation  today.   So I do believe there is a path forward, but I also think it would be  unfair if I didn't make clear that the time for that path is running  out and the door will permanently close if, at the end of this month,  the Maduro government moves forward with this assembly, which is  illegal and unconstitutional. At that point, it would be clear for all  that they have no interest and no intent of restoring democracy. I fear  the consequences of that, not simply because of what the U.S.  Government and the Trump administration might do but what it would mean  to those in the streets who are already desperate as it is.    I do think that path is there. I do believe that opportunity is still  available, but it will not be around forever. My hope is that cooler  heads will prevail. My hope is that patriots in Venezuela--no matter  what side of this debate they have been on up to this point--realize it  is time to step up and further this process of reconciliation, not with  a goal of vengeance or punishment but with a goal of freeing those who  have been imprisoned unjustly, with the goal of having free and  democratic elections, with the goal of living up to constitutional  principles, with the goal of restoring democracy to a great people and  a great nation.   I know that I, for one, despite all of my criticisms and all of the  speeches I have given and all of the measures we have taken, am  prepared to do all I can to be helpful in that endeavor, to help the  people of Venezuela take control of their destiny once again and  restore the democratic order, the constitutional order in a way that  unites the country, not one that further fragments and divides it.   I know the President has expressed a willingness to be involved in  that process in whatever capacity is appropriate, knowing that other  nations in the region are prepared to lead as well.   I thought it was important on this 11th day of July, as we get closer  to that measure--which I think will do irreparable harm to this  possibility--that I come here to the Senate floor and express this. In  the end, I think all of us in this hemisphere and, ultimately, the  world would benefit greatly from a Venezuela that fulfills its  potential--the potential of its people, the potential of its economy,  the potential of its proud history of democracy. Whatever we can do to  be helpful in that endeavor, I know that this Nation is prepared to do  in whatever capacity is appropriate in the eyes of the people of  Venezuela.   Ultimately, the future of Venezuela belongs to the people of  Venezuela, and that is what we stand for. We hope that we can be  helpful in a process that brings them together--and not further divides  them--and restores what they once had and deserve to have again: a  proud democracy, a vibrant economy, and a people with extraordinary and  unlimited potential to achieve great things on behalf of their nation,  their countrymen, and the world.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.    Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to the  memory of a man who was a great friend of mine: Dr. Michael Gordon.   A professor at the University of Miami, Michael's love for medicine  and people impacted the lives of so many, both inside the classroom and  out. Michael first came to Florida in 1960 and eventually returned in  1966 to teach at the Miller School of Medicine at the University of  Miami, a move that would keep him in the Sunshine State for the rest of  his life. His tenacity intelligence led to critical medical  breakthroughs, But it didn't come easily.   Michael's first invention, ``Harvey''--the cardiopulmonary patient  simulator used across the globe--was initially viewed with contempt and  suspicion amongst his contemporaries. But that did not discourage  Michael. And thank God for that, because the once-ridiculed invention  has since been used by many in the field of cardiology around the  world. His relentlessness and ambition served as a testament to his  character. He was a man with unfailing dedication to the well-being of  others.   He also created UMedic, a system fostering research and learning in  cardiology. Michael also devised training for first responders, which  undoubtedly saved many lives over the years. He founded the Medical  Training and Simulation Laboratory, which was eventually named the  Michael S. Gordon Center for Research in Medical Education. The center  focused on the mission of improving medical techniques and training  paramedics and firefighters.   So many of us in the Miami-Dade community cherish his memory. While  some in our community may never know his name, their loved ones may  very well be saved by one of his innovations or the training he  provided to first responders. Over the course of his life, Michael  would bear many titles, including professor, mentor, innovator, doctor,  inventor, friend, father, grandfather, and husband. To put it simply  and quite literally; his friendship and passion touched many.   I am proud to have known such a tremendous human being and benefactor  to the Miami community. My wife Jeanette and I will forever miss him  and we join our friends at the University of Miami and his family in  honoring his legacy.   May God bless him, his family, and those who continue his mission of  saving lives and advancing medicine.                            ____________________
