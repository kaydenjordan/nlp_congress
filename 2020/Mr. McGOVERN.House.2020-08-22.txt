 Madam Speaker, COVID-19 is having a devastating impact  on global hunger and food security, especially among children.   Even before the pandemic, malnutrition and hunger rates were  alarmingly high. Globally, 144 million children suffer from stunting;  wasting affects 47 million children; and hunger has risen by 60 million  people since 2014. The pandemic could push over 130 million people into  hunger by the end of 2020.   In July, The Lancet estimated that without timely action, the global  prevalence of child wasting could rise by a shocking 14 percent,  affecting nearly 7 million more children and causing more than 10,000  additional child deaths every month.   Madam Speaker, with such unprecedented need, Congress must act. We  must help fund the global response to this COVID-19 pandemic. We must  divert this potential hunger and malnutrition crisis. The children of  the world, just like our own children, need us.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 1092 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1092         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House without intervention of any       question of consideration the bill (H.R. 8015) to maintain       prompt and reliable postal services during the COVID-19       health emergency, and for other purposes. All points of order       against  [[Page H4257]]       consideration of the bill are waived. An amendment in the       nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules       Committee Print 116-61, modified by the amendment printed in       the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution, shall be considered as adopted. The bill, as       amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill,       as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) two hours of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight and       Reform; and (2) one motion to recommit with or without       instructions.                                time  1030     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Friday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1092, providing for consideration of  H.R. 8015, the Delivering for America Act, under a closed rule.   The rule itself executes a manager's amendment from Chairwoman  Maloney, provides 2 hours of general debate on the bill, equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Oversight and Reform, and provides one motion to recommit,  with or without instructions.   Madam Speaker, we are here today because our democracy is being  eroded by this administration. It is under siege on all fronts.   I read the report released this week by the Senate Intelligence  Committee, a Republican-led committee. It was truly shocking. It found  that some in the President's campaign created ``notable  counterintelligence vulnerabilities.''   Make no mistake, they welcomed help from Russia, and they knowingly  used intelligence from Putin's regime.   While this report was released, the President continued to attack his  political enemies. He continued all of the lies. This week, he even  floated the idea that America should hold a do-over of the upcoming  election in November if he doesn't like the outcome.   Are you kidding me?   On top of this, this administration has moved to dismantle the United  States Postal Service. We have all seen the images of mailboxes  uprooted. Others have been chained shut. Sorting machines have  disappeared. Mail service has slowed to a crawl for some Americans,  threatening the delivery of everything from medications to Social  Security checks.   Did you know, Madam Speaker, that 80 percent of our veterans'  prescription medications are delivered by mail? Why would anyone want  to place their health in harm's way?   Why, Madam Speaker? Because this administration knows that more  Americans than ever are likely to vote by mail in November. The U.S.  Postal Service expects 10 times the normal amount of election mail  because of the coronavirus pandemic. This President fears that if more  people vote, the less likely he is to win a second term.   Now, we all recently mourned the passing of our dear friend, the  great John Lewis. Not too long ago, he stood right here on this floor  and he said: ``When you see something that is not right, not fair, not  just, you have to speak up; you have to say something; you have to do  something.''   Madam Speaker, what we are seeing today cannot be dismissed as Donald  being Donald or the President just continuing to be provocative. This  is scary stuff. It is frightening, and we have to do something.   In the face of extraordinary public pressure and action by this  majority, the Postmaster General promised to halt further changes until  after election day. But I have to tell you, I wouldn't trust this  administration to tell me the correct time. Not only was there nothing  in his statement about reversing the damage that has been already done,  there was nothing about reinstalling boxes or sorting machines and  nothing about treating election material as first-class mail.   But the Postmaster General made clear, since, that he has no  intention of undoing what he has done. He doesn't plan on lifting a  finger. He said as much in the Senate hearing yesterday. He made clear  that he didn't even study the impact of these changes on our seniors  before they were implemented. He didn't study the impact on our  veterans first. Apparently, he just made them, Madam Speaker,  struggling Americans be damned.   This administration isn't going to do a single thing about it, and  this is why Congress must act.   Now, my friends on the other side have tried to claim there is no  problem here. They have waved around charts that are weeks and weeks  old to try to pretend that everything is just fine, that everything is  just beautiful.   Well, I don't need some outdated statistics to tell me what is going  on today, Madam Speaker. I don't need empty rhetoric from the occupant  of the White House or Mr. DeJoy. My constituents are my evidence. They  have flooded my office with calls. They have stopped me on the street.  Something is happening here, whether this administration or its allies  want to admit it or not.   Before my friends on the other side try to paint this issue as some  kind of liberal conspiracy, let me remind them: There is no money for  hungry families here, although they badly need it; there is no funding  for State and local governments here, though they are pleading with all  of us for relief. We have already acted on all that. It is Mitch  McConnell over in the Senate who is determined to do absolutely  nothing.   All this bill does is get the Postal Service back to where it was at  the start of the year and provide them with the resources they need,  not just to process an influx of ballots, but to continue delivering  mail, including Americans' Social Security checks and medications. It  ensures that they are able to continue delivering to places in rural  America that their competitors just don't go, and it supports the  Postal Service's more than 630,000 hardworking employees. And we all  owe them a debt of gratitude for their service, especially during this  pandemic.   Madam Speaker, if we don't undermine and tear apart the Postal  Service, then they can handle the increase in mail-in ballots. They  handled two to three times the volume of mail and packages at  Christmastime, and they are determined to handle the volume of  election-related mail. But they need their equipment; they need to pay  their workers; they need confidence that management won't try to  undercut them on the job; and they need support from this Congress,  Democrats and Republicans.    That is it. This is all pretty bare bones, Madam Speaker. I don't see  why in the world that Republicans won't join us on this. It shouldn't  be a radical concept to suggest that, in the United States of America,  every vote should count, whether it is for Donald Trump, Joe Biden, or  someone else.   It shouldn't be a tough call to support the United States Postal  Service. More than 90 percent of Americans view this agency favorably  because it is their lifeline in so many ways.   Madam Speaker, this is a five-alarm fire on our democracy. I think  our country is worth fighting for. I hope all my colleagues join  together to help us save it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I am just getting a little sick and tired of all of the excuses as to  why my Republican friends don't want to join us in helping the American  people.   My friend mentioned the appropriations bills. Well, with all due  respect, we passed almost all of them here in the House. My friend, the  Republican leader in the Senate, hasn't done a damn thing, hasn't  passed one.   We passed the HEROES Act, which would have helped the Postal Service,  which would have provided relief to cities and towns, which would have  provided assistance to those in this country who are going hungry. The  Senate majority leader hasn't done a damn thing, not anything, hasn't  lifted a finger for anybody. And we have even agreed to meet him  halfway. He still won't negotiate.   On an infrastructure bill, we passed an infrastructure bill here.  Negotiate with the Senate? They haven't passed a damn thing. It is  malpractice. If politicians could be sued for malpractice, then  the Senate majority leader would be sued. This is ridiculous.    And here we are with a crisis in the Postal Service. Mail has slowed  down all across the country. Members are getting calls, including  Republican Members. And what is the response? Oh, well, we will just  let it go. You know, we will say we need to do better. We will deal  with this another day.   This is ridiculous, it is unconscionable, and I am tired of the  excuses.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Pocan).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I would love to spend weeks and weeks discussing this  in committee, but the truth is that is what the Trump administration  wants, to run out the clock before the November elections. So trust in  our democracy is undermined, and they can act like there is some  conspiracy if he loses.   I have heard my friends on the other side of the aisle talk about  process, but I really question their judgment here. They thought that  dealing with cheese was such a national emergency last Congress that  they used emergency powers to bring a bill on that topic to the floor  during a government shutdown no less.   But today, as seniors can't get lifesaving medications and our  veterans can't get social security checks, they want to hit pause. Our  Postal Service is in chaos. Give me a break.   You know, my friends say they don't know who the Postmaster General  is.  [[Page H4263]]  Let me tell you who he is. He is like the least qualified candidate for  the job. He is a big, mega donor to Donald Trump. And my Republican  friends are believing everything Mr. DeJoy says, like claiming there is  no mail shutdown.   Well, let me remind them what the Postmaster General wrote in a  recent memo that these changes have had: ``Unintended consequences that  have impacted our overall service levels.'' Those are his words, Madam  Speaker.   He is transforming the Postal Service all right. Transforming it from  reliable to chaotic right before an election. So even if you trust Mr.  DeJoy, which I do not, even he acknowledges that there is something  happening here.    Those on the other side of the aisle cannot have it both ways here.  This administration apparently won't lift a finger to fix this problem,  but this Congress is acting. And I would respectfully urge my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us. Help the American  people. They should be your priority, not the guy in the White House.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas  (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I have heard some of the Republicans  clamor last night in the Rules Committee all about statistics.   Well, let's look at some. This is from the Postal Service's most  recent quarterly report. It compares on-time delivery for single-piece  first-class mail this fiscal year so far as compared to last fiscal  year. Do you see the red line? It is going in the wrong direction. Mail  is slowing. People aren't getting deliveries that they need on time.  This is just through the end of June. We don't know what truly happened  in July or so far in August.   Our constituents are not lying to us. Their mail is delayed. Their  medications are delayed.   Yesterday, we were told: You know, people who are on Social Security  don't have to worry because they get all their Social Security checks  electronically. We know that is not true. We know that close to 1  million people get Social Security and SSI through the mail.   So, this is real. This is happening. And we need to do something  about it.   The fact that this is happening in the middle of a pandemic right  before an election, I mean, I don't believe in coincidences. This is  deliberate, and it is shocking. As I said before, this is a five-alarm  fire on our democracy.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Madam Speaker, let me just say again for the Record  because we hear this on the other side: Wouldn't it be nice if we were  here negotiating a larger package on a whole range of things. Well, we  actually passed something in the House called the HEROES Act. The  Senate has passed nothing. The reason why is because Republicans are  fighting with Republicans. They can't agree on what to do, so they have  done nothing. So, we are negotiating with an empty chair.   If my friends really want to help, they ought to pick up the phone,  and they ought to call Mitch McConnell and tell him to do something, to  actually do something.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro).    Madam Speaker, I am sad that the gentleman thinks this  is entertaining. We have veterans who are calling our offices whose  medications have been delayed getting to them. We have some people on  Social Security and on SSI who are worried that their checks are not  going to get to them. We have small businesses that are calling to  complain.   This is a crisis that this administration produced all on its own.  And whether it is designed, as some of us fear, to try to create more  chaos around the election--and by the way, this is what Donald Trump  said about the money that we have in this bill: ``They need that money  in order to have the post office work so it can take all of these  millions and millions of ballots.''   Did anybody ever think that they would see a President of the United  States who would publicly say that he doesn't want every vote to count?  This is outrageous, and I cannot believe that my friends on the other  side of the aisle, who I know are getting the same calls we are, are  totally fine with doing nothing.                                time  1115    Well, maybe if some of my Republican friends would join with us, it  might send a message to the White House that they have to respond, they  have to do the right thing.   It is the complicity; it is the indifference that I just can't  understand given what is going on in this country right now.   So we have been complaining about this for weeks--this didn't just  happen this week, but for weeks--but it is now out of control, and we  have to do something.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Matsui), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.  [[Page H4266]]         Madam Speaker, I insert in the Record a CNBC article,  entitled, ``Patients Say Post Office Slowdown Is Delaying Delivery of  Lifesaving Medications.''   Patients Say Post Office Slowdown is Delaying Delivery of Life-Saving                                Medications                            (By Christina Farr)         The U.S. Postal Service has become a political       battleground, and has experienced delays after Postmaster       General Louis DeJoy slashed overtime.        Many patients are experiencing delays receiving life-saving       medications and are sharing their experiences online via       hashtags like #USPSMeds.        Experts say the situation could escalate, despite       Postmaster General Louis DeJoy's promise to suspend changes       to the Postal Service.        Nathan Geissel, who lives in rural Oregon, has been waiting       more than nine days for a lifesaving medication to arrive in       the mail. As far as he knows, it's stuck in a fulfillment       center.        Geissel's doctor prescribed the medicine two years ago to       prevent blood clots. He's never experienced delays before.        The U.S. Postal Service has become a political battleground       after President Trump said he opposes additional funding       because he doesn't support universal mail-in voting.       Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a Trump supporter, reportedly       ordered recent cost-cutting measures, slashing overtime and       curbing late delivery. It has created significant delays in       mail deliveries, according to mail worker advocates and       others.        Americans are sharing stories about medication delays with       the hashtag #USPSMeds. Many are veterans who have reported       weeks-long delays. Some are seniors who instead have to visit       a pharmacy, putting them at higher risk of exposure to Covid-      19.        Geissel chose mail-order for the convenience--the nearest       pharmacy is 20 minutes away--and the affordability. His       insurance company covers more of the cost of the medication       when it's delivered by the U.S. postal service. Geissel has       to pay a $135 copay for a months supply if he instead picks       it up at a retail pharmacy.        ``Thankfully, a local pharmacist approved two more weeks of       medication with my health plan that I could pick up as an       emergency,'' said Geissel. ``I work in health care, so I know       the system, but I can't imagine what it must be like for an       elderly patient who doesn't have that same access.''        ``I'm worried,'' said Liz Austin by phone. Her mother,       Barbara, is sick with cystic fibrosis, a progressive disease       that causes lung infections and limits her ability to       breathe. ``Covid-19 is primarily a respiratory disease, so my       mother relies on the mail to get her prescriptions as safely       as possible.''        Her medicine was so late that her husband had to risk       visiting a pharmacy.        After lawsuits from more than 20 state attorneys general       and a call to testify before Congress, DeJoy on Tuesday said       he's suspending operational changes until after the November       election.        Some experts are concerned that the delays will snowball.        ``There's an exponential factor to this,'' said John       McHugh, a former congressman who heads up the Package       Coalition, an alliance that aims to preserve affordable       postal package delivery services. Members of the  [[Page H4267]]       Package Coalition include Amazon, eBay, and Cigna's Express       Scripts. ``Once you are behind, what happens next is you get       further behind and then further behind.''        The pandemic has strained the mail-order medication system       as more people are opt to receive prescriptions at home.       Those with pre-existing conditions are at greater risk for       hospitalization if they get Covid-19.        ``Data show an increase in prescription drugs dispensed       through mail-service pharmacy during the pandemic,'' said a       spokesperson from PCMA, a national association representing       pharmacy benefits managers, which negotiate prescription drug       costs on behalf of insurers.        Online pharmacy Honeybee Health said about 20% of patients       who order delivery via first-class mail have experienced       delays so far.        ``The situation is fluid but it's clear from our customer       service team that an usually high number of patients are       receiving their medication far later than expected--and in       some cases, not receiving it at all. These delays are       troubling for everyone, but for patients who rely on       medication to live, it's especially dangerous,'' said Dr.       Jessica Nouhavandi, co-founder and lead pharmacist for       Honeybee Health, which delivers generic medications via USPS.        Umar Afridi, founder of TruePill, a company that provides       pharmacy services to telemedicine companies, said he       ``estimates that about 90 percent'' of prescription drugs his       company delivers via mail run through the postal service.        ``We tend to use UPS and FedEx more for time-sensitive and       expensive drugs,'' he said. ``USPS is often the lowest cost       and they have the biggest reach.''        Afridi said he hasn't yet heard about delays but knows       there are service-level disruptions, including pickups not       happening on time.        Pharmacy benefits managers are more optimistic. Express       Scripts, a major pharmacy benefit manager, said it was ``not       experiencing unusual delays.'' OptumRX (owned by UnitedHealth       Group) declined to discuss delays. It said it's working with       all major carriers ``to help ensure timely shipments of home       delivery prescriptions.''        Some doctors are concerned for their low-income and elderly       patients. Dr. Lakshman Swamy, a Boston-based pulmonologist       and critical care doctor, says the situation could be       disastrous for asthma patients who rely on Medicaid or don't       have insurance. These patients might not be able to negotiate       an emergency supply.        Swamy, who also has asthma, said it's common for patients       with chronic respiratory conditions to rely on mail-order       medications. ``You can do rescue therapies for a while, but       the strong medications will wear off,'' he said. ``Once you       don't get the medications you need, you can quickly fall off       the wagon and end up hospitalized.''        ``Any additional strain will have an impact on patients,''       he said. ``It's inevitable.''     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I don't know for certain that the Senate will take  this bill up, but I fervently hope that they will, because I sure as  hell know that we are doing the right thing here in the House.   Madam Speaker, I would also like to just point out, because I have  heard these questions raised about the $25 billion in this bill for the  Postal Service: Why are we providing that amount?   Madam Speaker, because that is what the USPS Board of Governors  recommended, and this Board is made up of 100 percent of Donald Trump's  appointees. So, you know, this is not a number that Democrats made up.  It is what his Republican Board of the USPS came up with. So that is  why that number is there.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, it is interesting to hear my friend talk about the  extension of PPP when he voted against that in the HEROES Act when it  came before the full House. Luckily, it passed and it is over in the  Senate. We are waiting for Mitch McConnell to do something.   But I love my friends on the other side of the aisle who come up with  all these ideas right now. Most of them were in the HEROES Act.   But if these are so important, where is Mitch McConnell? Where is the  United States Senate? They went on vacation. They are gone.   We are here because we have a crisis. We have people who can't get  their medications, who can't get their benefit checks. We have a crisis  where we have a President who is trying to undermine our elections. So  we are here doing our work.   Where is Mitch McConnell? Where is the Senate? How about picking up  the phone and calling them to come back and do something for the  American people?   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Madam Speaker, the gentleman asked: Where are the leaders? We are  here. We are doing our job. We are responding to a crisis.   Where is Mitch McConnell? On vacation.   Where is the President? Tweeting more insults.   But we are here doing our job to help deal with this postal crisis,  and we also did our job when we passed the HEROES Act.   Where is Mitch McConnell? On vacation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close.                                time  1130     Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I have great respect for my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle which makes me especially sad to hear some of the  comments that we heard here today.   This is a crisis that we are currently facing. We are getting calls  from veterans whose medications are being delayed in the mail. We are  getting calls from others whose essential benefits are being delayed in  the mail. People rely on this stuff. It is important.   Madam Speaker, you have heard the testimonies that have been  recounted here on our side of the aisle.   This is an emergency, and on top of that, we have a President who  does not want every vote counted in the upcoming election because he  believes that if we do count every vote, he will lose.   We are in the middle of a pandemic. More and more people are going to  be voting by mail, and this President, rather than trying to make it  easier for people to vote and to have their voices be counted, is  trying to make it more difficult.   The current Postmaster General is not interested in reforming the  Post Office. He is interested in dismantling it. That is what he has  been doing.   The bill that is before us is about more than money, I would say to  my colleague from Georgia. It is about undoing all the damage that the  current Postmaster has put into place that is resulting in all these  delays, all this confusion, and all this chaos. Come on. This is  serious business.   I am going to close with this. History is not going to look well on  those who just went along to get along with this President while he has  done some things that would have been unthinkable in any other  administration, Democrat or Republican. The complicity and the  indifference are shocking to me. I can't believe it sometimes when I  hear people defend the indefensible.   What the President is doing with the Postal Service is indefensible,  and everybody needs to be counted on this issue. I ask my Democratic  colleagues and I ask my Republican colleagues to support this bill. It  is the right thing to do for your constituents. Even if the man in the  White House doesn't want it, it is the right thing to do. It is about  time people started doing what is right for the people of this country.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Woodall is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1092    At the end of the resolution, add the following:         Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       8086) to provide additional appropriations for the public       health and social services emergency fund, and for other       purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed       with. All points of order against consideration of the bill       are waived. Clause 2(e) of rule XXI shall not apply during       consideration of the bill. General debate shall be confined       to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Appropriations. After general debate the bill       shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule.       All points of order against provisions in the bill are       waived. When the committee rises and reports the bill back to       the House with a recommendation that the bill do pass, the       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit with or without       instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports       that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the       next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the       third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV,       resolve into the Committee of the Who further consideration       of the bill.        Sec. 3.
