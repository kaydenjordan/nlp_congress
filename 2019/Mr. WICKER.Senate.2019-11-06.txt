 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.  [[Page S6434]]     Mr. President, I am wearing a pin on my right lapel that  was presented to me by some folks today who appreciate veterans, and I  appreciate being recognized.   I am a veteran of the U.S. Air Force and Air Force Reserve. I retired  from that organization, and I appreciate their coming to put an extra  pin on me today.   We will celebrate Veterans Day on November 11, and I will be making  speeches. Hopefully, many of us will be properly recognizing those of  us who have worn the uniform and taken the oath and are serving in that  respect.   Today I want to talk about another group of folks, and those are the  future veterans. By that, of course, I mean the soldiers, sailors,  airmen, marines, and servicemembers who are serving their country now  on Active Duty. I make a plea to my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle, at both ends of this building, to get our work done at least for  national security.   We are at a time of heightened politics. There are tensions in this  building as there often have been, but at this critical juncture, with  so much at stake around the world, it seems to me we ought to be able  to pass the National Defense Authorization Act, of which the  distinguished chairman, Chairman Inhofe, and his ranking member,  Senator Reed from Rhode Island, have prepared and are ready to go on.  It seems we ought to be able to come to an agreement with the other  body and get that to the President for his signature.   We are now 5 weeks into the current fiscal year, and we don't have an  appropriations bill done for the Department of Defense. We have to have  the authorization act, which I mentioned, but at the beginning of  October, we are supposed to have the government funded, and we don't.   We are under a continuing resolution, a CR, and it sounds so  harmless, like we are just continuing the funding until we get all the  numbers right. That is not true. Every defense expert in the  government--formally in the government and outside of the government-- will tell you that a continuing resolution is harmful to our Nation's  defense. It not only sends the wrong signal, it has us sending money in  the wrong direction and has us not spending money where we need to  spend it.   At the end of this month, when the current CR ends, we need to be  ready with a permanent appropriations bill for the Department of  Defense for this current fiscal year. Just think of what we are looking  at right now. Iran is the largest State sponsor of terror, and it is on  the warpath. Iran knocked out the world's largest oil facility in Saudi  Arabia just a couple of months ago and is attacking tankers in the  gulf. This is no time to not have a permanent appropriations bill for  this fiscal year. Vladimir Putin's Russia is in a shooting war against  our partners in Ukraine. The Communist Government of China is  brutalizing its own people on the streets of Hong Kong violating the  ``one nation, two systems'' policy.   That is not the half of it. The Chinese dictator, Xi Jinping, is not  keeping his repressive ambitions at home as we know from what is going  on in the Pacific. As my friend, the chairman of the full Armed  Services Committee, pointed out, the People's Republic of China has  increased military spending by 83 percent. China has increased military  spending by 83 percent over the last decade at a time when we can't  even agree on the funding for the current fiscal year we are in. That  sends a signal around the world. You best believe Xi Jinping knows we  can't get our act together through a funding bill.   Now my hat is off to the leaders, both Republican and Democratic, in  this body who have done their job and are ready to go forward with the  funding bill, but we need to join hands and actually get it done. For  some reason, we have not been able to do that. I am begging my  colleagues, let's fund our military, and let's fund these future  veterans who are serving on Active Duty right now. The current  continuing resolution is doing real damage to our national security. It  is harming the progress we have already made to rebuild our military  since the sequester--and wasn't that a disaster. It is harming our  military men and women and making it harder for them to do their jobs  going forward.   I want to quote General Mattis, former Secretary Mattis, who said  this, as Secretary, about continuing resolutions:         It's not like we even maintain the status quo if we go into       one of these situations yet again. We actually lose ground.    I urge my fellow colleagues in the Senate and in the other body to  heed the words of this great military leader. We are losing ground  today, November 6, 2019, because we are under a CR. We have seen it  before, and unfortunately we are losing money and losing readiness  right now. Extending the CR any further will harm military personnel in  every branch. The Air Force is short 2,100 pilots. Keeping the CR going  would cut $123 million from undergraduate pilot training.   Under a continuation of the CR further than the end of this month,  naval training will be scaled back dramatically. We will not be able to  fix dangerous housing that we have had hearings about and there has  been a scandal about in the press. We will not be able to attend to  that because we are working under a continuation of last year's old- fashioned numbers. Vital research and development programs will go  unbegun. Not only that, keeping a CR going not only doesn't save money,  it actually costs us money because we are spending dollars on programs  we have decided not to be involved in anymore. We want to move in a  different direction. The House and Senate leaders have decided to do  that, the Members of the Pentagon have decided to do that, but under  the CR we are forced to keep spending money on programs we don't need  anymore.   According to General Martin, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, delays  and misallocated funds cost $7 billion every month, and that is just  for the Army.   We have an opportunity to correct this, or we have an opportunity to  waste another $20 billion on a yearlong CR. I am urging the American  public to make it known to those of us at Veterans Day programs this  weekend and next week. I am urging my colleagues to stress this when  they talk to the public.   There are appropriations bills that are not yet worked out, but for  heaven's sake, let's at least do the bill that pays the troops and  sends a signal to the rest of the world in these trying times that we  are at least going to fund our Defense Department and our future  veterans who are on Active Duty and who have taken the oath today and  that we will do them in a modern and timely fashion. We are 5 weeks  late. Let's not make it another 5 weeks after this and another 5 months  after that.   Pass a full-funding appropriations bill for our troops, for the  Department of Defense, and give them the type of representation and  government that they deserve based upon their worthy service.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
