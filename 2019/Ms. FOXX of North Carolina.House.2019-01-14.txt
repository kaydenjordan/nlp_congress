 Madam Speaker, this week, I am delighted  to celebrate the promise of school choice alongside thousands of  teachers, students, and their families.   Every student deserves an excellent education, and school choice  empowers parents to choose the right education for their children.  Through school choice, all students have increased access to charter  schools, magnet schools, private schools, homeschooling, and other  innovative programs designed to help students achieve their goals.   When we passed the Every Student Succeeds Act, we advanced reforms to  widen the reach of school choice and empower families and communities.   I am proud of these accomplishments and look forward to continuing  the work to protect and expand school choice and help students succeed.                            ____________________
