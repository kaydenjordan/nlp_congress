 Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator Jim Risch  and Representative  Mike Simpson, I congratulate three Idaho athletes  who competed in the XXIV Olympic Winter Games in Beijing. I commend  Andrew Blaser, Chase Josey, and Hilary Knight for their diligence and  dedication that resulted in them representing our great State and  country on this world stage.   Four-time Olympic medalist Hilary Knight, of Sun Valley, once again  competed with distinction on the U.S. women's hockey team. The team  earned a silver medal, and Hilary scored one of the team's two goals in  the final game. In the 2022 Olympic Games, she scored her 12th career  Olympic goals, becoming the second leading scorer in U.S. Olympics  Women's Hockey history. With 15 career Olympic assists, Hilary also  ranks second in most career assists. She played in her 22nd career  Olympic Game, giving her the record for the most Olympic Games played  in U.S. women's hockey history. This follows her earning a gold medal  in the XXIII Olympic Winter Games in PyeongChang; a silver medal in the  XXII Olympic Winter Games in Sochi; and a silver medal in the XXI  Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver.   Two-time Olympian Chase Josey, of Hailey, earned seventh place in the  snowboard halfpipe. Chase completed two frontside double cork 1080s and  a cab double cork 1260 in his third run of the 2022 Olympics, earning  79.50 points. He earned sixth place in the halfpipe in the XXIII  Olympic Winter Games in PyeongChang and was fifth at the 2021 world  championships.   Nick Blaser, of Meridian, who ranked 28th in the world, competed in  his first Olympic games on the U.S. Olympic Skeleton Team. With three  competitors, the team was characterized as ``small but mighty.'' Nick,  who came in 21st place at the 2022 Olympics, was a top pole vaulter and  hurdler at the University of Idaho before competing in skeleton after  college.   These athletes lead through their examples of dedication and  persistence. As younger generations watch, they show us all how to turn  preparation into achievements. Thank you, Olympians, for representing  Idaho and our country so well in the Olympics, while overcoming the  added pressures of training and competing during a global pandemic, in  a high-risk and dangerous political environment. We commend you for  your extraordinary hard work and commitment.                            ____________________
