 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, April 23, the  Army Reserve marked 110 years in service to the Army and the United  States of America, evolving from the Medical Reserve Corps in 1908 to  the most capable, combat-ready, and lethal Federal Reserve force in our  Nation's history.   I rise to say thank you to our soldiers, both past and present, and  their families for serving all these years.   In today's full-spectrum environment, America's Armed Forces must be  prepared to respond quickly to capable and sophisticated high-end  threats. They must conduct sustained counterterrorist operations, and  they must deter aggression in multiple regions of the world while  simultaneously defending the homeland.   The Army Reserve has a congressionally authorized strength of 199,000  soldiers, more than 11,000 civilians, and 2,075 units. The Army Reserve  accounts for 20 percent of the Army's organized units and provides  nearly half the Army's total maneuver support.   Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly thank the Army Reserve for defending  our Nation with honor and distinction for the past 110 years.                            ____________________
