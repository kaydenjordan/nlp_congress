 Madam President, I come to the floor today in having  heard the Senator from Washington--the senior Senator from Washington,  a Democrat leader--talk about something in this Senate Chamber, and she  called it outrageous.   Let me tell you what I find outrageous. Outrageous is the fact that  people all across this country are facing crisis after crisis, all  caused by the Democrats who are in charge of the House, the Senate, and  the White House. And on this day, the final day of the fiscal year, we  are spending time on a nominee who is completely unfit for the job for  which she has been nominated. That is outrageous.   But it has been one outrageous thing after another that I hear about  in Wyoming each weekend. In August, it was the chaotic abandoning of  Afghanistan, resulting in the deaths of 13 American heroes; hundreds  more individuals who lost their lives, or Afghani citizens--one of  those brave soldiers, Rylee McCollum, a marine, age just 20, was from  Wyoming.   President Biden's activities in Afghanistan, they were outrageous.  Because of his hasty retreat, the administration has enraged--enraged-- our allies around the world and has emboldened our enemies at the same  time. That is outrageous.   You know what is happening at the southern border?   And I would tell you, our weak immigration policies that resulted in  millions of illegal immigrants flooding into our country, that is  outrageous.   Across the West, a lack of fire mitigation and tree-thinning lacking  has contributed to raging forest fires. These fires threaten lives,  communities, and economies.   And here in Congress, Democrats continue to create chaos. Runaway  partisan spending has resulted in the biting pain of inflation and  spiking costs for families all across the country when they go to the  grocery store to buy food or go to the gas station and fill up. That is  outrageous.   So with all of these crises occurring across the Nation and the  world, what is Leader Schumer and the Senate Democrats choosing today  as one of their top priority for the Nation?   Well, it is confirming a nominee who has a history of having  collaborated with ecoterrorists.   We talk about the threat of terrorism around the world and the threat  of terrorism at home, and yet the Democratic leader is bringing to the  floor today a nominee of the President of the United States and,  apparently, endorsed and agreed to by all of the Democrats, who has a  history of ecoterrorism and has been involved in such. It is confirming  a nominee who collaborated with ecoterrorists, lied to the U.S. Senate,  wrote in favor of population control as a problem related to the  climate, and promoted the idea that homes built in the forest should be  left to burn. This is outrageous.   President Biden has nominated someone named Tracy Manning to serve as  the Director of the Bureau of Land Management. Across the West, it is  known as the BLM.   Ms. Stone-Manning lied to the Senate--lied to this very Senate this  year about her past association with an ecoterrorist cell that hammered  hundreds and hundreds of metal spikes--about 500 pounds of metal  spikes--into trees in Idaho's Clearwater National Forest.   If these metal spikes are struck by a logger's saw, the injuries to  the logger can be fatal. And it is not just loggers who use saws; it is  firefighters as well, going in to help fight fires. The same impact  would occur to them.   Ms. Stone-Manning anonymously sent a threatening letter to the U.S.  Forest Service on behalf of the ecoterrorists, of which she was one of  the ring leaders, and then spent years covering up their crimes, as  well as her own.   The lead investigator on the case sent a letter to our committee, the  Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The lead investigator sent that  letter to the committee to say that Ms. Stone-Manning was investigated  and she refused to cooperate as a result of the crime.   She had years to come forward, years to reveal the crimes, and she  never did. It wasn't until after she was caught and she was promised  immunity and she received that immunity--it was only then that she  agreed to testify.   Earlier this year, Ms. Stone-Manning lied to the Senate Energy and  Natural Resources Committee about her involvement as an ecoterrorist  and in ecoterrorism. When asked if she had ever done anything to  support tree spiking in any forest, she replied ``No.''   This is blatantly false. Ms. Stone-Manning's troubling record goes  beyond lying and collaborating with ecoterrorists. She has written  articles and a graduate thesis supporting the idea of human population  control.   And 1 year ago--not when she was a graduate student a number of  decades ago, but 1 year ago--she tweeted an article that her husband  had written, calling for homes built in the forest, allowing them to  burn during fires. She called the article a ``clarion call.''   Now, this is for the person nominated to be the head of the Bureau of  Land Management--a clarion call. That is not part of the  responsibilities and is the exact opposite of what we should expect  from the head of the Bureau of Land Management.   Tracy Stone-Manning is a dangerous choice to be put in charge of  America's public lands. And each and every Senator who votes to confirm  her will be held personally responsible for that vote. Her nomination  has been publicly opposed by the last two--the last two--BLM Directors,  by outdoor organizations, by sportsman's groups, pro-life  organizations, by loggers, by the Western States Sheriffs' Association.  The list goes on and on.   And might I mention that one of those past two BLM Directors was  President Obama's BLM Director, who said she was unfit for the position  to which President Biden had nominated her.   She is the wrong choice for this job. She should never be confirmed,  but that is exactly what Senate Democrats want to do today; and that is  outrageous.   At a time when America is facing mounting crises, Senate Democrats,  each and every one, is determined to confirm a nominee who collaborated  with ecoterrorists, lied to the U.S. Senate, and continues to hold very  dangerous views.   I emphatically oppose her nomination. Every single Republican in the  Senate opposes her nomination, and I urge courageous Democrats to stand  up and do the same.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  allowed to speak for up to 15 minutes and allowed to use a prop; and  that, when I finish, Senator Tester be allowed to speak for up to 10  minutes.    Mr. President, the Senate should emphatically oppose  the nomination of Tracy Stone-Manning to lead the Nation's Bureau of  Land Management.   It is hard to believe, but she has colluded with ecoterrorists, plain  and simple. She stonewalled a criminal investigation for years. She  lied to the Senate, and she still holds radically dangerous views; and  yet she is still the nominee of the President of the United States for  this very important post. It is outrageous.   Let's begin with her ties to ecoterrorists. We worry about terrorism  in this world and in this country. By her own admission in her court  testimony, when she was in graduate school, she collaborated with  ecoterrorists who had hammered hundreds of metal spikes into trees in a  national forest. It was in Idaho.   Tree spiking involves hammering a metal rod, like this one, into a  tree trunk. This can do serious damage. They put about 500 pounds of  these in tree trunks in a national forest. If a logger or firefighter  cuts this rod--you say, Why would a firefighter be there? They have  chainsaws and they work to clear areas to try to fight fires, or a  logger taking down trees--the saw will shatter, shrapnel will fly in  every direction, and the user of that saw could become terribly injured  or even killed. If a sawblade comes across a spike like this in a  sawmill, the saw can explode. The results could be catastrophic to both  life and limb.   Well, ecoterrorists who spike trees absolutely know what they are  doing. It is always premeditated. Even the Washington Post has labeled  tree spiking as one of the most vicious tactics of the ecoterrorists.  That is what we are dealing with President Biden's nominee to be the  Director of Bureau of Land Management.   You say: What is her connection to this horrible, horrible practice?   Well, she has admitted that she edited, typed, and then anonymously  sent a threat letter to the U.S. Forest Service on behalf of known tree  spikers. She and her Democrat defenders have claimed this letter was a  warning so no one would get hurt. That is false.   Here are just a few quotes from the letter she typed and she mailed  to the U.S. Forest Service:         You bastards go in there anyway and a lot of people could       get hurt.    And:         I would be more than willing to pay you a dollar for the       sale, but you would have to find me first and that could be       your WORST nightmare.    Think about these lines. Think about what it must be like if you had  received such a letter. She mailed this threatening letter to the  target of the tree spiking--and that was the U.S. Forest Service-- because she didn't want any trees in that area to be harvested.   She and her circle of friends were investigated for their involvement  with this ecoterrorist network and the attack. She was subpoenaed. She  had to give hair samples, palm sample, handwriting, fingerprint samples  to investigators.   All this time, she knew who the tree spikers were. She could have  gone to the authorities to identify them, but she refused, didn't  cooperate with investigators. The lead investigator on the case wrote a  letter to Chairman Manchin and to me after she had testified in the  Senate to the Energy Committee, and he referred to her as the  ``nastiest of the suspects.''   He also said she not only had knowledge of the plan to spike the  trees with spikes like this, she was one of the planners. She was a  ringleader. The lead investigator in the criminal case wrote:         It became clear that Ms. Stone-Manning was an active member       of the original group that planned the spiking of the Post       Office timber sale.    Now, he wasn't the only one who said she knew about it in advance. In  an interview recently, within the last couple of months, with the E&E  News, one of the convicted tree spikers, one of those who went to jail  for doing this, he also confirmed that Tracy Stone-Manning, the  President's nominee to run the Bureau of Land Management, to be in  charge of the national forests--that Tracy Stone-Manning knew of the  plan to spike the trees well in advance. This was premeditated.    So who have we heard from?   We heard from the criminal who is in jail--went to jail. We heard  from the cop who prosecuted the case. Both the cop and the criminal  agree that she was involved and she knew about the plan to spike the  trees.   According to the investigator's letter, Ms. Stone-Manning's lack of  cooperation would set back the investigation for years. From 1990 until  the end of 1992, the case went cold. Remember, she knew who spiked the  trees. She was protecting the ecoterrorists' identities the entire  time.   Eventually, Ms. Stone-Manning was identified, and she received an  investigation target letter to let her know she was being targeted as  part of the investigation. The lead investigator said she only agreed  to testify after she was caught and after her lawyer negotiated an  immunity deal to testify.   Her defenders have said she helped put the bad guys away. In fact,  President Biden's nominee is one of the bad guys. She helped plan the  tree spiking. She covered up the terrorist activity for years. She did  not cooperate with the authorities, and she only testified after she  was caught and received immunity.   After all of this, she lied to the Committee about the incident. On a  sworn affidavit in her Committee questionnaire, she said she was not  the target of any investigation. We know that is a lie. We know she  received a letter that she was a target of the investigation.   She complained in the press about how degrading it was to be  investigated. Then why did she tell us she was never investigated and  told the press how bad it was and degrading to be investigated?   She also admitted to the press that she could have been charged with  a crime if not for her immunity deal.   She also lied about her involvement in the tree spiking. I asked her  directly:         Did you have personal knowledge of, participate in, or in       any way directly or indirectly support activities associated       with the spiking of trees in any forest during your lifetime?    And she replied ``no.''   She sent their letter. She knew the plan in advance. She knew their  identities, and she refused to tell the authorities.   How is that not supporting activities associated with ecoterrorism  and tree spiking?   Finally, Senate Democrats are very quick to say this tree-spiking  episode was decades ago, can't be relevant anymore, in spite of the  fact that it is a Federal crime--as if collusion with terrorists is  just a youthful indiscretion. But she lied this year when she came to  testify to the U.S. Senate. She lied to our committee and she lied to  this institution.   It is clear to me that her radical views have not changed. In  September of 2020, 1 year ago, she tweeted an article written by her  husband that calls--because she would be in charge of areas related to  the forest--retweeted an article by her husband that calls for homes in  forests to be left to burn during wildfires.   Senator Sullivan talked about the fires in Alaska. We have had fires  in Wyoming. We have firefighters in there protecting structures and  human life.   Her husband says: Let them burn.   Her husband wrote:         There's a rude and satisfying justice in burning down the       house of someone who builds in the forest.    ``Rude and satisfying justice in burning down'' someone's home.   Tracy Stone-Manning isn't responsible for the views of her husband,  but a year ago--not as graduate student decades ago--we are talking  now, as wildfires burn across the country, she actually endorsed her  husband's views on letting the houses burn. In a tweet, she called her  husband's writing a ``clarion call.''   Well, clarion call, if you look it up, means a call to action.   As the Director of the Bureau of Land Management, Tracy Stone-Manning  would be in charge of firefighting operations on public lands. Yet her  husband and the things she retweets say: Let it burn.  [[Page S6831]]    Apparently, she is comfortable leaving the houses and homes of our  constituents in the Rocky Mountain West to burn because they built  their homes in the forest. I have constituents who have homes in the  forest. I am sure almost every Senator does. This tweet wasn't 30 years  ago. This tweet was 1 year ago.   Who actually thinks her beliefs are different today?   Her views on firefighting are just the tip of the iceberg. In her  graduate thesis, she actually argued that Americans need to have fewer  children. You know why? Because she says children are a threat to the  environment. She actually called children ``environmental hazards.''         Can you find the environmental hazard in this photo?    She told her readers to ``stop at one or two.''   She even made ads like this one to promote these ideas, the child as  an environmental hazard. And she is the nominee of the President of the  United States for an important position in this government.   She answered her own question by saying: Oh, yes, you can find the  environmental hazard, ``that's right, it's the cute baby.''   This thesis isn't the only time she argued for human population  control. In an essay in the High Country News, she said Americans were  ``breeding our weapons'' in the war on the grizzly bear. She concludes  that essay by saying: ``We should wage war on overpopulation.''   These are ideas you hear in communist China, not from the nominee to  be the Director of the Bureau of Land Management in the United States.   Mr. President, there are many qualified Democrats who could run the  Bureau of Land Management and do a fine job of it. We should reject  this nomination, and the President can nominate someone else.   It is astonishing to me to see Democrats digging in to defend a  proven liar, an ecoterrorist collaborator who still holds very  dangerous and threatening beliefs.   Bob Abbey was the BLM Director under President Barack Obama. He said  her actions ``should disqualify her'' from leading this important  Agency. One Biden administration official admitted on NBC News her  nomination was a ``massive vetting failure.'' So Obama's BLM Director  said she should be disqualified--her actions should disqualify her--and  a Biden administration official calls it a ``massive vetting failure.''   And when our Committee asked the Interior Secretary, Deb Haaland,  about Stone-Manning's views, her response was: ``I didn't nominate  her.''   Well, no, she didn't. The President of the United States did. This is  clearly not a rousing endorsement coming from fellow Democrats--the  White House, former BLM Director under President Obama, and now the  Secretary of Interior.   If she is confirmed, Senate Democrats will be held wholly  responsible. They should consider carefully if they want their name  associated with Tracy Stone-Manning. Tracy Stone-Manning should never  be the Director of the Bureau of Land Management.   I strongly oppose her nomination. Every Republican--every  Republican--strongly opposes her nomination, and Senate Democrats  should do the same.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
