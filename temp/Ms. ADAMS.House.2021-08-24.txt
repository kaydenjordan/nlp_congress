 Madam Speaker, Congressman John Lewis earned his  reputation as the conscience of this body because of his leadership  during the long march for equal rights at the ballot box.   John and so many people of conscience and courage were arrested,  beaten, bruised, and even murdered. The memory of being denied the  right to vote still dwells in the minds of countless Americans. Many of  those minds, like John's, survived crushing blows to the skull to earn  that right.   John fought and bled for voting rights. He led the charge for voting  rights. He should be honored by passing this bill drafted in his name.   We have had the promise of one man, one vote since the birth of this  country, and we can't backslide on this progress.   The John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act will help us get to  the promised land where every person has the right to vote.
