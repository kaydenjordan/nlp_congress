 Madam President, we have a great number of holidays each  year in America. But is there a more perfect holiday than the Fourth of  July? We celebrate the birth of our Nation. We gather with our families  for picnics, a trip to the beach, backyard barbecues, take in a  baseball game, and go to a parade. It is just the ultimate American  celebration. We relax, pull out our American flags, gather our kids,  and thank God that we are born in this great Nation and can call it  home.   But this last Fourth of July became a different scene in one part of  my home State of Illinois. It was the first time in years that the  people of Highland Park were able to gather together publicly. So there  was a special celebration as they gathered at 10 in the morning for the  Fourth of July parade.   Oh, in addition to the usual suspects at these parades, political  candidates, there were a lot of groups just there in pure celebration:  high school bands, gatherings of veterans, all sorts of groups in a  wonderful, wonderful suburban town in the Chicagoland area of Highland  Park.   Yesterday, we held a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee about  the day of the July Fourth parade in Highland Park. I wish we didn't  have to hold that hearing. I would rather it would have been some other  subject, some other place. But it was the 10th hearing during this  Congress--the 10th time--that we had held a hearing in the Judiciary  Committee on gun violence--gun violence, the No. 1 cause of death of  children in America. Let me repeat that: gun violence, the No. 1 cause  of death among children in America.   Yesterday, we focused on Highland Park and the Fourth of July parade,  and we focused on the obvious mass shooting incident that took place.  And we focused on military-style assault weapons.   The Fourth of July shooting in Highland Park, IL, was the 309th mass  shooting in America this year. What is a mass shooting? When four  people are either injured or killed--309 times it had happened before  July the Fourth.   By the time of yesterday's hearing, 16 days after the Fourth of July,  that number of 309 had grown by 47 mass shootings since the Fourth of  July in America--16 days, 47 more mass shootings.   Where else on Earth is this taking place? Nowhere. Right here in the  United States of America is the only place on Earth where mass  shootings are happening on such a frequent basis.   In many of the deadliest shootings, the attacker used an assault  weapon, a combat weapon--a gun specifically designed to kill the  maximum number of people in just a few seconds; the same weapon we saw  in Uvalde, TX, where the kids in their classrooms were killed; the same  weapon we saw in the supermarket in Buffalo, NY, when early morning  shoppers on a Saturday were killed; and, sadly, the same weapon that  was used in Highland Park.    During the Fourth of July parade in Highland Park, a deranged gunman  perched himself on a rooftop, using a Smith & Wesson assault rifle,  killing seven people and wounding dozens more. He shot 83 rounds in  less than a minute. Let me say that again: 83 rounds in less than a  minute.   This is Aiden McCarthy. Aiden is 2 years old. His mom and dad, Kevin  and Irina McCarthy, took him to the Fourth of July parade in Highland  Park. I first heard about him just an hour or 2 after this terrible  incident. I called my friend Nancy Rotering, who is the mayor of  Highland Park, and asked her: Tell me, what can I do?   She said: I don't know. Things are happening so fast. We actually  found a 2-year-old toddler who was wandering on the street by himself.  We don't know who he belongs to. His picture is being circulated in the  community.   The conclusion was fairly obvious. Whoever brought him to that parade  was not able to look for him and care for him. And the story eventually  unfolded. Kevin and Irina McCarthy brought Aiden to the parade--his  first parade. And then when the shooting started, they shielded him  with their bodies. In a matter of minutes, Aiden lost both of his  parents. Fortunately, a grandparent was located, and Aiden is in safe  hands today.   But because of this assault weapon being fired on the crowd, he lost  his mom and dad. That is the reality when a parent has to shield a  child like this from a mass shooting.   Nancy Rotering, as I mentioned earlier, is mayor of Highland Park.  She testified yesterday about the parade. She told us that when the  shooting started, she thought the sound of bullets was actually a drum  cadence from the local marching band. That is how fast the bullets were  being fired.   When she realized there was an active shooter, she began evacuating  the crowd. She said the adults she confronted stared back at her. They  didn't understand what she was saying. But the children, the teenagers,  they understood. This was a shooter; this wasn't a drill.   Did you hear that? The children and the teens at the Highland Park  parade instinctively knew what was happening because they had been  trained in their schools to deal with mass shootings. That is how  common these mass shootings have become.   I grew up in a different era, Cold War era, where it was duck and  cover under your desk for fear of a nuclear attack--an attack by the  Soviet Union. These kids--our kids, our grandkids--are being schooled  not just in the ABCs, but they are being schooled in survival, so that  if a shooter shows up in a classroom, they know what to do to try to  survive.   Mayor Rotering told the Judiciary Committee:         Our children are expected to return to school in [about] a       month. . . . They are frightened to go back. . . . They are       frightened to play outside. Many never want to go to . . .       parade[s] again. For the rest of their lives, they will look       over their shoulders, ready for another active shooter,       thanks to the drills our society has normalized [in our       classrooms].    She continued:         Playing outside is normal. Back to school is normal. Fear       of a shooter is not normal; but now in Highland Park       [Illinois] and so many other American communities, it is [the       new normal].    It can't be said enough that mass shootings with assault weapons are  a unique American phenomenon. They are devastating--so devastating.   I want to show you another picture with Aiden McCarthy. This is  Cooper Roberts, 8 years old. Cooper and his twin brother Luke went to  the parade with their mom and dad. And in the  [[Page S3585]]  course of the shooting, he was shot, taken to the hospital immediately.  He has gone through at least seven or eight surgeries now, touch and go  for many days as to whether he would live. And, sadly, in addition to  the damage that was done to his body, his spinal cord was severed by  this same bullet.   You see, when you fire an assault weapon at a human body, it hits  that body at three times the ordinary velocity of any other firearm. It  is so powerful that it was originally designed by the U.S. Army to  achieve a single goal described to us in the committee yesterday. That  goal was to be able to shoot one of these AR-15s and pierce a metal  helmet worn by a soldier 500 yards away--five football fields--the AR- 15. It is not another firearm. It is a killing weapon. And,  unfortunately, Cooper Roberts was in the line of fire. We pray that he  recovers.   His mom and dad have kept us posted, all of us posted, as to his  progress. But if you think about the devastation that an AR-15 combat  weapon assault rifle can do to a human body, imagine what it did to  this poor little boy's body. That is the reality of the issue we are  discussing.   Many gun manufacturers, like Smith & Wesson, Mossberg, Bushmaster,  and Daniel Defense have launched ad campaigns marketing their assault  weapons like they are fashion accessories.   Let me show you a few of them. This is from Mossberg:         Engineered to the specs of freedom and independence, stand       and salute the tactical rifle. We are America's oldest       family-owned firearms manufacturer, building dependable,       hard-working rifles and shotguns since 1919. American       built, American strong. Arm yourself with a Mossberg.    That is the type of weapon that shot Cooper Roberts, that killed the  parents of Aiden McCarthy. How is it being marketed? A symbol of  independence and freedom.   Some of these other ads--want proof of your manhood? ``Consider your  Man Card reissued,'' says Bushmaster with their AR-15.   I want to make sure, as we said at the hearing yesterday, that these  weapons are properly characterized. I will tell you how I characterize  them. The manufacturers of these weapons should be ashamed of what is  happening across America. To suggest that this typifies the values of  this country is just plain wrong and offensive. It is time for us to  name and shame these companies. It is time to hold them accountable for  the devastation they made possible. How many AR-15s are there in  America? We don't really know. The best estimate is 20 million--20  million.   I want to dispel a common talking point we hear from the other side  of the aisle. We heard it yesterday. They claim our communities don't  need new gun safety laws; all they need are good guys with guns. I wish  it were that simple. It is not.   In one survey of 433 active shooter attacks, how many were stopped by  a good guy with a gun? Twenty-two out of four hundred and thirty- three--about 5 percent. Half of those 22 were security guards and  trained law enforcement who were there present on the scene and off  duty.   The sad reality is, when the police come on the scene and someone is  holding a gun, they don't know if it is a perpetrator, a danger, or  somebody on their side. In many instances, they shoot the wrong person,  making a split-second decision in seeing a person holding a gun.   So this notion that we are going to come to the rescue of one another  and stop mass shootings is not a reality. Five percent of active  shooter attacks were stopped by a good guy with a gun--5 percent.  Imagine buying a car and being told there is only a 5-percent chance  that the airbag will go off if you need it in a crash? You wouldn't  take that car out of the dealership, and for good reason.   We heard testimony yesterday from RAND Corporation firearms expert  Dr. Kyleanne Hunter. She told us that assault weapons make mass  shootings significantly more lethal.   The evidence is clear. It is time for us to have a national  conversation about America and mass shooting.   Let me say that the manufacturers shouldn't get off the hook. They  aren't just selling you a product.   Let me show you one other thing that is particularly outrageous.  Sadly, this is in my home State of Illinois. It is a JR-15. It is  designed to look like the AR-15, the combat weapon assault rifle. It is  lighter, so it can be carried by a kid. Here are the symbols of this  JR-15. They are skulls, skulls of children. Each one of them has a  pacifier in his mouth. It isn't just on this poster, on this ad; it is  emblazoned on the gun itself. This is a kid's assault weapon. Think  about that for a second. In America, we have reached a point where that  is even thought of in light of the killing that has taken place.   The hearing yesterday showed an outpouring of people from Highland  Park in numbers I never expected. I believe there were 100 people there  who, on their own dime, came out to Washington to make sure all of us  in Congress knew what happened in Highland Park, how that village and  their lives were changed on the Fourth of July. What are we going to do  about it--shrug our shoulders and wait for tomorrow's mass shooting?  Sadly, we can expect one to come.   I listen to the defenses, but, frankly, I can't understand people  trying to defend the right to own an assault rifle in America.   One Senator argued: Well, it is just an inanimate object, you know.  Don't blame the object for the results.   I wonder if he feels the same way about a grenade launcher. Should  people have the right to own grenade launchers? I hope we can all agree  that is an incredible thought. Why doesn't this weapon fall into a  similar category, a combat, Army assault weapon that is being used by  individuals to kill so many innocent people in this country--kill them  at a concert in Las Vegas, at schools in Connecticut, at schools in  Texas, at Fourth of July parades in my home State.   Last month, we did come together--and I want to salute Senator  Murphy, who is on the floor--to pass a bill that was the most important  gun safety law we considered in three decades. I voted for it. It  didn't address this issue at all except in the background checks for  those under 21. And I am glad it did, but it didn't address the issue  of whether these guns should even be in America at this point, legal in  America. That, I think, is the critical threshold issue.   Incidentally, this shooter, who seemed to have a pretty ill-fated  life from the start, managed to buy high-capacity magazines so that he  could clip in quickly 30 rounds here, 30 rounds there, and fire off 83  times. Why in the world does anyone need a high-capacity clip magazine?  I don't understand it. It doesn't have any practical value for sport or  hunting.   We need to address the widespread, serious problem of civilian access  to military assault weapons, even for shooters as young as 18.   I thank the people from Highland Park for coming yesterday and all  the brave law enforcement and first responders whom I saw gather that  evening when I arrived at Highland Park. We owe them a lot. They are  doing an amazing job, and we should pay tribute to them and what they  did. But even they, being present and armed, could not stop this from  happening. They were up against a mighty weapon--a weapon we trust for  the military, we trust for the police; a weapon which has no place in  the hands of people like the shooter in Highland Park on the Fourth of  July.   Are we going to continue this American tradition of mass shootings?  Sadly, we will unless this body, this Senate, decides that it is worth  the fight, worth the political debate. After Highland Park, count me  in. I want to be on the record saying it is time to put an end to these  assault rifles, these weapons of war which have sadly taken so many  innocent lives like poor Aiden McCarthy's parents and five others who  died in Highland Park.   I hope for our children's sake that we don't run away from this  problem. The people in Highland Park had to run away from the Fourth of  July parade, and now they are counting on us to stand up and face it  squarely.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) and  the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Smith) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the  Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), the Senator from Minnesota (Ms.  Smith), the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) and the Senator from  Georgia (Mr. Warnock) are necessarily absent.
