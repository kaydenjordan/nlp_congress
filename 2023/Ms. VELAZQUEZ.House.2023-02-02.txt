 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this  resolution.   I think it is important that we clarify what my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle believe to be socialist policies. Historically,  Republicans have tried to label as socialist any Democratic actions  that improve the lives of Americans.   In 1996, Senator Bob Dole, the future Republican Presidential  nominee, referred to public housing as ``one of the last bastions of  socialism'' and called for an end to government-assisted housing  programs.   Public housing in the United States provides decent and safe housing  to 1.3 million families that are working class, elderly, or disabled.  This is what Republicans are calling socialism.   The 12-point plan to rescue America that Senate Republicans released  last year vowed to stop socialism and shrink the Federal Government by  enacting extreme policies like putting Social Security and Medicare on  the chopping block.   Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich promised that Medicare would  wither on the vine, thanks to spending cuts to combat what Mr. Gingrich  dubbed ``Big Government socialism.''                                time  1000    Social Security and Medicare are hard-earned benefits that provide  millions of seniors with healthcare and retirement funds every year.  This is what Republicans call socialism. From climate action and public  education to the Affordable Care Act and Social Security, Republicans  classify popular government programs to help working families as  socialism.   This resolution is a distraction from extremists and nothing more  than a thinly veiled scare tactic directed toward voters.   Why is it that we are here wasting our time discussing a resolution  about socialism? Guess what? Work on the budget. That is what you need  to do. You refuse to work on the budget because you will have to tell  the American people that you intend to cut benefits for Social Security  and Medicare.
