 I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Ms. Duckworth)  is necessarily absent.    Madam President, many of us were shocked when the  President tweeted that he was deploying the National Guard to the  border.   The President's claim that we face a crisis at our Southwest border  is simply false, and it is particularly ironic when the President  himself has repeatedly bragged--again, falsely--that illegal border  crossings are at an alltime low.   I remain concerned that the Trump administration is diverting Defense  Department resources to the border to help carry out its deportation  agenda. The Department is unable to tell Congress how much these  deployments may cost our Nation--paid for with money diverted from  other, critical defense programs. So far, the Department of Defense has  provided a preliminary estimate that these deployments will cost $182  million in fiscal year 2018, but there is no end in sight.   I am also concerned that these deployments may harm the readiness of  our National Guard by disrupting training for core missions. As one  local elected official in New Mexico noted in the Albuquerque Journal,  ``We're going into forest fire season. A big percentage of the state is  in drought right now, and if National Guard folks are continuously  rotated down to the border for a problem that doesn't exist, are they  going to be available for a real problem when it happens?''   Well, yesterday, Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson issued a  surprising report, which inadvertently agreed with these concerns.   Last year, Congress required the Department of Defense to examine  past deployments of National Guard troops to the border and to analyze  those experiences for whether they had been beneficial for those Guard  members. As Vice Chair of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I  received the Department's report yesterday.   It is fair to say that its conclusions are probably not what the  President wanted to hear from his own political appointees.   The report notes that several States have conducted training and  operations along the Southwest border. It concludes that training and  operations by California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas Guard units  ``does not directly contribute to collective core Mission Essential  Task readiness'' of those units. In other words, we are diverting them  from their most important missions.   It was even harsher in its conclusions for National Guard units from  other States traveling to the border for similar training. It describes  a pilot program to send 250 National Guard personnel to the border. Not  only did the pilot program cost a half a million more than that unit's  regular, scheduled training, but it also resulted in only 22 more  apprehensions than normal, while contributing almost nothing to the  unit's training.   The report also notes that these kinds of deployments ``comes at a  cost to the individual soldier, his/her family, and her/his employer,  as well as to overall united readiness.''   Is that what we want? To impose costs on our volunteer Guard  personnel, their families, their employers supporting their service?   The report goes on to say, ``Such tasking could also potentially  impact support to validated Global Force Management Allocation Plan  requirements.'' That is a mouthful, but it means that these deployments  could make our National Guard less prepared to respond to a natural  disaster back home or, God forbid, a war.   Is that what we want? No. There's an old adage that goes, when you  find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is to stop digging.   We all know that the President wants to build a wall on the border,  but he has failed to convince Congress that spending $25 billion on a  campaign promise is the right thing to do. Instead, he is sending the  outstanding women and men of the National Guard to the border, as if to  compensate for his inability to work with Congress.   I have met a great number of members of the National Guard, and I  know they will carry out their assigned duties as well as they can.  Many will view their deployments as a chance to serve the country they  love, but we owe it to them to send them on a mission that is worth it,  and the Pentagon's own study raises serious questions about that.   I hope that we end National Guard deployments to staff the crisis  that the President invented and get them back to their core job:  protecting their States and protecting this country.                            ____________________     Madam President, I would like to recognize a tragic  anniversary upon us this month. Four years ago this month, the  terrorist group Boko Haram kidnapped 276 girls in the dead of the night  from a school in Chibok, Nigeria, where they were taking final exams.   Some of the girls managed to run away, but Boko Haram abducted 219  girls.   These hundreds of young girls were held captive, abused, made to be  slaves, forced into marriage with their abductors, raped, starved, and,  in some cases, forcibly converted to Islam.   Some have tragically died while trying to flee or even during  childbirth.   You might recall the global campaign on Twitter, #BringBackOurGirls,  to urge the rescue of the girls.   Former First Lady Michelle Obama was moved to join the campaign for  the release of the girls, as were over 3 million people around the  world.   I, myself, was mortified to learn that, for the mere act of seeking  an education, the girls were abducted and forced into child marriage or  slavery. That is why, back then in 2014, I introduced a resolution  condemning the Chibok abduction and calling for the immediate, safe  return of the girls.   Since the kidnapping, just over 100 girls have been released, leaving  over 100 girls still missing. I fear some may have already perished.   Parents marked the fourth anniversary on Saturday by marching with  thousands of others to the school in Chibok where the girls were  abducted in 2014.   I think we should join them here in the Senate in remembering this  tragic anniversary.   That is why I have introduced, with some of my female colleagues, a  resolution calling for the immediate release of all Boko Haram  captives, especially the remaining Chibok girls.  [[Page S2475]]    The girls who have returned have told of the deplorable abuses Boko  Haram fighters made them suffer.   No one should be subject to the depravity of an organization that  doesn't value human life, let alone young girls simply trying to get an  education.   Unfortunately, since 2012, Boko Haram has conducted a violent  campaign of mass kidnappings of women, girls, and boys in Nigeria,  Cameroon, Chad, and Niger.   Boko Haram remains one of the deadliest terrorist groups in the  world, killing more than 13,000 people since 2013. The United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees says almost 2.5 million people in  Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, and Niger have been displaced--that is forced  from their homes--because of Boko Haram's brutality.   And the terror continues.   Just in February, Boko Haram militants stormed the town of Dapchi in  Nigeria and abducted 111 girls and 1 boy.   Thankfully, most of those children have been returned to their  families, but, heartbreakingly, some died during their ordeal, and one  girl still remains a hostage.   The New York Times recently ran a stirring front page piece about  some of the Chibok girls who have been freed. I applaud the  extraordinary bravery of those survivors, who have come forward to  share their stories and experiences at great risk to themselves.   The courage and strength of the girls who are still being held  captive to remain resilient in the face of unspeakable brutality is  deeply moving.   As a testament to their fortitude, let us all recommit ourselves to  ending discrimination and violence against women and girls, to ensuring  the safety and welfare of women and girls, to pursuing policies that  guarantee girls education, and to the release of the remaining Boko  Haram captives.   Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
