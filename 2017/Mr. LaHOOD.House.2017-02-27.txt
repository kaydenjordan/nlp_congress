A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials in the Record on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to honor the life, career,  and public service of Robert H. Michel, known as Bob Michel, former  Congressman of the 18th District of Illinois and the longest serving  Republican leader of the House of Representatives, who passed away  earlier this month on Friday, February 17. He was 93 years old. This  Thursday, March 2, he would have turned 94. He served in Congress in  this institution from 1956 to 1994.   To staff, friends, and colleagues, Bob Michel was more than a  Congressman and House leader. He was a mentor and larger-than-life  person. Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to stand before you and our  colleagues tonight to recognize the remarkable life of our departed  leader and friend. Over the past week I have had the opportunity to  hear testimony from friends, family, former colleagues, and the public  as they reflect on the reputation of Mr. Michel.   Among the many stories that have been told, it has been mentioned  time and time again the foundation upon which Bob Michel built his  remarkable career and reputation. Throughout Mr. Michel's 50 years in  politics, he never wavered from his values of civility, uncommon  decency, and humility. Those values were instilled in him at the  earliest age, rooted in his faith and family upbringing, and followed  him throughout his life.   Bob Michel was born to German and French immigrants in Peoria,  Illinois, on March 2, 1923, to Anna and Charles Michel. Hard work and  respect were required among the Michel children. After dinner each  night, it was mandatory for the Michel household to read the Bible  rather than go outside and play. The young Bob Michel was a product of  Peoria Public Schools.   Bob Michel didn't come from a privileged background or a family that  had money. He held numerous jobs, which played a formidable role in his  upbringing, teaching him the rewards of hard work and accountability.  His early jobs varied from mowing yards, delivering on two newspaper  routes, working in a factory, a tailor shop, and a grocery store.   Michel graduated from Peoria High School and attended one semester at  Bradley University before enlisting at age 19 as an infantryman in the  U.S. Army to fight in World War II. Michel landed in Normandy on the  fourth day of the D-day invasion of Europe and fought his way across  France and Belgium to the Battle of the Bulge. He was wounded in action  and was discharged after earning two Bronze Stars, a Purple Heart, and  four Battle Stars. When we talk about the Greatest Generation, Bob  Michel was a shining example of the Greatest Generation.   Bob Michel would return to Peoria, Illinois, after the war to  complete his business administration degree at Bradley University. He  joined the a cappella choir there, where he would meet the love of his  life, Corinne Woodruff. They were married for 55 years.   It was immediately after graduation that Michel's path into politics  started after then-president of Bradley University David Owen  approached Bob to inform him about a candidate by the name of Harold  Velde running for Everett Dirksen's congressional seat. After  interviewing, Velde hired Michel as a staffer. Years later, Michel  would go on to replace Velde in the House after he retired, winning a  contested four-way primary and defeating his Democratic opponent. Thus  began the service of Bob Michel in the U.S. House, which would lead him  to rise to the House leadership and serve a stint as minority whip and  eventually minority leader for 14 years.   Throughout his rise in leadership, Bob Michel remained grounded to  his district, never forgetting where he came from. Michel was masterful  at building personal relationships and represented the gold standard  for public service. That reputation derived from his commonsense  approach and midwestern upbringing.   This past Saturday, we laid Bob to rest in his hometown of Peoria,  Illinois. Bob was remembered at that time and honored as an American  hero, a tremendous public servant, a devoted father, husband, and  friend. Mr. Speaker, the life of this incredible statesman will never  be forgotten, and the legacy he has left behind should serve as a  reminder for how we as public servants can continue our work moving  forward.    Again, I am proud to stand with my colleagues tonight as a successor  to Congressman Michel's seat and to honor our beloved friend,  colleague, leader, and mentor.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus),  the dean of our Republican delegation.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Shimkus for those  beautiful words for Leader Michel.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Bustos),  who shares Peoria, Illinois, with me, Bob Michel's hometown, and she  was also at the funeral on Saturday.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Hultgren).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Hultgren for those  wonderful words for Leader Michel.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the  minority whip.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Leader Hoyer for those warm  words and inspiring words and heartfelt words for Leader Michel. It  means so much for his family, for all of us in Peoria, and for all of  his colleagues.   I want to thank everybody here tonight from the Illinois delegation  that spoke so fondly about Mr. Michel. When we think about the traits  that he exemplified--integrity, sincerity, humility, genuineness, and  civility--that everybody talked about here tonight, I think it is also  important to remember where he came from in Illinois.   The congressional district that he represented, the 18th  Congressional District, was the same district that Congressman Abraham  Lincoln represented from 1847 to 1849. It is also the same  congressional district that Everett Dirksen represented and that Bob  Michel represented for 38 years, and you think about the values that  they all exemplified, those strong midwestern values they never forgot.   The other thing that is unique about all three is they were all  buried within 1 hour of each other. Oak Ridge Cemetery, President  Lincoln; Pekin Cemetery, Everett Dirksen; and this last weekend, Leader  Michel in Peoria, Illinois. Bob Michel could have been buried in  Arlington Cemetery in a beautiful grave, but he chose to be buried next  to the love of his life in Peoria, Illinois. That says a lot about the  person that he was. I think it is unique that, within an hour's drive,  you can go see all three of their graves, but I think it reflects the  midwestern values that he had and those traits.                                time  2015    The other thing that I just want to mention here in closing is that  he served his 14 years as the Republican leader, the longest of anyone  in this institution as a leader of the minority party. But he also had  a number of people that he mentored and tutored: from Jack Kemp, to  Trent Lott, to Dick Cheney, to Newt Gingrich; people that served under  him, and he mentored in their positions, and that should not be lost.   Bob Michel was a conservative Republican, but the way that he went  about the work that he did, his style of civility and treating friend  and foe alike, and being able to work across party lines when he needed  to made this institution a better place. We need more people like Bob  Michel in public service. He is a shining example of what public  service should be. I couldn't be prouder to serve in the same  congressional district that he represented for 38 years.   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, he made us proud to be from Peoria, Illinois. He  made this institution a better place. He made this country a better  place by his service of over 50 years.   Tonight we say: Mr. Leader, rest in peace.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
