Harlem Hellfighters Congressional Gold Medal Act                                 H.R. 3642         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Harlem Hellfighters       Congressional Gold Medal Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) When the United States officially entered World War I       in April 1917, the Armed Forces were still segregated, even       though African-American soldiers had served and distinguished       themselves in every war since the Revolutionary War, and even       the Colonial Wars preceding the American Revolution.        (2) After several years of advocacy and debate, in 1916 the       State of New York authorized the recruitment of the 15th New       York National Guard Regiment, which was called to Federal       service on July 25, 1917, soon after arriving for training at       Camp Whitman, New York.        (3) The 15th completed its basic military practice training       at Camp Whitman, New York.        (4) To receive combat training, the 15th reported, on       October 8, 1917, to Camp Wadsworth, in Spartanburg, South       Carolina, where it experienced many incidents of racial       discrimination.        (5) Consequently, the government agreed to remove the 15th       from Camp Wadsworth, but, instead of receiving further       training, the regiment began preparing for deployment to       France in November.        (6) The 15th arrived in Saint Nazaire, France, on January       1, 1918, where it was redesignated the 369th Infantry       Regiment        (7) Partly because many White soldiers within the American       Expeditionary Forces (hereinafter, the ``AEF'') refused to       perform combat duty with Black soldiers, members of the 369th       were initially assigned manual labor tasks, such as loading       and unloading supplies, and constructing roads and railroads.        (8) After receiving pressure from the 369th regimental       commander about not having a combat mission, the AEF attached       the 369th to the French Fourth Army.        (9) By mid-March of 1918, the 369th went to the Argonne       Forest with the French 16th Division for training and soon       entered the trenches.        (10) The 369th encountered its first German soldiers in       combat in April, 1918.        (11) In May of 1918, Private Henry Johnson of the 369th       received the French Croix de  [[Page H2798]]       Guerre, with Palm, for extraordinary valor, becoming one of       the first American soldiers to be awarded this honor.        (12) Johnson also belatedly received a Purple Heart, was       awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, and in, 2015, was       awarded the Medal of Honor.        (13) Throughout the remainder of the spring and into the       summer the 369th served at Minacourt, in the Champagne-Marne       Defensive, and during the Aisne-Marne Offensive in support of       the French 161st Infantry Division.        (14) As summer turned to autumn, the 369th went on to       participate in the Meuse-Argonne offensive, where it captured       the important village of Sechault despite sustaining severe       losses.        (15) On October 14, 1918, the 369th advanced to Alsace.        (16) On November 20, 1918, the 369th reached the banks of       the Rhine River as part of the French Army of Occupation, the       first Allied unit to do so.        (17) The 369th was relieved of its assignment with the       French 161st Division in December, 1918, and elements of the       regiment sailed for New York in late January and early       February, 1919.        (18) The 369th Infantry Regiment received a parade up 5th       Avenue in New York City on February 17, 1919, receiving       applause and cheers from hundreds of thousands of onlookers.        (19) The 369th was demobilized on February 28, 1919.        (20) Over 170 individual members of the 369th received the       Croix de Guerre, many were awarded the Distinguished Service       Cross, and the 369th was awarded a unit citation.        (21) It is generally believed that the 369th was dubbed the       ``Harlem Hellfighters'' by German soldiers, who found the men       to be incredibly determined and courageous in battle.        (22) The 369th was the first regiment of African Americans       to deploy overseas during World War I and spent 191 days on       the front line in World War I, more than any other American       regimental sized unit.        (23) The 369th never lost a foot of ground nor had a man       taken prisoner, despite suffering a high number of       casualties.       SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.         (a) Award Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of       Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate       shall make appropriate arrangements for the award, on behalf       of the Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design to the       369th Infantry Regiment, commonly known as the ``Harlem       Hellfighters'', in recognition of their bravery and       outstanding service during World War I.        (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award       referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury       shall strike the gold medal with suitable emblems, devices,       and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.        (c) Smithsonian Institution.--        (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal in       honor of the 369th Infantry Regiment, the ``Harlem       Hellfighters'', the gold medal shall be given to the       Smithsonian Institution, where it will be displayed as       appropriate and made available for research.        (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the Smithsonian Institution should make the gold medal       awarded pursuant to this Act available for display elsewhere,       particularly at other locations associated with the Harlem       Hellfighters.       SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.         (a) In General.--The Secretary may strike and sell       duplicates in bronze of the gold medal struck under section       3, at a price sufficient to cover the costs of the bronze       medals, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery,       and overhead expenses.        (b) Proceeds of Sales.--The amounts received from the sale       of duplicate medals under subsection (a) shall be deposited       in the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.        (c) Authority to Use Fund Amounts.--There is authorized to       be charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise       Fund such amounts as may be necessary to pay for the costs of       the medals struck under this Act.       SEC. 5. STATUS OF MEDALS.         The gold medal struck pursuant to this Act is a national       medal for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States       Code.       SEC. 6.
