 Mr. President, the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the  people doing the truly essential work in our country, and it isn't the  Fortune 500 CEO, hedge fund manager, or investment banker. It is the  home healthcare worker providing essential care to homebound seniors or  the disabled. It is the delivery truckdriver working a 12-hour shift,  bringing food and medicine and other critical supplies to people who  need it. It is a grocery store clerk, working a checkout line or  stocking shelves to keep up with the skyrocketing demand. It is the  migrant agricultural worker picking berries or standing on an assembly  line at a meatpacking plant. It is the housekeeper or custodian working  longer hours to clean our hotels, offices, and other public places. It  is the childcare worker coming in every day to care for other children,  while being unable to afford care for their own. And it is the  busdriver who, despite operating on a tightly enclosed space,  transports hundreds of people to work every day.   These people, and others like them doing essential work, are  literally risking their lives every day for the rest of us, and they  are earning much deserved recognition during this pandemic. But let me  be clear. These workers have always been essential, even if our  economic system has not valued the jobs they do or treated them with  the respect they deserve.   Valuing and respecting essential workers is about more than calling  them heroes when that is the popular thing to do. It is about  recognizing and calling out how these workers have been treated in our  economy. And it is about doing something to fix it.   For too long, people doing the work now deemed essential during the  pandemic have been forced to work for low wages that are either at or  just above minimum wage, have jobs that offer no paid family or medical  leave, have little access to affordable childcare, have jobs that offer  no employer-sponsored healthcare coverage, and have been forced to work  in dangerous conditions.   Coping with these inequities in normal times was challenging enough  for our essential workers, but the pandemic, exacerbated by Donald  Trump's failure in leadership, is creating new problems, and it is  making existing problems worse. The administration's failure to  implement emergency safety standards is creating unsafe workplaces for  essential workers.   Meanwhile, it is pushing to provide businesses immunity from  coronavirus-related lawsuits. If they are successful, employers would  have even less incentive to provide safe workplaces for employees or to  protect customers and consumers.   Its failure to fully and effectively use the Defense Production Act  means the most vulnerable workers continue to face shortages of  personal protective equipment--putting them at greater risk for  contacting the coronavirus. And its failure to implement a national  testing and contact tracing program means that essential workers face  testing delays and may never be notified if a coworker has tested  positive for COVID-19.   As Donald Trump refuses to act responsibly to keep our essential  workers safe, this has fallen to States, local governments, and the  private sector.   In Hawaii, we are fortunate to have responsive State and county  governments, strong unions, and one of the lowest uninsured rates in  the country, thanks to Hawaii's Prepaid Healthcare Act. These  advantages, however, have not shielded Hawaii's essential workers from  the dangers of the pandemic.   Let me share a few of their stories. A few weeks ago, I spoke to a  group of transit workers who operate The Bus in Honolulu. A simple  shower curtain separates the drivers from passengers boarding their  buses. Many riders do not wear masks, putting the driver and other  passengers at risk for contracting the virus.   Drivers are also facing threats and physical violence when they ask  riders to put on a mask. One passenger even spat upon a busdriver who  asked the person to observe social distancing.   Many of the busdrivers live in multigenerational families. They spoke  about the fear that they will contract the virus on the job and bring  it home. Three bus operators have already tested positive, including  one just this week.   Transit workers in other industries have also experienced challenges  related to coronavirus safety. A group of Hawaii flight attendants I  recently spoke with are unable to be tested regularly due to supply  shortages, despite showing up to work every day. They also spoke about  their daily challenges convincing passengers to wear masks.   Essential workers are also providing childcare during this pandemic  so that other essential workers can continue to do their job. Katie, a  nanny on Oahu, whom I heard from recently, has provided childcare for  essential workers and military families on Oahu during the pandemic.  Katie lives with her mom, who has been battling stage IV cancer for  nearly 3 years. She is rightly concerned about the possibility she  might bring this virus home with her from work.   In April, Katie received a scare when one of the families she worked  with told her they might have been exposed. Katie is like so many  essential workers in Hawaii and across the country who live with  uncertainty about their jobs and families every day.   More firefighters, grocery store workers, bank tellers, postal  workers, community health center employees, and paramedics tested  positive for COVID-19 this week. They certainly will not be the last.   Something as simple as showing up to work every day shouldn't be an  act of bravery, but that is exactly what we are expecting from our  essential workers every day. If they can show up and do their job,  Congress can certainly step up and do its job.   It is why Senate Democrats have been fighting so hard to pass the  Heroes Act--to bring this to the floor, to debate the Heroes Act. The  Heroes Act includes a number of strong provisions that will support  essential workers during this pandemic. It establishes a $200 billion  fund to provide up to $10,000 of hazard pay to each essential worker.  It requires the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to issue  an emergency temporary standard within 7 days of enactment. It prevents  employers from retaliating against workers who report workplace safety  issues. It adds another $75 billion for COVID-19 testing, contact  tracing, and isolation measures. It also provides every American access  to free treatment for COVID-19. It provides access to free and  affordable childcare options for essential workers who are expected to  show up to their jobs regardless of whether they have someone to look  after their children, and it provides permanent paid sick and family  leave so that people don't have to choose between their jobs and the  health of their families   The Heroes Act is a bold, worker- and family-centric bill. We should  have passed it months ago. Instead, the bill has been sitting on the  majority leader's desk for almost 3 months now. He called it ``taking a  pause.''   The people suffering in our country didn't have the luxury of taking  a pause 3 months ago, and they certainly don't have the luxury to take  a pause now. As Senators, we are able to telework. We can attend  hearings remotely. We can stay socially distant. Maybe this is one  reason some Republican Senators don't have sufficient empathy or the  sense of urgency to pass the next COVID relief bill that would actually  help the busdriver who  [[Page S5243]]  can't drive a bus from home, the UPS driver who can't deliver packages  from home, the healthcare aide who can't administer medications to  seniors from home, the agriculture worker who can't pick coffee beans  from home, and the postal worker who can't deliver the mail from home.   Millions of people are suffering in our country today. They should be  able to count on the Senate to step up and take action to help them. At  this very moment, negotiators are deciding whom we will help and who  will be left behind. Democrats are fighting to protect essential  workers and help the unemployed.   Republicans are fighting to protect businesses from their own  negligence and allow corporate executives--corporate executives--to  write off their business lunches. These very different priorities  reflect very different values and point out what is at stake in these  negotiations. Protecting and assisting essential workers is a value. It  isn't enough to simply tell them ``thank you very much'' and call them  heroes. Actions speak louder than words. It is time for us to act. It  is long past time for us to act.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
