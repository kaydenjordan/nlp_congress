 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk for  Professor Dershowitz on behalf of myself and Senators McSally and  Moran.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question for counsel to the President,  directed to Professor Dershowitz, by Senators Wicker, McSally, and  Moran, is this:         Professor Dershowitz: You stated during your presentation       that the House grounds for impeachment amount to the ``most       dangerous precedent.'' What specific danger does this       impeachment pose to our republic? To its citizens?    Mr. Counsel DERSHOWITZ. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you,  Senators.   I came of age during the period of McCarthyism. I then became a young  professor during the divisive time of the Vietnam war. I, as you, lived  through the division during the Iraq war and 9/11 and following 9/11.   I have never lived at a more divisive time in the United States of  America than today. Families have broken up. Friends don't speak to  each other. Dialogue has disappeared on university campuses. We live in  extraordinarily dangerous times. I am not suggesting that the  impeachment decision by the House has brought that on us. Perhaps it is  merely a symptom of a terrific problem that we have facing us and  likely to face us in the future.   I think it is the responsibility of this mature Senate, whose job it  is to look forward, whose job it is to ensure our future, to make sure  the divisions don't grow even greater.   Were the President of the United States to be removed today, it would  pose existential dangers to our ability to live together as a people.  The decision would not be accepted by many Americans. Nixon's decision  was accepted--easily accepted. I think that decisions that would have  been made in other cases would be accepted. This one would not be  easily accepted because it is such a divided country, such a divided  time.   If the precedent is established that a President can be removed on  the basis of such vague and recurring and open-ended and targeted terms  as ``abuse of power''--40 Presidents have been accused of abuse of  power. I bet you all of them have. We just don't know some of the  charges against some of them, but we have documentation on so many. If  that criteria were to be used, this would just be the beginning of a  recurring weaponization of impeachment whenever one House is controlled  by one party and the Presidency is controlled by another party.   Now the House managers say there are dangers of not impeaching, but  those dangers can be eliminated in 8 months. If you really feel there  is a strong case, then campaign against the President. But the danger  of impeachment will last my lifetime, your lifetime, and the lifetime  of our children.   So I urge you respectfully, you are the guardians of our future.  Follow the constraints of the Constitution. Do not allow impeachment to  become a normalized weapon, in the words of one of the Framers. Make  sure that it is reserved only for the most extraordinary of cases, like  that of Richard Nixon. This case does not meet those criteria.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Arizona.
