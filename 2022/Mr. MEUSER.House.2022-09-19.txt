 Madam Speaker, over the past 21 months under the Biden  administration, border States and cities such as McAllen, Texas and  Yuma, Arizona, have seen hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants  enter their cities under these reckless border policies.   I, along with 59 Republicans, introduced H.R. 6592, the Immigration  Transparency and Notification Act, to provide for transparency of these  secret immigration flights conducted by the Biden administration into  my hometown and rural towns across America.   Thousands of illegals were flown into areas across the country with  no notice or coordination, yet no one flinched; no mainstream media  attention; no outrage from the White House.   Now that Chicago, D.C., and Martha's Vineyard have joined the party  and been introduced to open border policy, somehow, now this is a  national tragedy and unacceptable. This is hypocrisy at its highest.                            ____________________
