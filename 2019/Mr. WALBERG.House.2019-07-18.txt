 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 582,  better known as the Raising Unemployment for American Workers Act.   The bill's desired outcome may be well-intentioned, and you will hear  hypothetical numbers from my good friend and chairman of the committee,  assuming jobs are kept, which they won't be.                                time  0945    In reality, it causes harm to the very people it is supposed to help.  Just ask the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.   According to a CBO analysis of this legislation, it could eliminate  up to 3.7 million jobs with a minimum wage increase, but the loss of  3.7 million jobs, and reduce family income by $9 billion.   Low-income workers without a high school degree would be hit the  hardest.  [[Page H7102]]    We have seen the real-world consequences of a $15 minimum wage in  cities like Seattle. It resulted in small businesses cutting jobs and  workers receiving fewer hours and overall take-home pay.   Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, there is a better way to  boost income for hardworking families. Let's focus on policies that  keep our economy thriving and create more opportunities for all  Americans to find good-paying, living-wage jobs that allow advancements  as well, not just minimum wage.
