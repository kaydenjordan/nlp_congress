 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, yet again, to urge my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on today's vote to override the President's  veto of H.J. Res. 76.   It is unconscionable that any institution of higher education would  engage in fraudulent misrepresentation to prey on student loan  borrowers, particularly veterans who are able to qualify for GI  benefits to attend schools.   President Trump's commonsense rule would help students who were  defrauded and suffered financial harm by any school, giving them the  opportunity to individually make their case, ensuring due process for  all parties. It would also save taxpayers $11 billion, compared to  President Obama's last-minute, one-size-fits-all rule that did not hold  schools accountable.   As a member of the Education and Labor Committee and the former  chairman of the Higher Education Subcommittee, I strongly urge my  colleagues to vote ``no'' today.
