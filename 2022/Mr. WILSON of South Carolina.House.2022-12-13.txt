 Mr. Speaker, last week the average for  a gallon of gas was shamefully $1 more than when Biden took office. A  gallon of diesel, fuel for trucks and ships, is nearly 50 percent  higher.   Due to irresponsible energy policies of Biden and Democrats,  inflation reached 40-year highs, and families are hurting. In the last  year, one-third of households have reduced or skipped necessities like  food and medicine to pay energy bills, according to a LendingTree  survey.   The National Energy Assistance Directors Association has said that  household energy costs will be the highest in 15 years.   On Saturday, I was grateful to be on a codel warmly welcomed in Kiev  by Ukrainians thankful for defensive weapons which last week stopped 85  percent of Putin's missiles and Iranian drones. Putin must be stopped  from freezing Ukrainians to death as Stalin starved Ukrainians to  death.   President Biden joined Turkish President Recep Erdogan and French  President Macron pledging additional defensive weapons to courageous  President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from an Afghan safe haven to America.                            ____________________
