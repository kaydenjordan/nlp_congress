 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Irish  Diaspora Center on opening its new office in my district.   I had the opportunity to join supporters of the center this weekend  at its new cultural hub in Havertown, where I had the pleasure of  sharing food and swapping stories with fellow Irish Americans.   For decades, this organization has supported and celebrated the  vibrant Irish community in the Philadelphia region with passport and  citizenship services, senior outreach, youth programs, genealogy  services, and educational and cultural events.   People of Irish descent have historically formed the largest ethnic  group in my district, and to this day, we proudly continue to welcome  new Irish American citizens. With almost a quarter of the population  claiming Irish heritage, Delaware County is even sometimes referred to  as the 33rd county of Ireland.   I look forward to supporting and celebrating our Irish neighbors both  at home and abroad as I work with Chairman Neal and the Friends of  Ireland Caucus to protect the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement  and maintain peace and prosperity in Ireland.                            ____________________
