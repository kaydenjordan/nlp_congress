 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 3935, the  Securing Growth and Robust Leadership in American Aviation Act, more  commonly known as the FAA authorization.   My home State of Ohio, the Birthplace of Aviation, and H.R. 3935 will  ensure Ohio's 13th Congressional District continues to be a pioneer in  the aviation and aerospace industry.   H.R. 3935 invests billions into airports large and small, including  Akron-Canton Airport in my district and the Kent State University  Airport in my district, to keep our skies safe and to make our aviation  infrastructure cleaner and greener.   Notably, this bill includes important provisions that I supported for  advancement of a remote tower program in Ohio. The remote tower program  will improve traffic control for aircraft that utilize smaller  airports, generating economic development and safer air spaces.   Not only that, but the Ohio remote tower program will also support  the research and development of Advanced Air Mobility applications,  cutting-edge technology which has the potential to change how people  travel from small communities, how healthcare services can be delivered  to critical areas of need, and to offer a more sustainable mode of  transportation.   Finally, this legislation supports the hiring of 15 additional rail  investigators. That is important to northeast Ohio. As we all know, the  train derailment in East Palestine has devastated our community, but  train derailments have devastated communities across the country. This  amendment allows for more timely and more thoughtful accident reports  being reported to Congress so that we can act accordingly.   H.R. 3935 improves the health, safety, and well-being standards of  aviation, both on the ground and in the air. The bill also protects  consumer rights and improves accessibility so all people in Ohio's 13th  District can travel with safety and dignity.   Once again, Mr. Chair, I am proud to support this legislation.
