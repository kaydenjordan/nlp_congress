 Madam President, as I offer these remarks on the Senate  floor today, tensions between Israel and Palestine continue to escalate  to levels we haven't seen in years. Innocent lives have been lost, and  hundreds face injuries.   While the global media reports largely paint Israel as the instigator  of violence, this portrayal is patently false. It is simply not only  not backed up by fact, it is contrary to the facts.   Hamas, a U.S.-declared, U.S.-designated terrorist organization,  purposely exploited a nonviolent point of tension as justification to  trigger a violent set of conflicts.   On Monday night, Hamas launched thousands of rockets into Israeli  cities. The intended targets? Well, the intended targets were any  Israeli person, civilian or not, residential or commercial. The goal?  Just to create destruction and terror.   So to paint this action of armed aggression as anything other than  offensive terrorism is disingenuous, and we in the United States and  the U.S. Government itself must acknowledge and affirm Israel's right  to take proportional action to defend itself against these attacks.   What is perhaps even more disturbing and distressing than the media's  portrayal of these ongoing events is the Biden administration's ongoing  nuclear conversations in Vienna with Hamas's No. 1 supporter--the  Iranian regime.   Iran, of course, is a well-known state sponsor of terrorism. It is a  major funding source for Hamas, and their leaders continue to heap  praise on Hamas, specifically for its attacks against Israel.   Israel is undoubtedly our strongest democratic ally in the Middle  East, and together, the United States and Israel have made great  strides--tremendous strides, historical, unprecedented strides--toward  peace and stability through the region through the Abraham Accords.   The Biden administration's nuclear talks with Iran, as well as its  posture of willingness to concede on sanctions relief to Iran without  any meaningful corresponding gains to U.S. security, undermine both the  U.S.-Israel relationship and the new partnerships formed by the Abraham  Accords.   We really must stand with our strongest democratic ally in the  region, and we need to do that by recognizing Israel's right to self- defense against terrorism.   U.S. policy really ought to be geared toward strengthening and not  undermining this valued relationship. We certainly undermine that  relationship when we legitimize a regime that is funding these very  same terrorist activities.   I have gotten updates. Some of them are difficult to come by, given  that sometimes it is hard to find real-time, accurate facts on what is  happening on the ground. In addition to relying on U.S. media, I have  relied on media sources from throughout the world. I have also spoken  to people familiar with the area and in some cases, people who have  lived or currently live in Israel.   My friend Ruth Lieberman, a joint citizen of the United States and of  Israel, recently commented, just noting the exasperation that is in the  air, noting the genuine source of frustration that she feels. She said:         My kids are sitting ducks, and the world thinks we're the       aggressors.    Ruth is one of many Israeli citizens--one of countless Israeli  citizens--subjected to these attacks. It is Ruth and her husband and  their children who are among the many whose lives are put at risk every  single day as a result of these cowardly acts of aggression.   So we can't hesitate to condemn violence when we see it; nor can we,  nor should we ever step back and pretend that this is something that  can be perceived as a situation where language of moral relativism or  even moral neutrality can fairly be applied. On some days, that would  almost be a good day, if you could truly look at both sides, if the  mainstream media could look at both sides with language of moral  equivalence, but they don't. They don't even do that. Instead, they  largely refuse to blow the whistle on the aggressor and heap only blame  and vitriol on our ally, which is not the aggressor.   There are others who, regardless of whether they use terms of moral  equivalence wrongly or even unfairly, heap blame on Israel and on  Israelis. Some will resort to a different tactic, expressly or in some  cases implicitly saying: Yeah, I know this is bad. Yeah, I know it is  bad when hundreds and then thousands of rockets rain down on Israeli  citizens, innocent victims, civilians, often in residential  neighborhoods. Yeah, I know that is bad, but then again, Israel has a  strong military, in part because the U.S. supports its strong military  and shares funding and equipment with the Israeli military.   Let's think a little bit about the flawed logic there, how truly  messed up that is. You know it is cold comfort to the men and women and  children whose lives are put in danger every single day when they have  rockets raining down on them; it is cold comfort to them when their  loved ones die or are afraid to go outside even when they haven't done  anything wrong; it is cold comfort to them to say: Well, at least  Israel has a strong military.   Look, Iron Dome and David's Sling--these great technologies that have  been developed with the support of the United States--they provide a  great source of security and comfort and safety to the Israeli people,  and these same technologies benefit the American people as well. But  let's remember, those technologies are not foolproof. They can't catch  every single rocket. The more rockets that fire, the more difficult it  is to protect citizenry from casualties. So let's never make that  mistake of saying it is not that big of a deal because Israel is well  fortified and has a strong military infrastructure and Israel has  sophisticated, top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art equipment   It doesn't excuse--nor can it in any way, shape, or form negate--the  terrors to which they are subjected. Look, whenever someone aggresses  and starts firing on someone else, they are opening up a whole can of  worms. We can't be good allies and we can't be good global citizens  unless we are willing to call out acts of unprovoked aggression, acts  of violence, acts even of terrorism.   Unless we are willing to step out and call those evil and unprovoked  and unwarranted--unless we are willing to do that--we won't have the  credibility that we need, not just with our allies but also with our  enemies. We have to make sure that Hamas doesn't enjoy our support--not  directly, not indirectly, not through our acquiescence or otherwise.   My thoughts and prayers go out to the people in Israel. Everyone gets  hurt--the Israelis and the Palestinians--when Hamas engages in violence  and then tries to pass that violence off as somehow a defense on their  part. Nor can we allow Israel to be castigated as the aggressor, as the  instigator of these acts of violence, when it is plainly and clearly  not true.   I hope our friends in the media and in the Biden administration will  acknowledge that.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S2475]]
