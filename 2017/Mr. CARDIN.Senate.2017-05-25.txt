 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize May as Asian  Pacific American Heritage Month and celebrate the many contributions of  Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, AAPI. The Asian American and  Pacific Islander community is diverse and draws from a variety of  distinct cultures, each of which has strengthened this country-- providing leaders, innovators, scientists, activists, artists, and  citizens.   As we take the time to recognize Asian Americans and Pacific  Islanders and their heritage, it would be negligent to forget that this  year marks 75 years since President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed  Executive Order 9066. He signed Executive Order 9066 in the aftermath  of the attack on Pearl Harbor and authorized the Department of War-- today known as the Department of Defense--to establish ``military  zones.'' The military had complete authority over these zones,  including control over who entered and who was permitted to leave. The  military zones became internment camps. In total, some 75,000 Americans  of Japanese ancestry and 45,000 Japanese nationals were imprisoned in  these camps across the country.   At the time, many attempted to justify the internment camps by citing  Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. They cited the need to protect our  homeland from potential espionage. They cited the fact that Japan was  our wartime enemy. They cited the likelihood that the next attack would  come from someone ``looking like'' the enemy.   What they failed to explain was why no internment camps were  established for Americans of German ancestry--or Italian ancestry.  Japan was not our only wartime enemy; yet Japanese Americans were the  only ones thrust into imprisonment under the guise of ``national  security.''   It is not difficult to guess why. Japanese Americans were targeted  because their heritage was thought to be easier to perceive. Of course,  in many cases, the U.S. Department of War did not draw distinctions  between Americans of Japanese ancestry and Americans of other Asian or  Pacific Islander ancestry. If you were thought to look like the enemy,  you were a target--full stop--and were at risk of being imprisoned  illegally by the American Government.   This is one of the darkest periods in our history. We must not forget  it. We cannot forget the tens of thousands of innocent families who  were stripped of their basic human and legal rights and  [[Page S3205]]  property, racially profiled, and degraded. We cannot forget that  ``national security'' was then--and is now--a poor justification for  racial profiling and a transparent attempt to sanction and  institutionalize racism.   These are lessons the Asian American and Pacific Islander community  has carried for generations, all while making our country stronger and  more inclusive. The AAPI experiences--when we take the time to hear  them--force us to engage in self-reflection, to be more aware of our  own biases, and more cautious of our own impulses.   As the former chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign  Relations Subcommittee on East Asia and the Pacific, I have worked hard  to stay mindful of the needs and concerns of the AAPI community. I have  learned that, while we have come a very long way over the past 75  years, the AAPI community still battles nativism that portrays its  members as something other than ``real'' Americans. They still bear the  burden and pain of discrimination, and they still struggle to have  their voice and their perspective heard during the great debates of our  time.   The changes Republicans are seeking on healthcare, for example, would  have far-reaching consequences for the AAPI community. Asian Americans  and Pacific Islanders have one of the highest incidences of Hepatitis  A. In fact, in 2013, they had the highest Hepatitis A rates out of any  ethnic group in the country. In 2015, tuberculosis was 30 times more  common among Asian Americans than among any other group. Both Hepatitis  A and tuberculosis would be considered preexisting conditions-- conditions that would have made many Asian American and Pacific  Islanders uninsurable before President Obama signed the Affordable Care  Act into law and conditions that would result in sky-high premiums  under the misguided American Health Care Act.   By comparison, the Affordable Care Act has reduced the uninsured rate  for minority communities by at least 35 percent. It also expanded  Medicaid, allowing over 250,000 more Maryland beneficiaries to access  an array of mental health services like therapy, psychiatric  rehabilitation, and many others. The Affordable Care Act's Medicaid  expansion had similar positive impacts for mental health services  across the country, which affects Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders  directly as they continue to work tirelessly to reduce suicide rates.  For these reasons, when we think of healthcare, we must consider the  human cost our policies inflict on every community--on every American.   Likewise, immigration bans based on country of origin, race, or  religion are awakening newfound fear that minority communities will be  targeted once more, that racial profiling will rear its ugly head  again, licensed and sanctioned by the Federal Government. The AAPI  community's concern is warranted; people's fear is understandable. Each  Member of Congress must realize that caring about the mistakes of our  past means working with purpose and with conviction to prevent them  from happening again in the present. We must use our votes where our  values need defending and our voices where there is silence.   As we move forward through Asian Pacific American Heritage Month and  beyond, I implore every member of this Chamber to remember that the  best way to honor that heritage is to respect the community bearing it.  Hearing their experiences, carrying their lessons with us into the  policy arena, and considering their needs and fears as our own, these  are the substantive ways by which we can truly honor Asian American and  Pacific Islander Heritage. I am committed to honoring it accordingly  and join every American of Asian or Pacific Islander heritage in  celebrating this month as their own.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and celebrate  Jewish American Heritage Month. As a proud Jewish American, I am  honored to have the opportunity to acknowledge our heritage and the  ways by which it has helped shape this country. The list is a long one,  but this year, I want to focus on Mendes Cohen, whose legacy serves as  a microcosm of our community.   Mendes Cohen was born in Richmond, VA, in May of 1796 to Israel and  Judith Solomon Cohen, both of whom were immigrants. Mendes's father  came from Germany, and his mother came from England. His father died  when Mendes was just 12 years old. The event was a tragedy, of course,  for Mendes, his six siblings, and his mother, who moved the family to  Baltimore for a fresh start shortly thereafter.   Mendes grew up not far from where I grew up; he was raised not unlike  I was raised. He believed in the value of public service. He believed  in serving his country and working for the good of his community. He  held fast to an ideology based on tolerance, equality, and fraternity.  It was precisely this ideology that led him to fighting in the War of  1812 at Ft. McHenry. After the war, he and his brother Jacob began  lobbying to change Maryland's constitution so that Jews could run for  public office. In 1826, he was successful, and by 1847, he was a  delegate in the Maryland General Assembly. He carried his love of  country and belief in public service with him throughout the remainder  of his life, going on to serve as a delegate to the State Peace  Convention during the Civil War.   Mendes was, simply put, a historic marvel. He was a forward thinker,  an activist, a consummate public servant, and a proud Jew. He broke  down the single greatest barrier to Jewish entry into public life and  opened the door for Jews--including me--to pursue public service.  Today, as I stand in this Chamber as a U.S. Senator from Maryland, I am  struck by the impact of Mendes Cohen's legacy. If I were able to speak  to him now, I would tell him: thank you. Thank you for paving the way  for me to have it all: my faith, my family, my heritage, and my career  in public service. If Mendes were able to speak now, I imagine he would  tell us that his work is unfinished. He would encourage us to continue  carrying the torch of public engagement and civil service. He would  remind us that path toward progress, by its very definition, has no  endpoint.   These values underpin the broader Jewish community in Maryland and  across the country. We learned early in our own history that the tide  of oppression and bigotry can rise quickly and that, when it floods one  shore, it floods them all. We learned that, when it comes for one  community, it spares none. We learned that we must be our own  stewards--that pluralism and equality demand constant guardians and  that, when prejudice threatens them, nothing but our own tenacity can  fend it off.   That tenacity is needed now more than ever, as we are confronted by  resurgent anti-Semitism in every corner of the world--even here, at  home. In the past few months, we have witnessed hate speech targeted at  the Jewish community on social media, the ostracism and vilification of  Jewish students on college campuses, and attacks against Jewish  businesses and synagogues; yet it is precisely because the Jewish  community has endured generations of persecution that promoting  tolerance, equality, and inclusion has become a central tenant of  Jewish American culture.   Jewish Americans participated in the abolitionist movement in the  19th century. They joined the ranks of the Student Nonviolent  Coordinating Committee during the Civil Rights movement. The  partnership between Julius Rosenwald and Booker T. Washington resulted  in the construction of thousands of schools for African-American  children in the South throughout the 20th Century.   Jewish Americans are proud of their history promoting such causes.  They are proud of their faith and their heritage, but they are also  proud to profess their support of other people's faiths and heritage.  They are proud to be guardians of a free and pluralistic society; they  are proud to weave love out of millennia of knowing hate. That is the  story of Jewish Americans. From Mendes Cohen to the American Jewish  community's defense of diversity and inclusion today, every chapter we  write, though unique, shares the same theme: progress--progress and  equality.   Jewish Americans have, therefore, helped make the United States the  force for human and equal rights that it is today, but each day, we  face challenges to those ideals, challenges that  [[Page S3206]]  have felt increasingly ominous in recent months; yet this country will  remain a beacon for the oppressed and the downtrodden. That beacon will  stay lit due, in no small part, to the continued activism and  conviction of the Jewish American community. This month, we thank them  for that service, as we remind ourselves that our work goes on.                            ____________________
