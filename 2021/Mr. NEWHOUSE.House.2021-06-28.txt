 Madam Speaker, it is always unconstitutional for  government to restrict the rights of law-abiding gun owners, but to do  so in the midst of a crisis is especially unconscionable.   Unfortunately, Governors across the country, including Washington's  Jay Inslee, has used the COVID-19 pandemic as justification to  disregard the Founders' intent to preserve this right, excluding those  in the firearms industry from essential worker designations.   Denying Federal firearms licensees the ability to operate under  essential worker designations not only infringes on the Second  Amendment rights of Americans, but also recklessly ties the hands of  our law enforcement officers who require access to these tools to  ensure the safety of our communities.   The Homeland Security Act of 2002 establishes guidelines for States  regarding who should constitute critical infrastructure workers in the  event of a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, or other man-made  disaster.   Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have often referred to these  individuals as ``essential workers.'' Likewise, the USA Patriot Act  defines critical infrastructure as systems and assets so vital to the  United States that the incapacity or destruction of such system and  assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic  security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those  matters.   The Founders were clear in their drafting of the Second Amendment  that the right to bear arms is necessary to the security of a free  State. In other words, the Second Amendment is essential to our system  of government.   While essential worker designations have been arbitrarily decided and  enforced from the outset, forcibly shutting the doors of those who  enabled Americans to exercise their Second Amendment rights is  obviously motivated by a radical anti-gun agenda.   There is no question that the firearms industry is vital to the  security of the American people. The rights of Americans, including the  rights to keep and bear arms, are no less essential during a state of  emergency. In fact, the right to defend one's self and one's home is  most essential during a state of emergency. States of emergency merit  our heightened vigilance to protect against unnecessary and  unconstitutional government outreach.   In 2020, Americans sought to exercise their Second Amendment right so  they could have peace of mind during a turbulent time. As demand rose,  Americans faced delays due to the unconstitutional shutdowns imposed by  Governors across the country.   That is why I introduced the Second Amendment is Essential Act. This  legislation protects law-abiding citizens' ability to exercise their  Second Amendment rights and prevents future anti-gun restrictions that  restrict lawful access to firearms in times of emergency.   This act will classify, by law, the firearms industry as a critical  infrastructure sector and those it employs as essential workers by  amending the Homeland Security Act of 2002, and the USA Patriot Act of  2001.   Firearms manufacturers and dealers should not be forcibly closed by  government in a time when demand for  [[Page H3163]]  their products is high, and law-abiding citizens should never have any  of their constitutional rights restricted.   This legislation will ensure the Second Amendment can be freely  enjoyed by Americans when they need it most: in times of crisis.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  legislation and ensuring that the constitutional rights of our fellow  Americans are protected.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Brad Sawatzke,  who is retiring as CEO of Energy Northwest.   A leader to his core, Brad has been an invaluable member of the Tri- Cities community and has led Energy Northwest into the future with  vision, enthusiasm, and determination.   I had the pleasure to know Brad, and his impressive resume merits  recognition.   To earn money during college, Brad began his nuclear career as a  janitor, and over four decades his hard work resulted in numerous  leadership positions. Brad now retires at the pinnacle of his industry.  What could better embody the American Dream than a career where grit  and merit are so rightly rewarded?   During his tenure, Columbia Generating Station became one of the top- performing nuclear plants in the country, and the company is leading in  clean energy innovation by spearheading the deployment of advanced  nuclear technologies.   I thank Brad and his wife, Kim, for their many contributions to  Washington State, and I wish them the best in this new, well-earned  chapter of their lives.                            ____________________
