 Mr. President, at the end of each session of the Congress,  we, the Senate, take a moment to express our appreciation and  acknowledge the efforts of those Members who will be retiring in just a  few weeks. This year, one of our colleagues who will be leaving is  Senator Jeff Flake.   Jeff will be leaving us after a career of nearly 20 years in  Congress. He has impressed many of us with whom he has worked with the  strength of his views and determination to fight for those things in  which he truly believes, both as a Senator and a proud husband to his  wife Cheryl and father to his five children. He has been a reliable  advocate for what he sees as the best interests of Arizona and the  future of the Nation. He leaves behind a legacy of which he should be  very proud.   Jeff was born in Snowflake, AZ. His family name was well known to the  people in his neighborhood in part because it was named for his great- great-grandfather, William J. Flake, an early pioneer. His family  played an important role in the founding and day-to-day life of their  town, and Jeff always embodied the pioneering spirit through his work  in Congress.   After graduating from Brigham Young University with a bachelors of  arts in international relations and a master of arts in political  science, he took a 2-year leave of absence to serve as a missionary for  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in South Africa.   Jeff's early career work as the executive director of the Foundation  for Democracy in Namibia and executive director of the Goldwater  Institute helped prepare him for the House of Representatives. He  became a strong voice for the political views of the people from back  home.   Several years later Arizona's Senate seat was open and Jeff took up  the challenge. The people of Arizona and our Nation were fortunate to  have him to rely on for so many issues. He has been a steady and  dependable force for tackling difficult, complex, and occasionally  unpopular issues in the Senate while remaining respectful of his fellow  colleagues and loyal to Arizona.   As a Senator, Jeff worked tirelessly to reduce the deficit and  control government spending. As chairman of the Senate Budget  Committee, I sincerely appreciate his efforts and share the same goal  of reducing waste and ensuring the government operates efficiently. His  keen insight and attention to these critical issues will surely be  missed in Congress.   While serving with him in the Senate, I also learned that Jeff is an  avid survivalist. It was a pleasure to read about his excursions to  small, distant islands with only a few key survivalist tools in tow. As  an Eagle Scout, I understand how important these skills are to have,  and it is always fun to hear about others putting these critical skills  to use and what they learn along the way. If he would like to continue  participating in survivalist adventures after leaving Congress, I would  be happy to recommend some places in Wyoming that he might enjoy  camping in for an extended period of time.   We both have a strong western heartbeat that we express every day in  everything we do. Diana joins in sending our best wishes to Jeff and  his family and we thank him for his hard work and dedication to the  State of Arizona and this country. I appreciate his willingness to  serve and work so hard for what he believes in. He has helped encourage  and inspire another generation of leaders. In that way and so many  others he has made a positive difference.                            ____________________
