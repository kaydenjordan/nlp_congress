 Mr. President, I rise to honor the memory of one  of our country's great civil rights leaders and judges, the Honorable  Nathaniel Jones, who passed away on January 26 at the age of 93.   Judge Jones was a native of Youngstown in my home State of Ohio, a  veteran who served in the Air Force during World War II, and a tireless  advocate for justice and equality. After his time in the military, he  earned an undergraduate degree and a JD from Youngstown State  University.   For much of the 1960s, Judge Jones was the assistant U.S. attorney  for the Northern District of Ohio at the appointment of Attorney  General Robert F. Kennedy. In 1969, he became the general counsel for  the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, NAACP,  where he argued numerous cases before the Supreme Court.   In 1979 he moved to the Cincinnati area upon being appointed as an  appeals judge for the Sixth Circuit by President Carter, and he served  admirably in that role for decades. With all of his experience, and his  reputation for integrity and problem-solving, Judge Jones was an active  member of the Cincinnati community and widely respected in legal  circles. As an example, he was asked to deliver the inaugural Judge A.  Leon Higginbotham Distinguished Memorial Lecture at Harvard Law School.   His work also included helping to end the apartheid regime in South  Africa, working to promote a free and independent Namibia,  participating in the U.S.-Egypt Judicial Exchange Program, and  advocating for human rights within the Soviet Union. Among his many  accomplishments, he received the Distinguished Service Citation from  the National Conference for Community Justice and the State  Department's Millennium International Volunteer Award. For all of his  accomplishments, worked in the House of Representatives to write and  pass legislation to rename the U.S. courthouse in Youngstown after  Judge Jones--the courthouse stands only a few miles down the road from  where he was raised as a child. It now bears the name of this proud son  of Youngstown.   Back home in Cincinnati, Judge Jones was just as important a figure  in the fight for a more equitable society, having taught law at the  University of Cincinnati, among other schools. I was proud to work with  him on launching the National Underground Railroad Museum, housed in my  hometown of Cincinnati. It is there in large part because of the  efforts of Judge Jones, who also served as a co-chair of the board of  trustees for the museum. I was honored to work with him over the years  to further its mission. Just last fall, the University of Cincinnati  College of Law renamed its Center for Race, Gender, and Social Justice  in his honor.   Judge Jones was a model public servant, working to better his  community and his fellow man. I will remember him as a friend who  brought people together to support racial healing, equality and to  improve the community. His legacy of justice and equality before the  law should inspire all of us to continue to seek positive change.   Today, my thoughts are with his family--his sister, Allie Jean, his  daughters Stephanie and Pamela, his sons Rick, William, and Marc, and  the many others whose lives he touched.                            ____________________
