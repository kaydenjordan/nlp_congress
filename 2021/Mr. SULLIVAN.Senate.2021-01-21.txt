 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, there is a lot going on in the Senate,  a lot of activity behind the scenes right now. Leadership of both  parties is negotiating a 50-50 power-sharing agreement, which is very  important for the Senate and very important for our Nation.   One issue that is being discussed is the status of what is going to  happen, possibly--hopefully, nothing is going to happen--with a really  important element of the U.S. Senate: the legislative filibuster-- something that has been a hallmark of this body almost since the  founding of the Republic. This shouldn't be a hard issue.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter, led  by Senator Collins and Senator Coons, dated April 7, 2017, to the then- majority leader, Senator McConnell, and the Democratic leader, Senator  Schumer   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                      Washington, DC, April 7, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles E. Schumer,      Democratic Leader,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Democratic Leader       Schumer: We are writing to urge you to support our efforts to       preserve existing rules, practices, and traditions as they       pertain to the right of Members to engage in extended debate       on legislation before the United States Senate. Senators have       expressed a variety of opinions about the appropriateness of       limiting debate when we are considering judicial and       executive branch nominations. Regardless of our past       disagreements on that issue, we are united in our       determination to preserve the ability of Members to engage in       extended debate when bills are on the Senate floor.        We are mindful of the unique role the Senate plays in the       legislative process, and we are steadfastly committed to       ensuring that this great American institution continues to       serve as the world's greatest deliberative body. Therefore,       we are asking you to join us in opposing any effort to       curtail the existing rights and prerogatives of Senators to       engage in full, robust, and extended debate as we consider       legislation before this body in the future.            Sincerely,        Susan M. Collins, Orrin Hatch, Claire McCaskill, Lisa       Murkowski, Christopher A. Coons, Joe Manchin, III, John       McCain, Patrick J. Leahy, Roger F. Wicker, Luther Strange,       Angus S. King, Jr., Michael F. Bennet, Amy Klobuchar, Robert       P. Casey, Jr., Martin Heinrich, John Boozman, Lindsey Graham,       Richard Burr, Mark R.

Over 60 Senators in the U.S. Senate--the majority of  Republicans and the majority of Democrats--sent this letter to who was  then leadership of the Senate, writing, in essence: Don't change the  legislative filibuster.   A bunch of Democrats and a bunch of Republicans--I was going to read  the names, but they know who they are--the majority on both sides in  this body, from both parties, in 2017 said: Don't change it. This  shouldn't be something the U.S. Senate changes.   Part of the reason this was going on was that, at the time, then- President Trump was pressing Senators, particularly Majority Leader  McConnell, to change the filibuster. The filibuster requires 60 votes  to move legislation in the Senate. It requires compromise. It requires  bipartisanship. It is what makes us different from the House. At the  time, then-Republican President Trump was saying: Change it. I want  legislation to move more quickly.   The Republicans and then-Majority Leader McConnell said that it was  not a good idea. As a matter of fact, most of us said that it was not a  good idea, so we didn't do anything. We didn't change it because we  didn't want to change the nature of the U.S. Senate.   This is one of the issues being discussed right now, but it shouldn't  be a difficult issue because, as I said, the vast majority of Senators  in this body, a couple of years ago, said: Don't do it. We don't want  the Senate to just become a smaller version of the House, because that  is what would happen if you were to get rid of the legislative  filibuster.   I do want to extend my congratulations to the new majority leader as  of yesterday, Senator Schumer, but to the new majority leader: This  should not be a difficult issue. This should not be something that we  are having a problem with in terms of the negotiations between the  Democrats and the Republicans that delays the power-sharing agreement.  This should be a piece of cake. Just a couple of years ago, the vast  majority of Democrats and Republicans said: Don't change the  legislative filibuster. We want to make sure that remains the case.   I think, for the new majority leader, this would be an act of  statesmanship, an act of compromise, and would certainly make the  statement that he is going to keep the Senate the same as it has been  for decades, for centuries. Changing the legislative filibuster would  change the entire structure, history, and precedent of this very  important body in our country, so it shouldn't be hard. The vast  majority of the Democrats and Republicans has already agreed to this.   To our new majority leader: Do what you know is right--an act of  statesmanship and compromise. We have all been talking about it. It  should not be a difficult decision, particularly given that so many  Senators on both sides of the aisle feel strongly enough to have  written Senator Schumer and Senator McConnell just a couple of years  ago on this.   To all of my colleagues who signed that letter--you know who you  are--make sure you are pressing the new majority leader to stick to  what you pressed him on just a couple of years ago. It is important.                            ____________________     Madam President, I also want to talk about another  important issue, and that is President Biden's nomination for the very  important job of Secretary of Defense, Mr. Lloyd Austin. We are going  to be voting on his nomination here on the Senate floor in a couple of  hours.   I had the honor of introducing Mr. Austin just 2 days ago at his  confirmation hearing, and I thought the confirmation hearing went well.  So I want to talk a little bit about Mr. Austin before we take what  will essentially be two important votes for his confirmation.   Now, the last time I was actually on the floor of the U.S. Senate,  our Capitol was under siege, and from a foreign policy and national  security perspective, America's authoritarian rivals have been gloating  over what happened on that day. They have been reveling in our  disunity. Democracy brings chaos, they tell their people. It is better  to have a strong hand that keeps order. Well, as you know, we do live  in an imperfect democracy, no doubt, and the American I was honored to  introduce at the Armed Services hearing the other day, Mr. Lloyd  Austin, understands our imperfections more than many.   Yet, on closer inspection, the world's dictators have little to  celebrate. Congress went back to work on January 6, right here on the  Senate floor, to count electoral votes, and yesterday there was a  peaceful transfer of power at the top of our government, as there has  been since our Republic's founding.   At some point--maybe sooner than we think--Chinese and Russian  citizens are going to ask: Hey, why can't we do that? Why don't we have  strong, resilient institutions that ensure the regular elections of new  leaders and that invest in self-government and the people?   When these citizens ask these questions of authoritarians like Putin  or Xi Jinping, they are not going to be gloating anymore because they  won't have answers to these questions.   So what does this all have to do with Mr. Lloyd Austin? A lot. Mr.  Austin has been nominated to lead one of America's most trusted  institutions--the Department of Defense. Many of us have worked hard  over the last few years to rebuild our military's strength and  readiness, but I think we can all agree that there has been too much  turmoil at the top at the Pentagon. As its civilian leader, I am  confident that Mr. Austin will bring steadiness, leadership, and  respect to this indispensable American institution.   I got to know Mr. Austin in 2005 and 2006 while serving together in  an Army-heavy combatant command as we conducted combat operations  throughout the Middle East. We had what might be referred to today as  an unequal power relationship. He was a two-star general. I was a  major. He had spent years on Active Duty. I was a reservist. He was a  soldier. I was a marine. I was just one of hundreds of field-grade  infantry officers who had been recalled to Active Duty and deployed in  the region during a challenging time for our Nation. Yet, when I asked  for his time, Mr. Austin gave it. When I had a problem, he listened.  When I asked for help on an important mission, he provided it.   A critical hallmark of exceptional leadership, especially for  organizations like the Pentagon, is not just how one treats superiors  but how one treats subordinates, those down the chain of command. What  I saw was respect and integrity and someone who knew how to get things  done in a difficult environment.   It is clear to me the core principles of Mr. Austin's life have been  duty, honor, country. West Point has done its job. Now, that may sound  quaint to some, but I think having individuals of impeccable character  at the top of our government is more important than ever. Other than  integrity, there is no singular requirement for the difficult job of  Secretary of Defense, and as the former Director of the Joint Staff and  as the former CENTCOM Commander, Mr. Austin certainly has insight on  critical issues, such as interagency budget battles, working with  allies, and congressional oversight.   Mr. Austin is also fully committed to the constitutional principle of  civilian control of our military--something that those who serve in  uniform typically understand and revere more than those who don't. In  that regard, you may recall that, about 10 days ago, we had a hearing  in the Committee on Armed Services on this very important topic, but I  actually thought some of the witnesses had rather simplistic views of  this important issue.   They had brought up topics and discussions of so-called ``military  logic'' by those who wear the uniform versus ``political logic'' for  those who don't wear the uniform.   So let me play devil's advocate for those who participated and  watched that hearing.   The very nature of the confirmation hearing that we had with Mr.  Austin just 2 days ago and, indeed, the very nature of the transfer of  power that we saw yesterday here at the Capitol are evidence, in my  view, that the civilian control of the military is not at risk in  [[Page S85]]  America. I actually believe the related but opposite problem should be  of more concern today, at this moment, and that problem is no military  experience in the top ranks of our government. With the exception of  Mr. Austin, no nominee on the incoming Biden administration's national  security team has ever served in uniform. With regard to the entire  Biden Cabinet, only one other nominee has any military experience at  all. This is not wise.   If confirmed, I am sure I won't agree with all of Mr. Austin's  decisions, but when the inevitable budget battles occur, it will be  critical for our Nation's security and, very importantly, the military  members and their families who serve to have a Secretary of Defense who  understands firsthand the very real morale and readiness problems that  result from drastic cuts to our military--something, unfortunately, I  think many of my colleagues here in the Senate will be pushing for and  even members of the Biden administration will be pushing for.   So let me conclude with this. Right now, a number of us are  interviewing Cabinet members for confirmation for the incoming Biden  administration. I anticipate opposing some, supporting others.  Certainly, I anticipate opposing some if I believe they will hurt the  working families of my State. But with regard to Mr. Austin, I am fully  supporting his nomination.   We are living through difficult times--a pandemic, racial tensions,  riots, turmoil at the top of the Pentagon, and rising dangers from  China, Russia, and Iran. Mr. Austin's confirmation won't solve all of  these problems, but it will help.   He represents the best of America--a man of integrity, humility, and  character, with a wealth of relevant experience. Our allies will take  comfort in his confirmation, and our adversaries will take pause. And  as America's first African-American Secretary of Defense, he will be an  inspiration to millions both in and out of uniform.   For all of these reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues to support  Mr. Austin's confirmation and the waiver in Federal law that it  requires.   I yield the floor.
