 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to join me  in fostering increased investment in the United States economy by one  of our oldest allies, Portugal. As a co-chair of the Congressional  Portuguese Caucus, I am proud to join Congressmen Cicilline and Valadao  in leading the AMIGOS Act, which we introduced earlier this spring.   Earlier this month, Senators Whitehouse and Hatch introduced the  companion measure of the AMIGOS Act in the United States Senate. This  bipartisan, bicameral legislation would make Portuguese citizens  eligible for specific visas that allow them to enter the United States  to conduct substantial trade or to invest a substantial amount of  capital. We do this with other nations. This will spur investment in  our economy, and it helps create jobs.   In 2015 alone, trade between Portugal and the United States reached  $4.2 billion, and it is only growing. The AMIGOS Act will strengthen  this reciprocal economic relationship, one of our longest and strongest  allies.   Strengthening relationships that benefit both countries is the best  way to grow the economy and to increase the number of jobs in the long  term, not trade tariffs.   We have extended these visas before. In 2012, Congress granted, most  recently, eligibility to Israel.   Our friendship with Portugal and the contributions of hardworking  Portuguese immigrants in America are an important part of our country's  history and heritage. Portugal was one of the first countries to  recognize the United States after we declared our independence, and  Portugal joined us in being a founding member of NATO.   The AMIGOS Act is commonsense, bipartisan, and bicameral. It is the  type of trade policy we should be leading, not engaging in trade wars.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the AMIGOS Act and  working together for strong and stable investment in America's economy  and American jobs.   With bipartisan efforts in the House and in the Senate, these are the  kinds of things that we can do, and I am hopeful that this legislation  will be enacted into law before the end of the year.                           Immigrant Heritage Month     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Immigrant  Heritage Month.   At a time when heinous action is being taken in the name of securing  our borders--and we must secure our borders--I stand here to call on  every one of my colleagues in Washington, local leaders across the  United States, and individual Americans and their families. I call on  all of us to come together and remember we are a Nation of immigrants,  immigrants past and immigrants present.   For more than 250 years, immigrants have made our country what it is  today. Every generation of immigrants contributes new ideas, fresh  energy, and vibrant culture to our Nation that makes up this mosaic web  of an incredible place we call America.   I grew up in California's San Joaquin Valley, which I have the honor  and privilege to represent. Our valley is a rich combination of people  whose families have come from all over the world. It is part of this  fabric, this mosaic, I talk about. They have made California and our  Nation what it is today through hard work, family values, and lasting  contributions in so many different ways: the agriculture economy,  businesses, education, and healthcare systems.   Their story is our story. It is the story of achieving the American  Dream. The American Dream lives on. It lives on in all of us.   Last week, I met with a group of students from my district on the  Capitol steps, many of whom are children from immigrant families. These  young people came to Washington to learn about our government and how  to make a difference. They are our future leaders in the next  generation who want to achieve this American Dream.   At a time, Mr. Speaker, when children and Dreamers are being  leveraged to ram shortsighted and ineffective immigration reform  through Congress, let us pause. Let's step back. Let's think about what  our country stands for, our common bonds and our values. I call on all  of us to come together to reflect that.   Let us commemorate American Heritage Month with something real. The  Fourth of July is next week. We celebrate our country. We come together  in a patriotic fashion, remembering what has made America great. Part  of what has made America great is generations of folks coming from all  over the world, wanting to live this dream.   We must reject that immigration policy being forced through the  Congress, and we must come together to fix our broken immigration  system with real, bipartisan reform that provides long-term solutions  while respecting the dignity and humanity of all people who are part of  this American Dream.    As we celebrate the Fourth of July next week, let us never forget  that our common values and our bonds are far stronger than whatever  differences we may have.                            ____________________
