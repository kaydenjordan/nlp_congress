 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the  bipartisan HALOS Act because it will help startup companies with angel  investors without compromising important investor protections.   When working in the private sector, I participated in numerous so- called demo days where early-stage entrepreneurs make presentations. I  have counseled multiple startups and small firms through this process,  particularly women and minority-owned businesses. I have seen firsthand  as they struggled to overcome regulatory hurdles and to obtain access  to much-needed capital when traditional financing sources, such as  banks, may not be feasible.   It is important for the government at all levels--Federal, State, and  local--to promote economic growth and encourage innovation by  connecting people with good ideas to people with the capital and  courage to bankroll those ideas. Robust entrepreneurial ecosystems is  how great products come to market and how well-paying jobs are created.  This is particularly important for my district in central Florida,  which has a growing innovative and entrepreneurial startup community.   Based on personal experiences and on the experiences conveyed to me  by Floridians with expertise in this area, the current Federal  regulations governing demo days can be made more clear and less  burdensome so that they better promote the flow of capital through our  economy while continuing to protect nonaccredited investors.   Because I believe the HALOS Act achieves these dual objectives, I  urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on H.R. 79.
