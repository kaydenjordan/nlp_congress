 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President:   [[Page S4976]]              [Yesterday's summit] was one of the most disgraceful       performances by an American President in memory. The damage       inflicted by President Trump's naivety, egotism, false       equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to       calculate. . . . President Trump proved not only unable but       unwilling to stand up to Putin. He and Putin seemed to be       speaking from the same script as the president made a       conscious choice to defend a tyrant against the fair       questions of a free press, and to grant Putin an       uncontested platform to spew propaganda and lies to the       world.        Coming close on the heels of President Trump's bombastic       and erratic conduct towards our closest friends and allies in       Brussels and Britain, today's press conference--    Yesterday's press conference, actually--       marks a recent low point in the history of the American       Presidency.        No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly       before a tyrant. Not only did President Trump fail to speak       the truth about an adversary; but speaking for America to the       world, our president failed to defend all that makes us who       we are--a republic of free people dedicated to the cause of       liberty at home and abroad. American presidents must be       champions of that cause if it is to succeed. Americans are       waiting and hoping for President Trump to embrace that sacred       responsibility. One can only hope they are not waiting . . .       in vain.    Those are very strong words. People would say: Well, Chuck Schumer is  the Democratic leader. Of course, he is going to criticize President  Trump. But those strong, biting, and effective words are not mine.  Those three paragraphs I quoted come from John McCain, who is probably  the leading Republican expert on military security, national security,  and foreign policy.   When Senator McCain said that, it should be a clarion call to every  Republican to not just speak up but to take action because the national  security of America is in danger.   I ask unanimous consent that Senator McCain's statement, in its  entirety, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:      Senator John McCain Statement on President Trump's Meeting With                              President Putin         ``Today's press conference in Helsinki was one of the most       disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.       The damage inflicted by President Trump's naivete, egotism,       false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to       calculate. But it is clear that the summit in Helsinki was a       tragic mistake.        ``President Trump proved not only unable, but unwilling to       stand up to Putin. He and Putin seemed to be speaking from       the same script as the president made a conscious choice to       defend a tyrant against the fair questions of a free press,       and to grant Putin an uncontested platform to spew propaganda       and lies to the world.        ``It is tempting to describe the press conference as a       pathetic rout--as an illustration of the perils of under-      preparation and inexperience. But these were not the errant       tweets of a novice politician. These were the deliberate       choices of a president who seems determined to realize his       delusions of a warm relationship with Putin's regime without       any regard for the true nature of his rule, his violent       disregard for the sovereignty of his neighbors, his       complicity in the slaughter of the Syrian people, his       violation of international treaties, and his assault on       democratic institutions throughout the world.        ``Coming close on the heels of President Trump's bombastic       and erratic conduct towards our closest friends and allies in       Brussels and Britain, today's press conference marks a recent       low point in the history of the American Presidency. That the       president was attended in Helsinki by a team of competent and       patriotic advisors makes his blunders and capitulations all       the more painful and inexplicable. ``No prior president has       ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant. Not only       did President Trump fail to speak the truth about an       adversary; but speaking for America to the world, our       president failed to defend all that makes us who we are--a       republic of free people dedicated to the cause of liberty at       home and abroad. American presidents must be the champions of       that cause if it is to succeed. Americans are waiting and       hoping for President Trump to embrace that sacred       responsibility. One can only hope they are not waiting       totally in vain.''     It is still difficult to comprehend what transpired  yesterday in Helsinki. Because of his actions, it was one of the worst  days for any President of the United States in recent memory. On  foreign soil, President Trump said the United States was to blame for  the state of the relationship between Russia and America.   He trashed American intelligence and took the word of the KGB over  the word of the men and women of the CIA. Can you believe it? Can you  believe it? He said Russia's intelligence agency, which murders,  steals, lies, and cheats, is better than ours. There is no rational  explanation for an American President to do such a thing. It was the  act of a man who seems incapable of distinguishing between his own  narrow personal interests and the interests of America's national  security.   Can you imagine if President Kennedy believed Khrushchev when he said  there were no missiles in Cuba? Can you imagine if President Reagan  believed Gorbachev without verifying that the Soviet Union would reduce  its missile stockpile? We would be living in a much different world  than we are today. Thank God President Kennedy and President Reagan  showed strength in the face of tyrants--but President Trump shows  abject weakness and sycophancy.   Let me explain to the President why he is being so strongly  criticized when he embraced Putin's strong and powerful denial. The  reason, President Trump, that you are being so criticized when you  accept Putin's word is, Putin is a trained liar. He lies brazenly,  shamelessly, and repeatedly about big things and small.   Putin lied about the presence of Russian troops in Crimea. He lied  about the Malaysian airplane being shot down by a Russian rocket. He  lied about Russian athletes doping at the Olympics. He lied about  Russian behavior in eastern Ukraine. He lied about Assad's use of  chemical weapons. He lied about interference in the Brexit vote. Just  last week, he lied about the Kremlin's involvement in a recent nerve  agent attack in the United Kingdom.   Yet when President Putin gives President Trump a ``strong and  powerful denial'' that he didn't meddle in our elections, President  Trump immediately accepts Putin's word over the considered judgment of  America's dedicated intelligence professionals. It is almost as if  Donald Trump is embracing Putin's needs. I am ashamed of it, and every  American should be. No previous President would be that naive or that  weak. No serious leader would allow themselves to be taken in so  easily.   The only person with cause to celebrate is Vladimir Putin. Putin got  to stand on the stage with an American President who refused to hold  him accountable for anything. He watched President Trump careen through  Europe, carrying out Putin's dream agenda--torching old alliances,  interfering in the domestic affairs of the United Kingdom, weakening  NATO and American power in the region. Putin skated through a bilateral  summit and press conference without facing any consequences for  deliberately meddling in our elections. Putin could not have scripted a  better result.   I am from Brooklyn. If we learned anything, we learned one thing  there: When there is a bully around, as Putin is, you show strength.  President Trump showed abject weakness. Do you know what that means?  The bully will continue to take advantage of it. If Donald Trump was  such an easy mark in Helsinki, President Putin will realize he is an  easy mark elsewhere.   The behavior of the President is just inexplicable. Everyone in the  United States is scratching their heads. There seems to be no rational  explanation for President Trump's behavior, and so millions of  Americans are left wondering if Putin indeed has something over the  President. That is the most logical explanation of the President's  bizarre and weak behavior so deleterious to American interests.   If there is another credible explanation for why President Trump  behaved the way he did, it would behoove the President to let the  American people in on it; otherwise, so many Americans are going to  continue to wonder, does President Putin have something over President  Trump that makes the President behave in such a way that hurts our  country so?   We know the President doesn't like to prepare much, but even the most  basic preparation would lead a President away from the erratic behavior  we saw yesterday. The truth is, the summit yesterday was like an x-ray  machine, revealing that ``America First'' is really just ``Trump  First,'' no matter what it means for the country he is sworn to defend  from enemies foreign and domestic.  [[Page S4977]]    So the question looms: What will the Senate do in response? What will  my Republican colleagues do in response? A few of them have echoed  Senator McCain's sentiments, and they deserve recognition for that, but  those Senators who are not John McCain, who are here in the Senate  wielding an immense power to shape events, I say to them, words are not  enough. Our response to the debasement of American interests before a  foreign adversary demands a response, not just in word but in deed. Our  Republican colleagues cannot just talk the talk--some of them have done  that, most haven't--but, as a body, they need to walk the walk. The  American people are demanding it.    Our country needs to see Republicans in the Senate and the Republican  Party stand up and show through action that unlike our President, they  will not tolerate Russian aggression or accept Putin's lies. They need  to act in the spirit of Ronald Reagan, not in the spirit of Donald  Trump. Too often, when the President goes off the reservation, the  Republican Party has lightly rebuked his behavior and waited for  everyone to move on. Given the crisis, given Trump's horrible actions,  that is not good enough. Our Republican colleagues cannot just go tsk- tsk. They must act if they want to help America.   Yesterday, I outlined four things we could do immediately in response  to the President's disastrous summit. Let me repeat them and add a  fifth.   First, ratchet up sanctions on Russia, not water them down. The  sanctions we passed 98 to 2 have not even been fully implemented. Some  in the House now want to reduce those sanctions. We need to strengthen  them.   Second, and very importantly--probably most importantly--our  Republican colleagues need to join us in demanding testimony from the  President's national security team that was in Helsinki, and we need to  do that immediately. We need hearings as soon as possible to assess  what President Trump might have committed to President Putin in secret.  President Trump's public statements were alarming enough. The Senate  needs to know what happened behind closed doors. Does anyone believe he  was tougher on Putin in secret? You can't assume anything but that as  weak as he was in public before President Putin, he was even worse in  private. Why else did he not want anyone in the room?   President Trump and President Putin met one-on-one behind closed  doors for nearly 2 hours. Where are the notes from the meeting? What  did the President agree to? Was Secretary Pompeo briefed afterward on  what happened? Were any other members of the President's team briefed?  The American people need to know what is happening. The American people  deserve to know what is happening. It is our security at risk.   I am calling on Leader McConnell and his leadership team to  immediately request a hearing with Secretary of State Pompeo and the  rest of the President's national security team from Helsinki so we can  find out what the heck happened there--the explanation for what  happened openly, and even more importantly, what happened in that  meeting behind closed doors.   Third, our Republican friends must end the attacks on the Department  of Justice, the FBI, and the special counsel. Those have mainly  emanated from a small group in the House.   Given the indictments, given the indictment yesterday, not from  Mueller but from mainline Justice, we have to let this investigation go  forward. President Trump's actions yesterday lead many more Americans  to suspect that something was amiss; that there may have been  collusion. What else would explain President Trump's actions and  protestations in a foreign country?   We need to end these attacks and let the investigation proceed  unimpeded and encourage the President to sit down for an interview with  Mueller.   Fourth, the President must insist on the extradition of the 12  Russians recently indicted for election interference. In one of the  more bizarre of many bizarre incidents yesterday, Putin suggested that  Americans come and interview the Russians in Russia or actually watch  as Russian agents interview the Russians in Russia. Is Russia known for  a free and open judicial system? Is Russia known for the rule of law?  Of course not. It was an absurd suggestion. Any other President would  have rejected it out of hand.   We need to bring them here, and the President, to represent the honor  and the strength of the United States--something he has failed to do  thus far--needs to demand it.   Finally, election security. Our elections are at risk. We have now  had indictments of Russians interfering in the 2016 elections. Everyone  in America, except Donald Trump, admits that happened--Democrats and  Republicans, Speaker Ryan, Leader McConnell--that Russia tried to  interfere and interfere, most everyone believes, on President Trump's  behalf. Why? Well, we heard Putin's explanation.   We can't have that happen again. We must move election security  legislation immediately.   To its credit, in a bipartisan way, this Chamber and the other put  $380 million in the last omnibus for election security, but there is  very fine legislation. One is sponsored by Senator Klobuchar, and she  has worked with some of the Republicans on that. Another is sponsored  by Senator Chris Van Hollen. I believe Senator Rubio is a cosponsor of  that. We need to move that legislation--hopefully, with bipartisan  support--quickly.   These are five simple things we can do together, Democrats and  Republicans.   Now, yesterday, I saw my good friend--I see him sitting here--Senator  Cornyn say that we have done most of these things already. I wish it  were so. It isn't. We haven't done any of it. Leader McConnell has not  called for hearings to bring Secretary Pompeo and others here. We have  not increased sanctions, which we should do. In fact, there is a move  in the House to decrease them. We have not asked the President to  demand extradition of the Russians. We have not urged some Republicans,  particularly in the House, to stop interfering with the Mueller  investigation. We haven't done any of the four items I mentioned  yesterday or the fifth I mentioned today. I hope Senator Cornyn and  others will lead the charge and help us get those done, in a bipartisan  way, for the sake of this wonderful and great country.   The bottom line is that we need to act. A few statements will not  change President Trump's behavior and will not stop President Putin  from continuing to make a mess of our alliances around the world and  our elections here in America. Action is required. The eyes of America  are on the Republicans in the Senate to join us in the actions I have  outlined or other actions they might feel appropriate.                            ____________________     Madam President, turning to SCOTUS, I will conclude this  morning by adding that at this very delicate time, Senators from both  parties should carefully scrutinize President Trump's Supreme Court  nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. Not only has President Trump promised to  select judges who would overturn Roe v. Wade and undo the healthcare  law, Judge Kavanaugh has some troubling views on Executive power and  accountability.   We have all just witnessed the behavior of a reckless President who  has shown he is willing to test the bounds of Executive authority at  home, just as he is willing to depart from all wisdom and sense on  foreign soil.   Judge Kavanaugh has demonstrated in several writings that he believes  the President should be above civil and criminal indictment while in  office and that the President should be granted broad deference to  enforce or not enforce laws he ``deems'' unconstitutional.   Consider for a moment what it would mean for the Supreme Court to  rule that this President is immune from indictment or that he should be  allowed to exercise his authority so wantonly as to decide which laws  to enforce or not. That is all the more reason, given what Judge  Kavanaugh has written, that he get careful and rigorous scrutiny before  we move on any vote.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I join with my colleagues this afternoon  to talk about the President's deeply embarrassing and disgraceful  meeting with President Putin yesterday.   But first, allow me to comment on what we just heard from the  President. A few minutes ago, President Trump seemed to say that he  accepts the findings of the intelligence community that Russia meddled  in our election. Well, welcome to the club, President Trump.   We have known since the middle of the 2016 election that they  meddled. For the President to admit it now is cold comfort to a  disturbed public that has watched him bend over backward to avoid  criticizing Putin directly. President Trump may be trying to squirm  away from what he said yesterday, but it is 24 hours too late--and in  the wrong place--for the President to take a real stance on Putin's  election meddling.   Amazingly, President Trump, after reading his statement that he  accepted the intelligence community's conclusion that Putin meddled in  our election, added, in his own words, ``could be other people also. A  lot of people out there.'' This is just like Charlottesville. He made a  horrible statement,  [[Page S4986]]  tried to back off, but couldn't even bring himself to back off. It  shows the weakness of this President. It shows the weakness of  President Trump--that he is afraid to confront Mr. Putin directly. Like  a coward, he tries to squeal away from it when he is several thousand  miles away.   What is President Putin going to take out of the President's actions  today? That the man is weak, that he is afraid, that he is cowardly,  and that Putin will feel he can take even further advantage of Donald  Trump.   The President is now asking the American people not to believe their  own eyes and ears about what he told the world in Helsinki yesterday.  Even in his completely implausible effort to ``correct'' his own words,  he departed from his text to again claim that the hacking could have  been done by someone other than Russia. If the President can't say  directly to President Putin ``Mr. Putin, you are wrong and we are  right; our intelligence agencies are right,'' it is ineffective, and  worse, it shows such weakness. It tells President Putin to continue to  take advantage of the United States because President Trump doesn't  have the courage, the strength, maybe not even the conviction to say to  President Putin's face what he tried to say a few minutes ago.   The President's comments a moment ago changed very little. The  question still remains: What will the Senate do in response? I have  seen a few of my Republican colleagues shrug their shoulders, claiming  they have done all they can. That is bunk. As Senators, we have a  responsibility and an ability--an incredible power given to us by the  Founding Fathers to check and balance this President.   As I said this morning, here are a few things the Senate can do  immediately in response to the President's disastrous summit. We can  ratchet up sanctions on Russia, not water them down. Sanctions we  passed 98 to 2 have not even been fully implemented by the Trump  administration. And now someone has inserted a loophole to water them  down in the House defense legislation.   Second, our Republican colleagues need to immediately join us in  demanding public testimony from the President's national security team  that was in Helsinki. Secretary Pompeo, DNI Director Coats, Ambassador  Huntsman, and anybody else who was part of that team ought to be  testifying openly, publicly, and directly to Congress. We need to know  this because, as frightening and damaging as the President's comments  were to the public in Helsinki, what he said behind closed doors is, in  all likelihood, even worse. Why did the President want to close the  doors? There are lots of explanations. None of them are good. Does  anyone believe that President Trump was tougher on Putin in secret? Why  else did he not want anyone in the room?   Next, where are the notes from that meeting? What did the President  agree to? Can we have the translator come in and testify? Was Secretary  of State Pompeo briefed afterward on what happened? Did he take notes?  Were any other members of the President's team briefed? The notes need  to be turned over to Congress immediately.   I am calling on Leader McConnell and his Republican leadership team  to immediately request a hearing with Pompeo, Coats, Huntsman, the rest  of the President's national security team in Helsinki, and with the  translator, so we can learn the full extent of what happened behind  closed doors. Our national security is at risk. It is an unusual  request for unusual times.   Next, our Republican friends must end attacks on the Justice  Department, the FBI, particularly the special counsel, and let the  investigation proceed unimpeded. The best way to do this is to pass the  legislation, authored by a bipartisan group led by Senators Coons and  Booker on our side and Senator Tillis and Graham on the Republican  side, which passed out of the Judiciary Committee.   Leader McConnell, if you are serious about checks and balances, if  you are serious about making sure President Trump obeys the law and  protects our security, put that bill on the floor now. It will pass.   Fourth, the President must release his tax returns and insist that  the 12 Russians indicted for election interference are handed over. The  President has refused to release his tax returns, but these bizarre  actions he has taken seem to indicate that President Putin has  something over President Trump, something personal, and it might be  financial. We need to see the tax returns.   Finally, we must move the election security legislation immediately.  Senator Klobuchar has bipartisan legislation. Senator Van Hollen has  bipartisan legislation. Senator Harris has legislation. We need to move  it. Leader McConnell has talked about it a little bit. Let's move it  quickly, but remember, the President still has control because the  Director of National Intelligence has the ability to put out this  report, and he is, after all, a Presidential appointee. I have some  faith in the integrity of Mr. Coats, but he may not even be there after  November, particularly given the way President Trump treats his  appointees. So that legislation is good and necessary, but hardly  sufficient.   I hope our Senate will move; I hope our Republican colleagues will  not just talk the talk, but walk the walk. ``Tsk, tsk'' is not enough  when national security is at stake. Action--bipartisan action--is  required.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise alongside my colleagues tonight to  speak on two incredibly controversial circuit judge nominees that the  Senate considers this week.   The first, Ryan Bounds, of the Ninth Circuit, has not received the  approval of either home State Senator. The majority is unfortunately  moving forward with his nomination anyway, breaking a tradition that  goes back 100 years--a bipartisan tradition, a moderating tradition, a  tradition we need.   This is merely the latest example of the majority's sustained effort  to toss aside the rules and the customs that have guided the judicial  nomination process for 100 years. In May, Michael Brennan became the  first circuit court nominee to be confirmed over the blue-slip  objection of a home-State Senator.   If Judge Brennan's confirmation wasn't proof enough, the majority, by  moving to vote on Bounds over the objections of both Oregon Senators,  is signaling loud and clear that future Presidents need not work with  Senators to ensure the selection of consensus nominees to fill these  lifetime appointments.   For the past 20 years, including during the Bush administration, the  Oregon Senators have convened a bipartisan judicial panel to interview  candidates. Although Bounds was one of the candidates approved by the  committee, it was later discovered that Bounds misled the committee  about a number of highly controversial articles he wrote while in  college. The majority unfortunately is moving forward on his nomination  anyway.   Five of the seven members of the committee--a bipartisan committee-- including the chair, said they would not have recommended Bounds if  they knew of his writings at the time they interviewed him. The  majority is unfortunately moving forward with his nomination anyway.   In light of these inflammatory writings--and they were truly  inflammatory and nasty, unbecoming of someone being a town circuit  judge, let alone a court of appeals judge--and the bipartisan  committee's assertion that they should be disqualifying, Senator  Merkley and Senator Wyden, correctly and wisely, refused to support his  nomination, but the majority is moving forward on his nomination  anyway.   I might say about Bounds that he is not a judge. He doesn't have much  of a history. He practiced in a private law firm. It seems he is a  member of the Federalist Society--hard right. That is his only real  qualification. Is he a thoughtful jurist? Obviously not. Is he a  moderate jurist, neither far right nor far left? Obviously not. This is  what we are doing on the bench these days. The hard right, the  Federalist Society, which is probably in the 10 percent furthest to the  right in America, chooses the judges, and nobody objects on the  Republican side.   Now, another nominee, Mr. Andrew Oldham, for the Fifth Circuit, is  even more disturbing for a lifetime appointment on the Federal bench.  Mr. Oldham's career leaves no doubt that, if confirmed, he would be the  living embodiment of a judicial ideologue. This is a hard-right  warrior. He helped to defend a Texas law that would make it virtually  impossible for women in rural areas to exercise their constitutionally  guaranteed freedom to make decisions about their reproductive health.  It was a law designed to tell rural women that they couldn't have  freedom of choice. It was an absurd law, struck down by the Supreme  Court in 2016. This is the kind of man we are putting on the bench.   As the Texas solicitor general, he defended the State's extremely  restrictive photo ID laws, which a Federal court of appeals ruled  created an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote, had an  impermissible discriminatory effect against Hispanics and African  Americans, and was imposed with an unconstitutional discriminatory  purpose. The purpose that this nominee had in this law was to prevent  people of color and poor people from voting. There was very little  evidence of any fraud. This is the kind of person we are adding to the  bench?   Mr. Oldham helped to lead the charge on litigation challenging the  constitutionality of our healthcare law--a law that most Americans  support. He lost at the Supreme Court, once again. Now the Republicans  want to give him a promotion, putting him in a position to rule on  future cases concerning the law.   Here is what Mr. Oldham said about the EPA: It is ``illegitimate.''  He repeatedly helped Texas to join Oklahoma--and then-Oklahoma Attorney  General Scott Pruitt--to sue the EPA. Let me repeat that. Oldham  considers the EPA illegitimate. The rightwing media has gone crazy  about ``Abolish ICE.'' Meanwhile, the Senate Republican majority is  about to vote to give a lifetime appointment to a man who wants to  abolish the EPA.   ``Abolish the EPA'' is a position I think none--none--of my  Republican friends would dare support in public, would dare vote for-- get rid completely of the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act? But they  are happy to vote for a judge who believes in it and might help do it  for them.   Mr. Oldham is so far out of the political mainstream that he doesn't  represent the average Republican, let alone the average American. I  hope his nomination will be objected to.   The truth is that Bounds and Oldham are part of a decades-long  campaign by the hard right to install conservative ideologues on the  Federal bench. They started it. Bork did not start this. It started  when George W. Bush became President and his deal with the hard right  was this: I will put these new nominees on the bench who are  ideologues. They don't want to interpret law; they want to make law.  That is what the Republicans have been doing.   When Clinton was President and when Obama was President, most of the  judges they chose were moderate to liberal. They were not extreme. But  the hard right has such a grip on the Republican Party these days--the  Federalist Society, the Heritage Foundation, way out of the mainstream.   Most Americans don't believe in repealing Roe v. Wade. It is the  mission of the Federalist Society. Most Americans don't believe the  government should get out of healthcare altogether--Medicare, Medicaid,  ACA. It is the goal of the Heritage Foundation. But they put these  judges forward. President Trump has gone along with their lists and  their nominees. Unfortunately, we don't hear a peep out of our  Republican colleagues as the hard right hijacks the judicial bench in  America.   The goal of this campaign is to achieve by judicial fiat what  Republicans have been unable to accomplish through legislation. This  hard-right agenda--extremely pro-corporate, extremely anti-consumer,  anti-environment, anti-gun safety--must be pursued through the courts  because the hard right--the Koch brothers and all of these hard-right  groups--realize that they never get things through even a body like the  Senate, where they have a majority of the Republicans, or the House.  They want the one nonelected branch to turn the clock back decades, if  not centuries. It will hurt America. It will fractionalize America. The  middle class will be worse off. But the hard-right knows that these  types of nominations don't get much focus.   An apotheosis of this is the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the  Supreme Court as well. Kavanaugh was groomed as a partisan lawyer in  the Clinton and Bush eras. He was added to a list of 25 judges vetted  and approved by these two groups--the Heritage Foundation, dedicated to  getting rid of Medicaid, getting rid of Medicare, getting the  government out of healthcare altogether and letting people struggle,  [[Page S5024]]  letting those parents who have kids with illnesses never get insurance;  and the Federalist Society, dedicated by its leader, by its own  admission, to repealing Roe v. Wade. An analysis of the judicial  philosophy of Kavanaugh by Professor Lee Epstein found that Judge  Kavanaugh would be the second most conservative Justice on the bench,  even to the right of Justice Gorsuch and second only to Justice Thomas,  one of the most extremely conservative judges who has ever been on the  bench.   That political and judicial history is key to understanding how  Kavanaugh would rule as a member of the Supreme Court. On issues like  healthcare and reproductive rights, on which the President has been  crystal-clear about picking judges who are anti-Roe and hostile to  healthcare, Judge Kavanaugh will have an enormous and unfortunate  impact, if confirmed. After what the President has said, after knowing  what the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation stand for, does  anyone think Judge Kavanaugh would have been nominated by those parties  if they weren't sure he would repeal or dramatically limit the ACA or  Roe v. Wade?   Judge Kavanaugh, like Mr. Oldham and like Mr. Bounds, is outside of  the political mainstream--dramatically outside--even outside of the  Republican mainstream. It is part and parcel of the hard-right campaign  that Republicans bow down and go along with to install conservative  ideologues on the bench.   So I would say to my fellow Americans: No matter what your political  persuasion--Democrat, Republican, Independent--everyone should want a  more representative process for choosing judges and Supreme Court  Justices in the Senate. Instead, humming in the background of the  Senate's more newsworthy business, the Republican majority has  confirmed a conveyor belt of nakedly partisan, ideological judges to  the bench. Senators from both parties, in an America that wants  moderation, should lock arms and put a stop to it.   I yield the floor.
