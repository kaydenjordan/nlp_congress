 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, this is an absolute disgrace. It is beyond belief how  terrible this moment is. It is embarrassing to the people of the United  States what is going on.   We have seen three versions of this bill written behind closed doors  in Speaker Pelosi's office. As we stand here this second--as we stand  here, Madam Speaker, this second--they are rewriting a fourth version  of the bill in Speaker Pelosi's office.   We will be recessing shortly, sometime during this debate, so the  Rules Committee can present a fourth version of a 2,000-page bill. Once  again, in this House, Speaker Pelosi is trying to pass a bill before  anyone knows what is in it, so then the American people can read it  after it has been passed.   Let me tell you, Madam Speaker, I will tell you what is in the  version of the bill right now. It is the worst piece of legislation  that I have seen in my entire life of public service. It is  transformational. It will completely change America as we know it, all  at the expense of working-class families.   They call it the Build Back Better bill. Let me tell you what those  three b's stand for: bankrupts the economy; benefits the wealthy; and  builds the Washington machine.    We are standing here because this is a budget bill. It originated in  the Budget Committee. Speaker Pelosi said that a budget is a statement  of your values. Well, let's see the Democratic Party's values by what  is in their bill.   Of this 2,100-page bill, it bankrupts the economy. They will try to  tell you that the bill is less than $2 trillion. They will try to tell  you that a $4.5 trillion spending bill will cost zero. Well, the  American people are not stupid. You don't spend $4.5 trillion and it  costs zero. That is one of their talking points.   Even Senator Manchin, a Democrat Senator from West Virginia, says  that this bill creates shell games.   We know there are all kinds of budget gimmicks to try to make it look  like it only spends $1.5 trillion. In fact, it spends $4.5 trillion.  Even The New York Times agrees that it spends a whole lot more money  than what the Democrats are saying.   It is also not only the largest spending bill in the history of this  United States; it is the largest tax increase in the history of the  United States. It increases taxes on working-class families of all  income levels, all at a time when we are facing record inflation.   Since Joe Biden has taken office, inflation is over 7 percent. In my  home State, inflation is over 8 percent.   Madam Speaker, the folks on the other side of the aisle will say that  inflation is just a high-class problem. They will say that it is only  transitory. But I can tell you, the people of Missouri and the people  across this country care about those increasing prices in the  supermarket, not the prices in the stock market.   This bill only punishes Main Street while rewarding Wall Street, and  you should be ashamed of what is going on in this bill, Madam Speaker.  This bill benefits the wealthy beyond belief.   The Democrats always say that they are the party of the working  class. Well, in fact, the 10 most wealthy congressional districts in  this body are all held by liberal Democrats. In fact, Wall Street spent  more than $70 million to defeat Donald Trump and to elect Joe Biden.  Why are they doing this bill? They are doing this bill to reward their  political friends, their constituents, their allies, their donors.   The second largest program in this bill is a tax cut for  millionaires, $250 billion for a tax cut for millionaires. A  millionaire family will get $25,900 in a tax break in this bill, but a  middle-class family will get $20.                                time  1030    They are just rewarding their friends.   But, Madam Speaker, do you know what?   Those millionaires also get $12,500 to buy luxury electric cars.   Guess what, Madam Speaker?   Those millionaires also get government taxpayer-paid family leave.  The list goes on and on about the benefits to the wealthy. This body  should be ashamed of what is about to happen.   The third B, it builds the Washington bureaucracy. This bill creates  more than 150 new Federal programs.   It is all about control. This bill is about controlling every aspect  of Americans' lives whether it is their paychecks, whether it is their  healthcare decisions, or whether it is their kids' education. I would  think that the Democrats, after seeing what happened a few weeks ago in  Virginia, New Jersey, and all across this country, would know that the  American people are fed up with government control. In fact, over the  weekend, a poll said 60 percent of Americans believe that Joe Biden and  the Democrats are expanding government control beyond belief.   If we want to protect working-class families, if we want to protect  our freedoms, and if we want to save America, we have to kill this  bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  good gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Feenstra).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I would like to read a quote of a Senator who happens  to be the budget chair on the other side of the aisle. He is quoted,  ``You can't be a political party that talks about demanding the wealthy  pay their fair share of taxes and then end up with a bill that gives  large tax breaks to many millionaires.   ``You can't do that. The hypocrisy is too strong. It's bad policy,  it's bad politics.''   Madam Speaker, I agree with Senator Bernie Sanders. In this bill the  hypocrisy is way too strong.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the great gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Rouzer).    Madam Speaker, only in this Chamber will you  hear people say that if you spend trillions more dollars it will only  make inflation go down. The American people aren't that stupid.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the fine gentleman from New York  (Mr. Garbarino).    Madam Speaker, as the gentlewoman from Texas  says, this helps a lot of people, especially if you are a millionaire.  That is why it is the second largest provision in this bill. It is tax  breaks for millionaires.   In fact, Senator Tester from Montana is quoted, he is ``not a big fan  because I think it gives tax breaks to the wrong people: rich people.''  That is a Democrat Senator from Montana.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the fine gentleman from New York  (Mr. Jacobs).    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comments of  the gentleman from New York, but I would just like to point out, in his  home State, a family of four with two children under six, in just over  a year, will face more than a $3,200 tax increase. But yet, a  millionaire in his State, for the next 10 years, will receive a tax  break of over $25,000 a year.   Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the fine  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentleman from Georgia.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from the great State of North Carolina (Ms. Foxx).    Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield 2 minutes  to the gentlewoman from Colorado (Mrs. Boebert). She is someone who is  a warrior, a fighter for conservatism and, apparently, even the Budget  chairman is threatened by her.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Madam Speaker, as the gentlewoman from  California said, there is $150 billion in this program for housing  assistance. What is unfortunate, which she didn't share, is that it  also allows felons of domestic violence to get those grants, which is  unacceptable.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Cline).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I would like to read a quote from the Democrat Congressman from  Maine, talking about the huge tax break for the millionaires. He says:  ``The fact that more people and organizations on the Democratic side  aren't up in arms about this is wild.''   I am surprised with a lot of my colleagues on the other side who want  to help working-class Americans, who instead are going to be supporting  a bill that helps wealthy Americans.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Virginia  (Mr. Good).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Obernolte).    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a  document from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget that shows  the true cost of the bill is over $4 trillion.    [From the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Nov. 5, 2021]        House Build Back Better Bills Are Built on Shaky Foundation         The House is slated to vote today on two parts of the       President's Build Back Better agenda--the bipartisan       infrastructure bill (https://www.crfb.org/blogs/ infrastructure-plan-will-add-400-billion-deficit-cbo-finds)       and a reconciliation bill addressing climate change, child       care, health care. and other priorities.        The following is a statement from Maya MacGuineas,       president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget:         A fiscally responsible Build Back Better agenda should be       fully paid for, gimmick-free, well-targeted based on the       country's needs, and enacted in the context of a broader       budget. While policymakers should be commended for their       efforts to scale back costs and include real offsets, these       bills still fall far short of those goals.        While President Biden and Members of Congress pledged their       agenda would not add to the debt, it is likely that both       bills would increase the deficit based on official estimates.       The bipartisan infrastructure bill--negotiated by Democrats       and Republicans--will add roughly $400 billion (https:// www.crfb.org/blogs/infrastructure-plan-will-add-400-billion- deficit-cbo-finds) to the debt over the next decade. While we       still don't know the true fiscal impact of the reconciliation       legislation, it is likely that it will add modestly to the       deficit as well. No one should vote for this bill prior to       seeing a CBO score.        The bills are also riddled with gimmicks. The bipartisan       infrastructure bill claims it is fully paid for by taking       credit for saving (https://www.crfb.org/blogs/whats- bipartisan-infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act) that had       nothing to do with the bill itself. The reconciliation bill       keeps its official cost down through arbitrary expirations--      the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit expansions       after one year, Affordable Care Act expansions after 3 and 4       years, and child care and pre-K after six years. If these and       other sunset policies are extended without offsets, it would       cost an additional $2 to $2.5 trillion through the end of the       decade.        And then there's the last-minute addition of a SALT cap       increase, which will deliver a huge tax cut to very high       earners (https://www.crfb.org/blogs/72500-salt-cap-costly- and-regressive) at a cost of nearly $300 billion over the       first five years. The proposed SALT cap increase would cost       more than the bill's Child Tax Credit, health coverage       expansions, housing initiatives, or education funding, and       roughly 98 percent of the benefit would go to those making       six figures. This is egregious in light of the objectives of       the bill. This tax cut would be offset on paper with a       sleight of hand where policymakers extend the SALT cap beyond       2026 but leave other accompanying parts of the TCJA for       future lawmakers to extend.        All of this is being considered in the context of near-      record levels of debt, trust funds years away from       insolvency, and an unsustainable fiscal situation that few in       either party are even trying to address. Given the current       budget outlook, we should ideally be pursuing long-term       deficit reduction, rather than limiting deficit increases.       And we should be doing it in the context of an actual       detailed budget for the nation.        Washington's credibility is on the line, and we need to get       this right. Rather than rush through irresponsible       legislation before it has even been scored, the House should       fix the flaws in the current bills to ensure the Build Back       Better agenda--both reconciliation and infrastructure--is       honestly accounted for and truly paid for.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman  from Illinois, and I remind her that government spending is already  helping fuel an inflation fire that is on pace to raise prices at the  fastest rate in 40 years. In her home State of Illinois, food prices  currently are up 8 percent, clothing is up 9 percent, and gasoline  prices are up 62 percent.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I will point out that since Joe Biden became President  on January 20, the policies that he enacted by executive order in his  first week in office have created an incredibly awful border crisis.   Unfortunately, 1.4 million people have illegally crossed the southern  border since Joe Biden has taken office. And what does this legislation  do?   This legislation will only make it worse by providing over $100  billion in this legislation for backdoor amnesty.   This bill also provides roughly $45,000 of benefits to illegals over  U.S. citizens. That is unacceptable. The American people are opposed to  that, and they are not liking it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Malliotakis).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I hear all the time in this  Chamber people say it is for the children or it is for the kids. What  hogwash from the other side to say that this bill helps the children  with the child tax credit.   Your child tax credit is for 1 year, but your tax break for  millionaires is for 10?   You are spending $250 billion in tax breaks for millionaires and $130  billion for 1 year for families.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Less than one-third of this budget bill is scored. Less than one- third. But what we do know is that it will not be fully paid for, and  over the next 5 years it will add roughly $800 billion to debt. We do  know that.   This bill only bankrupts the economy. It benefits your wealthy  political friends, allies, and donors, and it only builds the  Washington machine.   If working-class Americans are considered millionaires, then this  bill is helping them because it is all about the millionaires.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
