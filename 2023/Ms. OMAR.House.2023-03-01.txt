 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today to call on Congress to take up economic  measurement tools that will uplift all Americans.   My amendment would add factors from the genuine progress indicator to  register budgetary reporting. GPI would supplement the information we  get from traditional measures like GDP, which mainly emphasizes growth  for its own sake.   GPI would provide a more accurate and inclusive assessment of  economic well-being. It evaluates the positive and negative factors of  economic activity ranging from the benefits of infrastructure and  workforce development to the process costs of income inequality and  pollution on our collective well-being.   It would give us the chance to finally account for important but  overlooked aspects of society such as wealth distribution, economic  sustainability, and the overall quality of life for everyday Americans.   We must recognize that collective prosperity is only attainable if we  identify the gaps and barriers preventing our most vulnerable  communities from thriving.   My amendment simply seeks to give lawmakers more comprehensive data  so that we can make more informed policy decisions.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment in order  to focus our policy lens on the lives of working and poor families in  America.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0915     Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Chairman, as my colleague on the other side of the  aisle admittedly said, this is just another factor that gives us more  tools, more ability to fully comprehend what is happening with our  economy.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and vote  ``yes.''
