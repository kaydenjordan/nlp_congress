 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute as in morning business.    Mr. President, our U.S. dairy farmers have had a tough  decade. Margins are thinner than ever, and new milk substitutes can be  found in every grocery store. While dairy farmers scored a major  victory in the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement with increased market  access to Canada, there is a scary new trend that is very disturbing.   Hollywood jokers have taken a stand against raising cows with the so- called hashtag ``mootoo'' movement. This is udderly irresponsible. U.S.  dairies produce the highest quality milk and cheese in the world under  the highest standards of care. Drink and eat dairy products. It is good  for you--especially ice cream. Help our dairy farmers.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader
