 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Kristy Sandoval as a  Valley Luchadora.   Kristy is a Los Angeles-based, self-taught artist from Pacoima whose  murals have put the city of L.A.'s art on the map.   She grew up in Pacoima and studied at the Academy of Art University  in San Francisco, where her community and personal experiences  influenced her work.   In the last 15 years, she has painted more than 50 murals. Her art,  including pieces titled ``Decolonized'' and ``A Womyn's Place is in the  Struggle,'' brings awareness to social justice issues and focuses on  female empowerment.   Kristy, along with other artists, helped kick-start the  transformation of a corridor in the Northeast San Fernando Valley known  as the Mural Mile, a 3-mile stretch of Van Nuys Boulevard that has  nearly three dozen murals.   These murals brought Kristy international recognition, and she was  the first female participant at the Mural Istanbul Festival in 2015.   She received the Phenomenal Woman Award in 2016 from the Department  of Gender and Women's Studies at California State University,  Northridge, and has presented her work and spoken at various  universities, museums, organizations, and events and in the media.   In 2017, she worked with Amnesty International through their Art for  Amnesty campaign, creating art pieces representing individual political  prisoner cases from around the world.   Kristy believes in the healing power of art and continues to paint  murals, direct and develop arts programming, and much more.   Her contribution to the Mural Mile has changed the face and  reputation of Pacoima from a place that people would avoid visiting to  a neighborhood where sold-out mural tours stroll down the streets. Her  art shows our neighborhood as the beautiful, unique place that it  always has been and truly is.   Thank you, Kristy, for your transformative artwork. It is my honor to  recognize you as a distinguished community leader and luchadora during  this Hispanic Heritage Month.                             Honoring Danny Trejo     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Danny Trejo as a  Valley Luchador.   Danny is one of the best-known actors in film, a community leader, a  champion of the arts, and a dear friend of mine.   His prolific career in the entertainment industry came from hard work  and an atypical road to success. Danny's path has led him on an  incredible journey, rising from serving time in prison to a Hollywood  star and to a real-life hero when he rescued a baby who was trapped in  the child seat of an SUV that collided with another vehicle in Sylmar  just a few years ago.   Danny grew up in an environment where crime and drugs were common. He  ended up involved in drug dealing and robbery. It is well known that  Danny was sent to prison for these crimes. He survived prison riots,  solitary confinement, and a terrifying brush with death row.    Throughout the 1960s, Danny was a regular in the California prison  system until he was released on parole in 1969. It was then that he  decided to change his life for the better.   After coming out of incarceration, he worked odd jobs in  construction, gardening, sales, and labor while spending his evenings  in recovery meetings and mentoring kids to keep them from making the  same mistakes he did.   Danny was introduced to the acting world as an extra but was  exclusively cast as an imposing gang member for years before he grew  into the leading actor we all know and love today.   His very real background story has made him one of Hollywood's most  recognizable character actors. He has grown into a professional actor  working alongside and with the likes of Al Pacino, Nicolas Cage, and  the filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, all while inspiring young people with  his story.   Danny Trejo's transformation from juvenile delinquent to Hollywood  star is an impressive example of personal growth and improvement that  gives hope and inspiration to everyone.   Danny's extraordinary success continues in his businesses. He founded  a restaurant chain in honor of his mother and created his own brand.   Danny has never forgotten who he is and the impact he makes in our  neighborhood. He continues to be accessible in the community and  frequently volunteers his time, and he is a regular at the annual  Pacoima Christmas Parade.   Thank you, Danny, for your contributions to the arts and continued  commitment to community service. It is my honor to recognize you as a  distinguished leader and luchador during this Hispanic Heritage Month.                                time  1800                             People Over Politics
