 Mr. Speaker, today I rise on behalf of the communities and  the residents surrounding Lakes Freeman and Shafer.   This summer, these communities witnessed the water levels in Lake  Freeman reach a dangerously low level. The low water levels were  brought on by drought, but were exacerbated by a U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service ruling meant to protect several species of mussels.   However well-intended the ruling, it is having devastating  consequences for these communities and the city of Monticello. Local  businesses are struggling to get by, property values are decreasing,  and the ecosystem of the lake is threatened.   Fish and Wildlife have the power to resolve this issue, but the  agency has been unable to adjust to realtime circumstances.   I brought this issue to the attention of the Department of the  Interior. My hope is that our government can be responsive to the  concerns of the people on a problem they have helped create.

This year marks the 25th year that Dr. Eutsler has co-chaired the  nationally televised IPL 500 Festival Parade. Using his experience as  the former director of bands at McCutcheon High School, he has helped  over 45,000 students from 425 Indiana schools participate in the  nationally acclaimed IPL 500 Festival Parade.   Prior to his appointment as co-chair, Dr. Eutsler has served as an  enthusiastic supporter of the Indianapolis 500 Festival for decades.  Mark has attended the parade consistently since 1980 and has been a  volunteer for the event for 29 years.   Dr. Eutsler's consecutive years of service stand out among the more  than 3,000 volunteers who will fill roughly 7,000 positions for the  month-long May event every year.   Dr. Mark Eutsler is a pillar of the community. I express my deepest  thanks and appreciation for his passion and for the service he has  devoted to a program that defines Hoosier heritage.                            ____________________
