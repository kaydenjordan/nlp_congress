 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, June marks the start of the Atlantic  hurricane season, and 2021 is on us, but my constituents are still  suffering from the storms of 2020. There are a lot of folks in  Louisiana who are still hurting. If you were to fly over Lake Charles,  LA, you would still see blue tarps on roofs of homes damaged a year  ago.   I took to the Senate floor last month stressing the need for disaster  supplemental while Lake Charles and Baton Rouge at that time were  getting hit by heavy rains and severe flooding. At the time, Lake  Charles ended up with 8 to 15 inches of rain in less than 12 hours. It  is heartbreaking to see them affected once more by a natural disaster.  Baton Rouge got more than 13 inches of rain overnight, with 15,000  homes and businesses without power the next morning. All this comes on  the heels of Hurricanes Laura and Delta and winter storms which had  catastrophic damage to livestock, crops, and structures for Louisiana  farmers.   For those who need a refresher, 2020 set a record for the most named  storms--30 in 1 season and 5 of those named storms hitting Louisiana,  which is also a record. Hurricane Laura, a category 4 hurricane, hit  Lake Charles, devastated it, and then almost the exact same place that  Laura hit, Delta hit--category 2--6 weeks later. It is unprecedented to  have one hurricane followed by another.   NOAA calculates the damage from Hurricane Laura at about $19 billion  and Delta at $2.9 billion. Laura wreaked havoc through devastating  winds, which reached 150 miles per hour at landfall--the strongest  hurricane to hit my State since 1856. Delta was just rain. In LeBleu  Settlement, just northeast of Lake Charles, they received almost 18  inches.   I may sound like a broken record, but I need to just play this broken  record once more. We cannot allow the impact of an entire year's worth  of natural disasters to go unaddressed.   Just a few weeks ago, I was in Lake Charles, and I heard incredible  frustration about rebuilding in the aftermath of these storms--a church  still with its roof ripped off; homes, as I mentioned, covered with  tarps--and stories from members of the community who are not back in  their homes and, frankly, may not even be back in their city because  there are no homes and there is no housing for them to return to.   The people in Lake Charles have an incredible resilience and an  incredible we-can-do spirit. So you go there, and people are laughing  and they are smiling, but then you see that blue tarp, and you know  that this community will not recover at the way things are going. I  would argue that the weather events were tragic, but the lack of action  upon recovery is making a tragedy worse.   In March, my colleague from Oregon, Senator Jeff Merkley, and I urged  the Biden administration to support a supplemental disaster  appropriation to urgently address and direct Federal resources to  communities throughout America struggling to recover from hurricanes,  floods, wildfires, and other 2020 natural disasters.   President Biden came to Louisiana. Once more, he heard from Mayor Nic  Hunter, Governor Edwards, and myself that we could hopefully have some  relief. We need programs like community development block grants,  disaster recovery, mitigation funding, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineer  funding for southwest coastal Louisiana hurricane and storm damage risk  reduction. We need emergency solutions grants and social services block  grants to provide assistance to the thousands of families who have lost  their homes due to hurricanes like those I have been describing.   We are past due moving quickly. If it happened tomorrow, it still  would have not happened quickly, and we have gone into another year  which could have similar storms. We need to help the people of  Southwest Louisiana. The region has been pounded. My job is to do all I  can to help them get back on their feet.   Once more, I call on my colleagues in the House and the Senate with a  simple message: Let's get a disaster supplemental done.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, today I rise in recognition of  seersucker manufacturers and enthusiasts across the United States. I  wish everyone a happy National Seersucker Day. This uniquely American  fashion has a storied history dating back to 1909. The first seersucker  suit was designed by Joseph Haspel at his Broad Street facility in New  Orleans, LA. Louisiana is proud to have played an important part in  introducing the country to seersucker apparel.   This lightweight cotton fabric, known for its signature pucker, has  been worn and enjoyed by Americans across the country during the hot  summer months. Mr. Haspel said it best: ``Hot is hot, no matter what  you do for a living.''   In the 1990s, Seersucker Day was established by Members of this  Chamber to honor this unique American fashion. I proudly resumed this  tradition in 2014 in the U.S. House of Representatives and continued  this tradition in the U.S. Senate. This year, I wish to designate  Thursday, June 17, as the eighth annual National Seersucker Day. I  encourage everyone to wear seersucker on this day to commemorate this  traditionally American clothing.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Parker Loy,  an intern in my office, be granted floor privileges for today, June 17,  2021.
