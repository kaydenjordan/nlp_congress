 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  legacy of Arkansas businessman and Tyson Foods founder, the late John  William Tyson.   John spent his life building Tyson Foods into one of the world's  leading food companies and was equally committed to serving northwest  Arkansas.   In 1931, John Tyson moved his family to Springdale with only a nickel  in his pocket. There, he laid the foundation for a future Fortune 100  company.   John transformed the poultry industry. He developed a novel in- transit feeding system, hatched chickens, and produced commercial feed  himself. With each new venture, John diversified and grew his business.   In 1947, Tyson Feed and Hatchery was incorporated. Over time, the  business expanded to become the successful company that we know today.   He exemplified the entrepreneurial spirit of our State, and it is for  his contributions to the Arkansas economy that he is being posthumously  enshrined in the Arkansas Business Hall of Fame.   I congratulate his family for this terrific honor.                            ____________________
