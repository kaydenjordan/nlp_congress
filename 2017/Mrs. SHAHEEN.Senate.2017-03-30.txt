 Madam President, I come to the floor to join my  colleagues in opposing this misguided measure, which would leave  millions of women and families with fewer healthcare options, and it  would drastically decrease women's access to basic primary and  preventive health services, including lifesaving cancer screenings and  HIV testing.   Make no mistake about it, as my colleagues have said, the primary  target of this legislation is Planned Parenthood. For years now, we  have seen Republican leaders in Congress attempt to defund this  essential healthcare provider, which serves millions of women  nationwide, including nearly 12,000 women in New Hampshire, most of  them with incomes below or near the poverty line. The sad irony of  these attacks is that study after study has shown that restricting  access to birth control and other family planning methods actually  increases the number of abortions.   The authoritative Guttmacher Institute estimates that in 2014 alone,  contraceptive care provided under title X helped women avert more than  900,000 unintended pregnancies and 326,000 abortions. Without  contraceptive care provided by title X funded centers, the U.S. rates  of unintended pregnancy and preventable abortions would be an estimated  33 percent higher, and the teen pregnancy rate would be 30 percent  higher.   At the end of the Obama administration, teen pregnancy in the United  States was at its lowest point since we have been keeping track. As  Senator Hirono said, these services don't provide abortions. Federal  law expressly forbids the use of Federal funds to pay for abortion,  except to save the life of the mother.   So the real issue here is not about abortion. This is about ensuring  that American women have access to the basic healthcare they need,  where they want to receive it. This is just a mean-spirited effort to  keep women from seeing the provider they want to see and getting care  at rates they can afford. For 40 percent of women, their visit to a  family planning center is the only care they receive annually.   In 2015 alone, title X provided basic primary and preventive  healthcare services such as Pap tests, breast exams, birth control, and  HIV testing to more than 4 million women and men at nearly 4,000 health  centers. Planned Parenthood plays an essentially important role in  delivering health services to low-income, uninsured, and vulnerable  individuals, including in rural areas.   I am sure that every person in this Chamber has received letters and  emails and phone calls from constituents on this issue. They are  pleading with us: Don't take away our access to healthcare from Planned  Parenthood.   I received a letter from Sandra Sonnichsen of Goshen, NH. She writes:         Planned Parenthood was my only affordable source of       gynecological healthcare for most of my life. I received       good, wise, and thoughtful care. I think it is not extreme to       say they saved my life. Abortions were not involved. They--    Meaning Planned Parenthood--       remain very important, especially for poor or uninsured       women. There are not enough alternate low cost women's       clinics available. Not providing birth control services to       women who want it is not a good economic or social solution.       Don't let it be defunded.    In a follow-up call, Sandra said that without Planned Parenthood, she  would not have had any healthcare at all. Because her mother died of  breast cancer, Sandra is deeply grateful that she has been able to  receive mammograms, thanks to Planned Parenthood.   I also heard from Meredith Murray of Exeter, NH. She says:         Nine years ago I graduated from college and immediately       began my journey to become a medical provider. . . . During       this time in my life, I was surviving almost entirely on       student loans. And I knew that during this time, especially,       I needed to ensure that I was doing all I could to prevent       pregnancy. . . . With my insurance--an IUD would have cost       $900. That was not possible for me to afford. Then I       remembered--Planned Parenthood. . . . I was informed, due to       title X funding, my IUD would be completely covered. I       continued to use Planned Parenthood services for the next 5       years for my routine screenings while in medical school. The       care I received was phenomenal. As I proceeded through my       medical training, I strived to be as kind, compassionate, and       knowledgeable as those who work Planned Parenthood health       centers. I am now a practicing medical provider, married, and       still using an IUD because Planned Parenthood offered me that       opportunity.    I received this letter from Samantha Fox of Bow, NH. She writes:         In 2007, I was a 19-year-old just barely starting out when       I was denied health insurance due to a preexisting condition.       Had I been able to access affordable coverage, my preexisting       condition, a reproductive system disorder, would have been       easily manageable. . . . At that time, I was able to access       care through Planned Parenthood, which likely preserved my       ability to conceive in the future.    And finally, let me share this message from Robina Parise of Rye, NH.  She says:         I started utilizing the services at Planned Parenthood for       birth control when I was about 17 years old. . . . Planned       Parenthood made sure I was protected and healthy. They gave       me access to vital protection and healthcare when I could not       get it anywhere else. They regularly called me with reminders       to have exams and to pick up my prescription. Planned       Parenthood is the reason my husband and I were able to       graduate from high school and college. . . . I'm not sure       what our lives would be like now without their support.    I don't know. Do the people who are voting for this CRA believe it  would be better to have allowed the people whom I just talked about--to  prohibit their access to these healthcare services so that their lives  would have been disrupted, so they might not have finished college, so  we wouldn't have another doctor in the world, so they wouldn't be able  to afford healthcare? I hope we will listen to our constituents who  have been speaking out in passionate support of Planned Parenthood and  other family planning clinics.    This is about respecting women's access to healthcare services,  including millions of vulnerable women who have nowhere else to turn  for essential care. This is also about respecting women's  constitutionally protected right to make our own reproductive choices.  We must not allow Congress to strip away investments in family planning  clinics by allowing States to discriminate.   Finally, I want to point out that we haven't heard from any of our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are voting for this  measure about why they think it is so critical. I don't know. Maybe  they are not willing to come to the floor and tell my constituents why  they should be denied access to healthcare from the provider they want.  Well, I am disappointed that we haven't heard from anyone who is  willing to stand up and defend this vote. I hope they are going to have  to defend it to the American people.   Madam President, I yield the floor.
