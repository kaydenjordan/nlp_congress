 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and  congratulate him on his important amendment. I hope this important  study will be part of that legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to come to the floor to join our  colleagues, the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee and the former chair, Mr. Upton, in their bipartisan support  of this legislation.   I salute Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, a crusader in this urgent  mission to protect our communities from PFAS chemicals.   I also thank Mr. Tonko, the chair of the Environment and Climate  Change Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee.   The list goes on and on, and I will name some more.   Last year, our Members worked relentlessly to pass bold legislation  to tackle the PFAS crisis. We salute the Members whose bills were  included in the bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act agreement  reached by the House.                                time  0945    Unfortunately, at the end of the year, the Senate GOP refused to join  the House to secure full, robust protections against PFAS chemicals,  and key provisions were cut from the NDAA, the National Defense  Authorization Act. The Senate GOP obstruction is why we are here today.   We are also here today because our distinguished chairman, Mr.  Pallone, promised that we would have a chance to vote on robust  legislation after the first of the year. I thank the chairman.   PFAS chemicals are a serious public health threat, contaminating the  water we drink, the air we breathe, and the food we eat. These forever  chemicals--which do not break down easily--are exposing millions of  Americans to liver disease, asthma, thyroid dysfunction, multiple forms  of cancer, and further health threats.   Today, nearly all Americans, including newborn babies, expectant  mothers, and children, have PFAS in their blood; and up to 110 million  people may be drinking tainted water, including, as our colleagues from  Michigan have indicated, the challenge in their State indicated by the  leadership and demonstrated on the floor in a bipartisan way on this  issue.   Our colleague from Hoosick Falls, New York, Mr. Delgado, has been a  champion on this issue. Their contamination from a plastics factory  raised the level of PFAS chemicals in residents' blood to 100 times the  national average, Mr. Shimkus.   In Chincoteague, Virginia, near Maryland, where I grew up,  contamination from NASA Wallops Flight Center forced the local  community to find an entirely new drinking water supply. And we thank  Congresswoman Luria for her leadership in all of this.   And Mr. Pappas, also with Annie Kuster, has a situation in  Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where contamination from Pease Air Force  Base poisoned the drinking water of thousands of residents, including  children and infants.   Mr. Chair, before we won the majority, we had a hearing. It really  was about a number of issues, environmental justice being one of them.  Reverend Barbera brought people from all over the country to talk about  this. I particularly remember our conversations in the testimony of  Peggy Price.   She came and told the story of her family and how they were affected  by what was happening at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. It was a very  sad story. Their families suffered, the parents, the children--just a  horrible situation. They were serving our country at Camp Lejeune, and  they were victimized by the water supply there.   Particularly egregious, is the epidemic of contamination on military  sites, as I mentioned just now, and more than 400 sites across the  United States are affected. It is unacceptable that our men and women  who sacrifice to keep us safe around the world face this danger in  their health at home.   Sadly, some big corporations and the EPA have known about the risks  from PFAS chemicals for decades, but they have failed to prevent the  spread of contamination. The Trump administration's EPA is breaking its  own promises every day that it delays and puts polluters ahead of the  American people.   In stark contrast, the House is taking action. We are cleaning up  communities by designating PFAS as a hazardous substance by the EPA,  which is the key barrier to cleaning up military and industrial sites.  [[Page H158]]    We are also creating new, robustly funded grants, in partnership with  States, to help with cleanup and remediation efforts. Hopefully, we  will be adding this important study that Mr. Levin is proposing to this  legislation.   And we are helping stem the tide of further contamination with tough,  new testing reporting and monitoring requirements, strict limits on the  introduction of new PFAS chemicals, limits on air emissions, and  banning unsafe incineration--strong measures to hold contaminating  companies accountable.   Last month, the Senate GOP fought to prevent many of these lifesaving  measures from becoming law in the NDAA. Now, Senator McConnell will  have to explain once again to the American people why he is blocking  our bipartisan action to clean up contaminated communities.   I urge a strong vote on this legislation to keep the American people  healthy and safe and, again, salute all of those who have worked so  hard to bring this legislation to the floor in a bipartisan way.
