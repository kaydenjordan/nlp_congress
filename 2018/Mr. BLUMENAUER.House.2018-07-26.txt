 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy in  permitting me to speak on this bill.   I am pleased that this bill is being named after Senator McCain. It  has been my privilege to work with him in one particular area: dealing  with the people who worked with us in Afghanistan and Iraq on special  immigrant visas.   Along with the late Senator Kennedy, over the last 10 years, we  worked to try and help these people who put their lives on the line to  help our forces as guides, as interpreters, who are now being left to  the tender mercies of people with long memories, like the Taliban and  al-Qaida. Their lives are at risk, as are their family members'. We  still have 17,000 applicants who want to have these visas to come to  the United States to safety.   I am disappointed that we have been unable to have the funding for  additional visa allocations. I appreciate that due to an accounting  convention, this would be at the expense of other important things that  are being fought for.   But I would hope that we are able to focus on what the costs would  have been to us if we didn't have those people helping us in  Afghanistan and Iraq. It would have been far more expensive. And like  you, I have met with people whose lives were saved because they put  themselves at risk, and we are leaving them behind.   My friend, Kirk Johnson, wrote a book: ``To Be a Friend Is Fatal: The  [[Page H7706]]  Fight to Save the Iraqis America Left Behind.'' And for these people,  being a friend of the United States is fatal. Their lives are at risk  every day.   I hope, as this process goes forward, we can either deal with the  accounting convention or try and find some money to rescue these  people.
