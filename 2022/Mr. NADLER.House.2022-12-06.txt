 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7946, the  Veteran Service Recognition Act.   This modest but important legislation would ensure that noncitizen  Active-Duty military, veterans, and their families are treated with the  dignity and respect befitting the sacrifice they have given to this  country.   While military service can offer an expedited pathway to  naturalization, many noncitizen servicemembers leave the military  without becoming a U.S. citizen because of unnecessarily burdensome  requirements that they must meet.   Further, many servicemembers have family members who lack lawful  status in the United States with no ability to adjust their status. As  a result, while our military personnel are deployed protecting U.S.  global interests and keeping our Nation safe, they must worry if their  loved ones will be apprehended in an immigration raid and potentially  be deported.   This legislation would address this concern and would protect our  servicemembers, just as they protect us.   It would, one, establish an advisory committee to review and provide  recommendations on the cases of noncitizen veterans, Active  servicemembers, and their families who are placed in removal  proceedings.   Two, it would direct the Department of Homeland Security and the  Department of Defense to implement the program that allows noncitizen  servicemembers to file for naturalization during basic training or as  early as otherwise possible.    Three, it would provide an opportunity for noncitizen veterans who  have been removed or ordered removed, and who have not been convicted  of serious crimes, to be considered for lawful permanent resident  status.   Four, it would allow certain immediate relatives of U.S. citizen  servicemembers or veterans in the United States to adjust their status  and to obtain a green card as long as they are otherwise admissible.   Despite the rhetoric that we have already heard from our Republican  colleagues throughout this debate, I want to make it clear that H.R.  7946 has nothing to do with the border. This legislation is about  recognizing and honoring the sacrifice of our servicemembers by  supporting them and their families and by giving them the opportunity  to become U.S. citizens if they so desire.   I thank Chairman Takano of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, as well  as Chair Zoe Lofgren of the Subcommittee on Immigration and  Citizenship, for their commitment and leadership on this issue. I was  honored to join them in introducing the legislation before us today.   Immigrants have served in our Armed Forces since the founding of our  Nation. In return for their service and sacrifice, we promised them,  and they have earned, the opportunity to become American citizens.   I hope all of my colleagues will demonstrate their commitment to our  servicemembers and our veterans by supporting this important  legislation.                                time  1330
