 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of my bill, H.R. 8, the  Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019.   Mr. Chair, first, I thank Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Nadler for  their support. Gun violence is a true national emergency, and I am glad  that we are moving so early in this Congress to address this crisis.   Mr. Chair, I also thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  who recognize the importance of passing this legislation,  Representatives King, Fitzpatrick, Mast, Upton, and Smith, who stand  with more than 90 percent of Americans who support universal background  checks.                                time  1245    This bill will require a background check on all firearm sales and  most transfers. Mr. Chairman, I am a lifelong gun owner. I am a hunter  and I support the Second Amendment. If this bill did anything to erode  the rights of lawful gun owners, I wouldn't support it and it wouldn't  have my name on it.   Background checks work. Every day, they stop 170 felons and 50  domestic abusers from getting a gun from a licensed dealer. But, in  some States, those same people can go into a gun show or go online and  buy a gun without a background check. This bill will help stop them  from doing so.   Some will argue that criminals won't follow the law. If that is the  case, then why do we have laws against murder? People still commit  murder. Why do we have laws against stealing? People still steal. This  is flawed logic, and don't fall for it.   This bill is supported by law enforcement, medical professionals,  veterans, gun owners, religious leaders, and the millions of Americans  who took to the streets in support of H.R. 8.   Mr. Chairman, I ask that my colleagues support this bill and honor  the lives lost with action. No more moments of silence with no action  to follow. Today, your thoughts and your prayers aren't enough. Today,  you can vote, ``yes''.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   I was asked to talk about some of the outrageous allegations that  were made about this bill, and the chairman already cleared one up, and  that is the $100,000 fine that we are hearing from the other side. It  is $1,000, as was pointed out.   We also heard that this isn't constitutional. Well, the Constitution  is pretty clear: Individuals have a right to bear arms. Nobody is  disputing that. As a matter of fact, it was settled in District of  Columbia v. Heller.   But also in that opinion were Justice Scalia's remarks that stated  that government also has a responsibility and a right to regulate  firearms. That is all we are doing.   We are saying that people who are felons, domestic abusers,  dangerously mentally ill, a danger to themselves or others shouldn't be  able to have guns. I don't think anybody can dispute that. And how do  you find out if you don't do a background check?   My friends on the other side of the aisle said this won't work. We  have  [[Page H2253]]  heard it a hundred times: This won't work. Well, we have been working  on this for 6\1/2\ years, ever since Sandy Hook. We have pleaded with  the other side to work with us, have a hearing.   What are your ideas?   Absolute silence from them. Absolute silence.   This does work. We know that licensed dealers stop the sale of  firearms to 170 felons every day and 50 domestic abusers every day  because they are required to do background checks.   But in some States, that same individual can be found to be  prohibited, walk outside and go to a gun show or go online and buy a  gun without the benefit of a background check--and that is wrong.   Countless speakers from the other side of the aisle said this  wouldn't have stopped this crime, this wouldn't have stopped this mass  shooting, this wouldn't have stopped that mass shooting. Well, my  friends, if that is your standard, if you will only support a bill that  will stop every mass shooting, that will stop every death by a firearm,  that means you want to get rid of all guns, and no one on this side of  the aisle is saying that.    The only way you can ensure that there  will never be another person murdered by someone with a gun is to do  away with all guns. We recognized that from day one.   Numerous speakers have said, just today on this floor, this will not  stop every death. But it will stop some, and it is certainly worth  pursuing.   I urge your ``aye'' vote.
