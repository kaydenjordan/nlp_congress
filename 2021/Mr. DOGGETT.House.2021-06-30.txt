 Mr. Speaker, since they make such important decisions  concerning mobility, social and economic opportunity, metropolitan  planning organizations across the country have boards that should be  fully representative of all those who are served within their  jurisdiction. And while some MPOs do just that, my amendment No. 25,  which was a part of en bloc No. 1, addresses those that do not by  ensuring that MPO board membership is equal, equitable, and  proportional to the population.   I would like to engage in a colloquy with the chairman.   Mr. Chairman, I thank you for supporting this amendment and trust  that you share that objective.    If, for example, as happened down in Texas, an MPO  arbitrarily provides that a new MPO voting representative gets added  any time a new city comes along and surpasses a population of 50,000,  but is not providing a voting representative for every 50,000 residents  in longstanding urban areas, would you agree that that does not  constitute representation which is equal, proportional, or equitable,  and that with the adoption of this amendment a change must be made to  ensure equal representation?    I thank you very much for accepting the amendment. I  think it will be helpful to us here.   Much of my concern about this issue arose from the fact that in our  area, my hometown of Austin, an effort was made to require in  transportation planning that we measure greenhouse gas emissions and  that we consider that. It was rejected, and it is not representative of  the feelings of people in the central Texas area.   I appreciate not only your endorsing amendment No. 25, which can  bring about important changes, but also incorporating in the base bill  the Green Transportation Act which we worked on with your staff to  ensure that greenhouse gas emissions are measured, evaluated, and  considered in transportation planning.                                time  2015
