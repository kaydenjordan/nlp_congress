 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Takano for his  staunch leadership for veterans in so many arenas and for moving this  bill through his committee. I also want to thank Ranking Member Phil  Roe for his continued bipartisan support and encouragement.   H.R. 1271, the Vet Health Professionals Act, Vet HP Act for short,  also called the Veterans-Specific Education for Tomorrow's Health  Professionals Act; I am honored to speak on its behalf this evening.   By expanding opportunities for future physicians interested in  serving our Nation's veterans, this legislation will lay the groundwork  to help fill, as was mentioned earlier, the Department of Veterans  Affairs' nearly 50,000 medical vacancies by creating a viable pipeline  for future physicians.    The Vet HP Act creates a 3-year pilot program that will operate in at  least five VA medical centers for premed students to gain clinical  observation experience, allowing them to gain a deeper understanding of  veterans' specific health needs and experiences. We have heard about  some of those this evening.   Several years ago, three premed students--and I will put their names  into the Record--Andrew Frank, Seamus Caragher, and Michael McNamara-- highlighted to my team that included Andrea Kaman, Nora Sarsour, Carrie  Swope, and more recently Margaret McGuinness, our legislative  assistants, the struggles that disadvantaged minority and other young  people who lack personal connections face as they apply for medical  school.   Health schools recommend or require clinical observation hours, but  there is no formal process to apply for these hours. Let me tell you,  Mr. Speaker, in the field of neuropsychiatry it is particularly  difficult. Opportunities to shadow are limited and are often based on  where you go to school or whom you know.   Students who attend schools outside major cities as well as those  whose families lack connections to the medical community find it harder  to shadow and are disadvantaged in medical school admissions. This  places an unfair burden on otherwise qualified students who come from  less affluent communities or even rural areas.   Through their own struggle to access clinical observation experience,  the students realized an immense opportunity. This bill prioritizes  students in medically underserved areas, first-generation college  students, students referred by minority-serving institutions, and  veterans themselves.   It also prioritizes training for students who specialize in health  professions where there is an identified staffing shortage. This  important bill will help narrow the professional gap and ensure we are  training premed students in careers that are in demand and necessary.  For example, the three VA medical centers that service our constituents  in Ohio are located in Cleveland, Ohio; Ann Arbor, Michigan; and the  city of Detroit. They currently have--this is an amazing number--542  medical and dental staff vacancies.   How are we to serve veterans when we don't have enough doctors and  medical professionals to do it?   This bill creates an important shadowing opportunity for health  students and will help strengthen the workforce with a pathway going  into the Department of Veterans Affairs.   Importantly, premed students in this pilot program will gain a deeper  understanding of veterans' specific health needs and experiences, which  is critical for health professionals who treat veterans.   One of our top responsibilities as a Congress is to ensure that  America's veterans receive top quality and timely healthcare from  highly trained professionals. This bill furthers that effort, and I am  pleased it will get a vote this evening.   I would like to thank, again, Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Roe  for bringing this bill to the floor.  [[Page H2337]]    I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the bill's  passage to strengthen medical care inside our veterans' healthcare  system and help the future be built through our work here tonight.    Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Trump  administration's very curious lifting of sanctions against Russian  energy magnate Oleg Deripaska.   The President and our allies must strengthen sanctions against  Russia, not weaken them.   Russia illegally invaded the sovereign nation of Ukraine and has  killed more than 10,000 people, including civilians. She has seized 24  Ukrainian sailors and not released them. Russia cyberhacks our firms  and even our democratic election process.   That is why Congress passed significant sanctions in 2017 by an  overwhelming majority to raise the costs on Putin's sinister aims. Yet  the Trump administration caved to foreign influence and, astoundingly,  announced it would lift sanctions on Deripaska.   Madam Speaker, America's first job is to protect liberty. It should  not sell off our liberty to billionaires, especially mob bosses who  enable cold-blooded murder in Ukraine. It does make you wonder what  forces pull the strings of the Trump administration.   The free world must not be soft on the Russian command structure, and  I look forward to hearing what additional sanctions our President  proposes to replace his ill-advised removal on sanctions.   Stand fast, liberty lovers. Pay attention.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for helping to organize this evening, as well as  the dean of the North Carolina delegation,   David Price.   Truly, so many of us miss Walter Jones among us already. And we thank  them for this Special Order, this order to celebrate the honorable life  and service of the late Congressman Walter B. Jones of North Carolina,  a man of deep conscience and integrity. His word was his bond.   Madam Speaker, it is with a sense of true sadness, but abiding  gratitude, that I rise tonight to join all of you as we pay tribute to  our cherished friend and colleague, Walter, and offer sincerest  condolences to his beloved wife, Joe Anne and daughter Ashley, to their  friends, to their family, to his constituents in North Carolina, and  friends across the country.   I also rise this evening in memory of his father, Walter Jones, Sr.,  with whom I had the privilege to serve when I was first elected to the  Congress.   We both shared a great interest in maritime commerce. And so when  Walter arrived in Congress, it was my great privilege to serve with his  son.   So I was able to serve with Walter during his entire quarter century  of exemplary service here in the House. And, yes, he was a man of deep  conscience in an era of utter distraction. He exemplified exceptional  honor, kindness, and a steady conviction that always stayed true.   I brought with me today a book Walter gave me entitled, ``Extortion''  by Peter Schweizer. And in it Walter inscribed the following message:         Marcy, may those of us who serve in the U.S. House work       together to return the House to the people and not let       ``special interests'' continue to influence policy. Thank you       for your friendship. God bless America.        Walter Jones.    At the time Walter wrote these words, he and I had been talking about  a bipartisan effort to clean up Congress using our joint efforts,  traveling to appropriate venues along the way to advance reform of our  democracy, and get big money out of politics.   But as the months went by, it became clear that Walter would not be  able to make this journey, and he bore his wounds with great dignity  and in silence.   What a man of courage.   Walter, as others have said, had a deep passion for the people he  represented--surely, the Marines of Camp Lejeune and their families and  colleagues, as these photos attest.   He would always take to this House floor to compassionately recall  their patriotic service. He never, ever forgot them.   The war in Iraq weighed so heavily on him, and his integrity required  him to speak out. And he did, often.   His constituents knew the measure of this committed, modest man of  sterling conviction.                                time  2015    Walter is held in highest esteem by his colleagues on both sides of  the aisle, and he will be sorely missed.   A grateful nation thanks the people of the Third Congressional  District of North Carolina, and I know all of his constituents join us  in thanking Walter for his decades of public service and his family for  all of their sacrifices because he so conscientiously and selflessly  dedicated himself to our Nation.   He was true; he was reflective; he was faithful; and he was a  patriot. His spirit lives right here. I can feel it myself as a beacon  across this Congress and as a shining star for all to come with  integrity and moral conviction.  [[Page H2348]]    May God bring comfort to his family, and may his strength shower them  to move through this period of deep mourning and come into the sunlight  again.
