 Madam Speaker, I rise today to encourage Congress to  continue investigations into potential criminal conduct by President  Biden or his family.   The web of deceit that is being spun surrounding this issue must be  unraveled, and House Republicans are doing just that.  [[Page H3876]]    Yesterday, House Oversight heard from two credible IRS whistleblowers  with knowledge of the Biden criminal investigation.   According to the whistleblower, Hunter Biden and his associates raked  in a total of $17 million from China, Romania, and other sources  between 2014 and 2019.   Knowing whether or not President Biden has been compromised or  targeted by foreign actors is critical to our national security.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House to continue the  investigations and pursue all reliable evidence. The American people  deserve truth, transparency, and answers.                            ____________________
