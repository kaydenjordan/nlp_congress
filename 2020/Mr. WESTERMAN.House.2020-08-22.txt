 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of frontline,  essential rural mail carriers and postal workers across my district and  America who have continued to go to work and do their jobs during the  pandemic. This is in sharp contrast to many of my colleagues across the  aisle who draw a paycheck but don't show up to vote or do their jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I also stand in opposition to H.R. 8015 because it is a  sham bill that has no future. It doesn't belong on this floor. It  belongs in the archives at the election hoax of the month club.   How do the Democrats keep a straight face while proposing a $25  billion bailout disguised as election integrity when it would equal  about $200 per ballot if every voter voted by mail?   That is preposterous.   With its current over $14 billion cash on hand and access to $10  billion from the CARES Act, do we even have to keep explaining that the  United States Postal Service is in a more than adequate financial  position to remain fully functional well beyond the election?   No. The American people are smarter than Democrats give us credit. I  believe most see past the smoke and mirrors. The post office is  important. It is not going anywhere, and this bill has nothing to do  with a fair election.   The ranking member and I participated in a youth organization, and at  the beginning of each meeting the leader would ask: Why are we here?   Many of us are asking that question today: Why are we here?   The answer is because this House is adrift. This House is a ship  without a rudder. It lacks vision, it lacks direction, and, most  importantly, it lacks leadership. It simply gets tossed to and fro by  the political wind of the day.   Mr. Speaker, it didn't just start. It has been that way this whole  Congress. At a time when America has legitimate needs with a pandemic  and an economy trying to get back on track, it is really no surprise  that this is the best the left can do. House Democrats offer no hope.  We need change.
