 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order       for the quorum call be rescinded.         Madam President, when you watch U.S. athletes compete       in the Olympics and Paralympics and the World Cup, it probably doesn't       cross your mind that men and women who play the same sport may not get       the same travel accommodations or equal medical care or may still be       waiting to be reimbursed for their expenses that they had out of       pocket. In fact, for women athletes, they may not be sure if they are       even going to get a fair shake at all.        It has taken women athletes at the top of their game stepping up and       demanding their worth over and over for women to be taken seriously in       sports. I am talking about the women of the U.S. Hockey in 2017 and the       U.S. Women's National Soccer Team in 2019 and many other athletes.        It has been 50 years since title IX carved out a place for women and       girls in sports, but still women athletes frequently get less. That is       why we needed the bipartisan Equal Pay for Team USA Act to build on the       promise of title IX for women competing at the international level.        I am happy to say that this Senate bill, S. 233, which already       previously passed the Senate, just passed the House tonight, 350 to 59.       I am happy because we need to make sure that there is equal pay for       team USA and to make sure that U.S. national teams under the U.S.       Olympic Committee comply with this act. It ensures that athletes in the       same sport will receive equal pay, benefits and medical care, travel       and reimbursement expenses regardless of gender. It applies to the U.S.       Olympic and Paralympic Committee and also to the national governing       bodies the USOPC oversees and, basically, any athlete competing for       Team USA on a world stage. It will make sure that they get and receive       equal compensation to their fellow male athletes in the sports.        I want to thank my colleague, Senator Capito, for cosponsoring this       legislation and helping to advocate for it for the last year and a half       and continuing to fight to make sure that we got this implemented into       law. This law requires detailed reports from the USOPC and national       governing bodies--like U.S. Soccer, U.S. Squash, and U.S. Volleyball--      to be sent to Congress each year so we can help make sure that these       women athletes get equal pay. We want to get to the root of any issues       in the future that hold anyone back from making sure that this law is       implemented.        I also want to thank heroes like Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan who       brought that case against U.S. Soccer. U.S. Women's Soccer led the       charge            [[Page S9759]]            after winning the World Cup and making it clear to everyone that women       athletes deserve equal pay.        It took a lot of hard work to make sure that this bill got into law,       and I also want to thank my colleagues from the committee who helped       pass this legislation, and Senators Klobuchar and Lummis who also       joined Senator Capito and me in advocating for this legislation.        While I wish tonight there were solutions to the inequities that       exist in professional leagues like the WNBA and the National Women's       Soccer League, this is a huge important step toward the economic       empowerment of women athletes.        I also want to mention the hard work of my staff and Lucy Koch from       the Commerce Committee and many others on Senator Klobuchar's staff and       on the Commerce Committee who helped get this legislation over the goal       line.        This is a strong message to female athletes, not just in the State of       Washington but across the United States. You deserve and you now will       have equal pay, and this is a win for Team USA.        I yield the floor.        I suggest the absence of a quorum.
