 Madam Speaker, as you know, as a result of COVID-19 and  our discussions with the Capitol physician, we have organized voting in  a way that we have seven different segments at 5-minute intervals so  that a limited number of Members will vote in every 5-minute segment.  That is obviously designed to keep us as safe as possible, our staffs  as safe as possible, so we get off the floor, and they have to be on  the floor.   This vote that we just had was about 1 hour and 5 minutes. Obviously,  if you take seven segments at 5 minutes a segment, that is 35 minutes.  We have added another 5 minutes for people who missed their segment,  which would be 40 minutes. We are starting to average 20, 25, 30, 35  minutes beyond that 40 minutes.   Therefore, I wanted to announce to every Member that I will be  recommending that we close votes 45 minutes after they start. Bang.   Now, I will tell my side--which probably has this responsibility more  than the other side because we use proxies more than you do--that if  you hold a proxy, not only do you have a responsibility to yourself to  vote in a timely fashion, but if you miss the vote, acting in a  fiduciary capacity for another Member who can't be here because of  health-related issues, and you do not vote, that will not be a happy  situation.   So I want you to know, I am going to be talking to the Speaker--I  have already talked to her--that 45 minutes after that first bell rings  I want the gavel to come down. And, hopefully, we will all recognize  when the bell rings that we will have to vote in the next 45 minutes.  Now, that cannot be a real burden on anybody. Cannot.   It is simply that we look to see how many people have voted--oh,  well, there are 20 people out, so I don't have to worry, and that is  after we have gone by the 40 minutes.   Madam Speaker, I am going to send out a notice on this as well, and I  want to confirm with the Speaker, but I know, having talked to the  Speaker numerous times about this issue, that she shares my view that  if we are going to run this institution with respect to one another--   Don Young didn't come on this vote.   Don Young is the famous--call it  on time.   I want every Member to understand, this is not to penalize anybody.  It is, however, to try to run this institution in a way that Members'  time, which is valuable, is respected, and we simply don't waste it  waiting around for one or two or five or six other people to come. I do  not cast aspersions. Sometimes it is hard to get here on time,  particularly if you have done something and you are in some other  place.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the time. I will be talking to the  Speaker. I will notify everybody when that is going to be implemented.  It may be implemented as soon as today, and we will be sending out a  notice. And, by the way, everybody I talked to agrees with this.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   One of the sad things that is happening in America, Mr. Speaker, is  that the truth is so often being perceived as fake news or that fake  news is so often being perceived as the truth.   Mr. Speaker, I am old enough to have worked for a United States  Senator during the civil rights era. And I would get a publication-- because I opened the mail; I had a hifalutin job--from what was called  the Cross and the Sword, a publication that came somewhere from the  South. I forget where its headquarters was.   I remember reading how the Bible told us that we should not integrate  America and that if God had wanted us all to be together, then we would  be the same color. I perceived that then and I perceive that now as  absurd.   So I proudly rise in support of H.R. 5, the Equality Act, and  congratulate Mr.  [[Page H657]]  Cicilline and all those who have worked on getting this bill to this  point on this floor.   We passed it before, of course, and sent it to the United States  Senate. They ignored it, to their discredit. The House passed this bill  last Congress with bipartisan support. I hope we have bipartisan  support this year because I remember, Mr. Speaker, back in the days of  the early sixties and mid-sixties there were giants in the Republican  Party who stood with Democrats on behalf of civil rights. I hope we can  repeat that today because there is no room in America--it says here in  2021 that there should have been no room in America from 1776 on when  we said: ``We hold these truths to be self-evident''--for legal  discrimination.    There are moments in our history that are celebrated for generations  as those in which Americans came together to perfect our Union and to  protect and uphold the universal rights enshrined in our founding  documents. That is what we as a nation did with the 13th, 14th and 15th  Amendments. It is what we did with the 19th Amendment where we said:  Oh, yes, I know you are a woman, but you are going to be equal, you are  going to be allowed to vote.   What a radical idea that was and how long it took.   We did it as well with the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act  of 1960. We did it together with the bill that I was proud to sponsor  on this floor, the Americans with Disabilities Act. We said that it is  not your disability that counts; it is your ability; drop the ``dis.''   We can do it again today with Mr. Cicilline's Equality Act, affirming  that equality is for everyone all the time and everywhere.   This legislation, Mr. Speaker, would ban discrimination against LGBTQ  Americans in every area where it still exists and in every State that  still permits it. One nation under God, indivisible. Not discrimination  in the Northwest and discrimination in the Northeast or discrimination  in the South or the Southwest. One nation--no discrimination--fairness  and equality for all.   That includes housing, public education, personal finance and credit,  employment, healthcare, jury service, and public accommodation. The  practical effect of such legalized discrimination is the denial of  opportunities and economic security to certain Americans because of  their gender identity or sexual orientation.   The practical effect of this bill, Mr. Speaker, will be to open the  doors of opportunity and economic security to those for whom they were  shut for far, far too long.   I want to thank Representative Cicilline. I want to thank the  gentleman in the Chair for his leadership and courage. Both of them  have displayed such worth as human beings and as colleagues, not by  some arbitrary definition that we give to them based upon their sexual  orientation or whether any of us, because of our gender, male or  female, or our color, Black or White or yellow or red, one nation under  God, indivisible. This legislation tries to recognize that  indivisibility of the right of all Americans.   I want to express my gratitude to the Congressional LGBTQ-Plus  Equality Caucus, which has provided leadership both in shaping and  improving this legislation championing its adoption.   The House will pass this legislation today, and then I hope it will  not be lost in the politics of the Senate. That body has an  extraordinary record over the centuries in terms of civil rights. It  should uphold that record. I know that the Democratic Senate majority  is eager to see it considered and passed.   As I said, when I grew up in the sixties in the civil rights  movement, many Republican leaders were giants in this effort. I hope  the Senate Republicans who have stood in the way of equality of  opportunity for LGBTQ Americans for too long will finally come together  with them in a bipartisan fashion and allow an up-or-down vote. That is  all we ask, an up-or-down vote.   Frankly, that is not all we ask. We ask for 10 Republicans to join us  with 50 Democrats to make this a reality. Most Americans have come to  understand that ending discrimination for LGBTQ people is about the  fundamental rights and dignity of their fellow Americans, and it is  about who we are as a country, who we claim to be but for far too long  were not.   We know we are not there yet, but this is a very significant and  important step for us to take in a land of opportunity for all and a  land of liberty and justice for all. So let us affirm that today in  this House. And I hope the Senate, in days to come, will join in that  affirmation of justice for all, and let us make this a day to remember  in our history as one where we came together to perfect our Union, as   John Lewis would say, one more time.   I urge a ``yes'' vote, Mr. Speaker.
