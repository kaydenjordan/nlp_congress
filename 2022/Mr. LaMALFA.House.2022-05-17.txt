 Madam Speaker, a country without borders might as well  just not be a country.   The chaos that this current Biden border policy is causing is  damaging American families, American schools, and American healthcare,  and it is not even good for the so-called immigrants themselves.   Witness the way children are used and abused in order to get people  across the border to please the cartels, to pay off the cartels. Kids  are rented, rented out by families. To get a fake family group across  the border, kids are often left by the river--children left by the  river when they are done with them and recycled back across like you  would an empty pop bottle.   Is this the kind of humanity this administration is about? It  certainly isn't for us on this side of the aisle.   We need to enforce our border. We need to continue building the fence  so it is effective for our border personnel to be able to process ones  that really are coming here on what would be true asylum.   Asylum laws need to be changed because they have been made a joke.  Indeed, some of the newest cases won't be heard until 2024. There is  such a backlog.                            ____________________
