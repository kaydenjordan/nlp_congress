 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  legislation.   This week, Star Parker provided insight in ``Staying Free and  Faithful in a Pandemic'' in The Daily Signal:   ``The coronavirus presents challenges to us as Nation and as  individuals. There are principles we should keep in mind. We have a  Constitution that assigns limited, defined powers to the Federal  Government and leaves the rest to the States and individuals.''  [[Page H1827]]    Trump acted with deliberation, shutting down flights from China. We  know this virus is most lethal to the elderly. There are large  variations among the States. The answer is we should maximize local  responsibility.   There are two other things to keep in mind. One is, life is  unpredictable. That is why socialism and national planning are so bogus  and always result in failure, and that is why freedom is so critically  important. Only through freedom is responsibility focused on  individuals.   Two, faith is critical. It is faith that keeps us human, faith that  binds us together, unique individuals.   ``Faith will play a key role in helping our Nation through this  crisis and emerge better for it.''    Mr. Speaker, during a time when our  nation is facing an unprecedented crisis, I am grateful to join  President Donald Trump in supporting the CARES Act to provide American  families recovery from the coronavirus. Even though I am not completely  happy with every aspect of this bill, it does addresses multiple parts  of our economy, specifically, it expedites resources to healthcare  providers and patients, supports small businesses, to keep jobs alive,  and provides direct assistance to American families.   To fast track a national recovery, I ask that we all do our part in  stopping the spread of the coronavirus by following the Center for  Disease Control's guidelines. The health and safety of our nation is  the top priority, I am confident we will push through and come out of  this crisis stronger than ever.
