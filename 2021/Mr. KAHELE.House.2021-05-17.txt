 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for  yielding me time.   Madam Speaker, today, I rise to speak in favor of H.R. 2878, the  bipartisan Native VetSuccess at Tribal Colleges and Universities Pilot  Program, which includes a bill that I co-led with my esteemed colleague  from Iowa's Second Congressional District, Congresswoman Miller-Meeks,  the VET TEC Enhancement Act.   In our Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard, our veterans  and their families have sacrificed so much to protect our Nation and  keep our country whole. We owe them our thanks, we owe them our  respect, but most importantly, we owe them our support as they  transition back into civilian life once their service is over.   The Veteran Employment Through Technical Education Courses, or VET  TEC, is a 5-year pilot program that allows eligible veterans to use GI  Bill-style benefits to attend innovative job training programs and  prepare them for future employment in the technology industry. Our bill  would expand funding of this program from $45 million to $125 million a  year, allowing more of our men and women in uniform to enroll each  year.   The VET TEC program is highly popular and has a 90 percent completion  rate, giving our veterans the tools they need to gain meaningful  employment in well-paying jobs. No servicemember who has taken the oath  to protect and defend our country should be left behind in today's 21st  century workforce. I am proud to co-lead this important legislation,  and I look forward to its passage and benefit to America's  servicemembers. Mahalo.
