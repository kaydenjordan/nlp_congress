 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor women in America and  abroad by commemorating Women's History Month.   Today and always, we honor the brave, courageous, and fearless women  who have made this Nation so great; to name a few: Rosa Parks, Harriet  Tubman, Delores Huerta, Celia Cruz, the hidden figures such as Mary  Jackson and Katherine Johnson, and most recently, Madam Speaker Emerita  Nancy Pelosi, who was the first woman to serve as Speaker of this  House.   From the women in leadership roles on my staff who help respond every  single day to the needs of my constituents, to the women who tirelessly  uplift our families and our communities, we cannot imagine a world  without the leadership of women.   It fills me with great pride to represent a district that is over 52  percent female. Women get things done--period, and they do it better  than us men.   Happy Women's History Month, Madam Speaker.                            ____________________
