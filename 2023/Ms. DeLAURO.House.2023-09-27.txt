 Mr. Chair, I rise today in opposition to this Defense  Appropriations Bill. This bill is historically an opportunity to come  together on a bipartisan basis to make investments that further  American leadership around the world. protect our national security.  support American workers and servicemembers. and promote global  democracy. I come from a defense state. I have always been proud that  this bill creates jobs in Connecticut and boosts my district's long- term economy.   I have supported this critical legislation in the past. But l cannot  support this bill, which harms our military readiness by undermining  morale and failing to support our servicemembers with its divisive  policy riders. Neither the Army. Navy nor the Air Force have been  unable to meet their recruiting goals, and this bill will do nothing to  rectify this situation--it will only make it harder to recruit and  retain service members.   At a time when the Department of Defense is struggling to meet  readiness goals, this bill cuts $1.1 billion in salaries for civilian  positions. Research, development, acquisition, and oversight efforts  will all suffer from these drastic cuts. The work still needs to get  done so the Department will have to hire contractors--which are more  expensive and less bang for the buck.   And nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars cut from climate- related programs and a ban on the effort to reduce carbon pollution  will tie our hands in the face of the national security risk that will  define this century.   House Republicans are using annual funding bills as vehicles to  further their goal of making abortion illegal nationally and spreading  hate and discrimination. Republicans have once again discarded the  majority of the American people's views and injected their own beliefs  into the deeply personal health decisions of women and families. This  bill bans funding for expenses incurred for the reproductive health  care needs of servicemembers and their families.   When women consider serving in our nation's military, they should not  have to weigh whether or not politicians in Washington, D.C. think they  should have access to reproductive care. They should not worry that an  unplanned pregnancy could disrupt their ability to serve or derail the  plans they are making for their family. We should trust the American  people to make these decisions for themselves--and we should especially  trust those who have made the decision to selflessly serve in America's  armed forces.   By using this legislation to attack LGBTQ+ servicemembers, ban  funding for diversity efforts, and stand between American service  personnel and their doctors, the majority is exchanging America's  military readiness for cheap political points in the face of escalating  conflicts abroad. The bill gives broad license to discriminate and  protects disseminators of misinformation while limiting the free speech  of those who express ideas the majority opposes.   This bill is dangerous, and this bill leaves women and minority  servicemembers behind. Diversity of background and culture is and has  long been the preeminent strength of our Nation's military. And it will  continue to be. I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.    Mr. Chair, the Homeland Security Appropriations bill  before us weakens our national security, defunds border security, harms  the Homeland Security workforce, and leaves Americans vulnerable to  escalating disasters. That we are debating this bill on September 27, 3  days before the end of the fiscal year, when House Republicans have  provided no path forward to keep our government open is irresponsible.   The House majority has exhibited their own inability and  unwillingness to govern by ensuring this bill cannot become law without  other partisan legislation moving first, but it cannot become law.  Rather than voting to keep our government open and ensuring border  protection officers and immigration officials get paid, Republicans are  pursuing a path explicitly designed to shut down the Federal  Government. A shutdown will have consequences for every American family  and on the border and border communities.   Mr. Chair, Democrats do not support an open border, but let me be  unequivocal. There is a crisis on our southern border. Our border  communities are struggling with the influx of immigration. The status  quo cannot be maintained. That much, we agree on.   Where the majority and minority differ is how we address this issue.  We must continue to invest in our processing facilities and in  transportation and medical care. We need to have an effective process  of determining who is eligible to enter the country and who is not.   We must continue to invest in newer technology and in our immigration  and border security officials and invest in immigration judges, but we  must also think bigger, broader, bolder. We cannot hope to resolve this  issue if we only begin addressing it right at the border.   We must invest in our partnerships with Latin-American countries and  fund the expansion of safe mobility offices. Our Republican colleagues  refuse to negotiate with Democrats on these issues. We were kept on the  sidelines, and, thus, this bill does not make the sound investments  that would actually reduce the burden on our border facilities and our  communities.   This bill misses important opportunities to address the dire opioid  crisis that we face as a Nation. It provides insufficient funding for  our ports of entry where the vast majority of these drugs enter our  country.   We should be focusing resources where we agree they are needed most,  like combating fentanyl crossing the border, helping our border  communities, advancing our cybersecurity posture, protecting Americans  from violent extremism and foreign adversaries.   I am also deeply concerned about the conditions that greet migrants  and asylum seekers, people who leave their homes out of desperation and  necessity. We have a responsibility to ensure the safety of these  migrants, especially children, and to provide resources so that those  who are entitled to stay under our immigration laws can do so.                                time  1530    Please understand, by law the United States is required to take in  unaccompanied children from neighboring countries, screen them, house  them, and provide safe placement.   This bill leaves Americans vulnerable to the growing number and  increasing severity of natural disasters, exposes Americans to foreign  threats with inadequate cyber and infrastructure security investments,  and does not fully fund the Transportation Security Administration  personnel.   House Republicans claim to care about oversight, but this bill  proposes several cuts to programs throughout the Department of Homeland  Security which are critical to the oversight of our immigration  facilities.   This bill also eliminates discretionary funding for refugee  processing. It shifts the burden of those costs to an already  backlogged and overwhelmed system.    Mr. Chair, we all know the enactment of appropriations  [[Page H4632]]  will require bipartisan agreement on sound investments, not reckless  cuts and partisan policy riders.   Let us focus. Let us focus on opening the government and keeping it  open. There is a bipartisan bill in the Senate that we are now  debating--77-19--that is overwhelmingly bipartisan. It will come here.  Let's put that bill up. Get bipartisan support on this floor. Bring  these harmful consequences to the American people to a close.   Don't close the government down.
