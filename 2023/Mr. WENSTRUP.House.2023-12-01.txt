 Madam Speaker, I rise today to welcome Reverend Jared  Timberlake and his family to the House Chamber.   Reverend Timberlake has dedicated his life to selfless service, first  through his time as a fellow Army soldier and then later through his  work as a youth minister and pastor at Sandhill Baptist Church in  Scioto County, Ohio.   As President George Washington said in his farewell address: ``Of all  the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity,  religion and morality are indispensable supports.''   Nearly 250 years later, I am glad we welcome our religious leaders to  the people's House to open our work with prayer.   Madam Speaker, I thank Reverend Timberlake for his decades of service  to our country and to the local Scioto County community.                            ____________________
