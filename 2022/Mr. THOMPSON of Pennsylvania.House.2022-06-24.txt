 Mr. Speaker, today I welcome Liera  Bertolsio and her family to Washington, D.C. to celebrate her great  accomplishment.   Liera is the 2022 winner of Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional  District Congressional Art Contest.   The annual art competition, organized by the Congressional Institute,  showcases the creative talents of high school students from across  every congressional district in the country.   Liera has just finished her sophomore year at Forest Hills High  School located in Sidman, Pennsylvania. Her work ``Girl with Pearl  Earring'' is an acrylic painting on canvas.   This year, 81 students entered Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional  District art competition. Liera's work was selected by a panel of  independent judges. The 2022 competition had our largest number of  entries to date.   All the winning pieces from around the country will be displayed for  the year in the Cannon tunnel where they will be viewed by Members of  Congress, staff, and those who visit the Capitol every day.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I congratulate Liera on her remarkable  achievement.                            ____________________
