 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to  complete my brief remarks.    Mr. President, before I speak on another topic I sadly  have to come to the floor every week and speak on, I want to offer my  heartfelt condolences to the McCain family and all of his friends and  supporters.   I had the privilege of serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee  with Senator McCain for 3 years. I learned a lot from him. During his  entire time in Congress, he did a wonderful job of standing up for the  men and women in uniform and standing up for veterans.   I also wanted to share this one story. I had a reporter ask me  yesterday: What kinds of experiences have you had with him that were  most memorable? It was a day I spent with him in North Carolina back in  2014. I think you can really judge a politician by how they behave when  they are not in front of the camera or here at one of the desks in the  Senate. When you saw him interacting with men and women in uniform and  with veterans, you saw a man with a heart of gold and a commitment to  those men and women in uniform.   I want to again tell the McCain family that our prayers are with them  and our hearts are with them. We thank them for allowing him to share  some of his life here with us in the Senate.    Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to meet  during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:        Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard    The Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard of  the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation is authorized to  meet during the session of the Senate on Tuesday, August 28, 2018, at  2:30 p.m. to conduct a hearing entitled ``Harmful Algal Blooms: The  Impact on Our Nation's Waters.''                            ____________________
