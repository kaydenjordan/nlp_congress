 Madam Speaker, first of all, let me just say I  rise in support of this package. I want to thank the Speaker; our  leadership committee chair; members of the Congressional Black Caucus,  including Chairwoman Bass; Chairwoman Kelly, chair of the Health  Braintrust; and all of the Members and staff who are working together  on the health provisions of this bill.   Also, let me just take this moment to thank our essential workers for  their sacrifices during this horrific pandemic.   Evidence has piled up that Black and Brown people are bearing some of  the worst burdens of COVID. This bill requires, as Chairwoman Bass  said, the CDC to get us the data on which communities are bearing the  worst brunt and then to make sure that testing is focused on these  communities.   But let me just say, we have much more work to do. Too many people  were trapped in poverty before this crisis, and now more people have  been pushed into the ranks of the poor because of COVID. People are  lining up in front of food banks.   We need to increase SNAP funding, support the State and local  government workers who are on the front lines of this crisis, protect  our elections, and help people who are falling through the cracks and  living on the edge. We have a moral and we have a patriotic duty to do  this.
