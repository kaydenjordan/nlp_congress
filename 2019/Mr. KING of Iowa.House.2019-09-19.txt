 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the privilege of being  recognized here to speak on the floor of the United States House of  Representatives. I come to the floor this morning, Mr. Speaker, to  address a topic, and most of the words that I say will be from an  article written by Roger Scruton, who is an author from Great Britain.  He is commenting on a new book by Douglas Murray, titled ``The Madness  of Crowds: Gender, Race and Identity.''   Some of this hits home so much, and it has so much to do with  America, that I thought it was important I address this here this  morning.   He says: ``In every period of history, therefore, there have been  opinions and customs that are dangerous to question . . . but our  situation in Western democracies today is a novel one. . . . The old  customs have been torn asunder by a culture of repudiation, which  encourages people to shape their lives according to an `identity' of  their own.''   Socialization no longer means what it used to mean. It means now  becoming who you are without regard to the framework that existed in  the civilization and the culture prior. ``The punishments for saying,  thinking, or implying the wrong thing . . . are real, serious, and  largely impossible to deflect.''   That means that ``the archive of your crimes is stored in cyberspace,  and however much you may have confessed to them and sworn to change,  they will pursue you for the rest of your life, just as long as someone  has an interest in drawing attention to them. And when the mob turns on  you, it is with a pitiless intensity that bears no relation to the  objective seriousness of your fault. A word out of place, a hasty  judgment, a slip of the tongue, whatever the fault might be, it is  sufficient, once picked upon, to put you beyond the pale of human  sympathy.''   This is reflected in the book ``The Madness of Crowds.''   ``The emerging world of censorship is a world without forgiveness . .  . in which the real virtues and vices that govern our conduct are  ignored altogether'' or are decided to be irrelevant.   ``The crimes for which we are judged are existential crimes. Through  speaking in the wrong way, you display one of the phobias or isms,'' or  they presume that is the case, ``that show you to be beyond acceptable  humanity. You are a homophobe, an Islamophobe, a white supremacist, or  a racist, and no argument can refute these accusations once they have  been made.''   Even ``your accusers are not interested in your deeds; they are  interested in you,'' and what they are interested in is ``whether or  not you are `one of us,' '' meaning actually one of them. ``Your faults  cannot be overcome by voluntary action, since they adhere to the kind  of thing that you are, and you reveal what you are in the words that  define you,'' as defined by your critics.   ``These words may be taken out of context, even doctored to mean the  opposite of what you said''--that is true with the author and certainly  true with me--``but this will not affect the verdict, since there is no  objective trial, no `case for the defense,' no due process. You are  accused by the mob, examined by the mob, and condemned by the mob, and  if you have brought this on yourself, then,'' they say, ``you have only  yourself to blame. For the mob is by nature innocent. It washes its own  conscience in a flow of collective indignation, and by joining it, you  make yourself safe,'' which is one of the reasons we see an epidemic of  virtue signaling here in this Congress, Mr. Speaker.    ``The spirit of the mob has entered not only the language of public  debate but also the sources of information and the institutions of  decisionmaking. Censorship begins in the media themselves.''   Cyberspace is censored and is controlled by about four major  companies. George Orwell predicted this, but I think it has eclipsed  even his magnificent imagination and the reality that we are dealing  with today.   ``Murray gives riveting examples of the way in which''--I will use  this example--``whiteness has become a moral fault in the eyes of  identity warriors on the American campus.'' They now openly ``condemn  people for the color of their skin,'' provided that it is white. The  art of taking offense, ``whole sections of the university curriculum  are devoted to explaining to students that words, arguments,  comparisons, even questions,'' rhetorical or not, ``are `offensive,'  regardless of the intention with which they are used,'' or, actually,  the language, the precise definition of the language.   ``Invariably, the offense is given by the old majority culture and is  taken on behalf of some privileged minority.''   Mr. Speaker, this is a shorthand version of what is going on in this  country, what is going on in this Congress, what is going on in the  media.   And I submit this, that we don't any longer have an objective news  media. That center that used to be the truth has been completely,  almost completely, vacated. Much of it has gone to the left. Some has  gone to the right. And that peace of being able to pick up a newspaper  and read it and believe that it is true today is no longer true today.  And the American civilization must come to grips with this and go to  original sources, come to our own conclusions, adjust our civilization  and our culture. If we fail to do so, we will be pitted against each  other for a long time to come.                            ____________________
