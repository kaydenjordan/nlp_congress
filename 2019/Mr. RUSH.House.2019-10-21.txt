 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The Word of the Lord says in Psalm 116:15: ``Precious in the sight of  the Lord is the death of his saints.''   With that in mind, the people of the First Congressional District of  Illinois have sent me here to extend their collective condolences to  the family and friends of Elijah Eugene Cummings and to the citizens of  the Seventh Congressional District of Maryland.   Elijah loved the Lord because the Lord first loved Elijah. How do I  know this? I know this from the many times that we had discussions.  Rarely in those discussions did we talk about anything other than  the Gospel of Jesus Christ and how good the Lord has been to both  Elijah and myself. I just stopped by the well of the U.S. House of  Representatives this evening to tell somebody, to tell everybody, that  the Lord is good and his mercy endures forever.    Our Nation shall surely miss the love, the compassion, the strength,  the brilliance, the tireless dedication, and the amazing words of  Elijah Eugene Cummings.   The Lord proclaims now to all who would hear his praise for Elijah  and Elijah's work: Well done, my good and faithful servant. Well done.
