 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Florida for being so kind in yielding.   Mr. Speaker, today the House will consider H.R. 4895, the Medgar  Evers Home National Monument Act, a bipartisan bill to designate the  home of civil rights leader Medgar Evers as a national monument.   Located in Jackson, Mississippi, the Evers family home, which was  designated a national historic landmark in 2017, is hallowed ground for  those of us who lived through the struggle for racial equality and  desegregation.   That single-story ranch-style house bore witness to one of the most  consequential moments in the civil rights era: the assassination of  Medgar Wiley Evers, a son of Mississippi, who was assassinated in his  driveway by those who saw his efforts at making America a more perfect  and just Union as a threat.   Through his work for the National Association for the Advancement of  Colored People, Medgar Evers earned an indelible place in the annals of  American history and the civil rights movement. Mr. Evers was a hero  for change, resistance, and equal rights for African-American citizens  in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to, in my capacity as a Congressman of the  Second Congressional District of Mississippi, author this legislation  to honor the sacrifice of not just civil rights icon Medgar Evers, but  his widow, Myrlie, by designating their home as a national monument.   Medgar Evers had a vision to defeat injustice for African Americans  in the State of Mississippi as well as throughout the United States.  Born in Decatur, Mississippi, Mr. Evers lived through the Jim Crow  South and wrangled with the overwhelming plight of racial  discrimination head-on.   Mr. Evers was a 1952 graduate of what is now known as Alcorn State  University, a great institution situated in my district. After  graduating, Evers worked on the Regional Council of Negro Leadership,  which provided him with critical training in activism. Then, in 1954,  he applied to the University of Mississippi School of Law, and despite  the landmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision, his  application was rejected.   After the rejection by the University of Mississippi School of Law,  Mr. Evers accepted the position of State field secretary for the NAACP.  Over a 9-year period, Mr. Evers crisscrossed the State, working to get  African Americans involved in civil rights activism and to register to  vote.   Even though racial discrimination and oppression had polluted the  minds of an overwhelming majority of Whites in Mississippi and  throughout the South, Mr. Evers led many of the fights against  injustice. His dogged pursuit for justice made him a target for hate,  and on June 12, 1963, Mr. Evers was gunned down in the driveway of his  home and later died at a local hospital.   Designating the home of Medgar Evers a national monument will be an  everlasting tribute to his legacy and journey that countless Americans  undertook for equality.   This legislation is of great personal importance to me because I,  like many others, was inspired by the magnitude of the determination of  Mr. Evers to dedicate himself to others and fight against adversity. I  am honored to walk the path paved by such a civil rights icon.   H.R. 4895 is a bipartisan measure. Representative  Rob Bishop of Utah  is an original cosponsor.   Additionally, it adds significant support from stakeholders. I  received letters of support for H.R. 4895 from Tougaloo College, the  Mississippi Department of Archives and History, and the Jackson  Historic Preservation Commission.   Mr. Speaker, I include these letters of support in the Record.                                               Tougaloo College,                                     Tougaloo, MS, January 29, 2018.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, Natural Resources Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Bishop: I have discussed with the       leadership of Tougaloo College's Board of Trustees the plan       to designate the Medgar Evers Home Museum as a national       monument through congressional legislation. We have reviewed       the proposed draft legislation and spoken with Congressman       Bennie G. Thompson, our congressional representative. We have       also spoken with the Mrs. Myrlie Evers Williams and her       daughter. We have received no opposition to the plan to move       forward with this designation through congressional       legislation.        We support the transfer of ownership to the National Park       Services, if the legislation passes. We are inspired by the       distinction this designation would mean for the Medgar Evers       Home and the legacy of Medgar Evers. We are also encouraged       to know the Home would be maintained by the National Park       Services. We are equally encouraged that there will be       opportunities for the College to continue to play a role with       the Home through interpretative and educational programming       as well as other learning opportunities that might be       available for our students.        Thank you for contacting Tougaloo College. We look forward       to hearing from you regarding the next steps.            Sincerely,                                                  Beverly W. Hogan,      President.                                   ____           Mississippi Department of Archives and History, Historic             Preservation Division,                                     Jackson, MS, February 5, 2018.      Re Medgar Evers National Monument.       Mr. Terry Camp,      Professional Staff, Committee on Natural Resources,           Subcommittee on Federal Lands.        Dear Mr. Camp: The Mississippi Department of Archives and       History (MDAH) is pleased to know that the Committee of       Natural Resources will be considering House Bill 4895, which       would establish the Medgar and Myrlie Evers House in Jackson,       Mississippi, as a National Monument. The Medgar and Myrlie       Evers House was designated as a Mississippi Landmark in 1993       and for the past two decades, MDAH has worked closely with       the property's owner, Tougaloo College, on the house's       restoration. In 2017, the Medgar and Myrlie Evers House was       designated as a National Historic Landmark by the Secretary       of the Interior. Thanks to all those efforts, the house is       now an important venue for telling the stories of       Mississippi's Civil Rights struggle and explaining how the       dedication and labors of one couple changed not only       Mississippi but the nation as a whole. With the recent       opening of the new Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, those       stories have an even wider audience.        We certainly appreciate the efforts of Congressman Thompson       in drafting this legislation and join our friends and       colleagues at Tougaloo College in wholeheartedly endorsing       House Bill 4895.            Sincerely,                                                 Kenneth H. P'Pool,      Deputy State Historic Preservation Officer.                                   ____                                       Jackson Historic Preservation                                                      Commission,                                      Jackson, MS, February 5, 2018.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, Natural Resources Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Bishop: I have reviewed the Bill H.R. 4895       and the Legislative Hearing Memo on this bill with other       Jackson Historic Preservation Commissioners. I       enthusiastically support the establishment of the Medgar       Evers National Monument under the purview of the National       Park Service.        Medgar Evers was Field Secretary for the NAACP in       Mississippi from January 1955 until his assassination on 12       June 1963, in front of this house. The house was designated       as Jackson local landmark in 1992 and the neighborhood       surrounding the house was designated a local historic       district, called the Medgar Evers Neighborhood Historic       District, in 1994.        We are inspired by the establishment of the Medgar Evers       National Monument would mean for the Medgar Evers Home, the       legacy of Medgar Evers, and for the Medgar Evers historic       neighborhood. We are also encouraged that there will be       opportunities for Jackson Historic Preservation Commission to       continue to play a role in preserving Medgar Evers       Neighborhood Historic District.        Thank you for contacting Jackson Historic Preservation       Commission. As the chairman of Jackson Historic Preservation       Commission, I urge the committee to offer favorable       consideration to this request for establishing  [[Page H3951]]       the Medgar Evers National Monument in the State of       Mississippi, and for other purposes.            Sincerely,                                                      Jeff Seabold,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Florida for his very kind yielding of time.
