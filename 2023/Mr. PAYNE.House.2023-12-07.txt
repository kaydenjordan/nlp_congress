 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the Republican  Presidential frontrunner's criminal connections after the latest  Republican Presidential debate.   At least 11 key figures in Donald Trump's past administration were  indicted or convicted of serious crimes during and after his  administration.   Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign manager, was convicted of tax and  bank fraud. Michael Flynn, Trump's National Security Advisor, was  charged with working with Russia.   Tom Barrack, a Trump fundraiser, was charged with spying for the  United Arab Emirates. Steve Bannon, Trump's political adviser, was  charged with stealing millions of dollars from border wall investors.   In addition, more than 1,100 people have been charged after Trump  encouraged them to overthrow the U.S. Government on January 6, 2021.   An appeals court ruled that Trump could be sued for inciting that  insurrection. These are not the associations of someone fit to be a  Presidential candidate.                            ____________________
