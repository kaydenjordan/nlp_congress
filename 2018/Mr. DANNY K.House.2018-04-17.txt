 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as we recognize tax day today, it is fitting that we  advance a bill that recognizes Taxpayer Assistance Centers are the  primary face of the Internal Revenue Service in local communities.   H.R. 5440 was jointly introduced by Representative Karen Handel from  Georgia and Representative  Tom O'Halleran from Arizona. It simply  requires public and congressional notification prior to any closures of  these critical centers.   Taxpayer Assistance Centers, or TACs, provide in-person help to  taxpayers on a wide range of issues, including making payments,  resolving questions, and authenticating identity. They are IRS  employees who know the law and provide high-caliber assistance locally.   In fiscal year 2017, TACs served approximately 3.2 million taxpayers,  down from 4.3 million served the prior  [[Page H3365]]  year. Unfortunately, this decline can be tied, in part, to the IRS'  recent prioritization of online services over in-person assistance.  This shift is evident in multiple ways:   It is evident in the closure of 30 TACs since 2011, a reduction of  over 7 percent;   It is evident in the substantial reduction in TAC staffing, a decline  of about 30 percent during the same period that the centers were  closed;   It is evident in the rigid requirement of appointment-only  assistance, without allowing walk-in help, even just to pay one's  taxes. Indeed, the Taxpayer Advocate noted that about 30 percent of all  TACs have either zero or one employee, resulting in virtual closures in  about 111 sites.   These reductions impose hardships on local communities and limit  taxpayers' rights to quality service. These reductions in access and  the resulting community disruption concern taxpayers as well as Members  of Congress.   H.R. 5440 is a commonsense bill that requires the IRS to provide  public notice, including through nonelectronic means, 90 days prior to  the closure of a Taxpayer Assistance Center. This notice ensures that  affected taxpayers are aware of closures as well as information on  alternative forms of assistance that is available. Importantly, the  Secretary of the Treasury must notify Congress of the closure and  provide the reasons for closing the TAC.   Face-to-face assistance is a critical element of the Internal Revenue  Service. Many tax issues cannot be resolved via a website or a brief  phone call. Taxpayer Assistance Centers are vital to our tax system,  and I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation to  ensure public and congressional notification prior to any closures of  centers.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O'Halleran), the lead Democratic cosponsor.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I have no further  speakers, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As I prepare to close, I want to reiterate the importance of Taxpayer  Assistance Centers as the local face of the Internal Revenue Service.  The Internal Revenue Service should be increasing this presence and not  limiting it.   H.R. 5440 is a commonsense bill that requires the IRS to provide  public notice, including through nonelectronic means, 90 days prior to  the closure of a Taxpayer Assistance Center. This notice ensures that  affected taxpayers are aware of closures, as well as information on  alternative forms of assistance that are available. This notice will  help communities and taxpayers better answer their questions and comply  with their tax obligations.   As I have said, this is, indeed, a commonsense bill. I urge my  colleagues to support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, as we recognize tax day today, I applaud this body for  advancing H.R. 2901, the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Permanence  Act.   I want to thank my colleague and commend him for his leadership in  bringing this legislation to the floor. It has been good working with  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo), and I look forward to  continuing to do so.   This crucial program provides high-quality tax assistance to  hardworking families to help those who can benefit from a program that  is designed to help.   The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program, or VITA, offers free tax  services to people who make less than 250 percent of the poverty level,  and to underserved taxpayers, including persons with disabilities, the  elderly, and limited-English speakers.   It is a prime example of smart Federal investment because each  Federal dollar is matched by the private sector. The demand for VITA  services is great. The number of tax returns prepared by the VITA  program doubled between 2014 and 2016. In 2016, VITA grantees filed  more than 3.8 million returns, helping families claim about $1.1  billion in earned tax benefits. In Illinois, over 23,000 returns were  filed for almost $32 million in refunds.   With the new tax law, these high-caliber, in-person services are  needed even more, especially in States like Illinois, affected by the  SALT limitation. VITA services are top-notch. The Internal Revenue  Service reported that VITA preparers have a 94 percent accuracy rate  nationally on returns claiming the earned income tax credit.   Further, VITA services make a real difference for individuals and  families. VITA sites are skilled at ensuring that taxpayers get all of  the tax benefits for which they are eligible. These savings, coupled  with the savings of hundreds of dollars in tax preparation costs, put  more money in my constituents' pockets to cover the essential costs  like rent, groceries, and medical care.   H.R. 2901 makes important changes to the VITA program. For example,  in addition to permanently authorizing VITA, the bill allows the  Secretary to fund the VITA grants up to $30 million. We have fully  exhausted the recent appropriations of $15 million. The IRS estimates  that 70 percent of Americans are eligible to file their taxes for free.    Given the high demand and need, H.R. 2901 recognizes that the IRS  should put taxpayers first by giving them access to high-quality free  services, doubling our Federal investment via this quality matching  grant program.   Madam Speaker, I want to acknowledge and recognize the wonderful VITA  sites in Chicago--the Center for Economic Progress, City-Wide Tax  Assistance Program via Ladder Up, and I am especially pleased that the  United Way of Metropolitan Chicago helps champion this program in my  hometown.   As these programs do, many VITA sites provide additional programs to  increase financial stability for families, and I am grateful for their  presence in Chicago and other places throughout the country.   Madam Speaker, I also want to thank Ranking Members Neal and Lewis,  Chairmen Brady and Jenkins, Senators Brown and Heller, former  Representative Mike Honda, former Representative Xavier Becerra, the  United Way, and Prosperity Now for their leadership in providing the  permanence of this program.   And as I know people are struggling and running trying to get there  fast before the deadline expires to file their returns, I am glad to  know that those who needed it were able to get help.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for this program, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Again, I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Curbelo), for his tremendous leadership on this issue. If one talks to  someone who has used this service to convey their earnest sense of  relief and gratitude for something that is called  [[Page H3375]]  ``free,'' they save not only the cost of paying a tax preparer, but  they also know that they have got all of the benefits for which they  were entitled.   I represent thousands of low-income taxpayers, and the earned income  taxpayer credit that they are able to get oftentimes lights up their  life when it is time to file. Some of them are able to get benefits  that they didn't think they were going to have, and so they give a real  bit of thanks to those who helped them prepare and to know.   There are many adviser volunteers and I want to thank them-- individuals who give of their time, their energy, their knowledge,  their expertise, and their effort to make sure that low-income  taxpayers are provided all of the assistance that they need.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have had the opportunity to work on  this bill, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.   I yield back the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 1512, the Social Security  Child Protection Act, which was introduced jointly by Representatives   Kenny Marchant and Lloyd Doggett, both of Texas. I note that my  colleague, Mr. Johnson, is also in the House. This means that Texas is  serious about children and protecting them. This bipartisan legislation  would protect children in cases where their Social Security card is  stolen from the mail.   Most parents apply for a Social Security number for their child soon  after the baby is born. They can do this easily and securely right in  the hospital. The Social Security Administration then assigns a number  to the child and mails the card to the child's family.   Unfortunately, sometimes these letters do not reach their intended  destination. They can be stolen from the mail. In fact, the Social  Security numbers of children are highly valued by identity thieves.  Fraudsters can wreak havoc, creating an extensive record of bad debt  and fraud associated with a child's number.   Currently, Social Security will issue a new number to anyone, child  or adult, who can show that their number has been misused and that they  have been harmed. However, in the case of a child, sometimes years go  by before the family learns that a child's number has been used for  fraud.   Under the bill, the Social Security Administration would issue a  child a new Social Security number if their card is stolen from the  mail. The family would no longer have to prove that harm has occurred  before the child can be issued a new number.   Madam Speaker, this is a commonsense measure, and I want to commend  Mr. Marchant for thinking it up, thinking of it and responding to a  need that was expressed to him by one of his constituents. It is a  great measure. I am pleased to support it, and I urge all of my  colleagues to support it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).    DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I have no further  speakers, and I will close.   I am pleased to note that H.R. 1512 and other bills before us today  take important steps to decrease identity theft. I know that identity  theft is one of the top issues that the Chicago Taxpayer Advocate  addresses. Helping prevent identity fraud and helping taxpayers deal  with identity theft are important improvements.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 5192, the  Protecting Children from Identity Theft Act, which was introduced by  Representatives Carlos Curbelo of Florida and Kyrsten Sinema of  Arizona.   Our Nation is facing a growing epidemic of so-called synthetic  identity theft. This is a sophisticated form of fraud where the  fraudster manufactures a fake identity using a legitimate Social  Security number but combining it with a made-up name. Numbers that  belong to children are especially valuable for these fraudsters. This  is because children typically do not yet have a credit record. If they  did, the credit record would reveal that the name and number do not  match, making the number useless to the synthetic identity fraudster.   Under this bill, banks and other certified users could verify the  customer's name, Social Security number, and date of birth with Social  Security's  [[Page H3379]]  own records. This would allow the bank to detect attempted synthetic  identity theft. As under current law, banks would be required to get  the consent of their customer in order to have the SSA verify  information.   Social Security would not provide any identity information back to  the bank other than, yes, this is a match or, no, this does not match.  This matching could occur more quickly than it does under current law,  to reflect the way commerce is conducted today.   I am pleased that we were able to work in a bipartisan way to develop  this legislation and to strengthen it as it moved through the committee  process. We did so in several ways.   First, we made sure that users of the system paid the full cost of  developing it and conducting the verifications. We did not want to  detract from the main mission of Social Security, which is to make sure  Americans receive their earned Social Security benefits on time and in  full.   Second, we strengthened the security of the system to make it not  subject to misuse. Americans' personal information must be kept secure,  and Social Security must only conduct the matching when the individual  has given consent.   I am pleased to say that Social Security's track record on this is  strong, and I expect they will carry on with their protectiveness of  Americans' private data as they design a new system. I urge my  colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation to protect children  and fight identity theft.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5  minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema), the lead  Democratic cosponsor of this legislation.                                time  1645     DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume. I have no further requests for time, so I am going to  move ahead and close.   Mr. Speaker, I think we have seen much agreement on the floor today,  pleasantly so. I really don't know when I have seen as much agreement  on a group of bills and legislation as I have seen on this day. And I  guess it really means that all of us agree that we need to do  everything that we can to protect ourselves from identity theft, that  we need to look after the interest of children and protect them.   I want to thank all of the staff from both sides of the aisle, even  those who worked for subcommittees, as well as for the primary staff,  for the tremendous amount of work that they have done.    Again, it is a pleasure working with Mr. Curbelo, and I guess if we  don't agree on everything, we do agree that all of us have a  responsibility to file and pay income taxes in order to keep our  government moving.   It has been a pleasant day, not just for us, but I think all of our  constituents, who have watched the proceedings, probably are saying to  themselves that they would love to see more days like this, and I  would, too. So I urge passage of this bill and the others that we have  had before us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
