 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Flag Ladies of  Freeport, ME, who will soon retire from their unwavering efforts to  commemorate the heroes and the victims of the life-changing events that  occurred on September 11, 2001. Every Tuesday since that day--for 18  years--the Freeport Flag Ladies have stood on Main Street in Freeport  in our Nation's colors waving our Nation's flag. First standing to  honor the lives lost in the 2001 attacks, these ladies have  [[Page S5100]]  continued to stand to support the brave men and women who serve our  country today. Main Street shall see them wave the red, white, and blue  for the last time on September 11, 2019.   In the days after the events of September 11, Elaine Greene, Carmen  Footer, and Joann Miller were just like the rest of the country: they  wanted to heal the Nation. So they acted, devoting their time and  energy to honor and salute those who were lost and those who are  willing to make the greatest sacrifice our Nation can ask. Since  beginning their effort, these ladies have not missed a single Tuesday  to share their message of patriotism and solidarity. Nothing could  deter them, not the heaviest rains, the coldest snows, the blazing  summer sun or even a dislocated shoulder. The Freeport Flag Ladies have  showed up every week--no matter what.   When troops were deployed to Afghanistan and later Iraq, these women  took this as an expansion of their mandate--traveling up to Bangor to  send off soldiers and greet those returning home. The Freeport Flag  Ladies have given up much themselves to ensure their mission is carried  out week after week. Their own comfort has been forgone in their  pursuit to bring comfort to their fellow countrymen. In waving the flag  and shaking the hands of soldiers, Elaine Greene, Carmen Footer, and  Joann Miller have represented the best of our Nation and the ideals of  the flag they wave.   I want to thank the Freeport Flag Ladies for their commitment to  honoring both the lives lost on September 11, 2001, and the soldiers  who are currently serving and defending the United States. Their  mission is not political. It is clear that what they do is an act of  love and appreciation for the great sacrifices made by those who serve  our country. These unwavering patriots are a reminder to the American  people of what the flag represents. While they may wave their flags for  the final time on September 11, 2019, the patriotism of these women  will continue to be remembered and celebrated.                            ____________________
