 Madam Speaker, this agreement is good for moving more  commerce across our three countries. It means more jobs, and it means  lower prices for consumers. That is especially important in Texas where  the original  [[Page H12249]]  NAFTA was signed only a few blocks from my San Antonio office: Mexico,  our top trading partner; Canada, our second.   Some were so eager for this commerce that would be produced by  continuing NAFTA that they were willing to accept most any agreement.  But, we insisted that we get a much-improved agreement to address the  legitimate concerns of those who raised objection to previous  agreements.   What we have today is an initial step, an important step, toward  achieving a truly 21st century trade agreement that not only encourages  trade but protects the environment and recognizes the legitimate  concerns of workers. This victory results from major changes in what  President Trump proposed 14 months ago.   First, we secured additional funding for the North American  Development Bank, the NAD Bank, based in San Antonio, which is  important in addressing especially environmental concerns.   Second, and very significantly, we deleted the horrible Big Pharma  power grab to extend its monopoly power for prescription price gouging.    Third, each country was forced to take all necessary measures to  comply with multilateral environmental agreements which take precedence  over trade. This includes an additional recent agreement to  dramatically reduce heat-trapping chemicals. In 2021, when we have a  new president who actually believes in science, the agreement will  facilitate, not impede, our response to the climate crisis.   And, finally, instead of platitudes, we have an enforceable agreement  to address worker concerns. Let's celebrate a major step forward in  building broad public support for trade.
