 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Brandon Caserta.   Brandon was a 21-year-old United States Navy petty officer. He  couldn't get mental health help when he needed it, and as a result, he  died from suicide on the flightline of his squadron in Norfolk,  Virginia.   Last week, on the second anniversary of the day that Brandon's  parents, Patrick and Teri, lost their son, I was proud to introduce the  Brandon Act. I am also proud to have successfully added this bill to  the NDAA today in the House Armed Services Committee in honor of  Brandon.   With the Brandon Act, servicemembers can seek mental health help  whenever they need it, even outside the chain of command, which is  important  [[Page H3046]]  in cases of hazing, bullying, or anything else our heroes want to  handle privately by self-referral.   We won't get Brandon back, but his legacy will be the servicemembers'  lives he saves when this bill becomes law. Let's pass the Brandon Act  for Brandon, Teri, and Patrick Caserta, and for every servicemember who  wants mental health help but can't get it. We owe it to them.                            ____________________
