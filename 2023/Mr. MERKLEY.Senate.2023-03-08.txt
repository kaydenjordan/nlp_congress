 Madam President, due to the passing of my mother, Betty  Lou Collins Merkley, I was not able to travel back to Washington, DC,  last week to be present on the Senate floor for several votes. However,  I would like it stated for the record how I would have voted had I been  present.   On February 28, 2023, I missed rollcall vote No. 26, confirmation of  Jamar K. Walker to be U.S. District Judge for the Eastern District of  Virginia. Mr. Walker has a distinguished career in both private  practice, as well as in public service as a former Assistant U.S.  Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia where he prosecuted a wide  range of cases including bribery, money laundering, wire and, bank  fraud, foreign corrupt practices, and securities fraud as part of the  Financial Crimes and Public Corruption Unit. Had I been in attendance,  I would have voted yea.   On February 28, 2023, I missed rollcall vote No. 28, confirmation of  Jamal N. Whitehead to be U.S. District Judge for the Western District  of Washington. With years of experience in commercial litigation, as a  trial attorney with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and as  an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney's  Office for the Western District of Washington, Mr. Whitehead is  eminently qualified for a seat on the Federal bench.   As the National Employment Lawyers Association said in their letter  supporting his nomination, ``Mr. Whitehead is a highly qualified  attorney who would bring his background representing all sides of  employment law disputes and would provide perspective that is very much  needed on the federal bench. His work for employers, workers, and the  government offer the kind of experience necessary to serve knowledgably  and fairly as a federal judge.''   It is for these reasons that Mr. Whitehead was unanimously rated  ``well qualified'' by the American Bar Association and received  bipartisan support in the Judiciary Committee. Had I been in  attendance, I would have voted yea.   On February 28, 2023, I missed rollcall vote No. 30, confirmation of  Araceli Martinez-Olguin to be U.S. District Judge for the Northern  District of California. Ms. Martinez-Olguin's entire career has been  dedicated to protecting civil and human rights. At the American Civil  Liberties Union's--ACLU--Women's Rights Project she represented women  of underserved communities with employment and education civil rights  cases. At the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, she researched and  advocated for victims of human trafficking and assisted in drafting the  reauthorization of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.   Ms. Martinez-Olguin also worked with Legal Aid at Work in their  National Origin, Immigration, and Language Rights Program, where she  strived to guarantee the civil rights of immigrant workers,  particularly under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and also  investigated federally funded education institutions for civil rights  violations in the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil  Rights. And since 2018, Ms. Martinez-Olguin has worked as a supervising  attorney at the National Immigration Law Center--NILC--focusing on  enforcing constitutional and statutory provisions to protect  immigrants' civil and workplace rights.   As only the second Latina to serve on this court, ``The confirmation  of Ms. Martinez-Olguin would be an important step towards ensuring that  our federal courts reflect and represent the diversity of our nation,''  in the words of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.  Had I been in attendance, I would have voted yea.   On March 1, 2023, I missed rollcall vote No. 32, confirmation of  Judge Margaret R. Guzman to be U.S. District Judge for the District of  Massachusetts. Judge Guzman has amassed an impressive record over the  course of her legal career. Over the course of her 13 years as a public  defender with Massachusetts' Committee for Public Counsel Services and  then 4 more in private practice, she tried more than 175 case to  verdict, judgment, or final decision representing clients who could not  afford an attorney, helping them navigate the complex criminal legal  system.   In 2009, she was appointed to be an associate justice of the District  Court on the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Trial Court, and since 2017,  Judge Guzman has been the first justice and a district court judge on  the Ayer District Court in Middlesex County, MA. Over the course of her  years on the bench, Judge Guzman has presided over more than 1,000  cases which have gone to verdict or judgment. And as the first Hispanic  Judge to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of  Massachusetts, a State where nearly 900,000 adults identify as Hispanic  or Latino, Judge Guzman will bring critical life experience to this  seat. Had I been in attendance, I would have voted yea.   On March 1, 2023, I missed rollcall vote No. 35, passage of H.J. Res.  30--providing for congressional disapproval of the rule submitted by  the Department of Labor relating to ``Prudence and Loyalty in Selecting  Plan Investments and Exercising Shareholder Rights.'' This is the  latest in ongoing efforts to stymie efforts to take on the climate  crisis which is the greatest threat that humankind has ever faced.   Passage would nullify a Labor Department rule which says plan  fiduciaries may, but not must, consider climate chaos and other  environment, social, and governance--ESG--factors when they make  investment decisions, with respect to employee benefit plans. Rules  like these are important because a growing number of Americans are  increasingly concerned about the future of our planet and they don't  want to be supporting businesses or industries that might be  contributing in any way to climate chaos. Investors are also concerned  about the risks of investing in fossil fuel companies at a time when  the future of these companies remains uncertain.   But supporters of this resolution don't want them to even want  fiduciaries to have the option to weigh these significant  considerations when making decisions about investments or shareholder  rights. This is an attack on investors' rights in service of propping  up the fossil fuel industry. Therefore, had I been in attendance, I  would have voted nay.   On March 2, 2023, I missed rollcall vote No. 37, confirmation of  Colleen R. Lawless to be U.S. District Judge for the Central District  of Illinois. For 10 years, Judge Lawless represented plaintiffs in  State and Federal courts on a wide range of civil litigation issues  from employment discrimination to medical malpractice to family law. In  one case, Judge Lawless represented a woman suing her insurance company  as she sought coverage for a stay in a medical facility that the  insurance company denied. And in another, she represented an African- American water maintenance worker who sued the city of Decatur for  discrimination after he was terminated for refusing to sign an  agreement that gave him a lower pay but allowed him to bypass civil  service selection rules.   In 2019, Judge Lawless was appointed to serve as an associate circuit  judge on the Illinois 7th Judicial Circuit Court, where she is  currently assigned to the domestic relations division. Over the last 4  years, Judge Lawless has presided over 125 domestic relations bench  trials alongside numerous proceedings implicating mental health  commitments, small claims, evictions, traffic infractions, and  emergency protection orders.   She has been unanimously rated as ``well qualified'' by the American  Bar Association, received support from several State circuit court  judges and justices, as well as the Sojourn Shelter and Services, a  not-for-profit corporation founded to help eliminate domestic violence  through service, leadership, and education which serves five central  Illinois counties, and received strong bipartisan support when her  nomination was voted out of committee. Therefore, had I been in  attendance, I would have voted yea.   On March 2, 2023, I missed rollcall vote No. 39, confirmation of  Jonathan  [[Page S711]]  James Canada Grey to be United States District Judge for the Eastern  District of Michigan. Since 2021, Judge Grey has served as a magistrate  judge for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan,  where he has written opinions in roughly 40 cases.   Prior to that, Judge Grey worked in private practice at a law firm  where he focused on labor and employment matters in Federal, State, and  local courts, as well as before administrative agencies. He went on to  serve as an Assistant United States Attorney for both the Southern  District of Ohio and the Eastern District of Michigan, where Judge Grey  briefed and argued dozens of dispositive and nondispositive motions and  also led several substantial investigations in cases that spanned  multiple States and countries.   While serving as an AUSA in the Southern District of Ohio, Judge Grey  led diversity programs and anti-domestic violence initiatives-- including instituting his office's practice of prosecuting people who  illegally possessed firearms after having been convicted of a domestic  violence offense. Judge Grey has amassed a stellar record, received a  unanimous ``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association,  and was voted out of the Judiciary with strong bipartisan support.  Therefore, had I been in attendance, I would have voted yea.                            ____________________
