 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind our Republican  colleagues how much work has been done by the House Democrats.   There has been a lot of discussion about the ongoing impeachment  inquiry. While that work is being done, we have been hard at work,  delivering on our agenda for the people of this country: driving down  healthcare costs, driving down the cost of prescription drugs, raising  family incomes with a real emphasis on rebuilding the crumbling  infrastructure of America, taking on self-dealing and corruption in  Washington, and getting the government to work for the people of this  country again.   In that effort, we have passed over 300 pieces of legislation: 10  healthcare bills, 4 that will reduce the cost of prescription drugs;  raising family incomes by raising the minimum wage for 33 million  Americans and providing equal pay for equal work; universal background  checks; restoring net neutrality; preventing our separating out of the  Paris climate accord; a new veterans tax credit; and on and on. Eighty  percent of those bills are sitting on Mitch McConnell's desk, awaiting  action.   Maybe most importantly, we passed H.R. 1, the biggest anticorruption  bill passed by Congress since Watergate.   Again, 80 percent of those bills are awaiting action in the Senate.   The Senate doesn't have to pass the version we passed. This is a  legislative process. Bring it to the floor, amend it, send it back, but  do your job.   The American people are expecting us to deliver on the promises that  we made to get government to work for the people of this country again.                            ____________________
