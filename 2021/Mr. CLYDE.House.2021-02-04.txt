 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose this unprecedented  power grab orchestrated by the Democrats.   Much has been said about what my colleague from Georgia has spoken of  in her past, but the past is past. I do not believe Congress has  jurisdiction to re-litigate what a Member of this body said before they  took their solemn oath of office. That is an issue to be adjudicated by  her constituents at the ballot box in the 14th District of Georgia, not  here in Congress.   Without question, this body is putting itself on an extremely  dangerous path, a path that opens the door to allowing the majority  party to strip the minority party members of their committees, based on  statements made or beliefs held before holding office.   It is clear the resolution before us is not about my colleague; it is  about Democrats seizing upon an opportunity to further suppress the  rights of the minority party, to silence a bold member of the  opposition, and to thereby further their socialist agenda.    Members of Congress have a duty to hold themselves to the highest  standards, and I know Marjorie is doing just that. I expect no less  from my Democratic colleagues, which is why this resolution must not  pass.
