 Mr. President, I rise today, with a unique combination of  joy, sorrow, and pride. For the last 8 years, Maya Ashwal has been my  right arm in the Senate, serving as my director of scheduling and  operations in our Washington office.   I rise with joy today because my life and the lives of everyone who  works in or with our office has been made better by Maya Ashwal. Maya  is this wonderful combination of hard-nosed, no-nonsense grit, and  gracious compassion. She brings a seriousness of purpose to her work,  but she treats everyone around her with kindness and caring. Over the  last 8 years, I watched Maya overcome obstacles that would have  swallowed up lesser people. She has persevered through personal loss,  finding a way to grow her compassion for others in the face of tragedy.  She has conquered a litany of bad health luck, at one point finding  herself stuck in South America dealing with a serious health emergency.  Somehow, we all knew that Maya would find a way to come back stronger,  with a smile on her face.   Through it all, it has been so wondrous to watch her grow as a  person. Since she has been with our office, Maya has gotten married to  Jeremy and welcomed a gorgeous daughter, Piper, into the world in the  middle of the pandemic. She is a wonderful mother, who deftly balances  work and family life.   But I also rise with sorrow today, because it is hard for me to  imagine life without Maya. My colleagues will understand how a great  scheduler or great assistant ends up becoming an extension of you, a  part of you. That is what Maya is. She knows my preferences before I  speak anything out loud. She guesses what I need before I know I need  it. She smooths over bumps and rough spots before they are visible to  me.   But she also provides great advice and counsel. I am lucky that we  share many passions--like mental health and gun safety--and Maya has  become a whip smart political counselor who I rely on to make sure that  my daily agenda best aligns with my policy goals. The Bipartisan Safer  Communities Act could not have happened without Maya's leadership.  Never before has such a complicated bill been written and passed in  such a short amount of time. Over 30 days and countless meetings,  zooms, and phone calls--with advocates, Senators, House Members, staff,  administration officials--we negotiated, wrote, and passed the most  serious gun safety bill in three decades. During that time, Maya was  the air traffic controller for the negotiations, managing to create  organization out of potential chaos. That bill is part of her legacy.   In addition to her work on policy, Maya has also been such a comfort  to my family. Being a parent of young children, with a wife who works  equally long hours, is an unsurprising anomaly in the Senate. Maya's  job over the last 8 years has been made infinitely harder since my  schedule has had to  [[Page S144]]  balance not just work obligations, but a myriad of sports practices,  school events, playdates, and Cub Scout meetings. Never once has Maya  balked at my insistence of putting my family first, ahead of the  Senate. In fact, she has been instrumental in protecting and supporting  my family, continually pushing back against the pressures to put the  children second. When my wife Cathy learned of Maya's departure, she  audibly gasped. She knew what a loss this would be for our family.   And finally, today, I also feel a ton of pride. I feel pride because  Maya is part of what makes the Senate work. She believes that this  place is still capable of great things, and she is committed to making  our institution live up to its potential. After spending 16 years  between our office and the office of former Senator Mark Begich, Maya  could have hightailed it for private sector pastures. But she didn't.  She leaves our office to join Senator John Fetterman as his new  administrative director. The job of standing up a brandnew Senate  office is a daunting one, but Maya doesn't shirk from the challenge.  She wants the Senate to work, and she is willing to do the hard work to  make this possible.   I also feel pride today in who Maya has become while she has worked  in our office. As she proudly told me when she informed me of her next  move, she has undergone the most important changes in her life during  her time with our office. She was amazing when she showed up here, but  I would like to think that she is even more amazing today. And maybe  the people she has spent the last 8 years with have had a little to do  with her growth. I hope she would say this is the case.   I am glad Maya isn't going far. I have a feeling she will be a part  of my life and our team members' lives for a long time. I feel joy,  sadness, and pride today, all at the same time. But mostly, I just feel  lucky that for the last 8 years, I have had Maya Ashwal as my right  arm.                            ____________________
