 Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise because we are tired of  extreme Republican antics that seek to put politics over the needs of  people.   Under Republican leadership, the House has successfully passed just  14 bills. Some of these were bills to punt an impending government  shutdown, which we all know was only avoided thanks to the Democrats.   Let us not forget that their complete and utter inability to govern  resulted in an entire Chamber of Congress being unable to perform its  basic duties for 17 days, 17 failed Speaker votes, and multiple failed  Speaker candidates. Their House is not in order.   Republicans haven't delivered on any top public priorities like  strengthening Social Security, delivering environmental protections, or  boosting our economy. Politically motivated censures like this one that  target Black and Brown Members of Congress like this one are not only a  waste of time, they are a distraction.   The people aren't falling for it. Republicans should actually  legislate rather than play useless political games like this attempt to  censure Representative Jamaal Bowman.
