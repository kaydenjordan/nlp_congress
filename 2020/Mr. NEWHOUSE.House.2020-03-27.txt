 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support this unprecedented  economic relief package in response to these unprecedented times.   It is clear this pandemic is having a profound impact on the American  people. It is our job to make sure that this impact is not a lasting  one.   Especially clear is just how devastating this crisis is hitting rural  communities like those in central Washington. This bill provides  desperately needed relief to rural hospitals, many of which are the  only healthcare provider for a great number of my constituents.    It will support the agricultural industry to ensure hardworking  farmers and ranchers can continue to provide food security for our  Nation. It will provide stability for workers and small business owners  who are the backbone of our local economies.   Mr. Speaker, this is a 9/11 moment, a time to put partisan  differences aside, policy goals aside, and work together as Americans  for the people of our Nation.
