 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this amendment,  of which I am a proud cosponsor.   Nearly 1 year ago, I traveled to Korea, Japan, and China. I visited  the DMZ and the Chinese border town of Dandong. I watched as trucks  loaded with goods drove across the China-Korea Friendship Bridge into  North Korea.   Mr. Chair, 70 percent of North Korea's trade passes over that bridge,  and it was a stark reminder that, in order to change North Korea's  malign behavior, we need sanctions that undermine the financial  networks that keep the Kim regime afloat.   Over the past year, the President has taken tremendous steps towards  disrupting North Korean cash flows, but we still have an imperfect  understanding of where and how North Korea gets its revenue, and our  limited knowledge has weakened international sanctions.   This amendment would require the Director of National Intelligence to  study North Korean financial and trade networks, weapons sales, labor  exports, and supply chains to better understand the sources of the  regime's revenue. It would aid the international community in closing  gaps in sanctions against North Korea. The report will help us support  our diplomats as they seek to restore stability on the Korean  Peninsula.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this critical amendment.
