 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 403 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 403         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 1629) to       amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect       to limitations on exclusive approval or licensure of orphan       drugs, and for other purposes. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy       and Commerce or their respective designees; and (2) one       motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order without intervention of any point of order to consider       in the House the resolution (H. Res. 275) condemning the       horrific shootings in Atlanta, Georgia, on March 16, 2021,       and reaffirming the House of Representative's commitment to       combating hate, bigotry, and violence against the Asian-      American and Pacific Islander community. The resolution shall       be considered as read. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the resolution and preamble to       adoption without intervening motion or demand for division of       the question except one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Oversight and Reform or their respective       designees.        Sec. 3.  House Resolution 398 is hereby adopted.        Sec. 4.  House Resolution 188, agreed to March 8, 2021 (as       amended by House Resolution 330, agreed to April 20, 2021),       is amended by striking ``May 20, 2021'' each place it appears       and inserting (in each instance) ``July 1, 2021''.        Sec. 5. (a) At any time through the legislative day of       Thursday, May 20, 2021, the Speaker may entertain motions       offered by the Majority Leader or a designee that the House       suspend the rules as though under clause 1 of rule XV with       respect to multiple measures described in subsection (b), and       the Chair shall put the question on any such motion without       debate or intervening motion.        (b) A measure referred to in subsection (a) includes any       measure that was the object of a motion to suspend the rules       on the legislative day of May 17, 2021, or May 18, 2021, in       the form as so offered, on which the yeas and nays were       ordered and further proceedings postponed pursuant to clause       8 of rule XX.        (c) Upon the offering of a motion pursuant to subsection       (a) concerning multiple measures, the ordering of the yeas       and nays on postponed motions to suspend the rules with       respect to such measures is vacated to the end that all such       motions are considered as withdrawn.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.  Fischbach), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 403, providing for consideration of  H.R. 1629, the Fairness in Orphan Drug Exclusivity Act, under a closed  rule. It provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce. It also provides for one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H. Res. 275, the  condemning the horrific shootings in Atlanta, Georgia, on March 16,  2021, and reaffirming the House of Representatives' commitment to  combating hate, bigotry, and violence against the Asian-American and  Pacific Islander community, under a closed rule.   It provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight and  Reform.   The rule deems as passed H. Res. 398, a resolution recognizing the  forthcoming centennial of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre.   The rule amends H.R. 188 to provide recess instructions, suspension  authority, and same-day authority through July 1, 2021.   Finally, the rule provides the majority leader or his designee the  ability to en bloc requested rollcall votes on suspension bills  considered on May 17 or 18. This authority lasts through May 20.   Madam Speaker, we are here today to consider two timely and important  bills. The first is a resolution from our colleague, Congresswoman Judy  Chu, condemning the horrific, shootings, in Atlanta, Georgia, in March,  and confirming the House of Representatives' commitment to combating  hate and violence against the Asian-American and Pacific Islander  community.   I want to start by offering my condolences, prayers, and support for  the family and friends of the eight people murdered in Atlanta on March  16 and the thousands of Asian Americans who have been physically or  verbally attacked over the course of the pandemic.   The horrific act of gun violence that took eight lives in Atlanta,  including six Asian women, is a tragedy unambiguously rooted in hate.  It is a tragedy that followed 4,000 reported hate crimes against Asian  Americans over the past year, and it is a tragedy that followed decades  of bigotry, discrimination, and indifference toward the AAPI community.   We must recognize that physical and verbal attacks against people of  Asian descent are not a new phenomenon and that our country has a  shameful past of violence and discrimination directed against Asian  Americans. From the Chinese Exclusion Act to the internment of Japanese  Americans, to the innumerable acts of individual violence that have  cost so many their lives or livelihoods, a vile and persistent racism  has denied many people the basic safeties and individual freedoms that  some others take for granted.   But we also need to recognize that at a time when we are all dealing  with the hardships caused by the pandemic, Asian Americans have had to  deal with additional pain, fear, and loss brought on by the callous and  careless rhetoric of opportunistic politicians and bigots. I have heard  from my constituents and staff members in my office about the pain that  the increase in verbal and physical attacks has caused throughout our  community.                                time  1515    I admire the incredible work being done by AAPI advocates and  organizers in southeastern Pennsylvania and across the Nation to bring  attention to anti-Asian discrimination and to call for change. Groups  in my district, such as Asian Americans United, Cambodian Association  of Greater Philadelphia, Laos In The House, VietLead, and others across  the United States, have mobilized whole communities to come together  and stand firm against hate and racism.   The anti-hate rallies and vigils organized in response to this year's  shocking attacks are a resounding reminder that hate is not welcome in  our cities and towns, but also that standing up to hatred requires more  than just thoughts and prayers. It requires all of us to recognize and  call out racism when we see it, to work with our neighbors to protect  everyone in our communities, and to lift up voices that aren't always  heard.   As we continue to confront the systemic racism that plagues so much  of our culture, the passage of this resolution by the House must be  part of a greater holistic effort to provide all Americans with  prosperity, justice, and freedom from fear.   Congress cannot keep waiting for problems to boil over in order to do  something about them. I ask that all of my colleagues keep that in mind  as we work to address systemic racism and the other pressing problems  of our day.   I thank Congresswoman Chu for her leadership, and I thank her and the  [[Page H2474]]  members of the Georgia delegation for introducing this important  resolution.   Madam Speaker, I also rise in support of H.R. 1629, the Fairness in  Orphan Drug Exclusivity Act. This bill is sponsored by my good friend  and colleague from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Congresswoman  Dean, who has bravely shared her family's experience with the hardships  caused by substance use disorder, and who has been a tireless advocate  for Federal solutions to the opioid epidemic.   This much-needed bill would close a loophole in our Federal drug  approval laws, promoting greater competition and lower prices and  allowing more medications to treat opioid use disorder, as well as  other diseases, to come to market. Closing this loophole would increase  access to low-cost treatments and would prevent pharmaceutical  companies from abusing the current law to boost drug prices for  medications that could be sold by competitors at much lower prices.   In particular, this bill would reduce the price of buprenorphine, a  drug that is critically important for medically assisted treatment, or  MAT, of opioid abuse disorder, but which has been made more costly and  less available due to abuse of the current laws.   The opioid epidemic has devastated families in my district and across  the country. Too many communities have experienced the terrible toll of  opioid addiction, and I am glad this is an issue on which Democrats and  Republicans have been able to work together and achieve real results  for the American people.   Since 2018, Congress has been able to pass multiple bipartisan bills  to increase funding for substance use disorder, provide more treatments  and medications for those suffering from opioid addiction, and improve  access to mental health services.   The Fairness in Orphan Drug Exclusivity Act is a straightforward bill  with bipartisan support and sponsorship that passed the House of  Representatives last Congress, and it was on track to pass this  Congress last week before inexplicably being derailed when one of its  former sponsors whipped votes against it.   I thank my Pennsylvania colleagues, Representatives Dean and  Fitzpatrick, for their bipartisan leadership on this bill, which is so  important, not just for Pennsylvanians, but for families across this  country who have struggled to obtain effective and affordable treatment  for loved ones suffering from substance use disorder. I urge its prompt  passage.   Lastly, I want to voice my support for H. Res. 398, a resolution  introduced by Congresswoman Jackson Lee to recognize the forthcoming  centennial of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. This event was one of the  most abhorrent instances of racial violence in our Nation's history,  and it is history that we should not ignore or forget.   With this resolution, we can at least recognize the people, families,  and descendants irreparably harmed that day, even if we cannot give  them the justice they deserved.   I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Jackson Lee, for her work to  bring this resolution to the floor and to ensure that we recognize this  terrible moment in our collective past.   I thank all of my colleagues who helped craft the bills we are  considering today. I look forward to supporting this rule, and I urge  my colleagues to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, like many, I am so excited to see our  country begin to unwind many of the COVID-19 precautions of the last  year, but we are not in the clear yet.   It is no secret that many Members of this body have refused to be  vaccinated, and many of the same Members have also shown repeated  disregard for the dangers posed by the pandemic. We need to extend  certain measures in the House to provide the House with flexibility to  ensure that Congress can expeditiously respond to the future needs  created by the pandemic and the economy and to keep all of those who  serve here safe.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Matsui), a former member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, with all due respect to my colleagues, I must  respectfully decline to chase the red herring that has been lobbed onto  the House floor.   A vote on the PQ is strictly a procedural vote to move a bill  forward. And as our colleagues know, voting ``no'' would simply mean  that we would hand control of the House floor to them, which I decline  to do.   As our colleagues know, they are under no obligation to offer any  specific amendment, even if they faithfully promise to do so. So let's  not distract from the bills that we are here to move forward today.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee), the lead sponsor of H. Res. 398, recognizing the  forthcoming centennial of the 1921 Tulsa massacre.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the majority whip.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Green).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Nevada (Mr. Horsford).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I wanted to mention that Senator Elizabeth Warren, a native of  Oklahoma, carries the Senate version of H. Res. 398 recognizing the  Tulsa centennial.   When I go home and meet with constituents, they want to know what we  are doing here to make their lives better, not whether we have  succeeded in obstructing the passage of necessary or popular  legislation or in shutting down Congress. I suspect that is true for  most Members, and I value those with whom I can work in good faith.   This Congress has already seen its fair share of parliamentary tricks  to disrupt the legislative process, and I applaud the leadership's  efforts to keep Members and staff safe, to advance legislation that  will end the pandemic, and to serve the American people.   Let's be honest about why we are taking up floor time to debate and  pass the orphan drug bill today, a bill with broad bipartisan support  that passed without a single objection last term.   Last week's ``no'' vote by some of our colleagues on the other side  of the aisle was incredibly disrespectful to the Americans we are all  here to represent. Those Members voting ``no'' effectively told their  constituents that they care more about whose name goes on a bill than  they care about actually passing legislation.   Like my colleagues, I am frustrated that this bill did not pass on  suspension last week. The opioid epidemic is a serious issue. Families  in my district and across the country know firsthand the hardships  caused by opioid abuse and addiction, and this issue deserves to be  taken seriously and addressed by Congress, which is why we are bringing  this bill back to the floor a week after one of its former sponsors  blocked its  [[Page H2479]]  passage because his feelings were hurt when he wasn't asked to lead the  bill this term.   Our colleagues extol, when convenient, the virtues of unity and  bipartisanship, but it is important for them to realize that  bipartisanship relies upon trust. And in the wake of January 6, despite  having witnessed the carnage created by falsehoods about the election  results, the majority of our Republican colleagues voted with no  evidence to cancel the electoral votes of several States.   For those of us who represent Pennsylvania, which was ground zero for  those falsehoods and the efforts to undermine and overturn our  electoral process, it is particularly tough to trust Members who have  shown more interest in silencing those who would challenge the lies  than in defending the Constitution.   It is a shame that a bipartisan bill to combat opioid abuse needs to  be reconsidered under a rule, and I hope this time around my colleagues  do what is right and pass the bill to improve access to low-cost  medications to combat opioid addiction.   We are here to pass legislation for the American people, not to put  our names on things. Stunts like what we saw last week are  disrespectful to the House, to its Members, and most of all to the  people we are here to represent.   I thank all of our colleagues who helped craft the bills we are  considering today. I look forward to supporting this rule, and I urge  my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Fischbach is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 403         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 261) to impose sanctions with respect to foreign       support for Palestinian terrorism, and for other purposes.       All points of order against consideration of the bill are       waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All points of       order against provisions in the bill are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on       any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Foreign Affairs; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 7. Clause l(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 261.    I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.
