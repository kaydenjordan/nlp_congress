 Madam Speaker, last night on television, I listened as  Jen Psaki--I don't know whether it was from yesterday or a replay from  something a month ago--wondered why President Biden should go to the  border. Having been down there, I want to educate her as to why.   First of all, she would find we have a shortage of Border Patrol.  Well over 10,000 unaccompanied minors a month are coming across the  border, and because they have to deal with them, they are not able to  guard the border. Rather than giving free college for illegals, you  could get some more Border Patrol agents.   Secondly, he would get to know that the Border Patrol agents are  wonderful people, so that in the future, when agents on horses are  charging a group of Haitians who are assaulting some woman, our hate- filled President does not attack the Border Patrol.   Third, she can find out that immigrants are right now routinely  throwing away identification cards so that we can't do background  checks on them.   Fourth, I always knew immigrants who tested positive for COVID are  being let in. I was not aware that Border Patrol has a policy that we  can never even force immigrants to take the tests.
