 I would vote--I would vote to impeach.         Because my constituents send me here       each and every day to fight.        Ms. Abrams. We have been fighting this fight.        And we need to be side by side to succeed.        So I hope that you will all join us in our fight.        And if we fight.        And as the next Governor of Georgia, I will never stop       fighting. We can show the old guard something new, and we can       fight.
