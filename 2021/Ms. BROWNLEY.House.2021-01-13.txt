 Mr. Speaker, today is a defining moment in our history.   Congress was attacked by a mob directed by the President of the  United States. It was a horrible, terrifying situation. But we all  know, deep in our hearts, that it could have been much, much worse.   We simply cannot let it stand. We cannot let it stand for the very  soul of our democracy. We cannot let the President of the United States  leave office without acting.   We are the oldest constitutional republic in the world, and our  Capitol is a sacred symbol of our great democracy.   To my colleagues across the aisle, I appeal to your sense of service  and duty to our Nation and to the oath we all swore to uphold. Before  we are Democrats and Republicans, we are Americans. Let us come  together to fulfill our oath by voting for the resolution before us and  by defending, preserving, and honoring our democracy.
