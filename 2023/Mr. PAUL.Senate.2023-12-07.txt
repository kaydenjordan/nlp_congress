 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to invoke the War Powers Act.  The War Powers Act requires that upon request from a Member of the  Senate or a Member of Congress, that there will be a vote on whether or  not troops should be put into harm's way or into a conflict without the  approval of this body.   Our Founding Fathers felt very clearly on this that we should not go  to war without a vote of the legislature. They wanted to make sure that  the Executive or the President was prohibited from going to war without  the authority of the legislature.   We have drifted away from that. There really hasn't been a valid  declaration of war since World War II. We have, at times, taken votes  to authorize a use of military force. They call them an AUMF. We did  when we went into the Iraq war. So we did the voting properly. It was  still a disastrous mistake to go there.   But we never have voted on being in Syria. We never have voted on  having troops in the middle of the Syrian civil war in which hundreds  of thousands of people have died, millions of people have been  displaced. We owe it to the soldiers who are in Syria--the U.S.  soldiers, the young men and women in Syria--to have a debate and have a  vote.   Now, the Senate doesn't want to do this. They are only doing this  under duress because I am forcing them to vote on this issue. I have  the power because it is called a privilege vote. They can't deny me  this vote or this debate.   This will put the Senate on record: Are you for having troops in  Syria? If so, why? What are they doing in Syria? I fear that they are  merely a tripwire to a greater war or to a tragedy should a terrorist  attack occur. They have become the target for the Iranian proxies. Will  we ever learn?   As the fire of war spreads across the Middle East, the Biden  administration sends aircraft carrier strike groups into the region  without the debate of Congress about whether the United States should  be further enmeshed in these region's conflicts. And will there be a  debate at all?   For the past two decades, the wisdom of Washington foreign policy,  the establishment, has embroiled our country in one war after another,  impervious to the catastrophic consequences resulting from this  adventurism. Some 7,000 U.S. servicemembers lost their lives in post-9/ 11 conflicts, tens of thousands more live with missing limbs, burn  scars, or are confined to wheelchairs, to say nothing of the mental  wounds of war. More than 30,000 veterans committed suicide since  Washington's misguided project to remake the Middle East.  [[Page S5835]]    While our soldiers carried out their missions with honor, the  Washington establishment has consistently failed them. Both Democrat  and Republican Commanders in Chief repeatedly have ordered our troops  into ill-advised conflicts with no vital national interest and no  possibility of victory.   Syria is but one example. In 2014, the Obama administration entangled  the United States in yet another endless war in the Middle East without  congressional authorization, without a definition of victory, and  without an exit strategy.   Operation Inherent Resolve was ostensibly intended to destroy the  Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, ISIS, an abhorrent terrorist  organization that was only able to thrive because of the chaos created  by the Iraq war, by Bush's foolish invasion of Iraq.   The U.S.-led coalition carried out a significant air campaign again  ISIS targets, conducting more than 11,000 airstrikes in Syria alone.  But of course our intervention didn't stop there. President Obama  unilaterally deployed boots on the ground, sending 300 Special Forces  into Syria. My comments at the time were: Who goes to war with 300  people? Who sends 300 soldiers to a battle of thousands and thousands  of troops? It was a terrible military strategy and still is.   By the end of 2017, the Pentagon revealed that we had, in fact, 2,000  American troops stationed on the ground in Syria. There were tens of  thousands of Turkish troops; there are Syrian Kurds; there are Assad's  troops; there are Russian troops; and we have got a couple thousand  troops, sitting ducks, in the middle of this chaos.   Congress enacted the War Powers Act in 1973 to prevent this exact  type of situation. At the time, the Nation was emerging from the  national tragedy of the Vietnam war. That war was never declared as  such. Yet it cost the lives of 58,000 Americans. Vietnam started with a  few hundred U.S. military advisers but subsequently escalated to a  point where there were over 540,000 troops, U.S. troops, in Vietnam.   The calamity of Vietnam prompted Congress to resolve that the  President should never again be permitted to enter the United States  into a prolonged war without congressional authority. The President  doesn't have this constitutional authority. The President does not have  the constitutional authority to unilaterally declare war anywhere at  any time for any reason. It is the prerogative of Congress; the  Constitution is clear.   Congress must heed the lessons of the past and seize abdicating their  constitutional warmaking power to the executive branch. If we are going  to deploy our young men and women in uniform to some farflung corner of  the planet and ask them to fight and potentially give their life for  some supposed cause, shouldn't we, as their elected representatives, at  least have the courage to debate the merits of sending them there?  Shouldn't we debate if the mission is achievable? Shouldn't we debate  what the mission actually is, what the purpose for having the troops  actually is, and if it is possible for them to accomplish that mission?   The Syrian civil war is one of the greatest tragedies of our time.  For the past 12 years, the Syrian people have endured unimaginable  suffering. That country has been torn apart, beset by conflict from  within and without.   The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimates the war has cost  the lives of 600,000 people. The United Nations claims that more than  6.8 million people are internally displaced and another 5.2 million  people live as refugees abroad.   It is a disaster.   Today, some 90 percent of the Syrian population lives in poverty. The  war, which began as a civil uprising of the Syrian people against the  regime of Bashar al-Assad, quickly transformed into a global  catastrophe as other countries, militias, and terrorist groups turned  Syria into their own proxy battlefield.   Like Vietnam, Syria should serve as a powerful warning of the dangers  of Presidential overreach and the dangers of mission creep.   The American people are told that the United States is in Syria to  fight ISIS, but we are not fighting ISIS. ISIS is gone. We also have  been directly attacked by the Syrian government and pro-Assad forces.  It is a much more complicated situation. We have targeted Iran's  Islamic Revolutionary Guard and Iranian-backed proxies. We have  targeted every stripe of jihadist and militia group we could find in  the region, which is lots.   In 2018, then-CIA Director Mike Pompeo admitted to the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee that the United States has even killed a couple  hundred Russians who were in Syria as part of the Wagner Group. We also  had our troops take fire from our own NATO ally Turkey. Just this past  September, we returned the favor by shooting down an armed Turkish  drone that came within 500 yards of U.S. forces. It is, obviously, a  conflict; it is, obviously, a war; and it is, obviously, a dangerous  place to have a few hundred troops with no clear-cut mission.   None of these conflicts were debated or authorized by Congress. Nine  American servicemembers have been killed in Syria, and not once has  this body debated the merits of our troops being deployed in harm's way  there. The only reason the debate occurs today is because I am forcing  them to have the debate. They would rather wash their hands of this and  say: President--Republican, Democrat, whoever you are--you take care of  it. We are washing our hands of this. We have no responsibility.   But, today, the Senate will take responsibility. Those who vote  against my motion will be voting to have troops in Syria, and it will  be their responsibility if calamity occurs.   There is a bipartisan agreement that the executive branch does not  have authorization for military action, or at least there has been in  the past. In 2017, the current chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee said in an interview--he's a Democrat--said:         The President does not have authorization from Congress to       use force against the Syrian regime. He should come to       Congress and get the authorization for use of military force.       He has to come to Congress and the American people and tell       them what the game plan is. How do we get a resolution?    This was Democrats in 2017. Fast forward to Democrats today, and they  say: No big deal. We have got a Democrat President. We don't want to  appear to be critical of him. So even though we used to say there needs  to be congressional authority when there was a Republican President, we  no longer say that. Now we are just peachy keen with whatever happens.   If it was true in 2017, it is still true in 2023. Congress should  either authorize a war or we should come home.   The Biden administration continues to say that we are there to defeat  ISIS. Well, the ISIS caliphate was completely eradicated in 2019. Four  years later, we still have 900 troops in Syria.   The administration claims it seeks an ``enduring'' defeat of ISIS.  Not surprisingly, they don't define what ``enduring'' means. Obviously,  it doesn't mean complete destruction of the ISIS caliphate, because the  ISIS caliphate no longer exists. They hold no land. Our intelligence  folks have said they don't even have the capacity to attack, much less  have the desire to attack us now.   The administration's quarterly combined State and Defense Department  inspector general reports that ``the majority of ISIS's branches likely  lack the intent or capability to have direct attacks on the U.S.  homeland.''   The only way they can get at us is if we are there. So, ISIS hasn't  controlled territory for 4 years. They lack the capability and intent  to attack the U.S., and those remaining members of ISIS--there are,  indeed, still radical extremists--they are surrounded by numerous state  and non-state actors who also seek to eradicate them. Between the  Turks, the Syrian Kurds, the Syrian government, none of them are happy  to have ISIS there if it should try to arise again.   It seems to me, though, that our 900 troops have no viable mission in  Syria; that they are sitting ducks; they are a trip wire to a larger  war; and without a clear-cut mission, I don't think they could  adequately defend themselves. Yet they remain in Syria, and they remain  vulnerable to attack by other groups.   Our troops in Syria regularly come under attack--not from ISIS, but  from Iranian-backed militias. Since Joe Biden took office, Iranian- backed proxies have attacked U.S. forces in Syria  [[Page S5836]]  and Iraq more than 160 times. They attack us because we are in close  proximity to them; and they couldn't attack us, frankly, if we weren't  there.   These attacks have accelerated following Hamas' monstrous October 7  attack on Israel. Since October 17, U.S. troops have been attacked at  least 76 times--40 times in Syria and 36 times in Iraq.   According to the Pentagon, a total of 60 U.S. military were injured  in these attacks. Of those, at least 32 were at the al-Tanf garrison in  southeastern Syria, where our soldiers suffered various injuries  including traumatic brain injuries.   The U.S. responded with a series of strikes on facilities used by the  Iranian Revolutionary Guard and its proxies in Syria and Iraq.   During his time in office, President Biden has carried out strikes on  Iranian proxies on at least eight separate occasions. Each time, the  White House claimed that the strikes were necessary to deter further  attacks.   How many times do our troops need to be attacked for the  administration to realize that we are not deterring anyone?   Does anybody believe the ninth air strike will make a difference or  do the trick?   We are actually a target. We are a trip wire. We are a place they can  actually reach by being there with no clear-cut mission.   In 2019, Joe Biden, as Presidential candidate, promised to end the  forever wars in the Middle East, saying:         Staying entrenched in unwinnable conflicts only drains our       capacity to lead on other issues that require our attention.    I wish he still had the same belief.   But 900 troops sitting in the middle of the Syrian desert does not  advance U.S. interests or provide deterrence. In fact, their presence  does the exact opposite. Their presence invites the Iranian proxies to  be able to reach them with attacks. This is the only way these groups  can strike at the United States. It is the only way they can get  attention. If they kill each other, no one seems to pay attention; if  they kill Americans, they pay attention. So why would we plop Americans  down in the desert within a few dozen miles of these folks and allow  them to be attacked? We actively are providing Iran leverage to direct  proxies to attack U.S. forces. This is the sort of strategic genius-- so-called genius that the Washington establishment parades around as  prudent foreign policy.   Our troops' presence also risks getting us dragged into a wider  regional war. Imagine if these recent attacks resulted in the deaths of  60 of our servicemembers--not injuries but deaths. How would the Biden  administration react to that? History is replete with major wars  breaking out for less.   President Biden would do well to channel the wisdom of President  Ronald Reagan.   In 1984, Ronald Reagan withdrew U.S. troops from Lebanon following  the Beirut Marine Corps barracks bombing that killed 241 U.S. military  personnel. Remarking on the decision in his autobiography, Reagan  wrote:         In the weeks [immediately] after the bombing, I believed       the last thing that we should do was to turn tail and leave.       Yet the irrationality of the Middle East politics forced us       to rethink our policy there. If there would be some       rethinking of policy before our men die, we would be a lot       better off. If that policy had changed towards more of       neutral position and neutrality, those 241 marines would       still be alive today.    President Reagan made the right decision in 1984, and we now have the  chance to make the right decision in 2023, without any more American  servicemembers being injured or killed.   The American people have had enough of endless wars in the Middle  East. The American people have had enough of the uniparty--the  ``demopublican'' party directing their sons and daughters to fight and  risk their lives in these internecine conflicts when the United States  is not directly threatened and no vital U.S. interest is at stake.   My War Powers Resolution that I put forward today offers the American  people an opportunity to see how clearly their elected Senators view  our unconstitutional, unnecessary, and dangerous presence in Syria.   This vote makes it impossible for Senators to avoid voting or stating  their opinion on having troops in Syria. Today's vote essentially puts  every Senator on record as being either for or against having U.S.  troops in Syria.   I urge all my colleagues to muster the courage to reclaim their  constitutional responsibilities by voting to remove U.S. troops in  Syria. Let's finally bring our troops home.   With that, I move to discharge S.J. Res. 51 from the Committee on  Foreign Relations.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on S.J. Res. 51.  [[Page S5837]]
