 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  [[Page H10025]]  bill (S. 4978) to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize  the State offices of rural health program.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 4978.         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``State Offices of Rural       Health Program Reauthorization Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. STATE OFFICES OF RURAL HEALTH.         Section 338J(i)(1) of the Public Health Service Act (42       U.S.C. 254r(i)(1)) is amended by striking ``fiscal years 2018       through 2022'' and inserting ``fiscal years 2023 through       2027''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 4978.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Today I rise in support of S. 4978, the State Offices of Rural Health  Program Reauthorization Act of 2022. Since 1991, the Health Resources  and Services Administration's State Offices of Rural Health Program has  assisted States in strengthening rural healthcare delivery systems by  maintaining a central hub for rural health in each State. This bill  would reauthorize the program for 5 years, through 2027.   Madam Speaker, this legislation could not come at a more crucial  time. Today, rural Americans face a far greater risk of death from many  of the leading causes of death for adults in our country, including  heart disease, cancer, stroke, and chronic lower respiratory diseases.   In addition, unintentional injury deaths among rural populations are  approximately 50 percent higher than among urban populations.   These adverse effects in rural areas also translate to pediatric  populations. A study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention found that children living in rural areas with mental,  behavioral, and developmental disorders faced more community and family  challenges than children living in urban areas with the same disorders.  Adolescent suicide rate is also approximately 47 percent higher in  rural areas.   HRSA's State Offices of Rural Health Program has met the health needs  of rural Americans head on for the last 30 years. The program provides  funding for an institutional framework that links small rural  communities with State and Federal resources to develop long-term  solutions to rural health programs through research, as well as  dissemination of information and solutions to barriers to rural health.   These offices must also coordinate all activities in the State  related to rural healthcare and conduct recruitment and retention  activities for healthcare professionals to serve in rural areas.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 4120) to maximize discovery, and accelerate development and  availability, of promising childhood cancer treatments, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 4120         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Childhood Cancer       Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research Reauthorization       Act of 2022'' or the ``Childhood Cancer STAR Reauthorization       Act''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZING AND IMPROVING THE CHILDHOOD STAR ACT.         (a) Children's Cancer Biorepositories.--Section 417E of the       Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 285a-11) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)--        (A) in paragraph (2)(A), by inserting before the period at       the end of the second sentence the following: ``, such as       collected samples of both solid tumor cancer and paired       samples'';        (B) in paragraph (9), by striking ``Childhood Cancer       Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and Research Act of 2018''       and inserting ``Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment,       Access, and Research Reauthorization Act of 2022'';        (C) by redesignating paragraph (10) as paragraph (11); and        (D) by inserting after paragraph (9) the following:        ``(10) Report on researcher access to children's cancer       biorepository samples.--Not later than 2 years after the date       of enactment of the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment,       Access, and Research Reauthorization Act of 2022, the       Director of NIH shall--        ``(A) conduct a review of the procedures established under       paragraph (2)(C) and other policies or procedures related to       researcher access to such biospecimens to identify any       opportunities to reduce administrative burden, consistent       with paragraph (2)(D), in a manner that protects personal       privacy to the extent required by applicable Federal and       State privacy law, at a minimum; and        ``(B) submit to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor,       and Pensions of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and       Commerce of the House of Representatives a report on the       findings of the review under subparagraph (A) and whether the       Director of NIH plans to make any changes to the policies or       procedures considered in such review, based on such       findings.''; and        (2) in subsection (d), by striking ``2019 through 2023''       and inserting ``2024 through 2028''.        (b) Cancer Survivorship Programs.--Section 201 of the       Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and       Research Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-180) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)--        (A) in the subsection heading, by striking ``Pilot Programs       to Explore'' and inserting ``Research to Evaluate''        (B) in paragraph (1)--        (i) by striking ``may make awards to eligible entities to       establish pilot programs'' and inserting ``shall, as       appropriate, make awards to eligible entities to conduct or       support research'';        (ii) by striking ``model systems'' and inserting       ``approaches'';        (iii) by inserting ``and adolescent'' after ``childhood'';       and        (iv) by striking ``evaluation of models for'';        (C) in paragraph (2)--        (i) in subparagraph (A), in the matter preceding clause       (i), by inserting ``within the existing peer review       process,'' after ``practicable,''; and        (ii) in subparagraph (B)(v), by striking ``in treating       survivors of childhood cancers'' and inserting ``in carrying       out the activities described in paragraph (1)''; and        (D) in paragraph (3)(B)(v), by striking ``design of systems       for the effective transfer of treatment information and care       summaries from cancer care providers to other health care       providers'' and inserting ``design tools to support the       secure electronic transfer of treatment information and care       summaries  [[Page H10026]]       between health care providers or, as applicable and       appropriate, longitudinal childhood cancer survivorship       cohorts''; and        (2) in subsection (b)--        (A) in each of paragraphs (1) and (2), by striking ``date       of enactment of this Act'' and inserting ``date of enactment       of the Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access, and       Research Reauthorization Act of 2022''; and        (B) in paragraph (1)--        (i) by striking subparagraphs (A) and (C);        (ii) by redesignating subparagraph (B) as subparagraph (A);       and        (iii) by adding at the end the following:        ``(B) recommendations for enhancing or promoting activities       of the Department of Health and Human Services related to       workforce development for health care providers who provide       psychosocial care to pediatric cancer patients and       survivors.''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 4120.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of S. 4120, the Senate companion to H.R. 7630, the  Childhood Cancer STAR Reauthorization Act. Last night, this bill passed  in the Senate by unanimous consent, and I am glad that we are now  considering it under suspension.   Mr. Speaker, cancer is the leading cause of death in American  children, yet only 4 percent of the National Cancer Institute's budget  is dedicated to childhood and adolescent cancer research.   Since its original implementation, the STAR Act has provided  resources for State cancer registries to identify and track pediatric  cancer incidence, enhance research on childhood cancer survivorship and  innovative treatment models, and support the pediatric cancer  workforce.   The bill before us reauthorizes the STAR Act for 5 years at $30  million per year, requires a report on researcher access to cancer  biorepository samples, and expands research to evaluate survivorship  and treatment approaches in children and adolescents with cancer.   I thank the House and Senate sponsors and families across the country  who have advocated for this important reauthorization.   I look forward to the STAR Act passing and adding on to the Energy  and Commerce Committee's efforts in the 117th Congress to enhance  pediatric cancer research, such as the Gabriella Miller Kids First  Research Act 2.0 and ARPA-H.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, this is an important piece of  legislation. I ask all Members on both sides of the aisle to support  it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 1541) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require the  Federal Communications Commission to ensure just and reasonable charges  for telephone and advanced communications services in correctional and  detention facilities.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1541         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Martha Wright-Reed Just and       Reasonable Communications Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS.         (a) In General.--Section 276 of the Communications Act of       1934 (47 U.S.C. 276) is amended--        (1) in subsection (b)(1)(A)--        (A) by striking ``per call'';        (B) by inserting ``, and all rates and charges are just and       reasonable,'' after ``fairly compensated'';        (C) by striking ``each and every'';        (D) by striking ``call using'' and inserting       ``communications using''; and        (E) by inserting ``or other calling device'' after       ``payphone''; and        (2) in subsection (d), by inserting ``and advanced       communications services described in subparagraphs (A), (B),       (D), and (E) of section 3(1)'' after ``inmate telephone       service''.        (b) Definition of Advanced Communications Services.--      Section 3(1) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C.       153(1)) is amended--        (1) in subparagraph (C), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (2) in subparagraph (D), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; and''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(E) any audio or video communications service used by       inmates for the purpose of communicating with individuals       outside the correctional institution where the inmate is       held, regardless of technology used.''.        (c) Application of the Act.--Section 2(b) of the       Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 152(b)) is amended by       inserting ``section 276,'' after ``sections 223 through 227,       inclusive,''.       SEC. 3. IMPLEMENTATION.         (a) Rulemaking.--Not earlier than 18 months and not later       than 24 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the       Federal Communications Commission shall promulgate any       regulations necessary to implement this Act and the       amendments made by this Act.        (b) Use of Data.--In implementing this Act and the       amendments made by this Act, including by promulgating       regulations under subsection (a) and determining just and       reasonable rates, the Federal Communications Commission--        (1) may use industry-wide average costs of telephone       service and advanced communications services and the average       costs of service of a communications service provider; and        (2) shall consider costs associated with any safety and       security measures necessary to provide a service described in       paragraph (1) and differences in the costs described in       paragraph (1) by small, medium, or large facilities or other       characteristics.       SEC. 4. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS.         Nothing in this Act shall be construed to modify or affect       any Federal, State, or local law to require telephone service       or advanced communications services at a State or local       prison, jail, or detention facility or prohibit the       implementation of any safety and security measures related to       such services at such facilities.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 1541.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1541, the Martha Wright- Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act of 2022.   Communications technology has evolved rapidly in recent years,  benefiting all of us. Whether it is a small business using broadband to  find new customers, the delivery of healthcare through telehealth, or  having educational resources for job training available at our  fingertips, modern communications have made a significant economic  impact but also a very clear human impact, as well. This became even  more pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic, as we relied on  communications networks to remain connected, even when we couldn't be  together.   Mr. Speaker, we know that maintaining connections with loved ones and  our community is crucial. Whether a simple phone call or a video chat,  staying in touch with a friend or loved one down the street or across  the country is incredibly meaningful. These connections are also  important to individuals who are incarcerated, but for them, this  communication is far more costly and difficult than it should be.   Studies have shown that regular contact with family members lowers  the rate of recidivism. Yet, due to a broken system, it can sometimes  cost as much as $1 a minute to make a call to or from a prison, jail,  or other confinement facility. This can make it all but impossible for  some families to maintain contact with a son or daughter, mom or dad,  or sister or brother, especially if and when in-person visitation is  limited, as it has been during the COVID-19 pandemic.   It is no coincidence that incarcerated persons are subjected to these  exorbitant rates. In most if not all cases, one company has a monopoly  in the facilities it serves. Unfortunately, kickbacks, not competition,  are often the deciding factor in which company is selected.   The Federal Communications Commission has previously exercised the  authority it has to reduce some of the rates charged in confinement  facilities, but its authority is currently limited, preventing it from  fully solving this persistent problem.   Recently, a court found that it cannot regulate the rates charged for  calls made between confinement facilities and people within the same  State. This bill would give the FCC this authority and also clarify its  authority over video communications.   It is my hope that this bill will help reduce financial burdens that  prevent people from being able to communicate with loved ones and  friends.   I commend my friend, Representative Rush, for steadfastly championing  this issue for so long. I hope we can pass this bill today and send it  to the President's desk so he can sign it into law. That would be a  fitting tribute to another piece of legislation that Representative  Rush got signed into law before retiring at the end of this Congress. I  am going to miss him here in the House and in the Committee on Energy  and Commerce, where he has been a strong and passionate leader for  decades.   I also thank Senators Duckworth and Portman, who worked so hard to  find compromise and pass this bill in the Senate, along the way  garnering the support of a diverse group of organizations, including  the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the Color of  Change, and the National Sheriffs' Association. This is a bill we can  all be proud of supporting.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Martha  Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, let me thank everyone. This is obviously a  very important piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support on a bipartisan basis, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3405) to require the Federal Communications Commission to  issue a rule providing that certain low power television stations may  be accorded primary status as Class A television licensees, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3405         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Low Power Protection Act''.       SEC. 2. LOW POWER TV STATIONS.         (a) Definitions.--In this section--        (1) the term ``Commission'' means the Federal       Communications Commission;        (2) the term ``Designated Market Area'' means--        (A) a Designated Market Area determined by Nielsen Media       Research or any successor entity; or        (B) a Designated Market Area under a system of dividing       television broadcast station licensees into local markets       using a system that the Commission determines is equivalent       to the system established by Nielsen Media Research; and        (3) the term ``low power TV station'' has the meaning given       the term ``digital low power TV station'' in section 74.701       of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor       regulation.        (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to provide low       power TV stations with a limited window of opportunity to       apply for the opportunity to be accorded primary status as       Class A television licensees.        (c) Rulemaking.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Commission shall issue a notice of       proposed rulemaking to issue a rule that contains the       requirements described in this subsection.        (2) Requirements.--        (A) In general.--The rule with respect to which the       Commission is required to issue notice under paragraph (1)       shall provide that, during the 1-year period beginning on the       date on which that rule takes effect, a low power TV station       may apply to the Commission to be accorded primary status as       a Class A television licensee under section 73.6001 of title       47, Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor regulation.        (B) Considerations.--The Commission may approve an       application submitted under subparagraph (A) if the low power       TV station submitting the application--        (i) satisfies--         (I) section 336(f)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47       U.S.C. 336(f)(2)) and the rules issued under that section,       including the requirements under such section 336(f)(2) with       respect to locally produced programming, except that, for the       purposes of this subclause, the period described in the       matter preceding subclause (I) of subparagraph (A)(i) of such       section 336(f)(2) shall be construed to be the 90-day period       preceding the date of enactment of this Act; and        (II) paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of 73.6001 of title 47,       Code of Federal Regulations, or any successor regulation;         (ii) demonstrates to the Commission that the Class A       station for which the license is sought will not cause any       interference described in section 336(f)(7) of the       Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 336(f)(7)); and        (iii) as of the date of enactment of this Act, operates in       a Designated Market Area with not more than 95,000 television       households.        (3) Applicability of license.--A license that accords       primary status as a Class A television licensee to a low       power TV station as a result of the rule with respect to       which the Commission is required to issue notice under       paragraph (1) shall--        (A) be subject to the same license terms and renewal       standards as a license for a full power television broadcast       station, except as  [[Page H10029]]       otherwise expressly provided in this subsection; and        (B) require the low power TV station to remain in       compliance with paragraph (2)(B) during the term of the       license.        (d) Reporting.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit to the       Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the       Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House       of Representatives a report regarding the implementation of       this section, which shall include--        (1) a list of the current, as of the date on which the       report is submitted, licensees that have been accorded       primary status as Class A television licensees; and        (2) of the licensees described in paragraph (1), an       identification of each such licensee that has been accorded       the status described in that paragraph because of the       implementation of this section.        (e) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be       construed to affect a decision of the Commission relating to       completion of the transition, relocation, or reimbursement of       entities as a result of the systems of competitive bidding       conducted pursuant to title VI of the Middle Class Tax Relief       and Job Creation Act of 2012 (47 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.), and       the amendments made by that title, that are collectively       commonly referred to as the ``Television Broadcast Incentive       Auction''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 3405.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3405, the Low Power Protection  Act.   Now more than ever, local television is the lifeline of our  communities. People across the country rely on their local broadcasters  for news, emergency information, and entertainment, particularly at an  unfortunate time when local newspapers are either shutting down or  cutting back on news coverage.   The Low Power Protection Act would help ensure that broadcasts in  some rural communities are better protected from interference, just  like larger stations that operate in bigger markets. Specifically, the  bill would require the FCC to issue rules allowing low power television  stations that serve markets with fewer than 95,000 households to apply  for an upgraded license.   If granted, the low power television station would be protected from  harmful interference, allowing the station to deliver important news,  emergency information, and entertainment without disruption. This local  news and information can be lifesaving in times of emergency, and we  need to ensure that local communities can access this information  during times of crisis.   The bill is supported by the National Association of Broadcasters,  among others.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join  me in supporting the Low Power Protection Act, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I also urge my colleagues to support this  bill on a bipartisan basis, and I yield back the balance of my time.
