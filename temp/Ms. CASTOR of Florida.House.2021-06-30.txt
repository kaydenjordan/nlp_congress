 Madam Speaker, there is good news. The  Congress intends to invest in America through passage of a landmark  surface transportation and infrastructure package. This is what  President Biden challenged us to do, and we will follow through.   It also comes one year after the House Select Committee on the  Climate Crisis made landmark recommendations to solve the climate  crisis and expand clean energy through a clean energy action plan to  cut greenhouse gas pollution, to reach net zero as soon as possible,  follow the science, improve our health, and make our communities more  resilient to costly climate fuel disasters.   Madam Speaker, over the past year, we have already passed 250  recommendations here in the House and turned 100 of them into law. But  now we are going to build on that progress through the INVEST in  America Act.   It is the most climate-forward transportation bill in the history of  the Congress with record investment in public transit and rail;  investments to make roads and bridges more resilient; record investment  in electric vehicle charging stations, pedestrian and bicycle trails;  progress on environmental justice, clean air, and clean water.   This is good news, indeed.                            ____________________
