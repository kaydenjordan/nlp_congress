 Madam Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues to  continue calling attention to the survival of our planet and our future  generations, the well-being of our communities, and the critical  importance of passing legislation across the board that reflects our  values, which are embodied in the Green New Deal.   The science is clear. We must urgently address climate change now. We  must address our greenhouse gas footprint and the causes of climate  change now. We must mitigate the impacts of climate change now. And we  must support and center and empower and invest in our communities now.   That is what the Green New Deal is all about, building a world that  is more just, more equitable, and more climate-resilient for future  generations, for our children, for our parents, and for everyone across  our communities.   To do so, we have to invest in our communities, critical  infrastructure, and all the things that will make it possible for our  communities to thrive. The time is now to be decisive, to be brave in  our policymaking, to be bold in our investments, and to lean into the  science.   We must do so now in the budget reconciliation and infrastructure  packages that this body is working to pass right now.   This is especially critical for my home State of New Mexico, where we  are already experiencing the impacts of extreme drought, catastrophic  fires, heat waves, and an uncertain future, and where our communities  are already struggling daily to make a living. Our families are  struggling to put food on the table and struggling to support people  across our community.   It is absolutely critical that we support and center our communities  in this conversation and that we invest in the resilient infrastructure  that will make it possible for us to live resiliently: our electric  grid, broadband infrastructure, drinking water, irrigation  infrastructure, and green infrastructure, and to lean into our clean  energy future.   We must also invest in the infrastructure of our communities, our  care economy, because that is the infrastructure of our economy and the  well-being of our people, our schools, and our families.                                time  1600    We must do all of this through the lens of social, racial, and  economic justice, investing in good paying jobs, lifting up the voices  of and listening to the people in our communities and ensuring that  their livelihoods and well-  [[Page H3795]]  being are at the center of these conversations.   That is why we need bold action now in the budget, in reconciliation,  and in the infrastructure package to ensure that we are investing in  things that are not only shovel-ready but shovel worthy and worthy of  our communities and their future.   The time for action is now. We need climate action now, and I am  proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with my colleagues here in the  House and in the Senate to ensure that we are making good on our  commitment to our future.
