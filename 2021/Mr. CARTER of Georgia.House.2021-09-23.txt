 Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor Anne Mueller of Savannah, Georgia, who, sadly,  passed away on September 15 at the age of 91.   Anne devoted her life to serving her community and the State of  Georgia.   After graduating from the University of Georgia in 1951, Anne began  an impactful career as a State representative, where she served for 20  years.   Beyond her service as a State representative, Anne was actively  involved in improving the Savannah community.   As a board member of the Savannah-Chatham Humane Society and member  of the Savannah Cultural Affairs Commission, Anne touched countless  lives.   Anne's passion for others is remarkable, and I know her impact will  never be forgotten. Her irreplaceable presence will be missed by all.   I am honored to rise today to remember Anne and her lifetime of  service to her community.   My thoughts and prayers are with her family, friends, and all who  knew her during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
