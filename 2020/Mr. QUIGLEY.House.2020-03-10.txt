 Mr. Speaker, the CDC has given the American public some  simple suggestions for protecting themselves and their communities  during the coronavirus outbreak: Wash your hands, cover your cough, and  stay home if you feel sick.   But for millions of hardworking Americans, staying home from work  when they are ill is literally not a luxury they can afford. The  difference between staying home for 2 weeks to self-isolate and going  to work for 2 weeks no matter how you feel is the difference between  putting food on your table and watching your children go hungry. It is  the difference between buying lifesaving medications and going without.   Here in Congress, Members are fortunate enough to be able to write  their own doctor's notes. They can stay home and still collect their  paychecks.   Shouldn't all Americans have that same option?                            ____________________
