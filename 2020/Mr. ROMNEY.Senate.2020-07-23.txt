 Mr. President, reserving the right to object.   Mr. Chairman, I came to the floor earlier this week to implore my  colleagues to debate the administration's proposal to withdraw troops  from Germany and to vote on my amendment aimed at evaluating such a  move.   As I committed in my remarks at that time, I am objecting to the  managers' package on the basis that the Senate has not been afforded  the opportunity to have that debate.   The proposed removal of our troops from Germany is a matter of  extreme significance for our national security and our military  readiness. A decision of this magnitude should not occur without the  input of the U.S. Senate. The failure to debate such a consequential  matter is a disservice to this Chamber, to our Nation, and to our  allies.   My amendment seeks to evaluate such a withdrawal and affirm our  support for Germany, our support for our NATO allies, and our national  security interests, and it sends a strong message to our adversaries  like Russia. Therefore, I ask the Senator to modify his request to  include the Romney amendment No. 1885.    Mr. President, I object.
