 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise and thank the Citizen  Potawatomi Nation and Chairman Rocky Barrett for their response to the  storm damage in late April throughout central Oklahoma.   The Citizen Potawatomi Nation dispatched more than 20 emergency  management units and agencies and even began working to anticipate  community needs before the tornado hit Potawatomi County.   The widespread destruction suffered in Shawnee and its surrounding  community was devastating. At least 1,800 structures in Shawnee were  affected, with 300 heavily damaged and 42 completely destroyed.   My heart goes out to the community, and I am proud of the way  Oklahomans have come together as we continue rebuilding and look  forward to the future.                            ____________________
