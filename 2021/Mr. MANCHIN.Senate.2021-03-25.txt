 Mr. President, I reserve the right to object.   I have a statement to make.   Last week, my friend from Indiana and I were last down here  discussing this issue.   There seemed to be a lot of confusion about the Treasury--or how the  Treasury would interpret the net tax revenue provision. There seemed to  be a fear that this language would prevent States from cutting any  taxes whatsoever.   And the good news is that we received some guidance earlier this week  from Secretary Yellen that should put those concerns to bed once and  for all.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the letter from Secretary Yellen   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                     Department of the Treasury,                                     Washington, DC, March 23, 2021.      Hon. Mark Brnovich,      Attorney General, State of Arizona,      Phoenix, AZ.        Dear Attorney General Brnovich: I write in reply to your       March 16, 2021 letter regarding Treasury's implementation of       section 9901 of the American Rescue Plan Act (the ``Act''),       which provides funds to States, territories, Tribal       governments, and localities to help them manage the economic       consequences of COVID-19.        In the Act, Congress has provided funding to help States       manage the public health and economic consequences of COVID-      19 and it has given States considerable flexibility to use       that money to address the diverse needs of their communities.       At the same time, Congress placed limitations to ensure that  [[Page S1801]]       the money is used to achieve those purposes--including       provisions stating that this funding may not be used to       offset a reduction in net tax revenue resulting from certain       changes in state law.        It is well established that Congress may place such       reasonable conditions on how States may use federal funding.       Congress includes those sorts of reasonable funding       conditions in legislation routinely, including with respect       to funding for Medicaid, education, and highways. Here, the       Act provides a broad outlay of federal funds, and accordingly       includes restrictions to ensure that those funds are properly       applied. Earlier COVID-19 relief measures providing state       funding also included restrictions that barred States from       spending those funds on certain ineligible expenditures.        Nothing in the Act prevents States from enacting a broad       variety of tax cuts. That is, the Act does not ``deny States       the ability to cut taxes in any manner whatsoever.'' It       simply provides that funding received under the Act may not       be used to offset a reduction in net tax revenue resulting       from certain changes in state law. If States lower certain       taxes but do not use funds under the Act to offset those       cuts--for example, by replacing the lost revenue through       other means--the limitation in the Act is not implicated.        It is also important to note that States choosing to use       the federal funds to offset a reduction in net tax revenue do       not thereby forfeit their entire allocation of funds       appropriated under this statute. The limitation affects       States' ability to retain only those federal funds used to       offset a reduction in net tax revenue resulting from certain       changes in state law.        Treasury is crafting further guidance--including guidance       to address more specifically the issues raised by your letter       and the procedures Treasury will use for any future       recoupment--that will provide additional information about       how this provision will be administered. We will provide this       guidance before a State must submit a certification under       602(d)(1). We also expect to engage in an ongoing dialogue       throughout the program.        These funds will provide transformative relief to States,       territories, and Tribal governments, and our communities       should be able to use the funds to recover from the economic       fallout due to the pandemic, which is what Congress intended.       I hope to work with your State, as well as others across the       country, to ensure these funds can be used in ways that align       with the goals of the statute without undue restrictions.            Sincerely,                                                   Janet L. Yellen.     Mr. President, I will enter this letter into the Record,  but I would like to read the key sentences. And to the Senator from  Indiana, if I could read this letter to you and to make sure that--I  don't know how--I have spoken to my attorney general, who was one of  the original cosigners, and I said: Mr. Attorney General, I want to  explain this in English because it is very easy to understand. It says  this:         Nothing in the Act prevents States from enacting a broad       variety of tax cuts.    Do whatever you want.         That is, the Act does not ``deny States the ability to cut       taxes in any manner whatsoever.''    This comes from the Secretary of Treasury.         It simply provides that funding received under the Act may       not be used to offset a reduction. . . .    That you choose, unless it is COVID related. It makes all the sense  in the world. It has to be COVID related.         If States lower certain taxes but do not use funds under       the Act to offset those cuts--for example, by replacing the       lost revenue through other means--the limitation in the Act       is not implicated.    They can do whatever they want to. And if they can show other revenue  to offset it, that is great. They just cannot use the Treasury's money  that the people have invested in their States for that purpose.   It also says this:         It is . . . important to note that the States choosing to       use the Federal funds to offset a reduction in net tax       revenue do not thereby forfeit their entire allocation of       funds appropriated under this statute.    They have alluded to that, which is not accurate.         The limitation affects States' ability to retain only those       Federal funds used to offset a reduction in . . . tax revenue       resulting from certain changes in [the] state law.    That is it. That is not--and these are all supposed to be educated  attorneys that are writing letters wanting explanations.   This is as common sense as it gets. It is a bipartisan guardrail to  simply make sure the emergency funds make it to the people who need it  most, and the States can do whatever they think they should do and  could do.   As a former Governor, I would have been offended if I thought it was  hampered. I am not. I have got to make good decisions here. I have  other revenue coming in. I want to cut this tax. That is fine. I just  can't cut a tax to be popular and then say: OK. Mr. Senators here,  please send us money so we can be popular back home but use your money  to make us look good. That is about it in a nutshell.   So it is for those reasons, and many, many more, I object.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
