 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the belated  birthday of my uncle, civil rights organizer J. T. Johnson. He served  in civil rights. He was one of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s  lieutenants, hailed from Albany, Georgia, and integrated St. Augustine  swimming pool accommodations. In fact, he had acid poured on him in the  swimming pool.   So we are thankful for you, Uncle J.T.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge the birthday today of my brother,  Colby Hall.                                   COVID-19     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the public health  pandemic that ravages our Nation.   As COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to rise, I believe that our  country is at an inflection point in which our actions and ability to  provide relief to struggling Americans will define our commitment to  the American people for generations to come.   As the Member of Congress tasked with looking after the seat that the  late Representative John Lewis held for over 33 years, I know that he  would want me to speak up and speak loudly about the need for Congress  to pass a comprehensive stimulus bill in response to this unprecedented  pandemic.   Having survived COVID-19 myself after dealing with it for over 3  weeks this summer, I am committed to doing everything I can to ensure  that we crush this virus and provide for the American people.   Like John Lewis once said: ``Governments and corporations do not  live. They have no power, no capacity in and of themselves. They are  given life and derive all their authority from their ability to assist,  benefit, and transform the lives of the people they touch.''   As the struggle mounts for the people in Georgia's Fifth  Congressional District, it is clear to me that the Congress of the  United States must act, and act swiftly. The latest report shows that,  by the end of this year, without additional relief from the Federal  Government, one in six Americans will go hungry, 20 million renters  could face eviction, and small businesses, which are already being  disproportionately impacted, will continue to suffer.  [[Page H6911]]    I know that the late Representative John Lewis would have taken every  opportunity to use his voice and speak up for those who would not have  food on their table if not for food banks. I know that he would have  taken every opportunity to speak up for those at risk of losing the  roof over their head, and I know that he would have taken every  opportunity to speak up for the small and minority-owned businesses  which cannot survive without help.   Just last week, it was reported that the Atlanta businesses that have  managed to remain open are only making it by the slimmest of margins.  Many of these struggling small and minority-owned businesses have  never, even before the pandemic, had the access to the capital they  need.   They need a pivot. The loans from the Paycheck Protection Program  would certainly help them, and additional funds for this program must  be included in any stimulus plan moving forward.                                time  1030    As the pandemic continues to impact communities in my district and  across the country, I cannot help but urge my new colleagues to step up  and take meaningful action. We cannot, and must not, leave the American  people to deal with this virus alone. It is in the spirit of the  Honorable John Lewis, our North Star and guiding light, that I say we  must not leave Congress until we ensure that help is on the way.   Mr. Speaker, struggling Americans deserve better.                            ____________________
