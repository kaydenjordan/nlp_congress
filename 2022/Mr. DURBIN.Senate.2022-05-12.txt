 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, 1 million deaths--unbelievable. But this  week, it became very, very real. One million of our fellow Americans  now have died from COVID, 1 million parents, grandparents, siblings,  children, friends, neighbors. That is more Americans who lost their  lives than the casualties in World War I, World War II, or the Civil  War. That is the size of San Jose, CA, the 10th largest city in our  Nation.   But behind those 7 stark figures are real people, including more than  33,600 in my home State of Illinois. One of those was a woman named  Maria Elena Sifuentes. Maria lived in Chicago, where she worked at  Communities United and organized for housing and education equity in  her community. She had received her first COVID shot when she  contracted the virus last summer. She passed away on June 10 at the age  of 57 and left behind five children.   We also grieve the loss of Sergeant Ken Thurman and Officer Brian  Shields, two 51-year-old veteran police officers who worked in Aurora  at the police department. They succumbed to COVID infections last year,  both within the same week.   When the pandemic first hit, this degree of loss was unimaginable.  Some people dismissed COVID-19 and said that it was just like the  ordinary flu  [[Page S2468]]  and that it would go away and mysteriously disappear. But now that we  have crossed this tragic threshold, we must take stock of where we are  and where we are headed.   More than 2 years into this pandemic, COVID is still a threat to  America and the world. In fact, infections nationwide are up 50 percent  over the past 2 weeks. Hospitalizations are up 20 percent. That is the  case in Illinois as well as our neighbors in the region. The  Commonwealth of Kentucky, home of Minority Leader McConnell, had the  highest COVID death rate in the country over the past week.    The one thing worse than being swamped with another wave of COVID  cases is being caught unprepared. Right now, we are sleepwalking into  the next potentially deadly wave, and we know the virus will continue  to mutate and pose threats. We need to learn from our 2 years of  experience with Delta and Omicron and act now and be ready, be  prepared.   Over the weekend, the Biden administration warned that new  subvariants could fuel a wave that is forecast to infect 100 million  Americans--almost a third of our population--over this fall and winter.  Yet last week, Health and Human Services Secretary Becerra testified to  the Senate Appropriations Committee: ``[B]ut in order to be ready for  that, we have to start purchasing today.'' That is what Secretary  Becerra said. If we wait for the surge to hit, it is too late.   Last week, it also was reported that the administration will run out  of COVID vaccines by September 1 if the FDA authorizes second boosters  for all adults. How can America be caught in this situation again--even  with vaccines--unprepared?   Because Federal funding has dried up to reimburse hospitals and  health centers for testing, we don't have a complete picture of how  many new infections are actually showing up. The University of  Washington estimates the true number of infections is five times higher  than official reports.   So the alarm bells are ringing, and a looming vaccine crisis is right  around the corner. Other countries in the world get it. They understand  it. They are racing ahead of us to secure supplies of vaccines, but  because of resistance from Republicans in Washington, we are not doing  that.   So why won't the Senate act to pass this COVID legislation--obviously  necessary legislation--right now? It was more than a month ago that  Senators Schumer and Romney, together with half-a-dozen bipartisan  Senators, announced a $10 billion emergency COVID package. It is not  everything we want; it is not everything we need; but it is an urgent  measure that seeks to address the crisis.   Instead of just getting this done, politics were inserted. There were  demands for amendments or else. The process broke down. Instead of  getting the job done, Republicans are playing politics. They are  demanding poison pill riders on issues unrelated, like immigration.   With summer approaching, Americans are eager to keep the face masks  off for good and move past the pandemic. I get it. Everybody wants the  kids back in school. They want them home for vacation. They want to  take family vacations. They want to go out to dinner--all things that  are part of the joy of life. I share the sentiment, but we have to deal  with the reality of this virus. It is changing every day, and it has  surprised us so many times before.   Even the most persuasive political speech isn't going to change the  course of this virus. Rather than reacting to whatever deadly curve  ball gets thrown at us next, we must be ready beforehand with the right  tools to keep us moving in the right direction. I don't want to come to  the floor to mark 1\1/2\ million dead Americans or 2 million dead  Americans due to the virus.   The time to provide additional funding is not now; it was weeks ago.  It is incredible to me that, after what this Nation has gone through--1  million dead Americans--we are still debating over whether we should be  prepared for the next stage of the virus. Shame on the politicians who  are inserting politics into a life-and-death debate.   Without this funding, we could very well lose the progress we have  made in containing COVID. We cannot tolerate that sort of setback,  especially at this pivotal moment where continued progress puts us on  the cusp of what we dreamed of 2 years ago: finally putting an end to  this pandemic, finally returning to normal.    While Senate Democrats and the Biden administration have taken  tremendous strides with getting shots in arms, supporting local  businesses, and getting our kids back in school, we still have a lot to  do.   To my Republican colleagues: Drop the political antics. Join us in  making this responsible investment to save lives and prevent the  pandemic from once again spinning out of control. We know a new wave  could be coming, and we need to sit down and face this public health  issue for the reality that it is.   Let's not waste time with irrelevant, anti-immigrant rhetoric. Let's  do something that helps the American people and work together to drive  America's recovery forward.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) is  necessarily absent.
