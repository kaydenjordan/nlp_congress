 Mr. Speaker, I also rise in strong support of this  measure, and I also have the veterans very near and dear to my heart.   Mr. Speaker, 15 years ago, I started my quest to help veterans deal  with those invisible wounds that they bring back from the battlefield,  PTSD and other mental issues that they bring back with them and carry  with them on a day-to-day basis.   As the chair of the California Committee on Veteran Affairs, I held  hearings. I kept getting veterans saying: We prefer cannabis to opioid  medication. We want the VA to give us cannabis. We don't want opioids.   I soon discovered that there was no medical research anywhere to  determine what cannabis was good for and what it was not good for.   Today, as a Member of Congress, I have attempted to pass legislation  year after year mandating that the VA do research, conduct research  into the medical benefits of cannabis, and we scored zero.   This amendment is simple. It is about saying let's do medical  research into the benefits of cannabis and other drugs that our  veterans are taking that they say are good for them. Let's not take  away from our veterans the ability to have the medications they prefer.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this measure. Let's do it for our  veterans. Let's do it for their welfare. Let's do it for scientific  research.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please support this measure.    Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the Santa Ana High  School debate team, and their coach, Sal Tinajero. They won the  National High School Division Speech Championship. They took first  place, and they won the School of Excellence Award.   More than 1400 schools across the country competed at the National  Speech and Debate Association. This is the largest speech and debate  tournament in the Nation, and Santa Ana High School took first place.   This is a huge honor. It shows that hard work and dedication pays  off. I thank our national award-winning coach, Sal Tinajero, as well,  for his dedication to the students. Coach Tinajero started the debate  program at Santa Ana High School a few years ago, and those students  have become tremendous debaters.   Coach Sal has shown the Nation that Santa Ana is, again, home of  champions. Santa Ana students, we are proud of you. We are tremendously  excited that you, again, have shown us what you are made of. Coach Sal,  muchas gracias.                            ____________________
