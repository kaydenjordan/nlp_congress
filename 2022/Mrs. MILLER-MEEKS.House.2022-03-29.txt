 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  achievements of several young ladies from my district.   In early March, the Iowa high school women's basketball State  championships were held in Des Moines. These young women took to the  court, gave it their all, and made their schools proud. I was thrilled  to see several young women recently earned all-State honors from the  Des Moines Register.   Kelsey Joens of Iowa City was named to the All-Iowa Elite team. Halle  Vice of Pleasant Valley was named to the Class 5A team, and Callie  Levin of Solon was named to the Class 4A team. Kaylee Corbin of Louisa- Muscatine and Kelsey Drake of Wilton were named to the Class 2A team.  [[Page H3900]]    In addition, Jasmine Barney of Iowa City Liberty, Macy Daufeldt of  West Liberty, Journey Houston of Davenport North, Allie Meadows of  Central DeWitt, Meena Tate of Iowa City West, and Taylor Veach of  Central DeWitt earned honorable mention recognition.   Congratulations to all of these young women on achieving these  honors.   Thirty-two years ago today, our daughter, Taylor, burst into our  lives. Thank you to Taylor, our Little Miss Sunshine, for all the  immeasurable joy she has brought to her father and me.                            ____________________
