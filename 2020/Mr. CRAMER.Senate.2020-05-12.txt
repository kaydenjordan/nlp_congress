 Madam President, I want to honor a remarkable woman who  has retired after three decades at the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration. In her 30 years at NASA, Karen Nyberg spent 20 of them  as an astronaut, including 180 days in space on two spaceflights.   Along with other Americans, I enjoyed following her space shuttle  mission in 2008 and the International Space Station's 6-month  expedition in  [[Page S2376]]  2013. During her space shuttle mission, she became the 50th woman in  space. While on the International Space Station, she shared unique  personal messages, including videos on how to wash hair in space, make  a stuffed animal, and work on a quilt. I have since become acquainted  with her as an alumna of the University of North Dakota, where she  earned a mechanical engineering degree in 1994. A native of Vining, MN,  she is one of 11 NASA astronauts who have ties to the Dakotas and  Minnesota.   Karen has given back to her alma mater, where she has served on the  foundation board of the UND School of Aerospace Sciences. There  students from across the globe in the Department of Space Studies learn  about cutting-edge technologies and scientific breakthroughs in space  exploration. Their coursework includes studying future space trips,  including a mission to Mars.   Last July, our Nation observed the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11  mission to the Moon. I recall as an 8-year-old watching history unfold  on our black-and-white television, joining millions around the world in  the exhilaration of this technological feat.   In the half-century since the first moon landing, space exploration  has had phenomnal impact on the world, which I believe is  underappreciated by the average citizen. Karen's contributions to space  exploration during 30 of those years have added to our greater  understanding of our world and universe.   There is a bright future for America to lead the world with  commercial, technological, and military space missions. The work of  astronauts like Karen and the future impact of current students at  institutions like the University of North Dakota inspire us to move  forward with these vital endeavors.   On behalf of all North Dakotans, I send my sincere congratulations to  Karen Nyberg on her distinguished career at NASA and for all she has  brought to this new frontier.   Best wishes on your well-earned retirement, Karen, and I hope our  paths will cross often. We will join in wishing godspeed at the end of  this month to your husband, Doug Hurley, and his space shuttle crew on  their historic flight from Florida to the International Space Station.                            ____________________
