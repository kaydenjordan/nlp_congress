 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5738) to amend title 38, United States Code, to require a  lactation space in each medical center of the Department of Veterans  Affairs, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5738         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Lactation Spaces for Veteran       Moms Act''.  [[Page H5105]]            SEC. 2. LACTATION SPACES IN MEDICAL CENTERS OF THE DEPARTMENT                     OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) In General.--Subchapter II of chapter 17 of title 38,       United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the       following new section:       ``Sec. 1720K. Lactation spaces in medical centers of the         Department         ``(a) Lactation Space Required.--The Secretary shall ensure       that each medical center of the Department contains a       lactation space.        ``(b) No Unauthorized Entry.--Nothing in this section shall       be construed to authorize an individual to enter a medical       center of the Department or portion thereof that the       individual is not otherwise authorized to enter.        ``(c) Lactation Space Defined.--In this section, the term       `lactation space' means a hygienic place, other than a       bathroom, that--        ``(1) is shielded from view;        ``(2) is free from intrusion;        ``(3) is accessible to disabled individuals (including such       individuals who use wheelchairs);        ``(4) contains a chair and a working surface;        ``(5) is easy to locate;        ``(6) is clearly identified with signage; and        ``(7) is available for use by women veterans and members of       the public to express breast milk.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of such chapter is amended by inserting after the       item related to section 1720J the following new item:  ``1720K. Lactation spaces in medical centers of the Department.''.        (c) Effective Date.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall carry out section 1720K of title 38, United States       Code, as added by this section, not later than two years       after the date of the enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 5738, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong support for H.R. 5738, as amended, the Lactation  Spaces for Veteran Moms Act introduced by Chairwoman Luria. The purpose  of this bill is to ensure that each Department of Veterans Affairs  Medical Center contain a hygienic lactation space that is not a  bathroom.   This legislation requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to  provide essential spaces to serve nursing individuals and veteran  mothers which are shielded from view, contain a chair and work surface,  are free from intrusion, and are accessible to disabled individuals.  These spaces should also be easy to locate with clear, identifiable  signs, and readily available for veteran moms.   This bill is endorsed by numerous veterans service organizations  including the National Veterans Legal Services Program, Paralyzed  Veterans of America, Disabled American Veterans, and Veterans of  Foreign Wars.   Women veterans make up the fastest-growing community within the  veteran population. In order to adequately meet their needs, VA needs  to provide culturally competent care and resources to ensure they will  feel comfortable when they seek care at a VA facility.   This legislation, which ensures safe, dedicated spaces for lactation,  further advances VA's mission to create a more welcoming and inclusive  environment at its facilities.   Women veterans face many challenges accessing essential VA care  benefits. The Lactation Spaces for Veteran Moms Act ensures VA  eliminates barriers that may discourage veteran moms from utilizing  those benefits.   A vote in support of this bill is a vote for women veterans and shows  our dedication to ensuring VA delivers equitable and safe spaces for  veteran moms.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Luria), my good friend, author of H.R. 5738, and the  chair of the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing this very important legislation, H.R. 5738, as amended, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill  [[Page H5106]]  (H.R. 7335) to improve coordination between the Veterans Health  Administration and the Veterans Benefits Administration with respect to  claims for compensation arising from military sexual trauma, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7335         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``MST Claims Coordination       Act''.       SEC. 2. VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION AND VETERANS BENEFITS                     ADMINISTRATION COORDINATION FOR CERTAIN CLAIMS                     ARISING FROM MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA.         (a) Coordinated Provision of Materials.--        (1) Required materials.--During or immediately after each       covered event, and together with each covered document, in a       claim for compensation arising from military sexual trauma       experienced by a covered individual, the Under Secretary for       Benefits of the Veterans Benefits Administration, in       coordination with the Under Secretary for Health of the       Veterans Health Administration, shall provide, to the covered       individual--        (A) outreach letters;        (B) information on the Veterans Crisis Line;        (C) information on how to make an appointment with a mental       health provider; and        (D) other information on available resources relating to       military sexual trauma (including information on military       sexual trauma coordinators of the Veterans Health       Administration, mental health providers trained in military       sexual trauma issues, and peer support specialists).        (2) Format of materials.--Materials described in paragraph       (1) may be provided electronically.        (b) Automatic Notification System.--In a claim for       compensation arising from military sexual trauma experienced       by a veteran, if the veteran is enrolled in the patient       enrollment system of the Department of Veterans Affairs under       section 1705 of title 38, United States Code, and consents to       the notification system under this subsection, the Under       Secretary for Benefits shall automatically notify the Under       Secretary for Health shortly before the veteran--        (1) participates in any covered event; or        (2) receives any covered document.        (c) Implementation Deadline.--The Secretary of Veterans       Affairs shall implement this Act not later than 18 months       after the date of the enactment of this Act.        (d) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) The term ``compensation'' has the meaning given that       term in section 101 of title 38, United States Code.        (2) The term ``covered document'' means a determination       (including a rating determination) that the Secretary of       Veterans Affairs provides to the claimant in connection with       a claim for compensation.        (3) The term ``covered event'' includes, with respect to a       claim for compensation--        (A) a medical examination under section 5103A of title 38,       United States Code;        (B) a hearing before the Board of Veterans' Appeals under       section 7107 of such title; and        (C) any other event determined relevant by the Secretary of       Veterans Affairs.        (4) The term ``covered individual'' means a former member       of the Armed Forces (as that term is defined in section 1720D       of title 38, United States Code) who elects to receive       materials under subsection (a).        (5) The term ``military sexual trauma'' has the meaning       given that term in section 1166 of title 38, United States       Code.        (6) The term ``Veterans Crisis Line'' means the toll-free       hotline for veterans established under section 1720F(h) of       title 38, United States Code.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 7335.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 7335, the MST Claims Coordination  Act, introduced by Chairwoman Luria. Information is power, but access  to information is empowering.   Given the traumatic nature of military sexual trauma, equipping  veterans with information about the MST claims process may help to ease  the apprehension that may be associated with pursuing MST claims.   The outreach materials mandated by this legislation will provide MST  survivors a variety of resources on how to pursue and file claims;  identify mental health resources for treatment; and contact information  for the Veterans Crisis Line, should the need arise.   By improving the notification mechanisms between the Veterans Health  Administration and the Veterans Benefit Administration, veteran  survivors of MST will benefit from claims coordination between the  administrations, which will hopefully lead to a more streamlined MST  claims process and accelerated compensation decisions, and will avoid  the complications that often lead to frustration among survivors.   I thank Chair Luria for offering this legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Luria), my good friend, author of H.R. 7335, and the  chair of the Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I truly appreciate the diligent work of  Chairwoman Luria. I ask all of my colleagues to join me in passing her  legislation, H.R. 7335, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6961) to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve  hearings before the Board of Veterans' Appeals regarding claims  involving military sexual trauma, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6961         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REQUIREMENT FOR TRAINING ON CLAIMS INVOLVING                     MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA PRIOR TO ASSIGNMENT OF                     CERTAIN PROCEEDINGS.         (a) Requirement.--Section 7102 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new       subsection:        ``(c)(1) The Secretary shall ensure that there is offered       to each member of the Board an annual training on military       sexual trauma and proceedings that concern a claim for       compensation based on military sexual trauma experienced by a       veteran.        ``(2) A proceeding that concerns a claim specified in       paragraph (1) may not be assigned to an individual member of       the Board or to a panel of members unless the individual       member, or each member of the panel, as the case may be, has       completed the annual training most recently offered to that       member pursuant to such paragraph.        ``(3) In this subsection, the term `military sexual trauma'       has the meaning given that term in section 1166(c) of this       title.''.        (b) First Training.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall ensure that each member of the Board of Veterans'       Appeals is offered the first annual training under section       7102(c) of title 38, United States Code, as amended by       subsection (a), by not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act.        (c) Applicability.--The limitation under section 7102(c)(2)       of title 38, United States Code, as added by subsection (a),       shall apply with respect to the assignment of proceedings on       or after the date that is 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act.       SEC. 2. REVIEW OF LANGUAGE AND PRACTICES USED IN CONNECTION                     WITH CLAIMS INVOLVING MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA.         (a) Board of Veterans' Appeals.--        (1) In general.--Section 7112 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended--        (A) by inserting ``(a) Remanded Claims.--'' before ``The       Secretary''; and        (B) by adding at the end the following new subsections:        ``(b) Claims Involving Military Sexual Trauma.--The Board       shall promptly determine whether a notice of disagreement       filed with the Board is a covered case.        ``(c) Definitions.--In this section:        ``(1) The term `covered case' means a case--        ``(A) that concerns a claim for compensation based on       military sexual trauma; and        ``(B) for which the appellant has requested a hearing in       the notice of disagreement filed with the Board pursuant to       section 7105 of this title.        ``(2) The term `military sexual trauma' has the meaning       given that term in section 1166 of this title.''.        (2) Clerical amendments.--        (A) Section heading.--The heading of such section is       amended by striking ``remanded'' and inserting ``certain''.        (B) Table of sections.--The table of sections at the       beginning of chapter 71 of such title is amended by striking       the item relating to section 7112 and inserting the       following:  ``7112. Expedited treatment of certain claims.''.        (b) Audit and Modification of Denial Letters.--        (1) Requirement.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall       conduct an audit of the language used in letters sent to       individuals to explain the decision by the Secretary to deny       covered claims. Not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall modify the letters       to ensure that--        (A) the letters use trauma-informed language; and        (B) veterans are not re-traumatized through insensitive       language.        (2) Consultation.--The Secretary shall carry out paragraph       (1) in consultation with veterans service organizations and       other stakeholders as the Secretary determines appropriate.        (c) Examinations.--The Secretary shall establish protocols       for Department of Veterans Affairs medical providers and       contract medical providers to ensure that the medical       providers conduct examinations regarding covered claims using       trauma-informed practices.        (d) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) The term ``compensation'' has the meaning given that       term in section 101 of title 38, United States Code.        (2) The term ``contract medical provider'' means a medical       provider who contracts with the Department of Veterans       Affairs to provide a medical examination or a medical opinion       when such an examination or opinion is necessary to make a       decision on a claim under the laws administered by the       Secretary of Veterans Affairs.        (3) The term ``covered claim'' means a claim for       compensation based on military sexual trauma experienced by a       veteran.        (4) The term ``military sexual trauma'' has the meaning       given that term in section 1166 of title 38, United States       Code.        (5) The term ``trauma-informed'' means, with respect to       language or practices, using language or carrying out       practices in a manner that--        (A) is based on a knowledge of the awareness of the       prevalence and impact of trauma on the physical, emotional,       and mental health of an individual, the behaviors of the       individual, and the engagement by the individual to services;        (B) is aimed at ensuring environments and services are       welcoming and engaging to the individual who receives such       services and the staff who provide such services; and        (C) ensures that the language or practices do not       retraumatize the individual.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 6961, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6961, as amended, the  Dignity for MST Survivors Act, introduced by Representative Mrvan.   The importance of caring for veterans who have experienced military  sexual trauma cannot be overstated. By virtue of the bill's name,  Representative Mrvan seeks to ensure that MST survivors are given the  respect and honor they deserve.   Words have meaning and power, and how we discuss MST can be  retraumatizing for survivors. Careful thought must be given to the way  in which the VA communicates with veterans who have MST claims. This  bill takes great  [[Page H5108]]  care to address the language included in claims denial letters so  veterans are not retraumatized when receiving what may be troubling  news. This legislation requires the VA to consult with stakeholders to  identify the appropriate language to include in these letters.   Additionally, the Board of Veterans' Appeals does significant work,  including the processing of appeals for MST. Given the extremely  sensitive nature of these claims, board members must be adequately  trained to review these cases. Therefore, this legislation includes an  annual training element and requires that if board members do not meet  this annual training requirement, they will not be assigned MST cases.   As has been noted in other MST-related bills, the training and  development of contract medical providers is essential to conducting  MST compensation exams.   This bill will require these medical providers to use the most up-to- date, trauma-informed protocols while working with veterans seeking MST  claims.   While it is my understanding that most MST claim exams are being  outsourced to contract providers, I appreciate the changes to the  introduced text that will require the same training for contract  providers and in-house VA providers.   As such, I supported the amendment by Ranking Member Bost to clarify  this issue during committee consideration.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this vital legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Mrvan), my good friend and author of this legislation, who  serves as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Technology Modernization  on the Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 6961, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6064) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to seek to  enter into an agreement with the National Academies of Sciences,  Engineering, and Medicine for a review of examinations, furnished by  the Secretary, to individuals who submit claims to the Secretary for  compensation under chapter 11 of title 38, United States Code, for  mental and physical conditions linked to military sexual trauma.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6064         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF ASSESSMENTS BY THE SECRETARY                     OF VETERANS AFFAIRS OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL                     CONDITIONS LINKED TO MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA FOR                     PURPOSES OF AWARDING DISABILITY COMPENSATION.         (a) Agreement.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall seek to enter into an agreement with the National       Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (in this Act       referred to as the ``National Academies'') to perform the       services covered by this section.        (b) Comprehensive Review.--Under an agreement between the       Secretary and the National Academies under this section, the       National Academies shall conduct a comprehensive review of       examinations, furnished by the Secretary to individuals who       submit claims to the Secretary for compensation under chapter       11 of title 38, United States Code, for mental and physical       conditions linked to military sexual trauma (in this Act       referred to as ``MST''), for the purpose of assessing the       impairments of such individuals arising from MST. The review       carried out pursuant to paragraph (1) shall include the       following elements:        (1) A determination of the adequacy of tools and protocols       used by the Secretary to provide examinations described in       this subsection, including--        (A) the Disability Benefits Questionnaires;        (B) the Department's schedule of rating disabilities;        (C) consideration of whether certain conditions linked to       MST should require referral for both a mental health       examination and a physical health examination; and        (D) the necessity of internal pelvic examinations to       diagnose certain conditions linked to MST, and whether       alternatives to such examinations could be considered if a       veteran objects to or cannot complete such examination.  [[Page H5109]]         (2) A determination of what credentials and training are       necessary for a health care specialist or provider to perform       such examinations related to physical conditions linked to       MST, for men and for women, including--        (A) sexual dysfunction;        (B) pelvic pain;        (C) pelvic dysfunction;        (D) musculoskeletal disabilities; and        (E) cardiovascular conditions (including stroke).        (3) A determination of what credentials and training are       necessary for a health care specialist or provider to perform       such examinations related to mental health conditions linked       to MST, for men and for women.        (4) An assessment of the quality of MST training for       individuals who perform such examinations, including       recommendations for improvements to such training.        (c) Reports.--        (1) Report of the national academies.--Not later than 540       days after the date on which the Secretary enters into an       agreement under subsection (a), the National Academies shall       submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate       and House of Representatives a report on the comprehensive       review conducted under subsection (b). Such report shall       include the following elements:        (A) The findings of the National Academies under subsection       (b).        (B) Recommendations of the National Academies regarding       legislative or administrative action to improve of the       adjudication of claims described in subsection (b).        (2) Report of the secretary.--Not later than 90 days after       submission of the report under paragraph (1), the Secretary       shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the       House of Representatives and the Senate a report on the plans       of the Secretary to carry out any action based on the       findings and recommendations of the National Academies.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 6064.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6064, introduced by  Representative Nehls.   Given the unfortunate prevalence of military sexual trauma among  veterans and the broad and long-lasting impacts it can have on a  survivor, it makes sense to have a neutral research party assess the  adequacy of compensation examinations conducted by VA examiners to  ensure we are fully addressing the needs of our veterans who have  experienced military sexual trauma.   The sensitive nature of MST evaluations requires competent and  compassionate care. Having a better understanding of the academic  preparation and credentialing of medical and mental health  practitioners will allow the VA to adjust and amend existing policy to  provide more appropriate compensation examinations.   The National Academies of Science provides independent and objective  research that informs public policy. To that end, an empirical review  of the practitioner training associated with MST compensation  examinations will strengthen stakeholder confidence in the overall  process, improve customer service, and enhance claim decisions to  benefit veterans who experienced MST.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Nehls for offering this  legislation. I urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 6064, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2724) to amend title 38, United States Code, to direct the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide for peer support specialists  for claimants who are survivors of military sexual trauma, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PROCESSING OF CLAIMS BY                     VETERANS FOR COMPENSATION FOR CERTAIN MENTAL                     HEALTH CONDITIONS BASED ON MILITARY SEXUAL                     TRAUMA.         (a) In General.--Section 1166 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended--        (1) by striking ``or air service'' both places it appears       and inserting ``air, or space service'';        (2) in subsection (a)--        (A) in the heading, by striking ``In General'' and       inserting ``Processing'';        (B) by inserting ``(1)'' before ``The Secretary''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:        ``(2) A peer support specialist of the Department--        ``(A) shall not be responsible for providing any assistance       to a veteran regarding a claim described in paragraph (1),       other than counseling services, guidance, and support,       pursuant to duties determined by the Under Secretary for       Health; and        ``(B) shall not participate in the adjudication of such a       claim.'';        (3) by redesignating subsections (b) and (c) as subsections       (c) and (d), respectively;        (4) by inserting, after subsection (a), the following new       subsection (b):        ``(b) Referrals to MST Coordinators.--The Secretary shall       include, in forms for claims described in subsection (a), an       option for a veteran to elect to be referred to a military       sexual trauma coordinator of the Veterans Health       Administration at the facility of the Department nearest to       the residence of such veteran.''; and        (5) in subsection (c), as redesignated--        (A) by inserting ``(1)'' before ``The Secretary''; and        (B) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:        ``(2) The Secretary shall ensure that peer support       specialists of the Department receive annual training on how       to provide peer support regarding military sexual trauma.        ``(3) The Secretary shall provide annual training,       regarding the processing of claims described in subsection       (a), to the following individuals:        ``(A) Military sexual trauma coordinators of the Veterans       Health Administration.        ``(B) Peer support specialists of the Department.'';        (b) Clerical Amendments.--        (1) Section heading.--The heading of such section is       amended by striking ``Specialized teams to evaluate claims''       and inserting ``Claims''.

Claims involving military sexual trauma.''.   [[Page H5110]]      Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 2724, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2724, as amended, the  VA Peer Support Enhancement for MST Survivors Act, introduced by the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Delgado).   VA has provided peer support specialists for recently discharged  veterans transitioning to civilian life, veterans with mental health or  substance abuse issues, and caregivers of veterans.   Peer support programs have proven successful for these communities  and may prove to be a beneficial tool during the claims process for  survivors of military sexual trauma. Victim advocacy can serve as a  bridge between survivors and the Veterans Benefits Administration  adjudicators processing their cases.   Within the MST context, a highly trained peer support specialist can  serve as an advocate who can provide counsel, assistance, and  coordination to navigate a process that may be stress-inducing and  anxiety-provoking.   If the MST claimant chooses to utilize the services of a peer support  specialist, the MST claims experience may go more smoothly and  potentially reduce the emotional strain on an inherently difficult  process.   This bill was amended in committee with thoughtful input from Ranking  Member Bost, who sought to clarify that the role of the peer support  specialist in assisting an MST claimant is to act as a shepherd for the  MST claimant rather than a surrogate who speaks on behalf of a claimant  during proceedings. As such, a peer support specialist can provide  guidance, support, and counseling and help claimants navigate a  difficult and potentially retraumatizing process.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 2724, as amended, and maybe, hopefully, the gentleman from  Montana will allow this to go on a voice vote. I thought I would just  mention that. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 4089) to restore entitlement to educational assistance under  Veterans Rapid Retraining Program in cases of a closure of an  educational institution or a disapproval of a program of education, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 4089         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Rapid Retraining       Assistance Program Restoration and Recovery Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. RESTORATION OF ENTITLEMENT UNDER VETERANS RAPID                     RETRAINING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.         (a) In General.--Section 8006 of the American Rescue Plan       Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2), as amended by the Training in       High-demand Roles to Improve Veteran Employment Act (Public       Law 117-16), is further amended--        (1) by redesignating subsection (n) as subsection (o); and        (2) by inserting after subsection (m), the following new       subsection (n):        ``(n) Effects of Closure of an Educational Institution or       Disapproval of a Program of Education.--        ``(1) In general.--Any payment of retraining assistance       under subsection (d)(1) shall not be charged against any       entitlement to retraining assistance described in subsection       (a) if the Secretary determines that an individual was unable       to complete a course or program of education as a result of       --        ``(A) the closure of an educational institution; or        ``(B) the disapproval of a program of education by the       State approving agency or the Secretary when acting in the       role of the State approving agency.        ``(2) Period not charged.--The period for which, by reason       of this subsection, retraining assistance is not charged       shall be equal to the full amount of retraining assistance       provided for enrollment in the program of education.        ``(3) Halt of payments to certain educational       institutions.--In the event of a closure or disapproval, as       described in paragraph (1), the educational institution shall       not receive any further payments under subsection (d).        ``(4) Recovery of funds.--In the event of a closure or       disapproval, as described in paragraph (1), any payment       already made under subsection (d) to the educational       institution shall be considered an overpayment and constitute       a liability of such institution to the United States.''.        (b) Conforming Amendment.--In subsection (b)(3) of such       section, strike the period and insert ``, except for an       individual described in subsection (n).''.        (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section       shall apply as if included in the American Rescue Plan Act of       2021 (Public Law 117-2).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on S. 4089.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 4089, the Veterans Rapid  Retraining Assistance Program Restoration and Recovery Act.   This legislation was introduced by Senator Durbin and passed by  unanimous consent in the Senate. I also thank the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis) for introducing this legislation in the  House.   Mr. Speaker, during the most difficult period of the COVID-19  pandemic, Congress and President Biden worked together to pass the  American Rescue Plan into law, one of the most significant investments  in American workers and the American economy since the New Deal.   The Veteran Rapid Retraining Assistance Program, which was included  in the American Rescue Plan, created a new program to retrain and  employ unemployed veterans.   Since passage, over 5,000 veterans have used this program, many to  great  [[Page H5111]]  success. However, not every veteran has had the same experience. Some  have been subject to school closures, which risk robbing them of this  one-time benefit. For example, in Illinois, more than 300 veterans were  scammed by a for-profit school that took their money and abruptly  closed its doors.   This legislation restores these education benefits to veterans  defrauded by schools and gives these veterans a second chance to gain  new skills in a booming labor market.   I thank the Senate for getting this bill to us so quickly and Senator  Durbin and Congressman Danny K. Davis for their leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this important  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), my good friend who serves as a  subcommittee chair on the Ways and Means Committee and is a member of  the Oversight and Reform Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in passing this  important legislation. I remind my colleagues that it was sent to us by  the Senate by unanimous consent, and we can express that same sense of  unanimity by allowing this bill to pass on suspension by voice vote.  The Senate has indicated unanimity. As my colleagues well know, to even  get to the floor requires a 60-vote super majority.   Mr. Speaker, I would say to my friend from Montana, the Big Sky  State, have a big heart as well as be from the Big Sky State. To my  colleague, the ranking member, I take to heart your consternation over  a $6 million non-offsetted cost, but I will remind you of a $2 trillion  tax cut which was not offset.   So we will wring our hands over $6 million for our veterans but yet,  look the other way when $2.9 trillion is blithely moved through this  Chamber with nary a hearing. I plead to a big heart in this institution  that we may get through these votes quickly.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support S. 4089, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6052) to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to  require the employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs to receive  training developed by the Inspector General of the Department on  reporting wrongdoing to, responding to requests from, and cooperating  with the Office of Inspector General, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6052         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Veterans       Affairs Office of Inspector General Training Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2.

(b) Employees.--In carrying out subsection (a), the       Secretary shall require--        (1) each employee of the Department who was employed by the       Department on the day before the date of the enactment of       this Act undergo the training required by subsection (a) not       later than one year after the date of the enactment of this       Act; and        (2) each employee of the Department who begins employment       with the Department on or after the date of the enactment of       this Act undergo the training required by subsection (a) not       later than one year after the date on which the employment       begins.        (c) Elements.--Training developed and required under       subsection (a) shall include the following:        (1) Definition of the role, responsibilities, and legal       authority of the Inspector General of the Department and the       duties of employees of the Department for engaging with the       Office of the Inspector General.        (2) Identification of the circumstances and mechanisms for       reporting fraud, waste, abuse, and other wrongdoing to the       Inspector General, including making confidential complaints       to the Inspector General.        (3) Identification of the prohibitions and remedies that       help to protect Department employees from retaliation when       reporting wrongdoing to the Inspector General.        (4) Recognition of opportunities to engage with staff of       the Office of the Inspector General to improve Department       programs, operations, and services.        (d) Design and Update.--The Inspector General of the       Department shall design, and update as the Inspector General       considers appropriate, the training developed and required by       subsection (a).        (e) System.--The Secretary shall provide, via the talent       management system of the Department, or successor system, the       training developed and required under subsection (a).        (f) Relation to Certain Training.--The Secretary shall       ensure that training developed and required under subsection       (a) is separate and distinct from training provided under       section 733 of title 38, United States Code.        (g) Notice to Employees.--The Secretary shall ensure that       the Inspector General is afforded the opportunity, not less       frequently than twice each year and as frequently as the       Inspector General considers appropriate under extraordinary       circumstances, to use the electronic mail system of the       Department to notify all authorized users of such system of       the following:        (1) The roles and responsibilities of the employees of the       Department when engaging with the Office of the Inspector       General.        (2) The availability of training provided under subsection       (a).        (3) How to access training provided under subsection (a).        (4) Information about how to contact the Office of the       Inspector General, including a link to any website-based       reporting form of the Office.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 6052.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6052, the Department of  Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General Training Act of 2021.   The VA's Office of Inspector General performs important oversight and  investigations into a broad range of programs and spending by the  Department.   Its work informs our committee's own oversight and has often formed  the basis of our legislation. However, the Office of Inspector General  relies on VA employees as a key source of information.   The better employees are at communicating with the OIG, the more  effective the OIG is in carrying out oversight. That is why this  bipartisan legislation introduced by Representatives Underwood and  McKinley is so important.   Their bill requires all VA employees to undergo training developed by  the OIG relating to reporting wrongdoing, responding to OIG requests,  and cooperating with OIG investigations.   This legislation is supported by The American Legion and Veterans of  Foreign Wars, and I urge my colleagues to support it as well.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Underwood), the brilliant gentlewoman, my good friend,  and author of H.R. 6052. She serves on the Veterans' Affairs  Subcommittee on Health.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 6052, the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of  Inspector General Training Act, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2533) to improve mammography services furnished by the  Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:  [[Page H5113]]                                       S. 2533         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 202. REPORT BY DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND                     DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ON INTERAGENCY                     COLLABORATION ON TREATING AND RESEARCHING                     BREAST CANCER.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs,       in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense, shall submit       to Congress a report on all current research and health care       collaborations between the Department of Veterans Affairs and       the Department of Defense on treating veterans and members of       the Armed Forces with breast cancer.        (b) Elements.--The report required by subsection (a)--        (1) shall include a description of potential opportunities       for future interagency collaboration between the Department       of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense with       respect to treating and researching breast cancer; and        (2) may include a focus on--        (A) with respect to women members of the Armed Forces with       a diagnosis of or who are undergoing screening for breast       cancer, transition of such members from receiving care from       the Department of Defense to receiving care from the       Department of Veterans Affairs;        (B) collaborative breast cancer research opportunities       between the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department       of Defense;        (C) access to clinical trials; and        (D) such other matters as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       and the Secretary of Defense consider appropriate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on S. 2533.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 2533, Making Advances in  Mammography and Medical Options for Veterans Act, or MAMMO Act,  introduced by Senator Tester.   This bill vastly improves the Department of Veterans Affairs'  mammography services by updating policies and directives to ensure VA  is not only following best practices, but also using the most advanced  medical, diagnostic equipment and testing to aid in early detection and  prevention of breast cancer.   Mr. Speaker, timeliness matters. By ensuring VA is using the best  practices and most up-to-date technologies, we will help decrease the  risk that women veterans--a group that is nearly twice as likely to  develop breast cancer than their civilian counterparts--are  misdiagnosed, or undiagnosed, for breast cancer.   Access to reliable mammograms at VA facilities is imperative in order  to detect tumors years prior to physical touch detection. A veteran  that receives an early diagnosis will have stronger treatment options  and an increased likelihood of survival.   It is important to note that women are not the only veterans  susceptible to breast cancer, men are increasingly at risk, too. This  bill addresses the needs of male veterans who may require prompt breast  cancer screening services.   In addition, this legislation calls on VA to collaborate with other  Federal partners, such as the Department of Defense and the National  Cancer Institute to enhance research and care for women veterans  suffering from breast cancer.   The MAMMO Act has broad bipartisan support, and I thank Chairwoman  Brownley for her steadfast leadership on this issue and for introducing  the House companion of this legislation with Dr. Miller-Meeks.   Additionally, numerous veteran service organizations, such as Iraq  and Afghanistan Veterans of America,  [[Page H5115]]  Wounded Warrior Project, and The American Legion have voiced robust  support for this legislation.   We cannot wait any longer to pass this critical piece of legislation.  The MAMMO Act is essential for VA to provide high-quality, lifesaving  care that veterans have not only earned but deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this important piece of  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing S. 2533. In the last vote, the gentleman from Montana went out  of my line of sight, and I thought we were going to pass this on  suspension. I plead with him, let MAMMO go, let MAMMO pass on voice. By  allowing us to pass it on voice, everybody says ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2102) to amend title 38, United States Code, to direct the  Under Secretary for Health of the Department of Veterans Affairs to  provide mammography screening for veterans who served in locations  associated with toxic exposure.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2102         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Dr. Kate Hendricks Thomas       Supporting Expanded Review for Veterans In Combat       Environments Act'' or the ``Dr. Kate Hendricks Thomas SERVICE       Act''.       SEC. 2. REVISION OF BREAST CANCER MAMMOGRAPHY POLICY OF                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS TO PROVIDE                     MAMMOGRAPHY SCREENING FOR VETERANS WHO SERVED                     IN LOCATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH TOXIC EXPOSURE.         (a) In General.--Section 7322 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended--        (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``The'' and inserting       ``In General.--The'';        (2) in subsection (b)--        (A) by striking ``The'' and inserting ``Standards for       Screening.--The''; and        (B) in paragraph (2)(B), by inserting ``a record of service       in a location and during a period specified in subsection       (d),'' after ``risk factors,''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following new subsections:        ``(c) Eligibility for Screening for Veterans Exposed to       Toxic Substances.--The Under Secretary for Health shall       ensure that, under the policy developed under subsection (a),       any veteran who, during active military, naval, or air       service, was deployed in support of a contingency operation       in a location and during a period specified in subsection       (d), is eligible for a mammography screening by a health care       provider of the Department.        ``(d) Locations and Periods Specified.--(1) The locations       and periods specified in this subsection are the following:        ``(A) Iraq during following periods:        ``(i) The period beginning on August 2, 1990, and ending on       February 28, 1991.        ``(ii) The period beginning on March 19, 2003, and ending       on such date as the Secretary determines burn pits are no       longer used in Iraq.        ``(B) The Southwest Asia theater of operations, other than       Iraq, during the period beginning on August 2, 1990, and       ending on such date as the Secretary determines burn pits are       no longer used in such location, including the following       locations:        ``(i) Kuwait.        ``(ii) Saudi Arabia.        ``(iii) Oman.        ``(iv) Qatar.        ``(C) Afghanistan during the period beginning on September       11, 2001, and ending on such date as the Secretary determines       burn pits are no longer used in Afghanistan.

(b) Report on Breast Cancer Rates for Veterans Deployed to       Certain Areas.--Not later than two years after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall submit to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the       Senate and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of       Representatives a report that compares the rates of breast       cancer among members of the Armed Forces deployed to the       locations and during the periods specified in section 7322(d)       of title 38, United States Code, as added by subsection (a),       as compared to members of the Armed Forces who were not       deployed to those locations during those periods and to the       civilian population.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on S. 2102.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 2102, the Dr. Kate  Hendricks Thomas Supporting Expanded Review for Veterans in Combat  Environments Act, or SERVICE Act, introduced by Senator Boozman.   I applaud Dr. Miller-Meeks and Chairwoman Brownley for their  initiative on this urgent issue and for introducing the House  companion.   The purpose of this bill is to ensure that any veteran who was  deployed in support of a contingency operation in specified locations  during defined periods is eligible for a mammography screening by a VA  healthcare provider. The specified locations are theaters of operations  where burn pits are currently--or were previously--being used.   This bill also requires inclusion of other locations and time periods  as determined by the Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry.   Additionally, the SERVICE Act requires a report that compares breast  cancer rates for veterans deployed to the specified locations,  comparing data to other members of the Armed Forces who were not  deployed during that period, and to the civilian population.   Many of us here today were lucky enough to have had the honor of  meeting Dr. Kate Hendricks Thomas; a fierce advocate, loving wife and  mother, and an exemplary Marine Corps veteran, who served near a burn  pit in Fallujah. Kate passed away last month after battling stage IV  breast cancer.   She gave her last days to her fellow veterans, fighting for the  passage of comprehensive toxic exposure legislation that would provide  potentially lifesaving care crucial for similarly exposed veterans.   While I support this important and timely legislation, I also stress  the urgency of passing the Honoring our PACT Act. It is time for our  country to make good on its promise to toxic-exposed veterans.   It is up to us, Members of Congress, to fight for our Nation's  veterans as they have fought for us. Our Nation's veterans do not have  time to wait.   I support S. 2102, and I ask my colleagues to do the same. Mr.  Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in passing  this important piece of legislation, the Dr. Kate Hendricks Thomas  SERVICE Act.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
