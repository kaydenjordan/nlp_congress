 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Dr.  Emmanuel Bilirakis and Honorable Jennifer Wexton National Plan to End  Parkinson's Act, H.R. 2365.   This bill takes a major step toward preventing and curing Parkinson's  and diseases like it, diseases that impact millions of Americans,  including more than 67,000 people in my home State of Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Tonko and Congressman Bilirakis for  introducing this transformative legislation, which I am proud to  cosponsor. I also thank the Houston Area Parkinson Society for the  advocacy and the important and meaningful work that they do for those  living with Parkinson's in Texas' Seventh Congressional District and  throughout the greater Houston area.   I thank my friend and colleague, Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton of  Virginia, for her leadership, for her grace, and for her inspiring  example. As her classmate in the Congress in the class of 2018 and  fellow William and Mary Law School alum, I have admired Jennifer since  the day that I met her.   Today, we honor her by naming this legislation for her in recognition  of the work that she has done to advance this landmark legislation that  will change the lives of millions of individuals and families affected  by Parkinson's and diseases like it for decades to come, but it is  Jennifer who honors all of us, who honors our Constitution and our  country and our fellow citizens by her service and by her example of  courage and commitment and citizenship.
