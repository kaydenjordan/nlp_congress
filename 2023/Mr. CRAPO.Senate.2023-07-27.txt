 Mr. President, when America conducted nuclear tests in  Nevada, New Mexico, and the Pacific, we had little understanding of how  radiation spread.   Throughout my time in Congress, I have advocated for expanding the  Radiation Exposure Compensation Act to cover the forgotten victims of  these tests, including the residents of all the affected States that  have been identified here today.   Downwinders, those affected by these tests, deserve to be compensated  for the effects of these weapons. I am grateful for working with  Senator Lujan and Senator Hawley and our other colleagues to ensure  that we do not leave our downwinders behind.
