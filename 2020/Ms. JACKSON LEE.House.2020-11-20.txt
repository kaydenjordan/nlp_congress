 Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me wish America a  happy Thanksgiving.   Just 24 hours ago, Pfizer indicated that they would seek an emergency  authorization of their vaccine at the Food and Drug Administration.   People are dying. 250,000 have died. One million cases have already  been met in Texas and California.   The General Services Administrator does not have any legal authority  to continue to block the certification that is needed for the incoming  President and Vice President of the United States so they can be  engaged in the distribution and the formula to be utilized for the  distribution of vaccines as they begin to come, with a number of  companies ready to move forward.   In interviews on national television, you are hearing different  States saying that they are getting a certain amount and that others  are getting a certain amount. It is a question of vulnerability and  those who are most vulnerable, those who cannot speak for themselves.  Therefore, cooperation between the present administration and the Biden  and Harris incoming administration is absolutely vital.   I call upon the General Services Administrator today to cease  blocking this engagement for the betterment of the American people and  to save lives.                            ____________________
