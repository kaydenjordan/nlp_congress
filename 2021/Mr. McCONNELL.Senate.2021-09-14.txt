 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, here is a quote to start the day:         I do think we're in very serious danger of repeating almost       all the mistakes of the 1960s and early 1970s.    That is Larry Summers, the senior advisor to two Democratic  Presidents, about the risk of inflation we face today.   As one report explained:         The former Treasury secretary has been warning since       February that President Joe Biden's big-spending agenda was       creating the risk of an inflation spike this year,       potentially cutting into the economic recovery from the       COVID-19 pandemic.    Oh, but Washington Democrats have spent trillions--trillions--of  dollars on pet liberal projects. They have been printing and wasting  money like there is no tomorrow, and American families are hurting as a  result.   Inflation has more than overtaken the average worker's wage growth  since last year. Employers are raising wages higher and higher, but  their workers' paychecks go less and less far. Families' incomes and  savings are eroding right before their eyes.   Democrats have done this proudly--proudly--on a party-line basis.  Back in 2020, during the teeth of the COVID emergency, Congress worked  across party lines to pass massive rescue packages that Republicans and  Democrats had written together. Virtually every serious expert agreed  that after the last relief bill that we passed in December, the economy  was primed and ready to go.   But our Democratic colleagues wanted more. Like they admitted from  the start of the pandemic, they wanted to use the crisis to  ``restructure things to fit [their] vision'' [from a temporary  emergency to permanent socialism].   They bragged the bipartisan bill they passed in March was the most  leftwing legislation in American history. Now they want to dwarf that  bill with a reckless taxing-and-spending spree that would cost  trillions more and bury the country in job-killing tax hikes.   When it comes to spending and the economy, President Biden, Speaker  Pelosi, and the Democratic leader have made a conscious decision: They  don't want Republican-governing partners. They want to go it alone.  Well, with one exception--just one exception.   No, Republicans won't have any input into the massive, reckless  taxing-and-spending spree that will stick middle-class families with  higher costs, lower wages, and a socialist country they didn't vote  for.   But Democrats do want Republicans' help with just one thing. They  want us to help raise the credit limit to make it happen. They want us  to help clear the path for their partisan, job-killing agenda, which we  oppose.   So let's make this perfectly clear, in case anybody is in doubt. The  debt suspension that just expired in August automatically covered the  borrowing that had been accumulated before that date. This is the  discussion about the future. This isn't the last 4 years, when we were  reaching bipartisan government funding agreements, bipartisan  appropriations, and bipartisan COVID bills.   Democrats have made a different choice. They want to make policy all  by themselves. So they can come up with the financing on their own as  well. The Democratic leaders have every tool and procedure they need to  handle the debt limit on a partisan basis, just like they are choosing  to handle everything else.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, on a completely different matter,  providing for the common defense and protecting the American people is  one of the fundamental responsibilities our Founders entrusted to the  Federal Government. It is a core obligation of the Commander in Chief.   Yet, to a deadly degree, a parade of mistakes in Afghanistan tells us  President Biden and his team have failed this most basic test of  competence. For 20 years, the United States has successfully kept  terrorists from staging another major attack on our homeland.   Over the years, we have reduced our own military presence in  Afghanistan, secured greater assistance in foreign partners, and  supported local Afghan forces who did the vast majority of the  fighting. This strategy kept al-Qaida on the run. It kept the Taliban  from taking control, and it kept Afghanistan from becoming a safe haven  for terror.   In only a matter of months, President Biden and his team have  squandered all of that--squandered it. The collapse we witnessed wasn't  inevitable. It didn't happen on its own. It happened because President  Biden pulled the plug on our Afghan partners and pulled the rug out  from under our allies who were with us in this shared fight.   Everyone seemed to realize this is a historic disaster for the United  States, except maybe the President and his loyal retainers.   Secretary Blinken points to the frantic evacuation of 100,000  desperate people as a huge success. Seriously? They initially didn't  envision having to evacuate anyone. The number of people evacuated is  not a metric of success for  [[Page S6466]]  this administration; it is a measure of their failure.   Back in April, my colleague the Democratic leader heaped praise on  what he called President Biden's ``careful and thought-out plan with a  real timetable and a firm end date.'' Does he stand by this lavish  praise for a careful and thought-out plan? Crickets. Was it wise to  conduct our retreat during the height of the fighting season? Was it  sound strategy to preemptively abandon the strategic Bagram Air Base in  the middle of the night without telling our partners? Was it careful  and prudent to tie our departure to the 20th anniversary of September  11?   Our botched retreat from a so-called endless war cost more American  lives than nearly the prior 2 years combined. And make no mistake, the  war against terror hasn't ended--far, far from it. In a rare moment of  candor, the Biden administration's own experts have admitted explicitly  that we will face new terrorist threats from inside Afghanistan sooner  rather than later. We will have to face a more entrenched and  emboldened enemy with fewer resources, fewer friends, and more  constraints.   So virtually every reason and advantage that President Biden said  this policy would bring about has already proven absolutely false.   The administration said leaving Afghanistan would let us focus more  resources on China, but its catastrophic retreat has tied up even more  resources, including strategic naval assets from the Indo-Pacific. And  while the administration's officials are consumed--consumed--with this  catastrophe, China is cultivating deeper ties with the Taliban.   The administration told us our military and intelligence community  could keep terrorists at bay with over-the-horizon capabilities, but  longer distances, fewer assets, and less intelligence are already  taking their toll, and innocent civilians appear to be paying the  price.   Even still, the White House continues to peddle misleading  comparisons with operations in other theaters, ignoring the unique  challenges of keeping close eyes on a landlocked country with a hostile  government thousands of miles from U.S. bases.   Administration officials like to say there is no imminent threat  posed by al-Qaida emanating from Afghanistan. But their abandonment of  Afghanistan has already allowed that threat to grow, and we will have  fewer resources with which to confront the gathering threat. According  to press reporting, just this very morning, the Deputy Director of the  CIA has acknowledged they are seeing al-Qaida terrorists flowing back-- back--into Afghanistan, and our intelligence capabilities are already  diminished.   But there is a larger pattern of broken promises. The President said  that everyone who wanted to get out would be able to do so, that we  would leave no one behind. Instead, we left Americans and vulnerable  Afghans behind.   Secretary Blinken said the Taliban committed to allow Americans and  vulnerable Afghans safe passage to the airport. Instead, we know  Americans and Afghans were prevented from getting to the airport. Many  still cannot leave.   The administration said that we would have tremendous leverage over  the Taliban, that they would need international recognition and  funding. Yet the Taliban doesn't seem to be terribly concerned with  global PR.   The administration said they would hold the Taliban accountable. They  haven't.   The administration seems to believe the Taliban would establish an  inclusive and representational government. Look, we are talking about a  government of medieval theocrats--medieval theocrats--the same killers,  kidnappers, and hostage-takers who aided and abetted the terrorist  architects of 9/11.   Well, their government is, however, inclusive in one way. It is  inclusive in one way. Listen to this. It includes four--four--of the  Guantanamo Bay terrorists released by President Obama in exchange for  Bowe Bergdahl; four people who were at GTMO, exchanged for Bowe  Bergdahl. And that is only part of the government. It also includes a  senior Haqqani terrorist with a $5 million bounty on his head and  American blood on his hands--another top official in the government.  This is not a government that cares about staying in the good graces of  the so-called international community.   Enough fluff. Enough spin. It is time for hard truths and  accountability. The Biden administration's conduct over the past  several months demands thorough instigation by the Senate. That will  begin with Secretary Blinken's hearing at the Foreign Relations  Committee today. I hope the Secretary and the administration he  represents are prepared to answer some tough questions about past  decisions, as well as future plans. The American people and the  vulnerable partners we have left behind deserve nothing less.                            ____________________
