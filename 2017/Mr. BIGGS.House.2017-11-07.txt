 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I stand tonight with a number of my  colleagues to shed light and ask questions and discuss the conflicts of  interest of Mr. Mueller and several others in the previous  administration.   As I recall the events of the past 2 years, it becomes clearer than  ever that Mr. Mueller should resign. If he does not resign, then he  should be fired.   I believe he has conflicts of interest that do not allow him to  proceed with his investigation in an unbiased, independent manner.  Further, he has broadened the scope of his investigation far beyond his  charge to examine Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential  election. In the process, he is helping to attack the integrity,  perception, and credibility of the American justice and electoral  system.   Mr. Speaker, my constituents want answers. Congress has sought  answers from the previous administration for many years. Without  exception, the Obama administration stonewalled these attempts.   Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation are the subject of many of  these questions and subsequent investigations.   Ms. Clinton did not become President. Some say that, because of this,  we should not complete our investigations into multiple allegations of  misconduct, but this is misguided.   No American is above the law. Losing an election does not grant  immunity for misconduct. Whether Ms. Clinton is Secretary of State,  President of the United States, or a citizen of Chappaqua, New York,  she should be held to the same standard as everyone else.   I am pleased that the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees share  this sentiment. Our committees will soon be launching a joint  investigation into the unanswered questions surrounding the allegations  that we have mentioned. We intend to get truthful answers to these  questions.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz).    I thank the gentleman from Florida and I appreciate his  remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for his  eloquent comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Meadows).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina for  his remarks, and I am grateful to have him here tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Franks).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for his  remarks. It is my pleasure now to yield to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for  his remarks, and I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas, my friend,  for his leadership on this issue. I appreciate his giving his remarks  tonight.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Yoho).    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman being here and  speaking tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B.  Hice), my good friend who has been waiting like patience on a monument.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Georgia.   Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I will do my best to sum up.   What you have heard tonight, those who have been listening, are the  outlines of the scandal of our lifetime--the scandal of our lifetime  that began in 2009 and proceeded forth even to revelations in the last  36 hours of Mr. Comey changing the wording in his draft from the  statutory culpable mental state requirement of gross negligence to  merely carelessness.   That is a huge change as he prepared his draft report on Mrs. Clinton  and the misuse of her email server giving access--which we don't even  know. We don't have access to that. But you take this back from the  Uranium One situation, the transaction that should never have happened,  the money that changed hands, and you look at the common thread  throughout.   Well, oddly enough, it is Robert Mueller. Robert Mueller sits today  as the investigator of the supposed collusion between the Trump  administration and the Russians to influence the election.   Oddly enough, it has turned on its head. We have found out now that  it is the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign that was funding Fusion  GPS, trying to influence the American electorate. It is upside down.   Yet the person who is tied throughout all of this is Robert Mueller.  He is the guy conducting the investigation. Is there any clearer  conflict of interest than what we see in this special investigator?   Again, with my colleagues--I thank all of them who have spoken  tonight--I renew my call for his resignation, short of that, his  termination of employment.   This is the scandal of our time. It affects our national security,  the views of the American people for justice, and our elections.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
