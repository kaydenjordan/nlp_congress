 Mr. Speaker, it is my joy today to be able to  introduce the newest voice of the Georgia delegation, Congresswoman  Karen Handel.   I have known Karen for many years. She is a self-made woman with a  very humble start, but a successful story. She and her husband, Steve,  have a track record of service that is above none other. She has fought  hard for the things that she believes in, much like us: balanced  budgets, better jobs, and defending innocent lives. I know she will  bring those same qualities that have made her such a great servant and  leader here to Congress today.   Now, if I know anything about Karen, she is going to hit the ground  running. So get ready.   I am also glad to be able to join with Congressman Lewis and to share  with you that Karen is making history tonight as being the first  Republican Congresswoman to serve in either the House or the Senate  from the State of Georgia. This is a proud moment for our State.   So, Karen, you are an inspiration. You are an inspiration to all the  young women throughout Georgia and throughout the country, including my  two daughters.   I am pleased to welcome and to introduce to you Georgia's newest  voice, a fighter for the State of Georgia, Congresswoman Karen Handel.
