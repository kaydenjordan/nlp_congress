 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to sound the alarm about our  military operations in Niger.   On October 4, four U.S. Army Special Operations Forces were  tragically killed on a mission in Niger. My deepest condolences to the  families of these fallen heroes.   This is a mission, Mr. Speaker, which Congress still knows nothing  about. And as recently as last week, Secretaries Tillerson and Mattis  testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on this  tragedy. But one question remains unanswered: Why were our  servicemembers in Niger?   It is outrageous that Congress has been left in the dark about these  operations. At a minimum, we should have some basic knowledge of the  missions we are asking servicemembers to risk their lives for.   Myself and others sent a bipartisan letter to the administration  demanding that President Trump seek authorization ahead of any future  military operations in Niger.   It is not just Niger. Speaker Ryan needs to stop blocking a debate  and vote on these ongoing wars. The people deserve answers.   What is the holdup, Mr. Speaker? What are you afraid of? Why don't  you want the American people to know?   Congress, yes, is missing in action. We owe it to our servicemembers  and our constituents to have a debate and a vote on these ongoing wars.  Congress needs to do its job.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, first let me thank Congressman Espaillat for  yielding and for his tremendous leadership and advocacy to ensure that  our communities have access to affordable housing, regardless of their  income, regardless of their background. I want to thank the  Congressional Progressive Caucus and him for leading this Special Order  tonight because it is so important that the public really understand  the issues that we are dealing with here in Washington, D.C., on behalf  of the American people.   Tonight, of course, we are calling on the Trump administration and  our colleagues across the aisle for greater investments in affordable  housing, including in public housing.   Affordable housing should be a basic right. No one should have to  choose between placing food on the table or paying their rent,  especially not in the wealthiest country on Earth. Sadly, right now,  our country is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis. Half of  all families in this country are forced to spend more than 30 percent  of their hard-earned income on housing.   Over 38 million families struggle to pay rent and put food on the  table every day because they pay more than one-third of their income on  housing. Right now there are only 12 counties in the entire country  where a minimum-wage worker is able to afford a modest two-bedroom  apartment.   Simply put, the housing crisis in America has reached epidemic  proportions. It is really a state of emergency. Nowhere is this  epidemic more evident than, for example, in my own district. The  average renter in Oakland, California, for example, would be forced to  spend a staggering 70 percent of their income on housing if they were  to move today--70 percent--and many are being forced out.   In Oakland, the number of homeless individuals increased by 25  percent this year to more than 2,700 people. In all of my county,  Alameda County, the homelessness population has increased by nearly 40  percent in the last 2 years to more than 5,600 people.   Now, these people have settled into encampments with all of their  furniture and belongings across the streets of cities in my district.  It is unconscionable and devastating that this un-American reality  persists across the country.   Yet, instead of working to address this crisis, Republicans have  slashed funding, mind you, for housing assistance programs to their  lowest level in 40 years. In the Republican fiscal year 2018 budget,  there are over $200 billion in cuts from programs that everyday  families depend on, like SNAP, agricultural subsidies, and housing  assistance.   What is worse, the Trump budget slashes the budget of the Department  of Housing and Urban Development by nearly 15 percent. The Secretary of  HUD, I guess, supports this, which is mind-boggling because he is  charged with developing housing strategies so that everyone can have  decent, affordable housing. To cut it by 15 percent makes no sense.   This endangers the livelihoods of millions of low-income seniors,  people with disabilities, families with children, veterans, low-wage  workers, families living with HIV and AIDS, which they all depend on  affordable housing programs.   Our Progressive Caucus colleagues and I are here tonight to say that,  really, enough is enough. We demand affordable housing for every person  in our Nation, regardless of who they are and where they live, and we  are not giving up.   Earlier this year, I introduced a renters' bill of rights. It is H.  Con. Res. 74, which affirms that all renters have the right to safe,  decent, and affordable housing. It calls for greater enforcement of  antidiscrimination laws that protect communities of color from  burdensome regulations. It calls on Congress to increase funding to  protect every American's right to livable and affordable housing.   So as a member of the Appropriations and Budget Committees, I am  committed to advancing the American Dream for all, and that is  affordable housing. People deserve to have a decent and safe place to  live to raise their families.   So to everyone across the country who worry about paying rent or  whether they can finally, at the end of the day, buy a home, I say:  Keep raising your voices and keep bringing what we call street heat to  defend your communities, because you have got allies in the  Congressional Progressive Caucus. You have got them in this House of  Representatives, especially Democrats. We are not going to give up  fighting for you.    I want to thank Congressman Espaillat for holding this Special Order  tonight because I think the public, given this crisis--and it is a  crisis, it is an epidemic, it is an emergency--people need to know we  are here fighting for them, and we are going to continue fighting until  everyone in America has a decent, safe, and affordable place to live.
