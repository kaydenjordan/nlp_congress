 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendments,  26 and 27, to H.R. 1. The Postal Service has been an essential service  for the American people for centuries, written into our Constitution.  And as we take steps to expand voting by mail, we must ensure that the  Postal Service is not weaponized to restrict its mission to promptly  and effectively deliver mail.   My first amendment would require the Postal Service to appoint an  election mail coordinator to assist election officials. My second  amendment would prohibit the Postal Service from enacting any new  operational change that would restrict the prompt delivery of mail  materials 4 months before the election; specifically, targeting removal  of the collection boxes and sorting boxes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support these amendments as part  of this en bloc.
