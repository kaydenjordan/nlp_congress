 Mr. Speaker, according to Proverbs, something that  people who are practicing Jews and Christians believe, it says that  there are seven things that are detestable to the Lord. They are:  ``Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, a heart  that devises wicked schemes, feet that are quick to rush into evil, a  false witness who pours out lies, and a person who stirs up conflict in  the community.''   It goes so far as to say, these are things the Lord hates. So the  word hate is not wrong in the Jewish and Christian tradition, but  anything beyond this is wrong. And, yes, there has been persecution of  Christians. There has been persecution of Muslims, but anybody who is  persecuting a people in the name of Christianity is not acting as a  Christian. That is not part of the faith.   But what makes this so dangerous--and the reason I will vote against  this resolution--is because we came here because of an anti-Semitic  remark. We came here to condemn anti-Semitism, but this resolution, as  changed up over the last hour, now condemns just about everything, and  the reason that is so dangerous is that anti-Semitism, hatred for the  children of Israel, is a very special kind of hatred that should never  be watered down.   There has never been a persecution of a people like the Jewish people  from 1933 to 1945. Over 6 million were killed. It started with little  things, hateful remarks made about the children of Israel that grew and  grew, and it was okay because it was made by somebody who had a grudge.  It was let go, and it built until it led to the death of 6 million  Jews. We have to say no.   We will not let it go on. That is why I will vote against it. It has  watered down the sentiment.
