 Mr. Speaker, I rise as co-chair of the bipartisan  Congressional Career and Technical Education Caucus to recognize  February as National CTE Month. Today, my good friend and caucus co- chair, Representative Thompson, and I introduced a resolution  supporting the goals and ideals of CTE Month.   This resolution is particularly important because many Americans  still hold an outdated view of CTE as a plan B. In fact, today it is  quite the opposite. The CTE programs are academic pathways that allow  students to explore careers in high demand, high-paying industries that  are relevant in today's society from healthcare to advanced  manufacturing to IT.   CTE Month is a time not only to celebrate the achievements of CTE  students, like the bright and motivated SkillsUSA students from Rhode  Island who visit my office each year, but to spread awareness of  today's CTE and its potential to help students and businesses succeed.   Mr. Speaker, society needs workers with these skills that are in  demand today, and I want to thank Representative Thompson for his  partnership and urge my colleagues to join us in supporting CTE  programs across the country.
