 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2020.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Congressional Black Caucus, led by  my friend, Chairwoman Karen Bass, New Jersey's great Senator Cory  Booker, and others for their work on this landmark legislation.   The need for serious structural reform cannot be clearer as our  country mourns the murder of George Floyd, just one of the most recent  instances of a long, painful history of violence and discrimination  against African American men and women in our country.   Right now we are witnessing an outpouring of support from all  communities, from all backgrounds, a collective movement working to end  bigotry and hatred, to advance racial equality, fighting the scourge of  racism that has held a grip on our country for far too long, and  affirming, yes, that indeed Black lives matter.    We should all be inspired by the overwhelmingly peaceful  demonstrations all across this country calling for justice, a freedom  which is a cornerstone of our Nation.   To make real change, we must continue to work together.   Mr. Speaker, I urge every one of my colleagues to join me in  supporting this important bill.
