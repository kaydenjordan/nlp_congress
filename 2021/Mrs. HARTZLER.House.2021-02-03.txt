 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. It  is an honor to work with him and to stand with him and some of the  colleagues for life--for the unborn.   Madam Speaker, today, I rise to remember 62\1/2\ million children who  have lost their lives at the hands of abortionists. It has been 48  years since the passage of Roe v. Wade, and our children continue to  suffer and die by the millions. It is unfathomable.   We know many of these children perished in the most horrendous and  brutal of ways. The pain must have been excruciating, yet we are still  failing to hear their cries. The single most-effective life-saving  protection to stopping the spread of this scourge is the Hyde  Amendment.   Over 2.4 million children are alive today because of Hyde's  protections, which prevents taxpayer dollars from going to pay directly  for abortions. We know the Hyde Amendment can't save every life, but it  can and it has saved many. Yet this limitation on Federal funds is the  number one target for many of my colleagues. Eliminating Hyde  protection will cause more child deaths, not less.   Madam Speaker, I also rise today to remember women like Keisha Marie  Atkins and Jamie Morales, who died as a result of the abortion  procedure. I also remember the women who mourn the loss of their  babies, who suffer physical, emotional, and spiritual trauma from their  abortions. I remember abortion-seeking women today who are offered  hopelessness and death and unsanitized, dirty, and subpar clinics when  they should be offered hope, prenatal care, and life for the baby  inside.   Today is a day of remembrance. So let us not forget the women and  children who have suffered and perished from abortion. Let us hear  their cry and silence them no more.
