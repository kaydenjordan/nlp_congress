 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment  to the Whistleblower Protection Improvement Act.   Historically, there has been a double standard between Federal and  corporate whistleblowers seeking reprieve for retaliatory actions taken  against them. While corporate whistleblowers can have their day in  court, Federal whistleblowers' cases fall only under the jurisdiction  of the Merit Systems Protection Board. The Whistleblower Protection  Improvement Act would remedy this by allowing certain Federal  whistleblowers to file their claims in district court.   My amendment would ensure that we continue to make evidence-based  improvements to the Federal whistleblower case review process by  requiring the GAO to study the outcomes of this bill. Specifically, my  amendment calls on the GAO to report on the timeliness of MSPB rulings  and the rates of Federal whistleblowers opting for district court  trials. It requires the GAO to offer recommendations for the MSPB to  make improvements to its review process so that Federal whistleblowers  who put their jobs, careers, and reputations on the line to call out  wrongdoing are given the respect of a timely review.   This bill is critical to improving protections for Federal  whistleblowers and enhancing accountability across the Federal  Government. My amendment would ensure that we collect the evidence  necessary to continue to make improvements.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendments en bloc.
