 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to voice my support for the  joint resolution. It is important for us in this institution, in this  critical moment, to undertake serious debate regarding the use of U.S.  military in the conflict in Yemen.   As my colleagues have pointed out, Article I of our Constitution  clearly states that the power to declare war belongs to the Congress.  Congress must put down a marker stating it is unacceptable for our  military to support hostilities we have not authorized.   Our support for the Saudi-led coalition's efforts in Yemen has proven  problematic in so many ways. The impact on civilian lives is real and  painful. Overall, 60,000 lives have been lost.   Ultimately, the question should be really simple: Did Congress  authorize our military to engage in hostilities in Yemen? The answer is  no.   So, today, we must pass this resolution to stand up for our  Constitution and stand up for what is right.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to lend their support to that  effort.
