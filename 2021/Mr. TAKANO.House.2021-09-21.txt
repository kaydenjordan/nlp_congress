 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan amendment, which  would prohibit the enforcement of forced arbitration clauses and  contracts covered by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, or SCRA.   Forced arbitration has undermined the rights of servicemembers for  years by forcing them to waive their ability to seek remedies through  the courts. This prohibition on forced arbitration clauses would  protect countless men and women wearing the uniform of our Nation from  predatory lenders while being deployed.   SCRA extends important financial protections to military service  personnel who are currently serving on active duty, and are often  targeted for exploitation. These protections can range from prohibiting  lenders from repossessing cars and foreclosing on homes while  servicemembers are actively deployed. I will repeat, while they are  actively deployed. This amendment will expand these protections to  remove a common tool used in this exploitation.   Those who serve in our military are inherently at a disadvantage  against aggressive lenders as the nature of their service makes it  difficult to seek fair resolve in any claims. While lenders are aware  of this unique circumstance, many seek to take full advantage of these  servicemembers. And this is a shame.   Our servicemembers protect us both at home and abroad, and it is time  we safeguard their rights against predatory lenders and others who  shamelessly seek to exploit members of our military.   So I am thankful to my colleagues for their leadership on this issue,  Mr. Cicilline, Mr. Golden, Mr. Reschenthaler, and Mr. Brown, and I urge  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of this  amendment, and I hope it stays in after conference.
