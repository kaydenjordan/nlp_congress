 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Colorado for her leadership.   For almost 50 years, a law called title X has ensured that women  across America, no matter their station in life, can receive expert  advice on how and when to plan their families, on contraceptives, and  also receive breast and cervical cancer screenings.   It is smart public policy. It often allows women to complete their  education and to get a job to become financially independent. It is  cost effective for all of us because it saves public money on prenatal,  maternity, and newborn care, and it has worked to decrease teenage and  unintended pregnancies.   In Florida, in 2014 alone, over 160,000 were counseled through  nonprofit agencies and community health centers, and over 38,000  unintended pregnancies were prevented, which helped prevent about  18,000 unintended births. That resulted in hundreds of millions of  dollars in cost savings. Plus, it is difficult to put a price tag on  the ability of someone to become self-sufficient and get a good start  in life.   Title X is critical for many of my neighbors in Florida, and it  should be protected. So it is sad to see my Republican colleagues  target working families and young women to restrict access to  contraceptives, family planning, and other health services. If  Republicans are successful, it would only harm our communities, and in  doing so, you are targeting the folks who need the help the most.   These politically motivated attacks on women's health are a  distraction from the real issues. Across the country, women, parents,  moms, and dads need greater economic and personal security, not less.  That is what Congress should be focused on.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this harmful resolution.
