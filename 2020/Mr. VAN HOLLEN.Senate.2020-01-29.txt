 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk to  the President's counsel and the House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Van Hollen's question is to both parties  and the House managers will go first:         What did National Security Advisor John Bolton mean when he       referenced ``whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are       cooking up on this'' and did he ever raise that issue in any       meeting with President Trump?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, when John Bolton-- and this is according to Dr. Hill's testimony--brought up the drug  deal, it was in the context of a July 10 meeting at the White House.  There were two meetings that day. There was a meeting that Ambassador  Bolton was present for, and then there was a follow-on meeting after  Ambassador Bolton abruptly ended the first meeting.   In the first meeting, the Ukrainians naturally wanted to raise the  topic of getting the White House meeting that President Zelensky so  desperately wanted.   And after raising the issue, at some point Ambassador Sondland said:  No, no, we have got a deal. They will get the meeting once they  announce the investigations.   And this is the point where Ambassador Bolton stiffened. You can look  up Dr. Hill's exact words. I am paraphrasing here. But this is the  point where Ambassador Bolton stiffens and he ends the meeting.   Hill then goes, follows Sondland and the delegation into another part  of the White House where the meeting continues between the American  delegation and Ukrainian delegation, and there it is even more  explicit, because in that second meeting, Sondland brings up the Bidens  specifically.   Hill then goes to talk to Bolton and informs him what has taken place  in the following meeting, and Bolton's response is: Go talk to the  lawyers, and let them know I don't want to be part of this drug deal  that Sondland and Mulvaney have got cooking up.   So at that point, that specific conversation is a reference to the  quid pro quo over the White House meeting. And we know, of course, from  other documents, the testimony about the quid pro quo, about the White  House meeting, and all the efforts by Giuliani to make sure that the  specific investigations aren't mentioned in order to make this happen.   But don't take my word for it. We can bring in John Bolton and ask  him exactly what he was referring to when he described the drug deal.   Now, did Bolton describe and discuss this drug deal with the  President? Well, it certainly appears from what we know about this  manuscript that they did talk about the freeze on aid.   And whether John Bolton understood and at what point he understood  that the drug deal was even bigger and more pernicious than he thought,  that it involved not just a meeting but involved the military aid,  there is one way to find out.   And I would add this in terms of Mr. Mulvaney--   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Schiff.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Maybe I will add it later.
