 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, the Nation finds itself in a grave situation. Our  government has shut down. Military men and women in Afghanistan, in  Iraq, and around the world are still risking their lives for our  country and are not being paid. Opioid treatment centers have had their  funds cut off. Children in States across America will start losing  their health insurance.   How did we get to this place?   The Nation assumes there must be a good reason. The House passed a  bill--a clean government funding bill with no strings attached and no  gimmicks because States are running out of money. We even included  funding for a bipartisan extension of the Children's Health Insurance  Program for 6 years without any offsets that our Democratic colleagues  have objected to in the past, the longest that CHIP has ever been  reauthorized for.  [[Page H592]]    So we passed that bill and it went to the Senate. We all know the  rules, but, Mr. Speaker, at times it sounds like some people need a  little greater knowledge of how the system works. It is incorrect to  claim otherwise.   Republicans may have majorities in both houses, but it takes 60 votes  in the Senate to move legislation. That means the Senate needs Democrat  votes to keep our government funded, but Senate Democrats said no, just  as more than 90 percent of those on the other side of the aisle in this  House did as well. Senate Democrats shut this government down. This is  a Schumer shutdown.   Once upon a time, Chuck Schumer called shutting the government down a  ``politics of idiocy.''   Senator Feinstein even said: ``Shutting down the government is a very  serious thing.''   You know what she said?   She said: ``People die. Accidents happen. You don't know. Necessary  functions can cease.''   So how did they change their minds? Why did they do it?   I would like to know, because nobody knows.   It wasn't the bill. The funding bill is clean.   It wasn't CHIP. The children's health insurance legislation we passed  came straight from the bipartisan deal in the Senate.   They say it is about immigration, about DACA. They are shutting down  the government, cutting off funds for our troops, cutting off funds to  opioid treatment centers, and cutting off health insurance for American  children over immigration, over something that has nothing to do with  this funding bill or with putting the American people first.   So I think that it is only reasonable that we ask: What exactly are  their demands? Why are they holding our government, our troops, and  American children hostage?   Why would you hold it hostage over DACA if the President brought the  House, the Senate, the Republicans, the Democrats together?   I was in that meeting.   Do you know who else was in that meeting?   The American public, because the President allowed the media to be  there.   Do you know what happened at the end of that meeting?   Based upon the President's leadership, he brought us together and we  all decided we would focus just on four ideas--DACA, border security,  chain migration, and the lottery--because we wanted to solve the  problem, but we didn't want to have to come back to it a few years from  now.   We took the President's lead.   Do you know what?   Every day we have been having those meetings.   Do you know how I know?   Because I am in those meetings and they are in my office.   Just a day before we shut down, the quote from those on the other  side of the aisle and even in the Senate was:         This is the most productive meeting we have had.    So why shut it down now? Why even shut down the meetings by shutting  down the government?   If they want something different than a bipartisan deal, if they want  to force one-sided immigration policy through Congress that the  American public doesn't want, then they should have the courage to say  it straight, have the courage to say that they are shutting down our  government to make the illegal immigration situation in this country  worse instead of making the hard choices to fix it.   Mr. Speaker, the American people don't want to see temper tantrums.  They don't want to see anyone stomping their feet demanding they get  their way. That is not just an embarrassment, it has profound  consequences for good people across this country.   Now, this House stands ready to pass another clean spending bill.  And, yes, Mr. Speaker, if this side of the aisle has to do it alone,  like we have done it in the past, we will.   We stand ready to keep our government open and pay our troops with no  strings attached, but we will not negotiate a bad deal for America,  especially not when Senate Democrats are holding our government  hostage.   This is too important. History is watching. History will not be kind  to those who put themselves above the American people.
