 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Raise the Age  Act.   This bill would protect the public by raising the minimum age to  purchase semiautomatic centerfire rifles to 21 years old. Currently,  the buyer only needs to be 18 years old, even though the minimum age to  purchase a handgun from a dealer with a Federal license is 21 years  old.   The Raise the Age Act would apply the 21-year-old minimum age  standard to buyers of semiautomatic centerfire rifles just as it  applies to buyers of handguns.   Imagine the agony that Alexandria Rubio's parents felt last May when  they learned that their 10-year-old daughter's life was cut short at  Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.   On that horrific day, 21 beautiful spirits were stolen from us: 19  precious young children and 2 beloved, dedicated teachers.   The halls of the grade school were forever robbed of their innocence  due to the gruesome actions committed by an 18-year-old who used a  semiautomatic weapon that he purchased shortly after his 18th birthday.    On May 14th, 2022, 53-year-old Andre Mackneil went to the Tops  grocery store in Buffalo, New York, to purchase a birthday cake for his  grandson. He never returned home for his grandson's birthday due to the  heinous acts of an 18-year-old mass shooter with an assault weapon.   That 18-year-old ended the lives of 10 innocent souls that day. Had a  21-year-old age requirement been in place, that 18-year-old shooter  would not have been able to legally purchase that firearm just a few  months earlier and the tragedy and trauma that occurred that day might  have been avoided.   Some of the most horrific and heartbreaking mass shootings in our  history were committed by 18-, 19-, and 20-year-olds using assault  weapons, including the massacres at Sandy Hook Elementary School in  Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012; at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School  in Parkland, Florida, in 2018; and at Columbine High School in Colorado  in 1999.   According to CNN, in November of 2022, up to that point, at least  3,179 people had been shot in mass shootings, resulting in 637 deaths  and more than 2,500 people wounded. Already in 2023, there have been  more than 170 mass shootings.   Some of my colleagues insist on choosing the Second Amendment over  second graders. They insist on banning books in schools instead of  banning assault weapons in schools. They talk about the weaponization  of our government, but they are silent when actual weapons are used to  lay waste to our schoolchildren.                                time  1030    Instead of supporting commonsense reforms to address our country's  gun epidemic, some Members offer bills that would make the problem even  worse, such as eliminating the ATF, the lead Federal law enforcement  agency that fights against gun violence.   Time and time again, our communities are devastated by these mass  killings. Some politicians send thoughts and prayers, but we should all  [[Page H1957]]  remember the wisdom in Paul's letter to James: ``Faith without works is  dead.'' This bill alone won't fix the problem of gun violence, but we  know that inaction will not stop the mass killings. The time for action  is long overdue.   That is why this bill is supported by many gun violence prevention  organizations, including the Giffords Law Center, which observes its  10th anniversary today, March for Our Lives, Newtown Action Alliance,  Community Justice Action Fund, and several others. Some major retail  chains like Walmart have even voluntarily raised the age from 18 to 21  to buy a firearm at their stores.   Raising the age to 21 also withstood judicial scrutiny recently. The  11th Circuit Court of Appeals recently upheld a similar law on the 21- year-old age requirement in Florida that was enacted shortly after the  2018 massacres in Parkland, Florida.   The Court determined that the act's restrictions on the sale of  firearms to 18- to 20-year-olds ``is consistent with the Nation's  historical tradition of firearm regulation.''   Raising the age to 21 to purchase these kinds of firearms is  reasonable and a crucial step, and I encourage all of my colleagues to  support this vital legislation.                            ____________________
