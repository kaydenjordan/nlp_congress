 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I rise today to offer an amendment to protect our Nation's  farmworkers.   This pandemic has shown that our farmworkers are absolutely  essential. They show up to work every day to keep our communities fed  and our Nation's food secure. But due to living and working conditions,  many are uniquely susceptible to this disease.   That is why we must dedicate immediate and robust funds to the USDA  to establish an emergency program that covers the cost of PPE and other  safety measures to protect our farmworkers.   And that is just the beginning. We need to provide our farmworkers  with proper pay, job security, methods for childcare, family leave, and  support for their families.   Our farmworkers deserve and require action from the Federal  Government to protect our food supply and our food security.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Lowey for yielding.   I rise today to offer an amendment to prohibit funds from being used  to open up new Federal lands to oil and gas drilling in my and my  neighboring district on the central coast of California. Based on  recent orders, this administration would use those Federal lands to  extract natural resources rather than explore their natural wonders.   In my district, our economy and well-being are intrinsically tied to  our environment. That is why we have taken critical steps to invest in  clean infrastructure rather than new leases for fossil fuels. That is  because we feel strongly that our public lands are not disposable and  should not be disrupted.   That is why I offered this amendment, and that is why I will continue  to fight to safeguard our Federal public lands.                                time  1615
