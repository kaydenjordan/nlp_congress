 Mr. President, due to unforeseen circumstances I  was unable to be present today for votes on amendment No. 5186 and 5187  to S. 3373, the Honoring our PACT Act, and to the underlying bill. I  offer this statement in the Record in support of all three.   Amendment No. 5186 to S. 3373, offered by my good friend from  Pennsylvania, Mr. Pat Toomey, closes an important budgetary loophole by  preventing $390 billion in baseline discretionary spending from being  reclassified as mandatory spending under the legislation. I support  this amendment, and I would encourage my colleagues to do the same.   Amendment No. 5185 to S. 3373, offered by my good friend from  Tennessee, Mrs. Marsha Blackburn, would expand care under the Veterans  Community Care Program to include toxic-exposed veterans. This expanded  care program is essential to ensure that toxic-exposed veterans receive  the full range of support that they need. I would encourage my  colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.   Finally, S. 3373, the Honoring our PACT Act, creates a presumption  that veterans who suffer from certain health conditions, and who were  exposed to toxic substances as part of their military service, are  eligible to receive Veterans Administration healthcare. This important  bill will provide much-needed care to our veterans, including  lifesaving early detection and treatment of certain illnesses. I  support the passage of the PACT Act.                            ____________________
