 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Lamborn for holding  this Special Order.   As I was listening to him, I was reminded of the Museum of the Bible  that we all went to 4 years ago when it opened up. I asked one of the  leaders there: What is the theme of the Museum of the Bible? What is  the overriding thing that you want the Museum of the Bible to ascend  to?   I will never forget his words. He said, Read the Bible. He said, It  does not need any guardian; it does not need any interpretation. Read  the Bible. It will change your life. That is what I have found to be  true and what is so needed today in America.   Madam Speaker, it is such an honor to come before you today to  celebrate National Bible Week. What better place to celebrate the Bible  than in what is called the people's House but what is ultimately God's  house.   As has been said, in 1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued  a national proclamation to celebrate the impact of the Bible on our  Nation. The Bible has been a light for so many and a source of hope in  the darkest of times, and its influence on this Nation is unmistakable.   In this Chamber, Moses, the messenger of the Ten Commandments and  witness of God in all of His glory upon the mountaintop, watches over  this body from above the gallery doors each time we gather to conduct  business.   However, it is not merely the multitudes of honorary monuments and  portraits of Biblical figures and passages that exemplify the  importance of Scripture to all Americans, but it is the impressions of  our social fabric, so evident in our actions, which speaks volumes.   This Nation was founded upon Judeo-Christian principles. A stroll  past any of the extraordinary monuments here in Washington, D.C., makes  that abundantly clear. Our commitment to the principles enshrined in  the written Word has sustained us throughout our rich history during  the highest of times and during the lowest of times. The profound  impact of the Bible, and particularly the Gospels, changed my life and  continues to guide me as a public servant today.   I believe that if we continue to turn to God in all of what we do and  love each other as God loves us, our best is yet to come. If we fail to  do so, the worst is yet to come.   Despite our political differences and well-known imperfections, God  never fails us. An annual celebration of His Word and unending love is  the perfect reminder for us to unite with the common goal of humbly  serving our Creator and encouraging this Nation to do the same.                                time  2015
