 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Bill Gaertner for  receiving the distinguished St. Dismas Award for his work through the  Gatekeepers Re-Entry Program in Hagerstown, Maryland.   Gatekeepers is a program that addresses one of the top needs in our  criminal justice system: support for returning citizens.   Today, 90 percent of incarcerated people get released into their own  communities, but many struggle to find the resources and support to  thrive.   A returning citizen himself, Bill was 70 years old when he was  released from prison. He started the Gatekeepers organization when he  realized the challenges those released from prison face as they reenter  society.   Gatekeepers aims to provide a connection to resources so folks could  be successful as they transition back into their communities.   We should all be working toward a more just criminal justice system.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Bill Gaertner on this much-deserved award  for his work to support justice-impacted communities.                            ____________________
