 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend the work  of Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and Foreign Affairs Committee  Ranking Member  Mike McCaul for their hard work on the China Task  Force.   After months of meetings and investigations, the task force released  82 key findings and 430 associated recommendations. That number of  recommendations demonstrates the important work that we have to do as a  Congress to address China's refusal to play by the rules as a global  power.   What was most disappointing, Madam Speaker, was that Speaker Pelosi  refused to participate in this effort.   Many of the recommendations, and legislation linked with the  recommendations, are bipartisan. I have heard it directly from my  Democratic colleagues with concerns about China's actions in a variety  of areas, from human rights, intellectual property theft, and military  incursions in the South and East China Seas, just to name a few.   Tackling China as an issue should be a bipartisan one, and I hope my  Democratic colleagues will come to the table in the coming months to  collaborate with Republicans on the proper strategy to counter China's  decision to threaten the global system.                            ____________________
