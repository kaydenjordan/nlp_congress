 Mr. President, I sat here and listened with interest to  the majority leader's comments about this strategy of obstruction and  slow walking the President's Cabinet. I share his frustration. More  than that, on behalf of the people we were sent here to represent--the  American people--I regret that petty politics has gotten in the way of  the ability of our colleagues across the aisle to get over the fact  that the election didn't turn out quite the way they hoped and to get  back to work on behalf of the American people.   This week we will continue to grind our way through consideration of  President Trump's nominees, despite the best efforts of our friends  across the aisle to obstruct and to slow walk. Because of their  insistence on taking advantage of every possible procedural delay, they  have tried to grind the Senate to a near halt, but we have overcome  that obstruction. We came together early Friday morning and voted to  move forward with the President's nominee for Education Secretary-- about 6:30 in the morning. It was a little earlier than we usually  convene, but I am glad we were able to get it done.   I am confident that we will get Mrs. DeVos confirmed soon. Then,  thanks to former Democratic leader Harry Reid, the Democrats know they  cannot block these nominees from taking office. Because of the so- called nuclear option, they reduced the voting threshold from 60 to 51,  meaning that, with 52 Republicans and, hopefully, with a little help  from some of our friends across the aisle, every single one of  President Trump's Cabinet nominees will be confirmed. We can take that  to the bank.   All they can do, which is all they have done up to this point, is to  slow the process down for no reason other than the fact that they can.  Again, thanks to Senator Reid, all of the President's nominees will be  confirmed. This type of behavior is really pretty juvenile, if you ask  me, and it can't actually accomplish anything. It is a strategy in  search of a goal. They don't have any particular goal in mind, because  at the end of the day, the President will get the Cabinet that he has  nominated and deserves.   After the vote tomorrow on Mrs. DeVos for Cabinet Secretary of  Education, we will vote to confirm Senator Sessions, our longstanding  colleague, as Attorney General. In addition to him and the Education  Secretary, we have the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the  Secretary of Treasury, too. These, of course, are key positions in the  new administration.   Now, 18 days after President Trump's inauguration, he still doesn't  have the help he needs in these critical posts. I believe this kind of  mindless obstruction is actually irresponsible, if not downright  dangerous. I know our Democratic colleagues said they confirmed General  Mattis, the Secretary of Defense, and later on the Director of the CIA  and, yes, they finally confirmed the Secretary of State. But the  Attorney General is part of the national security Cabinet. They run a  lot of the counterterrorism efforts for the Department of Justice.  [[Page S702]]    This is not only irresponsible, but this is, I believe, dangerous. It  should also be an embarrassment. The American people expect their  Senators and Congress to do our jobs and fulfill the duties to those  who we represent. If our Democratic colleagues don't want to support  one of the very well-qualified nominees of the President, that is fine.  That is their right, but don't slow walk and slow down the institution  of the Senate just to score some political points or to feed some of  the irrational rage that you see depicted in some quarters.   Dragging this out doesn't do any good. It won't change the outcome,  and it ill serves the American people. Let's get these nominations done  so they can be sworn in and begin their service to this new  administration and, more importantly, to the American people.   In addition to our work on nominations, last week the Senate started  to consider a number of measures to block a host of regulations put in  place by the Obama administration during the last 6 months that  President Obama was in office. Under President Obama, our country  witnessed a volcanic profusion of rules and regulations that empowered  unelected bureaucrats and shut out the voices of the elected  representatives of the people.   The result? Job creators have less freedom to operate and innovate  and are instead suffocated by more and more redtape and compliance  costs. That translates into a slower growing economy, which means less  jobs and which means the American people are the ones who get hurt,  directly as a result of this profusion of redtape and regulation.   According to recent reports, the 600-plus regulations issued by the  Obama White House came with a $700 billion pricetag for our economy.  Our economy is not even growing at 2 percent. I think this  overregulation is largely responsible because this profusion of  regulations hit businesses both big--they can absorb some matter of the  costs--but also small businesses, including local community banks that  are going out of business on a daily basis because they simply can't  afford to compete and to pay for the countless lawyers to comply with  all of the redtape and the mindless regulation from the previous  administration. It is not just financial services. It is health care,  it is agriculture, and it is all sectors of the economy.   I am grateful that President Trump has made it clear where he stands  on all of this, and he has already issued guidance requiring the  government to cut regulations should it want to add more: Cut two  regulations for every one you want to add. With President Trump in the  White House, Congress can reverse many of the Obama regulations. That  gives the American people and our anemic economic growth some relief.   Through the Congressional Review Act, Congress can review and  ultimately block recent regulations handed down by the Federal  Government. That is what we did last week, and that is what we are  going to continue to do. We can roll back many of the Obama  administration rules that are killing jobs and stifling economic  growth.   At the end of last week, we repealed the rule called the stream  buffer rule, which actually didn't have anything to do with streams. It  was a job-killing regulation that was more about stifling domestic  energy production, and I am glad we did away with it.   On Friday, Congress passed another resolution--one I was happy to  cosponsor. That was aimed at chipping away the regulatory burdens for  our community banks and other financial services organizations brought  on by Dodd-Frank.   I am all for transparency, but I am against laws that give advantages  to foreign companies over our own. This Securities and Exchange  Commission rule would have done that by forcing American companies to  disclose confidential information that their foreign competitors can  keep under wraps. It should go without saying that each of us want a  level playing field for our businesses, which help to create jobs and  grow the economy. That is why we blocked this rule.   Of course, this and other resolutions are the first few steps in a  broader strategy to kill overbearing regulations so that our innovators  and our entrepreneurs aren't suffocated by unnecessary paperwork and  bureaucracy. That is part of what the American people sent us here to  do. Certainly, the verdict they rendered on November 8 is that they did  not want a continuation of the status quo under the previous  administration. They wanted change. It is integral to restoring our  economy--the kind of change we are bringing about to restoring our  economy and helping it grow for everyone.   I look forward to working with the White House and with our  colleagues as we continue to find new ways to build up the American  economy.   Mr. President, if I can just close on one last topic. I see some  colleagues here wishing to speak. Tomorrow we will vote on the  nomination of Betsy Devos to the Department of Education. The Federal  Government, through the Department of Education, funds about 10 percent  of public education, because most of that comes from our States; that  is, the funding and the regulation of education from kindergarten  through the 12th grade. What this fight over this well-qualified  nominee is all about is power--as so many of these fights in  Washington, DC, are about--and the desire to keep power over public  education in all of our States and all across the country right here  inside the beltway.   I believe President Trump chose wisely, not because he chose another  education bureaucrat who knows all the acronyms and knows the arcanum  known to people who have been brought up within that establishment.  Instead, he chose an outsider, someone much like himself but someone  more interested in results, rather than paying homage to and feeding  the education establishment here in Washington, DC, and retaining the  power over the important decisions that should be handed back down to  the States, down to teachers, parents, and students, as they choose how  best to get to accomplish our universal goal of making sure every child  has a good education.   This fight isn't about the quality of education in our country. This  fight, for those who are opposing Mrs. DeVos, is largely about whether  we should retain power here in Washington, DC, so that Washington can  continue to dictate to the States, parents, and teachers what policies  they need to apply in our K-12 education system or whether we are going  to return that power back where it should be--back into the hands of  parents, teachers, and local school districts.   That is what this fight is all about. That is why I am glad that  tomorrow we will confirm Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education. Listen  to what the American people told us on November 8 when they said they  didn't want to maintain the status quo because the status quo is not  working for them, it is not working for our economy, and, certainly, it  is not working for our children, each of whom deserves a good  education.   Yes, Mrs. DeVos will shake things up a little bit but, more  importantly, she is going to be part of this effort to return power to  parents and teachers and to our local school districts. That is what  this vote will be about tomorrow.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.

The language that resulted in the vote that we had invoking rule  XIX was related to a quotation from Senator Ted Kennedy that called the  nominee ``a disgrace to the Justice Department, and he should withdraw  his nomination and resign his position.'' That was the quote. Our  colleagues want to try to make this all about Coretta Scott King and it  is not. I think the complete context should be part of the Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the  prayer, the Senator from Nevada be recognized for such time as he shall  consume, and then I be recognized.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                                   prayer    Pursuant to rule IV, paragraph 2, the hour of 12 noon having arrived,  the Senate having been in continuous session since Monday, the Senate  will suspend for a prayer by the Senate Chaplain.   The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:   Let us pray.   Eternal Lord God, teach us this day, through all our employments, to  see You working for the good of those who love You.   Strengthen the hearts of our lawmakers against temptations and make  them more than conquerors in Your love. Lord, deliver them from all  dejection of spirit and free their hearts to give You zealous, active,  and cheerful service. May they vigorously perform whatever You command,  thankfully enduring whatever You have chosen for them to suffer. Guard  their desires so that they will not deviate from the path of integrity.   Lord, strengthen them with Your almighty arms to do Your will on  Earth, even as it is done in Heaven.   We pray in Your mighty Name. Amen.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The Senator from Nevada.    Madam President, last night we all witnessed a rather  extraordinary event. Certainly for the first time in my time in the  Senate, we saw rule XIX of the Standing Senate Rules invoked. That rule  says: ``No Senator in debate shall, directly or indirectly, by any form  of words impute to another Senator or to other Senators any conduct or  motive unworthy or unbecoming a Senator.''   I certainly agree with the ruling of the Chair and the decision of  the Senate as a body that that line was crossed last night. A Senator  can't evade that rule by somehow claiming: These weren't my words; I  was reading what somebody else said.   Specifically, in the case of our former colleague, now deceased,  Senator Ted Kennedy claimed that the nominee for Attorney General was  somehow a disgrace to the Justice Department and ought to resign. That  certainly crossed that line.   Our colleagues want to point to a letter written by Coretta Scott  King. That was part but not the whole of the speech given by the  Senator from Massachusetts. I hope that maybe we have all been  chastened a little bit, and maybe we have all learned a little bit of a  lesson here.   I yearn for the day when the Senate and, frankly, the country as a  whole would pull back from the abyss of recrimination, personal  attacks, and we would get back to doing what this institution was  designed to do--which is to be a great body for deliberation and  debate--and we would treat each other with the civility with which we  would all want to be treated.   We are at a pretty challenging time in our Nation's history, when  many people who were surprised and disappointed at the last election  are unwilling to accept the results of that election and the verdict of  the American people. I can only hope that, after the passage of some  time, they will return to their senses, and they will agree that no one  is well served by this race to the bottom in terms of decorum and in  terms of rhetoric, in terms of how we treat one another. The American  people are better served when we treat each other with civility and  respect and when we don't make personal attacks against Senators  because of the positions that they take.   This debate over the nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions has taken on  some rather unusual twists and turns. I want to comment briefly on some  of the remarks made by our colleague from Minnesota about voting rights  because I think this is exemplary of the way that Senator Sessions'  record on voting rights has been misrepresented.   We all know that in 2006--those of us who were here in the Senate,  including Senator Sessions, including the Democratic whip and myself-- we all voted to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act. That included  section 2 and section 5, which was later struck down. Section 2 is the  provision of the Voting Rights Act that applies to the entire Nation,  and it authorizes a lawsuit to vindicate voting rights that are  jeopardized by some illegal practice. Section 5, which was the subject  of the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Shelby County case  that was decided in 2013--that was directed not at section 2, which  applies to the entire Nation, but to section 5, which applied only to a  handful of jurisdictions around the country. It was based on voting  practices that existed in the middle 1960s.   I would be the first to admit that the record of vindicating the  rights of minority voters in 1965 was nothing to be proud of. We have  come a long way in this country, and it has been because of the Voting  Rights Act. It has been because of our collective commitment to the  right of every citizen to vote that I believe those statistics which  existed in the mid-sixties are no longer valid today.   In fact, if you look at many of the jurisdictions covered in the  1960s, including places like Alabama, where Senator Sessions is from,  they have records of minority voting that are superior to jurisdictions  that are not covered by section 5. How our colleagues across the aisle  can somehow condemn Senator Sessions for the Supreme Court's decision  in the Shelby County case, when he voted for the reauthorization of the  entire Voting Rights Act, section 2 and section 5, strikes me as  extremely misleading and unfortunate, but it does seem to characterize  the nature of the debate about this nominee.    During his confirmation hearing, I said: Well, those who don't know  Senator Sessions are interested to learn his record and his resume, but  those of us who worked with him--we don't need to read his resume. We  don't need to hear a recitation of his record. We know the man. We know  what is in his heart. And he is a thoroughly decent and honorable  Member of the Senate, and he will do an outstanding job, I believe,  restoring the reputation of the Department of Justice, as one dedicated  to the rule of law above all else.   There is always a risk--and this happens in Democratic  administrations, as well as Republican administrations--when the  Attorney General feels like they are an arm of the White House. That is  not the job of the Attorney General. The President has a lawyer, White  House Counsel. The Attorney General is supposed to have some measure of  independence even though he or she is appointed by the President and  serves at the President's pleasure.   That is why we ask questions of people, like Deputy Attorney General  Sally Yates: Can you tell the President no? Well, she said she could.  And then ultimately, unfortunately, in the case of the Executive order  that was issued by President Trump later on, said--even though this  order was vetted by the Office of Legal Counsel and determined that  this was a legal Executive order both in content and in form, she said:  I still disagree with the President's Executive order, and I am going  to order the Justice Department lawyers not to defend it.   Well, that is the kind of politics that we need none of in the  Department of Justice. We have plenty of politicians in this country.  We have plenty of politicians in the Congress and in the White House.  We don't need another  [[Page S923]]  politician as Attorney General. In fact, we need a nonpolitician, an  apolitician, somebody who believes that their allegiance to the rule of  law, irrespective of who is involved, whether it is the President of  the United States or the least among us--that is what the rule of law  is all about. And that is one reason why I feel so strongly that  Senator Sessions will be an outstanding Attorney General, because I  believe he will restore the Department of Justice to an institution  that believes in and enforces the rule of law above politics, and that  is a fundamentally important thing to do.   We know Senator Sessions, as I said earlier, brings a lifetime of  relevant experience to this job: former Federal prosecutor, former U.S.  attorney for the Department of Justice. He said those were some of the  best years of his life.   I once had a colleague who now serves on the Fifth Circuit. When he  became a U.S. district judge in San Antonio, he was recalling his days  as U.S. attorney. He said--I still remember this after all these many  years--he said he never had a prouder moment in his life than when he  appeared in court and he said: ``I am here and I am ready on behalf of  the United States of America.''   Senator Sessions is here, and he is ready to serve the American  people as Attorney General. And we know from his service at the  Department of Justice, as attorney general of Alabama, and now for the  past 20 years in the Senate, that he is devoted to the rule of law and  keeping our country safe. So it has really been sad to see interest  groups vilifying him over and over again or people mischaracterizing  him, as they have on his voting rights record, things that he is not  responsible for after voting to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act in  2006. He didn't decide the Shelby County case.   This is a man we have worked with for--some for 20 years, people who  have been here that long with him, and we know Jeff Sessions to be a  man who has dedicated his life to public service. Our colleagues across  the aisle have offered him an occasional compliment, like the  Democratic leader, who once called him straightforward and fair. The  assistant Democratic leader called him a man of his word. But now the  decision to drag out Cabinet nominations as long as possible and to  waste valuable time that could be used on other bipartisan  legislation--we know our Democratic colleagues have chosen to slow-walk  the process, and I think it is a shame, particularly in the case of  somebody whom we all know so well and who is dedicated to the  Department of Justice and the restoration of the rule of law.   Several of us have talked from time to time about how the holding up  of these nominees is unprecedented. At this point in President Obama's  term, 21 Cabinet members were confirmed. Senator Sessions, when we vote  on his nomination tonight, will be No. 8--21 to 8. You have to go back  to George Washington to find a slower confirmation timeline for a new  administration. There is no good excuse for it, particularly in light  of the fact that now, under the Reid precedent, our colleagues across  the aisle know that all of these nominees, particularly in the case of  Senator Sessions, will be confirmed. So holding up the nomination just  for delay alone makes no sense at all.   Well, some have said holding up Senator Sessions' nomination is  somehow similar to the confirmation process for Loretta Lynch, but that  really rings hollow on examination. Let me remind them what happened  when Loretta Lynch was nominated as Attorney General. At the time, our  Democratic friends were filibustering a bipartisan bill that later  passed 99 to 0. They were filibustering a bipartisan anti-trafficking  bill for no good reason. That is my view; they may think they had a  good reason. I think actually what it had to do with was the Hyde  amendment and the longstanding limitation on the use of taxpayer funds  for abortion that had gone back to roughly 1976. They wanted to  eliminate that restriction in this anti-trafficking bill, so they  refused to consider that legislation, which many of them had  cosponsored, to help thousands of victims of sexual exploitation,  slavery, and human trafficking find a path to healing and restoration.  So the majority leader, in an action that I completely endorsed, simply  said that as soon as they dropped the filibuster, we would move on with  the Loretta Lynch nomination. They did finally, and we processed her  nomination. So in no way were those two situations similar.   Today, our colleagues across the aisle want to keep a new President  from surrounding himself with the men and women he has selected to help  run the country. I think if there is one thing that should give people  more confidence in the new administration, it is the quality of the men  and women he has chosen for his Cabinet, and I would add Vice President  Pence, somebody we know here, having served 12 years in the House of  Representatives.   So the delay is really for no good reason at all and will have no  achievable results. They are not going to be able to block the  nomination but, rather, just try to score political points. And  preventing an exemplary nominee from filling an important national  security position I believe makes our country less safe.   I will give our colleagues across the aisle some credit for allowing  the confirmation of Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Gen. John  Kelly at the Department of Homeland Security and finally, after a long  weekend, Mike Pompeo as Director of the CIA. Those are essential  components of the President's national security Cabinet, but it also  includes the Attorney General of the United States, someone whose  nomination has been delayed until we vote on him tonight. After 9/11,  the Attorney General became more than just a law enforcement officer;  he became a counterterrorism official as well, integrally tied, with  supervision of the FBI, to our efforts to protect the American people  from terrorists who would kill us or our allies.   So there is really no good excuse for delaying the confirmation of  Senator Sessions, and I am confident that tonight we will finally do  what we should have done at least 3 weeks ago--confirm Senator Sessions  as the next Attorney General of the United States. And I believe it is  past time that we do so.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
