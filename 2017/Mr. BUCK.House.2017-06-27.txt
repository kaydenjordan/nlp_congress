Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis), my  friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the  underlying legislation.   House Resolution 382 will ultimately drive down healthcare costs and  make care more affordable to millions of Americans across the country.   In 2017, we have had a conversation in America about how health  insurance costs have drastically increased in the past 7 years. We need  to fix our health insurance market, a task that House Members and  Senators have been working hard on for the past few months, but if we  are truly going to address out-of-control health insurance costs, we  need to start looking at the cost of supplying care itself. That is  where H.R. 1215, the Protecting Access to Care Act of 2017, plays a  vital role. H.R. 1215 focuses on lowering the cost of care by placing  checks and balances on the excessive and frivolous lawsuits faced by  doctors and other healthcare providers.   A GAO report found that rising litigation awards are responsible for  skyrocketing medical professional liability premiums. Unfortunately,  these premium costs are passed on to the patient and, in many cases,  are passed on to American taxpayers. The reforms in H.R. 1215 will make  care more affordable for patients and will improve access to care,  especially for rural America.   Over time, unending and excessive lawsuits have limited the amount of  doctors nationwide, particularly in States that have not instituted  their own reforms. With a string of frivolous lawsuits levied against  our medical community, many Americans who would become doctors and  practice in certain parts of the Nation simply decided against it.   The reforms in H.R. 1215 will especially help rural and underserved  urban communities, where quality healthcare can be difficult to access.  Incentivizing medical professionals to serve in communities that might  otherwise be overlooked should be one goal of our healthcare reform  efforts.   I know the healthcare challenges faced by so many in eastern  Colorado, where access to quality care is sometimes limited. We need  doctors who are willing to invest in these communities, but we need to  empower these doctors by freeing them of frivolous and excessive  lawsuits.   Beyond just access to care, the growth of frivolous malpractice  lawsuits has led to a change in the way care is provided. Many  providers are forced to practice defensive medicine. In doing so,  doctors order unnecessary, excessive diagnostics not because the  patient needs them, but because the doctor attempts to avoid a  frivolous lawsuit. The practice of defensive medicine increases costs  for the patient without providing any discernible benefit.   The legislation we are considering is key to increasing the  affordability of care and the access to care for all Americans.   This bill is supported by the American Hospital Association and the  American Academy of Family Physicians. The American Medical Association  has also voiced their support.   But let me be clear: The bill before the House today does not limit  access to justice for legitimately wronged or injured patients. It does  not hamper a wronged patient from recovering damages for their  injuries.   The bill simply imposes a $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages, a  provision that has worked well in California, where this legislation  has already been successfully implemented and modeled for decades. But  there is no cap on economic damages that a patient may incur in a  malpractice situation, and the bill's cap does not preempt any State  law that otherwise caps any form of damages at amounts either higher or  lower than the cap in H.R. 1215.   The legislation also limits the contingency fees that lawyers can  charge when bringing a malpractice case on behalf of a client. In other  words, we don't want to incentivize lawyers to push forward with  illegitimate cases. We want patients who have been wronged to have  access to a fair trial, where they walk home with the winnings in their  own pocket, not their lawyer's.   H.R. 1215 builds on the successes of medical malpractice reforms in  States like California and Texas. In these States, similar laws have  increased access to affordable medical care. They have created an  environment where doctors can focus on helping patients rather than  spending time in endless litigation and dealing with threats from the  trial bar.   The legislation before us, while creating a uniform national playing  field, protects State laws by allowing flexible reforms to be used at  the discretion of States. State courts will still hear medical lawsuits  as always.   The reforms at hand today deal with care that was provided or  subsidized by the Federal Government, including through a tax benefit.  [[Page H5194]]    We must pass this legislation for the American taxpayer. The taxpayer  doesn't deserve to have their hard-earned dollars simply end up in the  pockets of trial lawyers due to frivolous lawsuits. That is why H.R.  1215 is a critically needed reform.   Unlimited and opportunistic lawsuits help no one except trial  lawyers. Consequently, our doctors have to increase their costs and  practice expensive defensive medicine, costing patients and taxpayers.  And when our physicians are impacted, so are we.   Trial lawyers too often stand between patients and their doctors.  With the looming threat of excessive, unending lawsuits, healthcare  providers have to worry more about the trial lawyer at their door than  the patient in their office. H.R. 1215 places important limits on these  lawsuits so that the truly wronged are compensated without enriching  trial lawyers at the same time.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Proudly, no.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I know my friend from Colorado did not mean to insult me  when he referred to me as a lawyer, but I want to make a quick  distinction.   I spent 25 years as a prosecutor, not a lawyer. Prosecutors put  people in prison and make the world safe for all of us; lawyers get  people out of prison and make the world less safe for all of us. I want  to make that distinction.    I yield to the gentleman from Colorado.    Reclaiming my time, do not tell prosecutors that they are  merely lawyers. To be a prosecutor is a higher standard.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr.  Marshall).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to make one point.   I have heard a number of times now that this bill is a solution  searching for a problem or it does nothing to help our underlying cost.   The Congressional Budget Office, the very office that my friend  relies on for the most recent estimate of those that will decide not to  seek insurance under the Senate healthcare bill, has estimated that  this bill will save taxpayers $50 billion over 10 years and reduce  medical malpractice insurance premiums by 25 percent to 30 percent.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I will remind my friend from Colorado that the  very $250,000 cap that we are talking about in this bill is the same  cap that has been adopted by the Colorado State Legislature.    Mr. Speaker, I would remind my friend again that the States  that have adopted any cap--it could be $250,000, it could be $500,000,  it could be $1 million in non-economic damage caps--will not be  affected by this bill. This bill only affects those States that have no  caps, and it is Federal money that is being used to pay for these.    Mr. Speaker, I want to inquire of my friend from Colorado,  he mentioned when he was introducing the gentleman from Virginia that  there are schools that are closing because gym roofs are falling in. I  know a number of very generous individuals that would like to  contribute.   Does the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis) have the names of any of  those schools for us?   I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend's newfound sense of  bipartisanship. The Affordable Care Act was passed without a single  Republican vote in the House, without a single Republican vote in the  Senate, and without any concern of Republican thoughts about how  healthcare should be run in this country. Now that the Affordable Care  Act is, in fact, failing; now that we have over 90 counties in America  that have zero health insurers to choose from in the individual market;  and now that we see the Affordable Care Act in a death spiral, all of a  sudden, we are concerned about the bipartisanship and how to fix the  problem.   We have heard zero amendments in the past 6 years to the Affordable  Care Act that would have, in fact, improved the Affordable Care Act  from the other side of the aisle while they had the President in the  White House, and now, all of a sudden, we are looking for  bipartisanship and solutions. We will find that bipartisanship and  those solutions in the future.   Mr. Speaker, if we truly want affordable healthcare in this country,  then we need to address the cost of supplying care. H.R. 1215 strikes  at the heart of skyrocketing medical care. By limiting frivolous and  unending lawsuits, doctors can focus less on the courtroom and more on  the patient in the operating room.   The reforms made by H.R. 1215 will be especially important for rural  America and underserved urban America. Doctors will be able to afford  to live and practice in these communities, providing the attentive and  responsive care that all Americans deserve, not just Americans who live  a few miles from a major hospital.   I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  legislation. I know Democrats and Republicans have different policy  approaches to reforming our healthcare system, but this legislation has  already been implemented by Democrats in the State of California, where  it has proven successful. Now we have the chance to apply this approach  more broadly, in a way that will help millions of Americans. This  effort has been bipartisan in the past and should be bipartisan today.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsor of this bill, Representative Steve  King.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the resolution, and I urge a  ``yes'' vote on the underlying bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
