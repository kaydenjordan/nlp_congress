 Madam Speaker, I rise today on the 18th anniversary of the  September 11 terrorist attack to honor the nearly 3,000 individuals,  brave men and women who lost their lives. Most Americans remember where  they were during that day. There have been few times in our Nation's  history that we have faced such an atrocity. And the effects are still  being felt today.   But instead of shrinking in the shadow of such adversity, we rose to  the challenge and came together to help one another. We became a Nation  of one. But it also has changed our Nation and the world that we live  in today forever, the way we work, the way we view our security.   This past July, I was pleased that the House and Senate with the  President came together to reauthorize the 9/11 Victim's Compensation  Fund for police and firefighters, first responders who answered the  call after the attack in New York and Washington, D.C. These heroic men  and women deserve all the help we can give them, and we must never  forget September 11, 2001. We must remember 18 years ago today when we  were all one as Americans. We need that more today than ever before.                            Honoring David Huerta     Madam Speaker, in my home State in the San Joaquin Valley  we recently lost a wonderful individual, a leader who I would like to  honor today, Fresno State Police Chief David Huerta. David was loved by  all. He passed away in mid-August after serving honorably in that  position for 15 years.   A lifelong resident of Fresno County, Chief Huerta dedicated his life  to serving his community by teaching and providing public safety as a  police officer. During his career he was recognized as Officer of the  Year. And Fresno State President Joseph Castro said David served with  integrity, even in the most challenging of situations.   David will be greatly missed by his wife Cynthia, his four children  and three grandchildren. It is with great respect that I ask my  colleagues today to join in honoring Police Chief David Huerta.        Recognizing California State University, Fresno and UC Merced     Madam Speaker, I would like to take this moment to  recognize the recent achievements of two outstanding universities in my  district, California State University, Fresno and UC Merced University  of California.   According to the U.S. News and World Report's 2020 Best College  rankings, Fresno State University, my alma mater, ranked number three  in graduation rate performance for public universities.   UC Merced made the biggest leap of all on the college list. They  ranked number one in the Nation for student outcomes, including number  one in outperforming expected graduation rates.   Both of these universities currently have over 70 percent of their  student body who are the first in their family ever to attend a  university. These universities are doing what a higher education should  be doing for all Americans. Go Bulldogs. Go Bobcats.                     Congress Must Act on Gun Legislation     Madam Speaker, I would like to rise to urge Senate  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to keep his word and act on gun safety  legislation.   Every day it seems that there is coverage of another shooting on the  news. Americans are just frustrated. Since Congress has begun their  district work period in July there have been four high-profile  shootings in this country. Those shootings resulted in the death of 51  Americans and over 90 that were injured. The threat to public safety  today is simply unacceptable in our country.   In February, the House passed two key gun violence pieces of  legislation. It has been nearly over 200 days since we passed these  bills, but nothing has been done in the Senate. Despite the countless  Americans who have lost their lives in these senseless shootings,  including children, Leader McConnell has refused to bring these up for  debate. We should be doing our work and trying to provide gun safety  for all Americans.   After the shootings in Dayton and El Paso, the American public has  demanded action. The overwhelming majority of Americans want us to take  commonsense action to provide better public safety. So Leader McConnell  said he would be doing just that. I think it is time that we hold him  to his word.   This Congress must act. The President should take the leadership,  ensuring we can do everything we can to protect Americans throughout  our land.                            ____________________
