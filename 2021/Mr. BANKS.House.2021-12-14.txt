 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, here we go again. For the first time in history,  Democrats have complete control over a select committee. I hope the  American people are paying close attention. I hope they see what  happens when Democrats get total power. They abuse it. They intimidate,  they threaten, and they harass. And they try to put their political  opponents in jail.                                time  1630    In a matter of weeks, the committee has passed three criminal  contempt citations. Today, we vote on holding Mark Meadows in contempt  of Congress.   On September 23, 2021, the select committee served former Congressman  Meadows a subpoena for a sweeping set of documents and a deposition. In  October, President Trump instructed Mr. Meadows to maintain his  executive privilege in any response to that subpoena. Mr. Meadows then  told the select committee that he would give them any information they  requested that wasn't protected by executive privilege.   Mr. Meadows gave the select committee over 6,800 pages of  information, including 1,100 documents and 2,300 text messages. Mr.  Meadows agreed to sit for a deposition if it was limited to areas not  protected by executive privilege. He tried to cooperate, but the select  committee didn't care.   Mr. Meadows even sought an independent ruling on the question of  executive privilege, but the select committee voted to hold him in  contempt anyway, just like they did with Mr. Clark, who offered to  participate pending the Supreme Court's decision in Trump v. Thompson.   Apparently, the select committee's rules go like this: Ignore the  former President and don't wait for legal rulings. Immediately do  everything that we say without objection, or we will refer you for  criminal prosecution.   They don't care about fairness or due process. The point isn't  cooperation or factfinding. They care about punishment. The point is  prosecution. And, of course, the point is the headline that they are  going for: Former Trump Chief of Staff found in contempt of Congress.  But that headline omits the ugly and partisan truth about the select  committee.   According to the committee's charter, H. Res. 503: ``The Speaker  shall appoint 13 Members to the select committee, five of whom shall be  appointed after consultation with the minority leader.'' But the  committee has zero members appointed in consultation with Leader  McCarthy. And it doesn't have 13 members; it has 9.   According to the committee's charter, if Mr. Meadows had come in for  a deposition, the minority must have been allowed to question Mr.  Meadows for the same length of time as the majority, except no members  of the committee were named by the minority.   This isn't nitpicking. The Supreme Court has found that a select  committee must follow its own rules to act with legal force.   So we have the select committee as it exists legally and on paper,  and then we have something completely different. I don't know what to  call it, but it doesn't resemble the select committee that Democrats  voted to pass  [[Page H7787]]  on the House floor. It is just nine members picked by Speaker Pelosi.   The group is trampling on Americans' constitutional rights and the  rights of Congress, like Mr. Meadows, and current Members of Congress.  They even include Americans whose sole offense, according to Chairman  Thompson, was planning a legal, permitted, and First Amendment- protected political rally.   Thanks to media reports, we know that Democrats have seized their  enemies' call and text records, geolocation data, and personal  contacts. We know of hundreds of instances. It could be more.   All we know for sure about this partisan investigation is that it is  massive. It is happening without accountability, and it is happening in  secret.   The select committee should serve as a warning to all Americans. This  is what you get when Democrats get free rein: secret snooping,  harassment, contempt for the rules of Congress, criminalization of  dissent, and it all ends with their opponents in jail.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record three articles.   First: ``J6 Committee Misleading Witnesses About Republican Staff  Presence,'' by Mollie Hemingway, that was published in The Federalist.   Second: ``The Democratic Norm Breakers: The January 6 committee wants  to subpoena GOP phone records,'' by The Wall Street Journal editorial  page.   Third: ``Civil Liberties Are Being Trampled by Exploiting  `Insurrection' Fears. Congress's 1/6 Committee May Be the Worst Abuse  Yet: The Unconstitutionality of the 1/6 Committee,'' by Glenn  Greenwald, published by Substack.                    [From the Federalist, Nov. 10, 2021]     J6 Committee Misleading Witnesses About Republican Staff Presence         Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney ran to CNN a few weeks ago to       accuse conservative stalwart Rep. Jim Banks of falsely       presenting himself as the Jan. 6 commission's ranking member.       Banks is, in fact, congressional Republicans' choice to be       their top investigator on the committee, but he has been       prevented from fulfilling his duties by Speaker of the House       Nancy Pelosi.        However, it's Cheney who appears to be misrepresenting       herself as the ranking member--that is, the top Republican--      on the committee.        January 6 Select Committee staff have been falsely telling       witnesses that Republican staff will be present for       interviews, according to multiple eyewitness sources and       documents. In fact, not a single Republican-appointed member       of Congress nor a single staff member representing the       Republican conference is part of the controversial committee.        Witnesses are being told that John Wood, a longtime friend       and ally of the Cheney family, will represent Republicans       when witnesses testify. But neither Cheney nor her friend is       representing the Republican conference. In fact, Cheney was       appointed to the committee in early July by Pelosi herself.        ``John Wood works for the Democrat Party, just like Liz       Cheney, who was appointed by Pelosi and is not the Ranking       Member of the Select Committee. She is misleading witnesses,       before they testify under penalty of law, about the motives       and the position of the person questioning them,'' said       Banks, who has continued leading Republicans' investigation       of the federal government's handling of the Jan. 6 riot at       the Capitol. Cheney's work with CNN was designed to prevent       him from being able to gain answers to the questions the       select committee was ostensibly set up to answer.        Cheney was given six days to explain whether she considers       herself just the Democrat-appointed vice-chair of the       committee or also the Republican ranking member, as is being       represented to key witnesses. She has not responded to       multiple requests for comment.        The misrepresentation to witnesses is key because the       absence of any ranking member--meaning, in this case, any       Republican-appointed member--or minority party staff means       the committee appears to be failing to adhere to ironclad       rules for its work.        Pelosi ``blew up'' the Jan. 6 committee when she took what       she herself admitted was the ``unprecedented'' step of       refusing to seat multiple Republican-appointed members,       including the highly respected Navy officer and Indiana       Republican Banks, who was to be the committee's ranking       member. She also banned Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, who       currently serves as the top Republican on the Judiciary       Committee.        Pelosi chose two of her key Republican allies and anti-      Trump obsessives to fill two of her slots for the committee.       As such, they do not represent the Republican conference,       which opposed their selection, but the Democrat conference,       which supported their selection.        Cheney was promoted to vice-chair in September in thanks       for her stalwart work on Pelosi's behalf. Cheney, who has       been censured by Wyoming Republicans for working against       Republican voters and their interests, and who lost her       position as House Conference chair for hijacking multiple       briefings for Republican policy initiatives to talk about her       personal vendetta against Trump, is facing precipitously low       poll numbers and a challenge from popular Republican Harriet       Hageman.        Cheney was joined by lame-duck Adam Kinzinger of Illinois,       who recently announced his retirement rather than facing       certain defeat from Illinois constituents who don't share his       anti-Trump obsession. Kinzinger was appointed by Pelosi in       late July to make the committee appear more bipartisan after       she'd vetoed Banks and Jordan. Cheney, her selection for       vice-chair, was brought in for the sole purpose of helping       Democrats with their tribunal.        The resolution establishing the committee, purportedly to       investigate the federal government's role in detecting,       preventing, preparing for, and responding to the Jan. 6 riot,       says depositions taken by the select committee must follow       House rules.        Those rules clearly state, ``Consultation with the ranking       minority member shall include three days' notice before any       deposition.'' Also, ``A deposition shall be conducted by any       member or committee counsel designated by the chair or       ranking minority member of the Committee that noticed the       deposition. When depositions are conducted by committee       counsel, there shall be no more than two committee counsel       permitted to question a witness per round. One of the       committee counsel shall be designated by the chair and the       other by the ranking minority member per round.''        Additionally, the rules say, ``Deposition questions shall       be propounded in rounds. The length of each round shall not       exceed 60 minutes per side and shall provide equal time to       the majority and the minority. In each round, the member(s)       or committee counsel designated by the chair shall ask       questions first, and the member(s) or committee counsel       designated by the ranking minority member shall ask questions       second.''        The point of these rules is to structure depositions so the       minority and the majority counsel have the same opportunity       to question witnesses and gather information for their       separate reports. That's why they rotate and why they're       allotted equal time. Having questions alternate from one       hostile lawyer to another hostile lawyer who is working with       the first makes a mockery of the provisions. It also means       that the hostile lawyers can coordinate and cherry-pick which       information to leak or publish, and which to conceal from the       public because it contradicts their preferred narrative.        The rules do not envision the circumstances that accompany       Pelosi's uni-party select committee. The House Rules ``become       nonsensical in a situation like this,'' said one       congressional aide, adding, ``This isn't just a partisan       investigation--it's a coverup.''        For the select committee to be in accordance with the rules       regarding consultation for depositions, Cheney must be       considered simultaneously the ranking member for the minority       party while also being the vice-chair for the majority party.        Hill lawyers say Pelosi's handling of the committee casts       doubt on its adherence to  [[Page H7789]]       the rules. Because she vetoed the ranking member from the       committee, it has no ranking member. But the committee rules       require consultation with the ranking member before taking       certain basic actions, such as taking depositions, including       those pursuant to subpoenas.        ``So how can you consult with the ranking member when you       don't have one?'' asked one Hill attorney.        The multiple sources consulted for this article include a       document which confirmed January 6 Committee staff       represented to a witness that Wood would be the Republican       counsel during their interview.        ``If this was a real investigation, that'd land you in jail       for prosecutorial misconduct,'' Banks said of the false       representation. ``Fortunately for Liz, this is a sham       investigation,'' he added.                                   ____                [From The Wall Street Journal, Sept. 1, 2021]                        The Democratic Norm Breakers                          (By The Editorial Board)         Critics feared that Speaker Nancy Pelosi's probe of the       Jan. 6 Capitol riot would be partisan, and the latest proof       are subpoenas for the private phone records of House       Republicans. This is a violation of political norms that       Democrats will come to regret.        Bennie Thompson (D., Miss.), chair of the House special       committee, sent letters Monday to 35 companies, from At&T to       Facebook to Parler, asking them to preserve information about       account holders charged with crimes related to, or       ``potentially involved with discussions'' in planning, the       Jan. 6 riot. The companies are requested to preserve emails,       and voice, text and direct messages in preparation for       subpoenas to come.        The letters contained a list of individuals whose names       haven't leaked. But CNN reports that nearly a dozen House       Republicans are on the committee's ``evolving'' radar,       including Jim Jordan, ranking Member of the House Judiciary       Committee.        Republicans are furious, and rightly so. Indiana Rep. Jim       Banks noted in a letter to Mr. Thompson that this       ``authoritarian undertaking'' would depart ``from more than       230 years of Congressional oversight.'' The move recalls       California Democrat Adam Schiff's public release of the call       logs of Republican Rep. Devin Nunes in 2019.        At least Democrats claimed the collection of Mr. Nunes's       information was incidental to other records it targeted. The       special committee is using its oversight power to snoop on       political opponents. They'd gain access to information far       beyond the events of Jan. 6.        Democrats say they need the call lists to see if Members of       Congress fomented the assault on the Capitol. They hope to       confirm their narrative that the riot was a planned       ``insurrection,'' though Reuters reports that the FBI has       found no such evidence in six months of looking. Conspiracy       is a crime and matter for the Justice Department, not       Congress.        The subpoenas are also legally dubious, coming after recent       judicial warnings about the limits of Congressional fishing.       The Supreme Court last year in Trump v. Mazars reminded       Congress that subpoenas must have a ``valid legislative       purpose.'' The Jan. 6 committee has offered no such       rationale. Our legal sources say the subpoenas may violate       the Constitution's Speech and Debate Clause because Congress       can't pass a law that would limit Members' speech.        The private companies may want to think twice about       complying. In the Schiff affair, the telcos handed over call       logs without even notifying the targets. Mr. Thompson's       letter is demanding the same, telling companies that if they       ``are not able or willing to respond to this request without       alerting the subscribers or the accounts'' to ``please       contact the Select Committee prior to proceeding.'' The       ``please'' part is an admission that the committee knows it       lacks authority to make such a demand.        Federal Communications Commissioner Brendan Carr says       ``federal law requires telecommunications carriers to protect       the privacy and confidentiality of Americans' call records.''       He says his agency ``has brought enforcement actions against       carriers to ensure their compliance,'' and Congress isn't       automatically entitled to anyone's private records.        Even if the companies don't want to fight the subpoenas in       court, they have an obligation to alert targets so they can       contest the subpoenas. Mr. Banks's Friday letter reminded       corporate general counsels of their ``legal obligation not to       hand over individuals' private records unless the subject of       the subpoena consents to the information being shared or the       company has a court order to turn over the records.''        House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy also warned companies       against rolling over to Democratic pressure, noting they       could forfeit their ``ability to operate in the United       States.'' Democrats and the media spun this as pressuring       companies to ignore ``duly'' issued subpoenas. But Mr.       McCarthy was pointing out that federal privacy law protects       information, and that Democrats haven't proved in court that       their committee is entitled to these records.        If Democrats follow through and use their power to       investigate GOP opponents, there will be no end to it.       Republicans are likely to take the majority as early as 2022,       and two can play at Adam Schiff's nasty game.                                   ____                 The Unconstitutionality of the 1/6 Committee         Civil liberties abuses of this type are common when the       U.S. security state scares enough people into believing that       the threat they face is so acute that normal constitutional       safeguards must be disregarded. What is most definitely not       common, and is arguably the greatest 1/6-related civil       liberties abuse of them all, is the House of Representatives       Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the       United States Capitol.        To say that the investigative acts of the 1/6 Committee are       radical is a wild understatement. Along with serving       subpoenas on four former Trump officials, they have also       served subpoenas on eleven Private citizens: people selected       for interrogation precisely because they exercised their       Constitutional right of free assembly by applying for and       receiving a permit to hold a protest on January 6 opposing       certification of the 2020 election.        When the Select 1/6 Committee recently boasted of these       subpoenas in its press release, it made clear what       methodology it used for selecting who it was targeting: ``The       committee used permit paperwork for the Jan. 6 rally to       identify other individuals involved in organizing.'' In other       words, any citizen whose name appeared on permit applications       to protest was targeted for that reason alone. The       committee's stated goal is ``to collect information from them       and their associated entities on the planning, organization,       and funding of those events'': to haul citizens before       Congress to interrogate them on their constitutionally       protected right to assemble and protest and probe their       political beliefs and associations:                               Press Release   Select Committee Subpoenas Organizers of Rallies and Events Preceding                          January 6th Insurrection                               [Sep 29, 2021]         Washington--Today, Chairman Bennie G. Thompson announced       that the Select Committee has issued subpoenas for deposition       testimony and records to individuals tied to the events and       rallies leading up to the January 6th insurrection, including       the January 6th rally at the Ellipse that immediately       preceded the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol. The       subpoenas were sent to 11 individuals as part of the Select       Committee's efforts to collect information from them and       their associated entities on the planning, organization, and       funding of those events. In letters to rally organizers,       Chairman Thompson instructed witnesses to testify at       depositions and to produce a sweeping range of records.        The subpoenas seek a range of records that include       materials dealing with the planning, funding, and       participation in the events and bus tours; social media       activity of associated entities; and communications with or       involvement of Trump Administration officials and lawmakers.       The Select Committee issued subpoenas for records from the       following individuals and their associated entities, and has       instructed the individuals to testify at depositions:        Amy Kremer, founder and Chair of WFAF.        Kylie Kremer, founder and Executive Director of WFAF.        Cynthia Chafian, submitted the first permit application on       behalf of WFAF for the January 6th rally, and founder of the       Eighty Percent Coalition.        Caroline Wren, listed on permit paperwork for the January       6th rally as ``VIP Advisor.''        Maggie Mulvaney, listed on permit paperwork for the January       6th rally as ``VIP Lead.''        Justin Caporale, of Event Strategies, Inc., listed on       permit paperwork for the January 6th rally as ``Project       Manager.''        Tim Unes, of Event Strategies, Inc., listed on permit       paperwork for the January 6th rally as ``Stage Manager.''        Megan Powers, of MPowers Consulting LLC, Listed on permit       paperwork for the January 6th rally as ``Operations Manager       for Scheduling and Guidance.''        Hannah Salem, of Salem Strategies LLC, listed on permit       paperwork for the January 6th rally as ``Operations Manager       for Logistics and Communications.''        Lyndon Brentnall, of RMS Protective Services, listed on       permit paperwork for the January 6th rally as ``On-Site       supervisor.''        Katrina Pierson, former Trump campaign official, reportedly       involved in the organization of the January 5th and 6th       rallies and was in direct communication with the former       President about the rallies.        Even worse are the so-called ``preservation notices'' which       the committee secretly issued to dozens if not hundreds of       telecoms, email and cell phone providers, and other social       media platforms (including Twitter and Parler), ordering       those companies to retain extremely invasive data regarding       the communications and physical activities of more than 100       citizens, with the obvious intent to allow the committee to       subpoena those documents. The communications and physical       movement data sought by the committee begins in April, 2020--      nine months before the 1/6 riot. The committee refuses to       make public the list of individuals it is targeting with       these sweeping third-party subpoenas, but on the list are       what CNN calls ``many members of Congress,'' along with       dozens of private citizens involved in obtaining the permit       to protest and then promoting and planning the gathering on       social media.        What makes these secret notices especially pernicious is       that the committee requested that these companies not notify       their customers that the committee has demanded the       preservation of their data. The committee knows it lacks the       power to impose a ``gag order'' on these companies to prevent  [[Page H7790]]       them from notifying their users that they received the       precursor to a subpoena: a power the FBI in conjunction with       courts does have. So they are relying instead on ``voluntary       compliance'' with the gag order request, accompanied by the       thuggish threat that any companies refusing to voluntarily       comply risk the public relations harm of appearing to be       obstructing the committee's investigation and, worse,       protecting the 1/6 ``insurrectionists.''        Worse still, the committee in its preservation notices to       these communications companies requested that ``you do not       disable, suspend, lock, cancel, or interrupt service to these       subscribers or accounts solely due to this request,'' and       that they should first contact the committee ``if you are not       able or willing to respond to this request without alerting       the subscribers.'' The motive here is obvious: if any of       these companies risk the PR hit by refusing to conceal from       their customers the fact that Congress is seeking to obtain       their private data, they are instructed to contact the       committee instead, so that the committee can withdraw the       request. That way, none of the customers will ever be aware       that the committee targeted their private data and will thus       never be able to challenge the legality of the committee's       acts in a court of law.        In other words, even the committee knows that its power to       seek this information about private citizens lacks any       convincing legal justification and, for that reason, wants to       ensure that nobody has the ability to seek a judicial ruling       on the legality of their actions. All of these behaviors       raise serious civil liberties concerns, so much so that even       left-liberal legal scholars and at least one civil liberties       group (obviously not the ACLU)--petrified until now of       creating any appearance that they are defending 1/6       protesters by objecting to civil liberties abuses--have begun       very delicately to raise doubts and concerns about the       committee's actions.        But the most serious constitutional problem is not the       specific investigative acts of the committee but the very       existence of the committee itself. There is ample reason to       doubt the constitutionality of this committee's existence.        When crimes are committed in the United States, there are       two branches of government--and only two--vested by the       Constitution with the power to investigate criminal suspects       and adjudicate guilt: the executive branch (through the FBI       and DOJ) and the judiciary. Congress has no role to play in       any of that, and for good and important reasons. The       Constitution places limits on what the executive branch and       judiciary can do when investigating suspects . . . . .     Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, let's be very, very clear. The Democrats aren't  interested in finding out how a disorganized horde of rioters managed  to break into the United States Capitol on January 6. They don't want  to learn more about  [[Page H7792]]  the security breakdown that occurred that day, and they don't care  about protecting the Capitol from future attacks. They have proven it  to us.   None of the 51 subpoenas that the committee has publicly touted have  anything to do with Capitol security. As they have proven yet again  today, over and over again, they only care about attacking their  political enemies.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Rodney Davis).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My Republican colleagues and I have repeatedly condemned political  violence in all of its forms, including the violence on January 6.   But the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, who was elected by  Democrats to oversee Federal law enforcement, secured a Presidential  pardon for Susan Rosenberg, a domestic terrorist who set off a bomb in  the Senate Cloakroom in 1983. That is a fact.   Merrick Garland, appointed by Democrats to head the Justice  Department, helped the Obama administration to dismiss an indictment  against Elizabeth Ann Duke, a fugitive who was also arrested for  setting off a bomb inside the United States Capitol.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Roy).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 15  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Again, what you have heard today proves what we have said all along.  This select committee is not at all interested in doing anything to  prevent something like January 6 from ever happening again. It is all  about burying their political opponents. That is what they are about to  do today by holding Mr. Meadows in contempt. It is what they have  already done two times before. It is an absolute shame. We shouldn't  allow it to happen.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote against this resolution today.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
