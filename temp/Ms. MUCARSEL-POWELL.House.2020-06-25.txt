 Madam Speaker, my condolences. I just heard  about your father.   Madam Speaker, today I rise in strong support of the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act. Today marks 1 month since George Floyd called  out, ``I can't breathe,'' as an officer suffocated him to death and two  complicitly watched. The world has joined Mr. Floyd's family in  demanding that we take action. South Florida and my constituents are  demanding action.   We can't bring him back, but we can bring justice to him; to his 6- year-old daughter, Gianna; his family; and his brother, Philonise.   We can put an end to chokeholds and hold every police officer  accountable for their actions. We can honor the life and legacy of  Breonna Taylor, whose murderers still walk free, and we can and must  serve the memory of the countless other lives that have been taken and  brutalized by bringing law enforcement back to their roots of  protecting and serving.   The time for bold and profound action is now.                                time  1530
