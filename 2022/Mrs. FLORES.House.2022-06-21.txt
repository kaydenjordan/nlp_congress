 Madam Speaker, I rise today to give a voice to the  voiceless and to say that the people who live and work in south Texas  have had enough. We want to be heard, and we are tired of being treated  like second-class citizens.   I was born in Burgos, Tamaulipas, Mexico, and raised with strong  values to always put God and family first. My father, Saul Flores,  moved us to the United States because of the promise of America. He  told me that in this country, if you work hard, you can accomplish  anything. My story proves he is right.   But right now our people are struggling. They are taken for granted.  That ends now.   I am here. I have risen from working in the cotton fields to  representing the community I love in the United States Congress. And I  will give them a voice. I will use it to say: Our lives are not a game.  Our people deserve to have opportunity, security, and freedom, and I  will work every day to give it to them.   I am a proud Border Patrol wife and a mother of four young children  fighting for a better future for them and for all our children.                            ____________________
