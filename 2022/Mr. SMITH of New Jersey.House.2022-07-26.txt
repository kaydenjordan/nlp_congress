 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the  bill, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to convey my special thanks to Chairwoman Karen  Bass for her exceptional leadership, partnership, and friendship.   For years, we have worked together to combat the unspeakable crime  and abject cruelty of sex and labor trafficking.                                time  1415    The Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection  Act is just the latest bold initiative in our mutual commitment to end  modern-day slavery.   I want to thank Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Minority  Leader Kevin McCarthy, and especially Chairman Meeks and Ranking Member  McCaul for having favorably reported the bill from the Foreign Affairs  Committee on February 9.   Majority Leader Hoyer was especially helpful and has ensured timely  consideration during this month of July, just in time to commemorate  the World Day Against Trafficking in Persons.   As my colleagues know--we have all been through this--but in this  case there were five full committee referrals for this bill. It can be  very challenging getting the committee chairmen and ranking members to  agree, and I am grateful to them for their good faith in coming  together for this important human rights cause and making sure that  this legislation was brought to the floor.   Madam Speaker, I have been working on human trafficking since 1995. I  have chaired more than 35 hearings and written five anti-trafficking  laws including the landmark Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000.  Many in the United States--and I'm grateful that this is so  bipartisan--and many around the world have rallied to stop  [[Page H7087]]  this hideous abuse, yet it couldn't be clearer that much more needs to  be done.   Traffickers never take a holiday, nor can we. Because traffickers and  the nefarious networks that they lead always find new ways to exploit  the vulnerable, we must aggressively strengthen our laws, and we must  be equally aggressive in the implementation of those laws.   The Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection  Act is a bipartisan, survivor-informed bill. Karen and I first  introduced the bill nearly 11 months ago on Frederick Douglass' 183rd  anniversary of his self-emancipation, and we were joined at the  introduction by Kenneth Morris--Frederick Douglass' great-great-great- grandson. Ken has been a tremendous friend and ally in this human  rights struggle and helped us write the bill.   Born a slave--as I think many people know--back in 1818, Frederick  Douglass disguised himself as a sailor and traveled from Baltimore to  New York. A renowned abolitionist and statesman--and a Republican--he  continued to lead the fight to end slavery, Jim Crow laws, and advance  respect and equality.   The Frederick Douglass TVPRA honors this great man by significantly  enhancing programs, strengthening our laws and adding new ones, and  adding accountability for programs at the Departments of Justice,  Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and State to combat human  trafficking and to offer sustainable solutions, solutions that work.   This bill ensures robust prevention through trafficking prevention  education--situational awareness for our children, their teachers, and  parents--stabilization of survivors once they are no longer in the  hands of traffickers, and long-term solutions that facilitate healing  and survivor empowerment.   Frederick Douglass once said: ``It is easier to build strong children  than to repair broken men.''   We want to prevent trafficking from occurring in the first place.  That is why we have authored this legislation. We create an age- appropriate, scalable program to train the trainers, use proven and  tested best practices, and include training parents and guardians in  trafficking prevention education. This bill also properly designates  these grants as the Frederick Douglass Prevention Education Grants.   I know all of my colleagues are aware of Megan's Law which protects  children domestically. In 2008 I introduced International Megan's Law.  It passed the House three times and almost died in the Senate until the  third iteration of it. It was signed into law in 2016, and now it is  being reauthorized in this bill as well.   Megan Kanka was from my former hometown of Hamilton. She was just 7  years old when she was kidnapped, raped, and brutally murdered in 1994.  Her assailant lived right across the street. Unbeknownst to her family  and other residents in the neighborhood, he was a convicted, repeat  child sex offender. Her parents, Maureen and Richard Kanka, are  heartbroken to this day. They have been amazingly effective,  courageous, and heroic in successfully pushing every State in the Union  to enact Megan's Law.   So why International Megan's Law?   We know from law enforcement, academia, and media documentation that  Americans on the U.S. sex offender registries are frequently caught  abusing children all over the world: Asia, Central and South America,  and Europe--as I said, everywhere.   Under International Megan's Law, convicted child sex offenders who  travel abroad must provide notice to the U.S. Government through the  Angel Watch Center prior to departure of all planned destinations.  Failure to do so carries a significant jail term. Upon receipt of the  travel itinerary, the U.S. Government informs the destination country  or countries of those plans.   In just a few years of working--and that is with people not traveling  as much during Covid-19, the pandemic--the U.S. Government has notified  foreign governments of the planned travel of 19,000 covered child sex  offenders, and more than 7,000 individuals who were convicted of crimes  against children were denied entry to these nations.   The Douglass bill, Madam Speaker, also requires international  programs to focus on best practices in their integration of counter- trafficking efforts into their development portfolios. This way we can  make the best use of our foreign assistance at the Department of State  and the U.S. Agency for International Development.   The bill realigns efforts to meet fundamental needs of survivors  through wrap-around social services with case management, including  assistance with obtaining housing, life-skills training, and mental  health care, while also providing long-term solutions through  job coaching and training, and assistance with obtaining employment and  higher education. This approach is fundamental to meeting survivors'  needs on their continuum of healing.    As Frederick Douglass, again, once said: ``Knowledge makes a man  unfit to be a slave.''   Rather than quick fixes that can leave survivors vulnerable to re- trafficking, the Frederick Douglass bill invests wisely in systemic and  dignified solutions by providing survivors opportunities for the  education and jobs they need to become self-reliant and even leaders.   It provides, for the first-time, $35 million for Housing Assistance  Grants For Victims of Human Trafficking. The number of people without  housing in the U.S. continues to climb, while trafficking victims are  extraordinarily vulnerable if they don't have a place to live.   We cannot forget what is happening in Ukraine. There is good language  in the bill calling to our attention all of those who have been so  horribly mistreated and trafficked. I thank Chairwoman Bass for really  bringing a focus to foster care and the fact that so many of our foster  care children have been trafficked. It is a place of extreme  vulnerability. She has very good language that she has put into this  bill--we worked together--but it was her initiative on that issue.   The ILO says that there are nearly 25 million people in the world who  are enslaved and that most are women and children. That is  unconscionable. Every human life is of infinite value. We as lawmakers  have a duty to protect the weakest and most vulnerable from harm.   I yield such time as he may consume to gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Roy).    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close.   Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from Texas for his very fine  statement, and I look forward to a recorded vote.   I also want to say very clearly that we have a very, very broad  bipartisan group of stakeholders who are for this, including, as I  mentioned a moment ago, Frederick Douglass Family Initiatives, the  Douglass Leadership Institute, Frederick Douglass Foundation,  [[Page H7088]]  along with 300 anti-trafficking and human trafficking organizations,  over 500 advocates and survivors, and they have worked tirelessly with  us over the last 18 months, with both Karen Bass and me in crafting  this legislation. We even had more. Some of them did drop out, but we  will come back some day in the future to get some of that. But it is a  good solid bill.   Survivor leaders like Bella Hanoukey and Robert Lung provided  valuable insights and expertise for this bill. As I said, Kenneth  Morris was outstanding in the work that he provided for us.   As a matter of fact, as the special representative for human  trafficking for the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, a couple of years ago,  I brought him into one of our big parliamentary assembly meetings, and  there were at least 100-plus lawmakers from the European space that  heard him speak about the importance of prevention. If young people  know what is out there and what is waiting--particularly run-aways-- they will be forearmed and forewarned and, hopefully, can mitigate the  possibility of being trafficked themselves. He hit it out of the park,  and he has been a great friend on this.    We also have 3Strands Global Foundation; the Safe House Project;  America First Policy Institute; End Child Prostitution and Trafficking  USA; ECPAT, with whom we work very closely; the American Hotel and  Lodging Association; the Alliance to End Slavery and Trafficking, that  is known as ATEST. They have a great group and consortium of groups.   We have the International Justice Mission, IJM; World Vision; United  States Catholic Sisters Against Human Trafficking; Shared Hope  International; Hope for Justice; National Child Protection Task Force;  Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network, also known as RAINN; the  National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, who also worked  with us closely on it; the National Center on Sexual Exploitation; and  the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women.   They all provided valuable insights, as I mentioned a moment ago.   I want to thank Mark Iozzi and Jamie Jackson from the majority  leader's office for working closely with Chairwoman Bass and me and who  helped bring this to the floor today; Chris Bien and Will Dunham from  the minority leader's office; Janice Kaguyutan--I want to thank her for  her help as she has done before on trafficking and legislation; and  Doug Anderson.   I want to thank Mary Vigil who is sitting right behind me. For the  last 18 months she has been meeting with all the groups working and  drafting this legislation. She has done an amazing job. I want to thank  her for her leadership. She used to work at USAID. She has got a heart  for vulnerable people, and I can't thank her enough for that.   I thank Piero Tozzi, our chief counsel for the Lantos Commission on  the Republican side and Mary Noonan, my Chief of Staff, Tomekah Burl  and Meghann Galloway, Karen Bass' staff who were also outstanding.   It was a full court press and a great deal of collaboration. I thank  them and my distinguished staff and all the Members who got together  behind this.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
