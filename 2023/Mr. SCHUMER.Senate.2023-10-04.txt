 Mr. President, tomorrow, the U.S. Senate will close in  observance of the memorial of our late friend and colleague Senator  Dianne Feinstein. It will be my honor--a sad, tearful, but great  honor--to speak tomorrow at my friend Dianne's memorial. And I thank  all my colleagues who will be in attendance. I know that it would mean  the world to her for her colleagues to join in this one last good-bye.   I will have more to say tomorrow, but, over the past few days, I have  been coming back to the same thought again and again: Dianne Feinstein  was a public servant of uncommon integrity. Many of us here try our  best to pursue the common good, but Dianne was on another level. When  she thought something was right, when she had a cause she believed in,  she pursued it until the end, until her cause endured.   I got to see it for myself when she championed the Assault Weapons  Ban. The NRA launched horrible, vitriolic, arguably chauvinistic  attacks, but she remained undeterred. She knew her cause was just, and  she persisted, and, in the end, her cause won the day.   It will be a long, long time until the Senate sees someone as  consequential as Dianne Feinstein again.  [[Page S4922]]         Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.

Madam President, I just filed on three nominations, and  that will take us through Tuesday afternoon, October 17.   We will also return to the consideration of the minibus, which  includes MILCON-VA, Transportation-HUD, and Agriculture. We are working  in good faith, together with our colleagues, to get the minibus done as  soon as possible.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
