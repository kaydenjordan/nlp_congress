 Madam Speaker, these are challenging times for  everyone, including for our Nation's young people, who are trying to  cope with growing up and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.   At this challenging time, arts education is more important than ever.  The arts provide a way to help people connect and cope; and after this  crisis, the arts will continue to play an important role in helping to  heal.   In recognition of Music in Our Schools Month, I want to highlight the  value of music education. My mom was a piano teacher, and I took  lessons myself. I know music is an important part of a well-rounded  education. It helps students become critical, creative thinkers across  subjects and eventually in their careers.   Yesterday, I spoke with band and choir educators from Oregon, who are  working to safely reengage students in in-person music classes. I thank  them, and I am grateful that the American Rescue Plan will provide  funding to help schools open safely, including those important band and  choir classes.   Please join me in supporting music education.                            ____________________
