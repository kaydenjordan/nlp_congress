 Mr. Speaker, I came to Congress to make sure that no  parent ever experienced the pain that I have. I came to Congress to  fight for children who have practiced active shooter drills at the same  time that they are simply learning how to read, for families who have  lost loved ones to gun violence, and for communities that will never  ever be the same.   Last Wednesday, Members of this body hid from insurrectionists behind  barricades and locked doors. Staffers of this hallowed institution  texted to their loved ones, ``They are banging on the doors outside. I  love you.''   And citizens of this Nation watched in real time as rioters stormed  the Capitol through shattered windows and broken glass. The result of  the President's rhetoric has left five Americans dead.   Our response to anyone who seeks to overthrow the will of the people  must be unwavering and resolute. I didn't come to Congress to do this.  But President Trump's actions warrant his immediate removal from  office.
