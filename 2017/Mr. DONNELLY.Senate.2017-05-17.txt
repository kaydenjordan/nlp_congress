 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor our law  enforcement officers during National Police Week and to talk about the  importance of supporting law enforcement, including their mental  health.   During National Police Week, we recognize and remember the sacrifices  of the law enforcement officers we lost in the line of duty in 2016.  Every day and through every night in communities across Indiana and our  country, law enforcement officers are patrolling our streets, arriving  at the scenes of challenging and often traumatic incidents, and even  putting themselves in harm's way as they do their best to keep our  families safe. They help ensure that our children can be safe at the  neighborhood playground and our seniors can sit peacefully on their  front porch. They help keep drugs off our streets, they are called to  the scenes of opioid and heroin overdoses, and they help stem the  violence and crime that has plagued many of our communities for far too  long.    Our law enforcement officers put on the uniform every day. They head  out the door to serve us, while their family members say a prayer  hoping they come back safely into their family's loving arms at the end  of their shift. Sadly, sometimes they do not.   In my home State of Indiana, our law enforcement lost one of their  own last year when the Howard County sheriff's deputy, Carl Koontz, was  shot and killed during a raid in Russiaville, IN, last March.   Deputy Koontz was only 27 years old, in the prime of his life, and  had dedicated himself to serving and protecting the communities he  loved. He left behind his wife Kassie and their young son Noah.   Deputy Koontz's loss was felt not just in Kokomo, not just in Howard  County, but in cities and towns across our State. He represented the  very best our State has to offer. He was smart, talented, and service  driven, working  [[Page S2982]]  to make his community a better place to live.   Mr. President, I know your State was stricken this past year, as  well, with the loss of the same kind of extraordinary individuals who  went and served every day. That is at the core of what law enforcement  officers strive for and why it is so devastating when they are lost in  the line of duty.   While we pay our respects to those we lost, it is our solemn duty to  support those who serve our communities today. As law enforcement  officers go through their work, they are sometimes confronted with  challenging or even horrific situations.   Recently, I joined with my friend and colleague from Indiana, Senator  Todd Young, to introduce the bipartisan Law Enforcement Mental Health  and Wellness Act. It provides tools for law enforcement agencies to  help support the mental health and wellness of our brave men and women.   We were thankful to have the support from Senators Blunt, Coons,  Cornyn, and Feinstein when we introduced the legislation. I am honored  that Senators Blumenthal, Booker, Brown, Cruz, Hatch, Klobuchar, Cortez  Masto, Durbin, and Tester have added their support in the days since.   I say to the Presiding Officer, thank you for your support of our  legislation.   I am very pleased to say that our bill passed the Senate unanimously  late yesterday, and it is a major step forward. I am hopeful that our  friends in the House of Representatives, where a companion piece was  introduced by Congresswoman Susan Brooks and Congresswoman Val Demings  of Florida, who served as the first female chief of police in Orlando  before coming to Congress--I am hopeful Congresswoman Brooks and  Congresswoman Demings can shepherd this bill through that Chamber.   This legislation is also supported by a number of law enforcement  organizations, including the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police  Department, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of  Police Organizations, the Major County Sheriffs of America, and more.   I am proud that this is a bipartisan effort, as evidenced by the  Members supporting this legislation. It is time to get this to the  President's desk to be signed into law as soon as possible.   The Law Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act is about providing  resources to law enforcement agencies that want to better protect their  officers' mental health, as well as the providers who strive to serve  that unique population. It would direct the Departments of Justice and  Health and Human Services to develop resources for mental health  providers to educate them about law enforcement culture and evidenced- based therapies for mental health issues common to law enforcement. It  would require the Department of Justice to study the effectiveness of  crisis hotlines for law enforcement. It authorizes grants to initiate  peer mentoring programs in law enforcement agencies. We are already  seeing the success of these programs where the IMPD, the Indianapolis  Metropolitan Police Department, is utilizing peer mentoring for officer  mental health.   During my time in the Senate, our main legislative focus has been to  improve the availability of mental healthcare services for  servicemembers and their families. We have made great progress in  recent years. I am proud that my bipartisan Jacob Sexton Military  Suicide Prevention Act is now law.   As of this September, every servicemember--Active, Reserve, or  Guard--is required to have an annual mental health assessment. The Law  Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act builds upon the work our  military has been doing to combat suicide and mental health challenges.   It requires the Department of Defense, the VA, and the Department of  Justice to consult on military mental health practices that can be  adopted by law enforcement agencies. Building on the Sexton Act that  requires annual mental health assessments for servicemembers, the Law  Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act examines if having annual  mental health checks for law enforcement officers would help save  lives.   When Senator Young and I announced this legislation last month, we  had the honor of being joined by a number of law enforcement  professionals, including the Indianapolis chief of police, Bryan Roach.  Chief Roach shared some of his experiences. He said:         When I am came on, officers were taught to be in control of       their emotions.        We still teach the IMPD to be in control of their emotions.       But if you think about the day in, day out routine of the       things they participate in, and the things that they see, and       they are confronted with on a day to day basis, it is       difficult sometimes to control those emotions, but they do a       very good job of it.        The problem is they take those things home. The things       we're talking about are not just PTSD, but depression and       anxiety.    As the chief stated, law enforcement officers--like the rest of us-- don't just turn themselves off when they go home. The experiences they  have every day impact them and their family and their friends.   Sheriff Mike Nielsen of Boone County--located in Central Indiana,  right near Indianapolis--was also on hand that day with us to share his  perspective. He said: In 2015, Captain Nanavaty and the office received  national recognition, being awarded the National Law Enforcement  Officers Memorial Fund's Annual Officer Wellness Award. IMPD's  innovation and forward thinking have inspired police departments across  the United States to follow their footsteps and undertake similar  efforts to address law enforcement mental health and wellness. But this  is just the beginning of these efforts.         I have seen things that cannot be unseen. The brave men and       women of police, fire, EMS, are all public safety officers       who put their lives on the line each and every day.        They endure more than anybody can imagine, and they must       deal with the stresses of life both on the job and at home.    Sometimes it is really, really tough. Sheriff Nielsen continued:         We must all work hard to stop the stigma with mental health       issues.        As administrators, we have to train our supervisors how to       recognize signs of PTSD in our staff. We must administer       standard officer wellness programs.        As administrators and public safety, we must lead from the       front, and let our staff know that it is okay to struggle       with issues. That we are only human.        Our emotional mental health heals just like a physical       injury. With the proper treatment, and with time.        We must provide the funding and resources to go beyond the       critical stress debriefing. We must do this for our officers.    Both Chief Roach's and Sheriff Nielsen's comments show us the  importance of ending the stigma attached to mental health issues. We  can't be afraid of talking about mental health and the ways we support  our law enforcement officers as they work through these challenges.   Lebanon police officer Taylor Nielsen, who followed in the tradition  of her dad, Sheriff Mike Nielsen--an extraordinary family, serving our  State with their lives every day--was courageous enough to share her  mental health struggles following a particularly tough assignment.   She recounted the questions that she was dealing with:         Why am I alone? Why isn't anybody else having these issues?       Why can't I get this out of my head? What is wrong with me?       These were the questions that repeatedly ran through my head       on a daily basis last year.        Questions that made me believe that there was something       fundamentally wrong with me.    She continued:         For those of you who feel you are fighting alone, know that       there is relief out there. Please don't be afraid to seek out       those resources. The battle will be hard, but it can be won.    Thanks to her strong will and the help of a trained therapist, Taylor  was able to handle her mental health challenges. As she said, though,  we have to work together as a team to beat these issues.   We will take time over Police Week to reflect on the law enforcement  professionals we lost last year. As we do that, it is important that we  take commonsense steps to support our law enforcement officers.   We took a major step forward with yesterday's passage of the Law  Enforcement Mental Health and Wellness Act in the Senate. I see my  colleague Todd Young, who was my teammate on that, in the Chamber as  well. I am hopeful it will be enacted soon so we can bring more tools  to law enforcement agencies across Indiana and our country.  Congresswoman Brooks and Congresswoman Demings are working on it right  now.   After the service and sacrifices law enforcement officers make every  day, they have earned the resources we have, so that we can provide the  very best to the very best.   Thanks again to Senator Young for working with me on this effort, to  the police and sheriffs in Indiana who have lent their support, to law  enforcement officers protecting Hoosiers as we stand here at this  moment.  [[Page S2983]]    May God bless all of these officers, and may God bless the family of  Deputy Carl Koontz. May God bless Indiana, and may God bless America.   Mr. President, I yield back.
