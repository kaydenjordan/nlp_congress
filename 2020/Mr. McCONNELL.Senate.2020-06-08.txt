 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, all across our Nation, the past few  days have seemed to mark a turn for the better.   On Friday morning, new data showed that the economic fallout from  this pandemic may have bottomed out and begun to turn around weeks  earlier than had been predicted. Instead of losing millions more jobs  in the month of May, our Nation had already begun adding back millions  of jobs. Lockdowns are easing, and businesses are reopening. The  greatest country in world history is coming back online, and our  citizens are getting their jobs back by the millions.   Now, there is no question our national comeback is just beginning.  The coronavirus is still with us. We have a long way to go to rebuild  and recover from the historic layoffs of this spring, but already, even  in these early days of our careful reopening, the American people are  trouncing the predictions and starting to come back strong.   What is more, this weekend saw millions of Americans, once again,  take to the streets and town squares to protest the deaths of George  Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and other Black Americans at the hands of law  enforcement. Yet, unlike what our Nation faced about a week ago, this  weekend's demonstrations seemed to have been almost entirely peaceful-- no more rampant looting, no more police precincts set on fire. By and  large, there had been just peaceful protests in our great American  tradition.   In my home State of Kentucky, in Louisville, just like around the  Nation, hundreds gathered to remember Breonna Taylor on what would have  been her 27th birthday and to continue to call for answers. In  Lexington, a moment of silence was held at an historic former slave  market. Then a group marched to police headquarters. Police officers,  including the chief, came out and met them in civil discourse. And,  while a lot of ink has been spilled recently about our big cities, we  cannot miss that this moment is echoing throughout smalltown America as  well.   In Henderson, in western Kentucky, 200 people--protesters, law  enforcement, and local leaders alike--gathered for an interfaith prayer  vigil. In southeastern Kentucky, in Corbin, more than 100 gathered for  a peaceful demonstration that included a prayerful moment of silence.  The police officers keeping watch joined in. In Hazard, a town of about  5,000 people in eastern Kentucky, citizens gathered for what they  called a ``march of love.'' It was the same story in Benton, in  Danville, in Morehead--all around the Commonwealth and all around the  country. Our  [[Page S2748]]  country has remembered that peace and protest can and must coexist.   The vast majority of the men and women in law enforcement across our  country are not evil, are not racist, do not wake up every morning  looking for violence. We are reminded of their bravery every time a  citizen needs to dial 9-1-1, and they rush toward danger. We were all  reminded again this past weekend, as these professionals bravely kept  watch over demonstrations, including ones where they themselves had  been called racist or evil or were denigrated in the worst ways because  of their uniforms and their badges.   So, if peaceful protesters rightly do not want to be lumped in with a  subset of looters and rioters who seek destruction, then the vast  majority of brave police officers cannot be lumped in with the very  worst examples of heinous behavior. It is that simple. But, instead, we  are already seeing outlandish calls to defund the police or to abolish  the police take root within the leftwing leadership class. The  president of the City Council in Minneapolis has proclaimed she can  ``imagine a future without police.'' One of her fellow council members  put it even more clearly: ``This council is going to dismantle this  police department.''   To be clear as to what this effort is about, one of the local groups  informing this push in Minnesota has literally stated that arts  programs and mental health resources will be more effective at stopping  crime than will be armed cops. Instead of ``strangers armed with  guns,'' they say other professionals like social workers should be the  ones to ``respond to crises in our community.''   I am all for social work and mental health, but call me old- fashioned--I think you may actually want a police officer to stop a  criminal and arrest him before we try to work through his feelings.   Well, even if some leftwing leaders fall for this nonsense, I have a  feeling the American people are too smart for that. They know that what  happened to George Floyd was totally abhorrent. They also know that  riots and looting are unacceptable. They also know that well-trained  law enforcement officers are an important part of creating safe  communities, not something to defund or abolish.   So I am proud that Americans across the country can protest in safety  and peace. I am proud that their neighbors continue to answer the call  to protect and to serve, and I am hopeful that, with unity and mutual  respect, we can continue this important national discussion to ensure  justice and equal protection under the law                            ____________________     Mr. President, on an entirely different subject, while  the Senate remains the only Chamber in this Capitol with its lights on,  we are going to continue with legislative work for the country. We will  take our first vote today to advance the Great American Outdoors Act--a  generational bill from Senator Daines and Senator Gardner--that will  secure the future of our Nation's natural treasures.   America is home to 419 national park sites, 567 national wildlife  refuges, and hundreds of millions of acres of public lands. Every year,  millions of Americans turn to these lands for recreation, inspiration,  and for their livelihoods. These resources exist because of the  visionary actions of prior Congresses. Now it is our turn to secure  them for generations yet to come.   Our colleagues' legislation does two big things: It improves access  to parks and public lands by investing in maintenance and upkeep, and  it secures permanent support for the missions of the Land and Water  Conservation Fund.   Their legislation has already persuaded 59 cosponsors here in the  Senate. It has earned the bipartisan endorsement of the last six former  Secretaries of the Interior, and a diverse coalition of independent  advocates--from The Nature Conservancy to the Outdoor Industry  Association to the American Battlefield Trust--have called on us to  pass this bill.   This bill has unusually broad, bipartisan, and vocal support because  the issues at hand affect so many different communities so concretely.  Every year, visitors to America's national parks bring more than $40  billion in economic impact to the gateway towns that surround them. The  State and local parks, stewarded by the LWCF, help to generate another  $166 billion in local economic activity and support more than 1.1  million jobs.   My fellow Kentuckians and I know this firsthand. At least 120,000  jobs are supported by active outdoor recreation in the Commonwealth.  From hunters and anglers in the Daniel Boone National Forest to  tourists visiting Mammoth Cave, our State's natural treasures occasion  nearly $13 billion in annual consumer spending. Yet Kentuckians also  know that tight budgets for maintenance often mean that historic sites  go without important repairs and upgrades that would ensure safe access  and smooth operations. So we are acutely aware of the need to address  the deferred maintenance backlog, which this legislation tackles head- on.   So I am very grateful to our colleagues from Montana and Colorado for  shepherding this legislation. I am proud of the stand they have taken  in support of our Nation's natural wonders and the millions of American  livelihoods that depend on them. I look forward to discussing this  landmark legislation more in the days ahead, to supporting it here on  the floor, and to urging every one of my colleagues to join in.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
