 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6168) to increase, effective as of December 1, 2020, the  rates of compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities  and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for the  survivors of certain disabled veterans, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6168         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' Compensation Cost-      of-Living Adjustment Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. INCREASE IN RATES OF DISABILITY COMPENSATION AND                     DEPENDENCY AND INDEMNITY COMPENSATION.         (a) Rate Adjustment.--Effective on December 1, 2020, the       Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall increase, in accordance       with subsection (c), the dollar amounts in effect on November       30, 2020, for the payment of disability compensation and       dependency and indemnity compensation under the provisions       specified in subsection (b).        (b) Amounts To Be Increased.--The dollar amounts to be       increased pursuant to subsection (a) are the following:        (1) Wartime disability compensation.--Each of the dollar       amounts under section 1114 of title 38, United States Code.        (2) Additional compensation for dependents.--Each of the       dollar amounts under section 1115(1) of such title.        (3) Clothing allowance.--The dollar amount under section       1162 of such title.

(c) Determination of Increase.--Each dollar amount       described in subsection (b) shall be increased by the same       percentage as the percentage by which benefit amounts payable       under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et       seq.) are increased effective December 1, 2020, as a result       of a determination under section 215(i) of such Act (42       U.S.C. 415(i)).        (d) Special Rule.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may       adjust administratively, consistent with the increases made       under subsection (a), the rates of disability compensation       payable to persons under section 10 of Public Law 85-857 (72       Stat. 1263) who have not received compensation under chapter       11 of title 38, United States Code.       SEC. 3. PUBLICATION OF ADJUSTED RATES.         The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall publish in the       Federal Register the amounts specified in section 2(b), as       increased under that section, not later than the date on       which the matters specified in section 215(i)(2)(D) of the       Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)(2)(D)) are required to       be published by reason of a determination made under section       215(i) of such Act during fiscal year 2021.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous materials on H.R. 6168.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6168, the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living  Adjustment Act of 2020 increases veterans' disability compensation at  the same rate as the annual Social Security increase. This puts a  little extra money in the pockets of our disabled veterans and their  families to make sure VA benefits keep pace with inflation.   While this increase may be a small one, it is an essential one that  veterans and their families rely on us passing each year. In my time as  chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have had the opportunity  to speak to and know many veterans. Many of them highlight this bill as  a priority for them and their families.   The cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, is vital for ensuring that  veterans' benefits do not decline due to changes in the economy. For  veterans with service-connected disabilities, this annual change is an  assurance to them and their families that their benefits will remain  consistent. It is a guarantee we make to them and a great source of  comfort to many veterans and their families.   As our country deals with the novel coronavirus pandemic, and the  severe economic effects it will have, it is more important than ever  that we pass this yearly COLA increase so that veterans and their  families trust that their benefits will not decline due to inflation.  [[Page H2328]]    I want to recognize the work of the Disability Assistance and  Memorial Affairs Subcommittee chair, Elaine Luria, for introducing H.R.  6168. I wholeheartedly support H.R. 6168, and urge all of my colleagues  to do so as well.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Luria), my good friend and the chairwoman of the  Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee, the author of  H.R. 6168, and a former naval commander.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, urge all of my colleagues to join me  in passing H.R. 6168.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3414) to authorize major medical facility projects for the  Department of Veterans Affairs for fiscal year 2020, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3414         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Major Medical Facility       Authorization Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF MAJOR MEDICAL FACILITY PROJECTS OF                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS FOR FISCAL YEAR                     2020.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may       carry out the following major medical facility projects in       fiscal year 2020 at the locations specified and in an amount       for each project not to exceed the amount specified for such       location:        (1) Construction of an outpatient clinic and national       cemetery in Alameda, California, in an amount not to exceed       $113,332,000.        (2) Realignment and closure of the Livermore Campus in       Livermore, California, in an amount not to exceed       $311,730,000.        (3) Construction of a new medical facility in Louisville,       Kentucky, in an amount not to exceed $860,000,000.        (4) Construction relating to flood recovery of the medical       center in Manhattan, New York, in an amount not to exceed       $372,600,000.        (5) Construction of a spinal cord injury building with a       community living center, including a parking garage, in San       Diego, California, in an amount not to exceed $230,840,000.        (6) Completion of construction of a medical facility       project, including a parking garage, in San Juan, Puerto       Rico, in an amount not to exceed $307,000,000.        (7) Construction of a new critical care center in West Los       Angeles, California, in an amount not to exceed $75,790,000.        (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized       to be appropriated to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for       fiscal year 2020 or the year in which funds are appropriated       for the Construction, Major Projects account, $2,271,292,000       for the projects authorized in subsection (a).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on S. 3414.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3414, the Major Medical  Facility Authorization Act of 2020.   Each year the Department of Veterans Affairs submits an annual budget  request to Congress, and then it is our job to authorize and  appropriate the funding that VA needs to care for America's veterans  and their families.   Within that larger funding request is VA's request for funds to  replace and modernize its medical facilities. This year's major  construction requests total $2.27 billion, and will build a new  critical care center in West Los Angeles, California; complete  construction of a medical facility project in San Juan, Puerto Rico;  construct a spinal cord injury center with a community living center in  San Diego, California; complete flood recovery construction at the  medical center in Manhattan, New York; and fully fund the medical  facility replacement project in Louisville, Kentucky; as well as  construct an outpatient clinic and a national cemetery in Alameda,  California; and finally, realign the Livermore, California campus.   Mr. Speaker, with a major construction need that totals more than $15  billion, this authorization takes needed steps to reduce the backlog of  major construction projects.   It is no secret that VA's infrastructure is old. The average age of  its facilities is 60. The Secretary of the VA himself, Secretary  Wilkie, emphasized this point by making the statement: There are  several VA facilities that Abraham Lincoln would recognize.  [[Page H2329]]    Even with outdated facilities, the Annals of Internal Medicine found  in a 2018 report that VA provides better care than private options in  most cases. That is right. VA provides better care, even though they  are working from outdated facilities. What would those findings look  like if VA was competing with a modern infrastructure?   Mr. Speaker, not only does VA provide better care, veterans want to  use VA-delivered healthcare. A survey conducted by the Veterans of  Foreign Wars found that 92 percent of veterans who participated in the  survey responded that fixing VA facilities was the best way to improve  VA's delivery of healthcare to veterans.   Ninety percent of respondents who use VA stated they would recommend  VA healthcare to another veteran.   It is clear that veterans, given the option, want to preserve the VA  healthcare system and feel that it is a quality option for veterans to  receive care.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I support S. 3414. I thank Senator Moran,  the chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, for  prioritizing and passing this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0930     Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote  ``yes'' on passage of this important legislation, S. 3414, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3084) to amend title 38, United States Code, to modify the  limitation on pay for certain high-level employees and officers of the  Department of Veterans Affairs, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3084         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. MODIFICATION OF PAY LIMITATION FOR CERTAIN HIGH-                    LEVEL EMPLOYEES AND OFFICERS OF THE DEPARTMENT                     OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) Modification.--Section 7404(d) of title 38, United       States Code, is amended by inserting ``and except for       individuals appointed under sections 7401(4) and 7306 of this       title,'' after ``section 7457 of this title,''.        (b) Waivers.--        (1) In general.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may       waive the limitation described in section 7404(d) of such       title, as in effect on the day before the date of the       enactment of this Act, on the amount of basic pay payable to       individuals appointed under section 7401(4) or 7306 of such       title for basic pay payable during the period--        (A) beginning on November 1, 2010; and        (B) ending on the day before the date of the enactment of       this Act.        (2) Form.--The Secretary shall prescribe the form for       requesting a waiver under paragraph (1).        (3) Treatment of waiver.--A decision not to grant a waiver       under paragraph (1) shall not be treated as an adverse action       and is not subject to further appeal, third-party review, or       judicial review.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on S. 3084, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3084, as amended, a bill to  modify the limitation on pay for certain high-level employees and  officers of the Department of Veterans Affairs.   This legislation retroactively authorizes VA to waive a limitation  for basic pay for SES-equivalent employees employed at VA dating back  to November 1, 2010. These are senior-level clinicians who oversee  critical VA medical operations at the VA Central Office and in Veterans  Integrated Service Networks.   Due to a conflicting interpretation of the law, these senior-level  employees were overpaid by VA for almost 10 years. VA did not notify  Congress that it had been interpreting the pay cap in its statute as  not applying to these employees until this year.   Mr. Speaker, the Office of Management and Budget and Office of  Personnel Management have said this is an issue that affects  approximately 40 senior VA employees, some of whom play critical  support roles in VA's response to the global COVID-19 pandemic.   Now, without this legislative fix, these employees, through no fault  of their own, will be liable for a salary overpayment, plus any  benefits tied to the salary, to include employee and agency retirement  fund contributions.   While VA could request a waiver of this debt on behalf of the  employees under the law, a waiver will not completely address the  negative financial effects these employees will experience. Their  retirement and Thrift Savings Plan matching debt cannot be corrected.   Mr. Speaker, VA has been making up the difference between the  $156,000 cap and the rate of pay that has been received by the affected  employees with bonuses, which do not count toward employee and agency  retirement fund contributions and other Federal benefits.   Since VA has faced significant challenges hiring qualified healthcare  leaders in the past, removing any remaining barriers to ensuring VA can  recruit and retain senior clinicians is crucial.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support S. 3084, as amended, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I associate myself with the remarks about the memory of our recently  departed former Member. Of course, all of our Vietnam veterans who paid  the ultimate sacrifice but also those who came back from that service  in that war, we all owe a debt of gratitude toward them.   I recall my own uncle, who, unfortunately, committed suicide. I  remember coming back from school and learning that he had committed  suicide. We have so many of our Vietnam-era veterans who are extremely  vulnerable because they have underlying conditions. I know that many of  our veterans have been playing leadership roles among their neighbors  to lead their neighbors in responding to COVID-19, the novel  coronavirus.   I thank all of those veterans across our country for leading that  effort. Coming off of the Memorial Day weekend, it is certainly always  a poignant holiday that we observe in recognition of those who made the  ultimate sacrifice.   With regard to S. 3084, I urge my colleagues to pass it. It is the  right thing to do. We need to do right by the senior leaders of the VA.  We need to make sure that we continue to attract the very best to serve  our veterans in the service of the Veterans Department.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
