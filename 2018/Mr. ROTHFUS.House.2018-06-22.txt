 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to  me.   Mr. Chairman, I rise to urge my colleagues to support this amendment  to H.R. 6, and I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Keating), for his work on this effort. We have  worked before on this issue of naloxone, and it is great that he is  bringing forth this amendment. I am happy to be cosponsoring it with  him.   The House has been doing amazing, wide-ranging work over the last 2  weeks to combat the opioid crisis, and  [[Page H5566]]  I am proud to have assisted with these efforts.   The amendment that I have cojoined with Congressman Keating today is  simple. It instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to give  additional guidance to prescribing naloxone.   Naloxone is the drug used to reverse opioid overdoses, a situation  that far too many Americans have found themselves in across the country  and across western Pennsylvania.   Opioid addiction is tearing families apart. Unfortunately, an  overdose is frequently the grim end to a long struggle.   If we can help some of our fellow Americans come back from the brink  with increased knowledge for our Nation's medical professionals, I see  no reason not to do it.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I again  thank Congressman Keating for his leadership on this.
