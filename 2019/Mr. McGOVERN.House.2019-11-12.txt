 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlelady from the  District of Columbia, the Honorable Eleanor Holmes Norton, for leading  this special order today on the life of Austin Tice.   In November 2016, I had the privilege of meeting for the first time,  Austin Tice's mother, Debra. It was at the Newseum, where Reporters  Without Borders and the Newseum were launching a campaign that ran a  banner on the Newseum's facade featuring Austin.   The banner was showing on the International Day to End Impunity for  Crimes Against Journalists. The banner had a simple message next to a  photo of Austin's face, ``Held captive for being a journalist since  August 2012.''   Austin Tice is the only American journalist being held captive in  Syria. The banner at the Newseum is supposed to continue to run until  he is safely returned home to his family.   Today, November 12, 2019, Austin remains in captivity. I had the  privilege of meeting his parents Marc and Debra Tice in September. They  brought me up-to-date on Austin's captivity, and the many efforts to  press for his freedom.   Austin Tice is a graduate of the Georgetown School of Foreign Service  and many of Georgetown's students and faculty have taken up his cause.  He served as a Marine officer and returned home to study at the  Georgetown School of Law. But when he saw the carnage inside Syria, he  felt a calling to report on the Syrian human crisis. Working as a  freelance journalist and photographer for McClatchey newspapers, his  images, interviews and reports soon appeared in the Washington Post,  McClatchey, Agence France-Presse and other news media.   He intended to leave Syria after his 31st birthday, on August 11,  2012, after he filed his last story. On August 14th, he left for  Lebanon by car from Damascus. Shortly after, we know that he was  stopped and detained at a checkpoint, most likely in rebel control.  Five weeks later, a video was posted on a pro-government website by  people who appeared to be Islamist militants. There has been no contact  with his captors.   Marc and Debra continue their efforts to find and release their son.  The State Department believes that he is still alive. Other countries  have offered their services as intermediaries. And national and  international campaigns have been mounted to support him, his family,  and the many other journalists from many nations who are in captivity  or held hostage around the world.   Congress has sent several letters, introduced bills, and like today,  taken to the floor of the House of Representatives to raise his case  and declare our sympathy and solidarity with his family, friends and  colleagues.   We will not stop until Austin is free and reunited with his family.                            ____________________
