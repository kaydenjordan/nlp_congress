 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Clyburn for  inviting the delegation to participate in honoring the late Senator  Ernest F. ``Fritz'' Hollings.   Every day, when I travel across South Carolina, I am reminded of an  extraordinary achievement of Senator Hollings, when he served as  Governor. He helped establish the technical college education system to  develop trained workers in manufacturing. This enabled South Carolina  to recruit new industry, foreign and domestic.   As Governor, there was no auto production, there was no tire  production in our State. Today, because of the highly skilled, trained  workers, South Carolina is the leading exporter of cars from any State  in America. Two years ago, this was $10.4 billion of product. South  Carolina is now the largest manufacturer and exporter of tires of any  State. Thousands of jobs have been created.   Our citizens will always cherish the vision of Senator Hollings to  help families have fulfilling lives. Our thoughts and prayers are with  the Hollings family and his many friends.
