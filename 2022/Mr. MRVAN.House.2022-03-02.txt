 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today in support of  Honoring our PACT Act.   Respectfully, the impact of this piece of legislation will be  veterans receive world-class healthcare.   As I meet with veterans and veteran groups from northwest Indiana, I  continue to be grateful every day for the selfless service and  sacrifice by our veterans and their families.   Just yesterday, less than 24 hours ago, a veteran representing the  DAV, came to me who had two forms of cancer, who was advocating not  only for himself but other veterans to make sure they received the care  and the necessity of care that they deserve, as we have a  responsibility to ensure that all veterans receive world-class  healthcare when they return home from protecting our freedoms and  defending our democracy.   I commend Chairman Takano for his consistent advocacy and leadership  to bring this measure to the floor today.   I appreciate the announcement yesterday that the VA will process  claims for toxic-exposed veterans with certain rare respiratory  cancers. More must be done. I encourage all my colleagues to vote for  the Honoring our PACT Act so  [[Page H1234]]  that a regular and transparent process is established to ensure that  all issues facing toxic-exposed veterans are comprehensively addressed.   As I stated when I opened, the impact of this legislation is that  veterans receive the world-class healthcare they deserve.                                time  1315
