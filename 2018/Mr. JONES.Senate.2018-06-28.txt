 Mr. President, today with deep sadness, but also  with reverence, I wish to remember Charles Martin ``C.M.'' Newton, who  died on Monday, June 4, 2018. C.M. Newton was one of the most  influential coaches in college sports, whose skills I was fortunate to  witness firsthand during my time as an undergraduate student at the  University of Alabama. Coach Newton integrated the Alabama Crimson Tide  men's basketball team in 1969 and led them to three Southeastern  Conference, SEC, titles from 1974-1976. He also led the Vanderbilt  University Commodores to the Sweet Sixteen in the 1988 NCAA Tournament  before leaving to lead the athletic department at the University of  Kentucky, his alma mater. At Kentucky, he not only continued the  Wildcat tradition of winning NCAA men's basketball championships, he  once again broke down barriers by hiring the first Black women's and  men's coaches in UK history.   C.M. Newton was born in Rockwood, TN, on February 2, 1930. As a  student at the University of Kentucky, he played on the baseball team,  as well as the 1951 championship-winning men's basketball team. He  began his coaching career at Transylvania University before moving to  Alabama and, later, Vanderbilt. In addition to coaching, he served as  an assistant SEC commissioner. After leading Alabama to three  conference titles and six postseason visits, he headed to Vanderbilt in  1981, before returning to Kentucky in 1989. His success as a basketball  coach and as an athletic director led him to oversee the 1992 and 1996  Olympic men's basketball team rosters, which included the famous 1992  ``Dream Team'' led by Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, as  well as Charles Barkley, an Alabama native.   On a personal note, I have looked up to Coach Newton since before I  ever set foot on campus at the University of Alabama. In May 1972, he  spoke at a Birmingham Kiwanis Club luncheon where I received the Youth  of the Year Award during my senior year of high school. He spoke of  leadership, of integrity, and of the need to fulfill the promise of  America. He challenged all of the students in attendance that day to be  the best we could be for ourselves, our families, and our communities.   Forty-six years later, I can remember his advice just as clearly as  the day he gave it. I hope, in some way, we have each lived up to his  challenge.   Years later, Coach Newton went on to receive the John Bunn Lifetime  Achievement Award in 1997, an annual award given to an individual who  has contributed significantly to the sport of basketball, and was  inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2000.   My wife, Louise, and I extend our sincerest condolences to Coach  Newton's wife, Nancy, his three children, and the entire extended  community of athletes and fans on whom he made a positive impact. His  legacy lives on in each of us.                            ____________________
