 Mr. Speaker, today I stand before you,  honored to share the progress we have made in improving the lives of  eastern North Carolinians. Together we have cosponsored 100 bipartisan  bills that address our communities' most pressing needs.   My commitment to put aside partisanship and focus on our shared  values is stronger than ever. Working together, we can accelerate job  creation, expand educational opportunities, and champion affordable  healthcare for families across the First Congressional District.   This isn't just about the present, but it is about creating a  brighter future for the next generation. With every bill I cosponsor, I  envision a community where our children have boundless opportunities to  succeed.   I am immensely proud of the bipartisan progress we have achieved. Mr.  Speaker, let's continue to bridge divides, forge new pathways, and  create a legacy of positive change that will inspire generations to  come.                            ____________________
