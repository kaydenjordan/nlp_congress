 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to two law  enforcement officers in my district.   Police Officer Benito Chavez was injured in the line of duty  protecting our community in a senseless act of violence after a car  chase last week. He has only been with the Kittitas Police Department  for 8 months, so he has many years of service ahead of him. I am happy  to know that he is home with his family and his wife, and I thank him  for his service, wish him a speedy recovery, and hope that he will be  back on the job soon.   On a much sadder note, I, Kittitas County, and the whole Eighth  District mourn the loss of a hero, Deputy Sheriff Ryan Thompson who  lost his life in the line of duty on March 19. It is heartbreaking that  Deputy Sheriff Thompson leaves behind his wife and three children. I  send my deepest condolences to his family, his friends, and his  colleagues who have been hit hard by this tragedy. We will be forever  grateful for his service to our community and to our State.   We all owe such a debt of gratitude to Officer Chavez, Deputy Sheriff  Thompson, and all law enforcement professionals who put themselves at  risk every day to keep our community safe.                            ____________________
