 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to remember the life of  Brennan Stewart.   Brennan attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October 1. He  was an aspiring country musician who loved to sing while he played his  guitar. He enjoyed hunting; taking trips to his family's cabin in Moab,  Utah; and watching his favorite teams, the Atlanta Braves and the San  Francisco 49ers. He loved riding dirt bikes and is remembered as being  the life of the party.   Brennan would always put others before himself. He died at the Route  91 festival while he was shielding his girlfriend from gunfire and  helping others to safety. He is also remembered as a man who could give  anyone the shirt off his back and for being a genuine man.   I would like to extend my condolences to Brennan Stewart's family and  friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada,  and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
