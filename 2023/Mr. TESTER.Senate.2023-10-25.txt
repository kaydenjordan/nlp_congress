 Madam President, I want to thank the Senator from  Louisiana.   I rise in support of the Kennedy amendment and in support of the  Second Amendment rights of veterans in Montana and across this country.   It is not right that a DC bureaucrat at the VA could take away  veterans' legal rights to their firearms simply because they need  assistance in managing their finances.   A Montana veteran and mental health advocate told me that the VA's  longstanding policy to threaten veterans' constitutional rights, who  ask  [[Page S5169]]  for help in managing their affairs, has been a barrier to veterans  receiving help for years. It is time to end it so veterans can reach  out for the financial help they need and the mental help they need.   I agree and don't believe someone who has served this country and who  needs a fiduciary should have to hire a lawyer and go back to court to  get their Second Amendment rights back.   I yield to Senator Kennedy.
