 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5509, the Innovations in  Mentoring, Training, and Apprenticeships Act. I would like to thank  Majority Leader McCarthy for introducing this bill.                                time  2130    Building a workforce with skills in the STEM fields--science,  technology, engineering, and math--which can meet the demands of our  continually evolving economy is one of the most pressing challenges  that we face today.   Many companies are having difficulty recruiting and retaining workers  with sufficient STEM skills for their needs. This STEM skills gap has  existed for years and is continuing to widen. With companies across all  economic sectors increasing their reliance on data, automation, and  technology-driven business models, the need for STEM workers has never  been greater.   Employers are increasingly concerned that their inability to hire  employees with the technical skills they need will affect their  capacity to innovate, increase production, and expand internationally.  Make no mistake: America's future economic prosperity is on the line.   High schools, community colleges, and universities have been slow to  respond, struggling to adapt their curriculum to keep pace with the  rapidly evolving needs of industry. There is a need to innovate and  encourage partnerships between educators in the private sector to  better prepare the next generation of skilled technical workers.   Apprenticeships have garnered significant attention in recent years  because of the potential to bridge the STEM skills gap. Apprenticeships  offer workers practical hands-on training, nationally recognized  credentials, and the potential to earn credit towards an associate's or  bachelor's degree. At the completion of an apprenticeship, most workers  are on the path to a long-term, well-paying career with little or no  education-related debt.   By investing in education and on-the-job training for their workers,  employers can develop a workforce equipped with a set of skills  tailored to the specific needs of their businesses.   Despite the benefits for employers and employees, apprenticeships  remain underutilized in the United States when compared with other  developed nations. President Obama first called for expanded access to  apprenticeships in his 2014 State of the Union Address. In 2016,  Congress appropriated funding for the Department of Labor in support of  expanding entrepreneurships.   H.R. 5509 builds on these efforts and ongoing activities at the  National Science Foundation by providing support for the improvement of  STEM degree programs and apprenticeship programs in partnership with  universities and local employers. This legislation also supports  research to find lessons learned from international approaches to  skilled technical workforce development.   Mr. Speaker, we must prepare a workforce that keeps pace with needs  of industry if we are to reach our full economic potential and remain  the global leaders in innovation. H.R. 5509 is a good step in that  direction.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 5509 because it  recognizes the great work under way in National Science Foundation's  Advanced Technological Education Program. This program works to promote  the development of our STEM technical workforce and ensures that it  continues to be prioritized going forward.   As my colleagues are aware, I have two degrees in engineering. My  wife also has a degree in math. This is part of the reason I am an  ardent supporter of STEM education, especially education that is  aligned with the requirements for in-demand careers.   One such program in my district is called the National Center for  Systems Security and Information Assurance at Moraine Valley Community  College. Since 2003, it has received Advanced Technological Education  funding from NSF to be a national center of excellence in cybersecurity  education. The college provides students with real-world learning  experiences and provides curriculum, instructional materials, and  professional development for cybersecurity educators around the world.   We all know that there is a massive nationwide need for cybersecurity  professionals. According to the Department of Homeland Security's  National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education, there are currently  over 301,000 open jobs in cybersecurity, including over 13,000 in the  public sector.   To make progress in meeting this need as well as the need in other  STEM fields, we will need many more innovative education programs like  the one at Moraine Valley and those promoted by H.R. 5509. This type of  education benefits students, employers, our economy, and our national  security, and it is worthy of this Chamber's support.   I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson for  their work on this bill. I thank Chairman Smith for his bipartisan work  on the three bills that we are doing here tonight, and I am hopeful  that perhaps there will be more to do before the end of this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6229, the National Institute  of Standards and Technology Reauthorization Act of 2018, and I thank  Chairwoman Comstock for sponsoring this bill.   This is a bipartisan bill that provides support for NIST's important  work carrying out scientific and technical research, and assisting  small- and medium-sized U.S. manufacturers. The agency's work helps to  advance standards development in critical areas of innovation across  all sectors of our economy.   NIST's core mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial  competitiveness. Through its laboratories and user facilities, NIST  carries out world-class measurement science and facilitates the  development of standards for emerging technologies.   Standards ensure users that promising technologies have been  rigorously tested for safety, effectiveness, and reliability. NIST  provides its services and expertise to other agencies, academic  researchers, and the private sector.   This bill provides funding to support NIST's work in critical areas  of national importance, including advanced communications,  cybersecurity and privacy, the Internet of Things, quantum information  science, and infrastructure resilience. The wireless demands of the  21st century require the advances in measurement science that NIST is  carrying out.   The devastating hurricanes and other natural disasters that have  plagued our communities underscore the importance of NIST's work in  disaster resiliency and new infrastructure materials.   In addition, this bill provides significant funding for NIST's  quantum information science and artificial intelligence research  programs. Quantum technology has promising applications in healthcare,  navigation, encryption, and many other areas. We are only beginning to  explore the significant advances that artificial intelligence, or AI,  may bring to the world.   At the same time, there are significant policy implications for AI,  and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on issues  dealing with ethics, workforce impacts, and the human-AI interface as  these technologies move forward.   Finally, with five Nobel Prize-winning scientists in its ranks, NIST  continues to attract some of the Nation's leading scientists. Even so,  recruiting and retaining top talent is a challenge, and this bill  provides flexibility to help NIST bring on and train the best and  brightest measurement scientists in order to remain at the leading edge  of emerging technologies.   I am also happy to see the bill increases support for the labs  program and funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership  program. In the future, I hope my colleagues will support increases for  necessary improvement to NIST's aging lab infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6229, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, NIST's expertise across many fields is critical to our  economy, our research enterprise, and our manufacturing sector. This  bill puts NIST in a strong position to carry out its work through the  end of fiscal 2019.   I want to particularly highlight the strong support for the Hollings  Manufacturing Extension Partnership and the Manufacturing USA programs,  which receive a robust authorization under the Industrial Technology  Services account, and I want to thank my majority colleagues on the  Science, Space, and Technology Committee for working with me to match  the agency request for fiscal year 2019.   I have a strong relationship with Manufacturing USA's Digital  Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute located in Chicago, just  outside my district. Through partnerships with universities,  manufacturers, nonprofits, and government entities, they work to  develop the technology-enabled manufacturing tools industry needs,  pilot them on the factory floor, and train the manufacturing workforce.   The digital manufacturing hub is just 1 of 14 Manufacturing USA  institutes across the country, each with its own technology focus.  Together, they are working to ensure that we have a competitive  manufacturing sector in the U.S. into the future.   Manufacturing USA and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership play a  key role in keeping our economy strong and creating the jobs of  tomorrow.   Beyond manufacturing, I also want to highlight the critical position  pay authority this bill gives NIST to hire talented cybersecurity and  quantum information science professionals.                                time  2200    It is often difficult for Federal agencies to attract top-level  talent in these fields, because the Federal pay scale cannot compete  with the private sector.   This bill grants a limited exemption to the Federal pay scale to  ensure that NIST will have access to the right people to lead the  Nation and the world in cybersecurity and quantum information science.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairwoman Comstock again for  introducing this bill. I want to urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6398, the Department of Energy  Veterans' Health Initiative Act, and I thank Mr. Norman for introducing  this bill.   This bill authorizes the Department of Energy to conduct  collaborative research with the Department of Veterans Affairs to  address large and complex data management challenges associated with  veterans' healthcare issues.   H.R. 6398 also directs the DOE to carry out a 2-year research pilot  program to advance research in artificial intelligence and data  analytics for a broad range of applications.   These technologies have the potential to significantly improve the  efficiency of the use and distribution of our Nation's resources.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the majority and minority members  of the Veterans' Affairs Committee for working with the Science, Space,  and Technology Committee to improve this legislation. Together, I  believe we have ensured that this bill will be a positive step toward  tackling some of the critical problems that the VA is currently facing  in providing our veterans with the care they deserve when they come  home.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I am sure my colleagues on both sides of the aisle agree  that supporting technology to improve the lives of our veterans should  be a high priority. Unfortunately, many face an uphill battle to  overcome the physical and mental toll of war once they return home.  Those who sacrificed so much for our country deserve our best efforts  to provide them with the latest technologies to improve their quality  of life.   There are almost 20 million veterans in our Nation today, and just  under half are enrolled in the Department of Veterans Affairs  healthcare system. The health records generated from decades of care  provide a trove of information that may lead to more accurate diagnoses  and treatment of certain conditions and diseases.   High-performance computing and machine learning can help analyze this  massive amount of data to make it more useful for delivering better  health outcomes, not only for veterans, but also the general  population.   The Federal Government has made strategic investments over the years  to advance data analytics in data science research and development. We  have also invested in supercomputing facilities at our national labs,  including the Leadership Computing Facility at Argonne National Lab in  my district.   The programs created by this bill will take advantage of these  resources to improve health, deliver a high quality of life, and lower  treatment costs while advancing American leadership and artificial  intelligence and data analytics.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
