 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Fischbach for  allowing me to speak and for her leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th anniversary of the  Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision. Over the past five decades, we  have seen the devastation of this ruling which has led to the loss of  tens of millions of innocent lives here in the United States.   I am heartened by the Supreme Court's reversal of this decision in  Dobbs v. Jackson last year and the countless lives that will now be  saved each year.   For me and my family, the sanctity of life is deeply personal. Nearly  20 years ago, my wife, Jodi, and I became parents of a baby born with  Down syndrome. Whenever I look at my son, Isaac, I see a miracle of  God's special gift to our family.   Today, Isaac is an incredible, kind, and charming young man, and we  know his future is bright.   Now imagine what kind of world we would be living in if every child  was given the same chance to reach their potential. The world would be  much better, and our collective future would be much brighter.   Since the start of the current Congress, the House has voted on two  bills to protect and support life. I am proud that all of my Republican  colleagues joined me in supporting these very important measures.   Unfortunately, very few of my Democrat colleagues joined us in  support.   To those Democrats who joined us in defending life: I commend you for  your courage to stand up to the radical wing of your party which pushes  for abortion on demand without limits and paid for with taxpayer  dollars.   The right to life should not be a partisan issue. I extend an olive  branch to all of my Democratic colleagues from across the aisle and  encourage them to join us in our fight for life and to protect the most  innocent among us--the unborn. It is up to us to do what is right and  always defend life.
