 Mr. President, I want to start by thanking my  colleague, the Senator from Arkansas, for his longtime leadership on a  range of important national security issues, including his attention  and focus on the threat posed by Huawei and ZTE, which, as he  explained, are two Chinese telecommunications companies that pose a  risk not just to our security but also to the privacy of American  citizens.   This is a threat that is here and now, and it is not one we have not  been aware of for a long time. I think it is important to look back  because this didn't sneak up on us overnight.   If you go back to the year 2012, the House Intelligence Committee  sounded the alarm on Huawei and ZTE in a bipartisan report that stated  that ``China has the means, opportunity, and motive to use  telecommunications companies for malicious purposes'' and that ``based  on available and classified and unclassified information, Huawei and  ZTE cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus  pose a security threat to the United States and to our systems.''   That was a House Intelligence Committee report in the year 2012.  Since then, the evidence has grown even stronger.   We know that the Government of China exercises significant control  over its telecommunications firms and that ZTE and Huawei have close  and very longstanding ties to the government. We also know that China  is one of the world's most active perpetrators of economic espionage  and cyber attacks in the United States.   In 2015, the FBI issued a report on Huawei making it clear that the  Government of China relies on signals intelligence to spy on American  citizens. American intelligence officials have long warned that Beijing  could harness this technology to steal data, eavesdrop on  conversations, or carry out cyber attacks.   We had testimony recently--in February--from the leaders of the top  U.S. intelligence agencies. Senator Cotton referenced the testimony of  the FBI Director and others, and I want to expand on the testimony of  FBI Director Chris Wray, who said:         We're deeply concerned about the risks of allowing any       company or entity that is beholden to foreign governments       that don't share our values to gain positions of power inside       our telecommunications networks. That provides the capacity       to exert pressure or control over our telecommunications       infrastructure. It provides the capacity to maliciously       modify or steal information. And it provides the capacity to       conduct undetected espionage.    That is why part of this amendment contains the very important  provision that the Senator from Arkansas mentioned that would prohibit  U.S. taxpayer dollars from being spent to purchase any equipment from  Huawei or ZTE. The Pentagon recently prohibited the sale of these  devices on U.S. military bases. The FCC has also proposed steps to  discourage American companies from using products from Huawei and ZTE.  It stands to reason--and it is totally consistent with that sentiment-- that we make it clear that U.S. Federal Government agencies should not  be purchasing this equipment that threatens our national security.   One of those companies--ZTE in specific--not only represents the kind  of threat that we have been discussing but also has been a repeated and  flagrant violator of U.S. law. They were caught a number of years ago  for cheating, and instead of coming clean, they tried to cover it up,  cheated again, and they were caught again.   Here is what the Department of Commerce said in its report about ZTE  just this past April. It said that they engaged in ``a multi-year  conspiracy to violate the U.S. trade embargo against Iran to obtain  contracts to supply, build, operate and maintain telecommunications  networks inside Iran using U.S. original equipment'' and that ZTE was  ``illegally shipping telecommunications equipment to North Korea in  violation of the Export Administration Regulations.''   The Commerce Department went on to explain that ZTE--finally, after  getting caught multiple times--``admitted to engaging in an elaborate  scheme to hide the unlicensed transactions from the U.S. Government by  deleting, destroying, removing, or sanitizing materials and  information.''   In fact, it turns out that they were violating our sanctions regime  against not only Iran and North Korea but also Sudan, Syria, and Cuba.  In fact, they had elaborate flowcharts at ZTE showing exactly how they  were going to do this. Then, when we confronted them and they said they  were going to come clean, instead they rewarded their top executives  with bonuses. That is why, when the Secretary of Commerce issued the  sanctions and imposed the blocking order on the sale of U.S.  telecommunications components to ZTE in April, he explained that the  message ZTE sent from the top was essentially to evade and then lie  about what they were doing with respect to U.S. sanctions.   Well, it is very important that we send a message, and we need to  send a message consistent with what the Secretary of Commerce did last  April. It is very important, as the Senator from Arkansas said, that we  let countries know we mean what we say. They are a flagrant violator of  those sanctions laws, and we can't let them off the hook with a slap on  the wrist because if we do that, it will undermine our credibility with  respect to our sanctions on North Korea, which are very important in  focusing the attention of North Korea on the goal of denuclearizing the  Korean Peninsula. It will send the wrong message to countries around  the world that if we catch you and you cheat again and we catch you,  you can just cut a deal that ends up being a slap on the wrist.   That is why I am very pleased to join with the Senator from Arkansas  in offering this bipartisan amendment. In addition to the two of us,  there are a number of other Senators--a bipartisan group--supporting  this legislation. I am glad it has been incorporated in the  legislation.   With that, I want to turn it back over to the Senator from Arkansas  and ask him whether he has any further thoughts on this very important  issue before us today.    Mr. President, if I may, I just want to emphasize  that final point made by the Senator from Arkansas, which is that it is  going to be very important that we keep this provision in the Defense  authorization bill as it winds its way through the process. I am  confident that there is a bipartisan commitment to doing exactly that  because we cannot back away at this point. Backing away would send a  very bad signal to ZTE and Huawei and other violators of our sanctions  or any of our other adversaries who are considering violating U.S. law  and U.S. sanctions.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, Senator  Cotton from Arkansas and I were just on the floor these past 15 minutes  explaining why this bipartisan provision is in the managers' amendment  to the bill. It is because of the threats posed by Huawei and ZTE. With  respect to ZTE specifically, it is because of its multiple flagrant  violations of U.S. law. Removing that provision would send a very bad  signal, not just to ZTE, not just to China but to anybody else around  the world watching that they can violate U.S. sanctions law with  impunity. We shouldn't be doing that.   I object.
