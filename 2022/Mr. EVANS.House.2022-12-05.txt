 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, the State Trade  Expansion Program Improvement Act.   This bill would reauthorize STEP for 4 more years and improve it in  several ways, including creating a standardized application process and  collecting performance metrics.   As a member of both the Small Business Committee and the Ways and  Means Committee, I see trade as a tool in the economic toolbox to help  small businesses expand and grow.   Since 2011, STEP has been assisting small businesses with export  development through the use of grants and introduction into the  international marketplace.   Trade helps to create and support jobs, which is good for the  economy, community, and families in Pennsylvania. Over 1.5 million jobs  were supported by international trade in 2019, which accounted for 20  percent of all jobs in the State.   Further, in 2020, nearly 15,000 companies exported goods from  Pennsylvania of which 88 percent were small-and medium-sized  enterprises.   Coming from the city of Philadelphia, where nearly half of the  population is African American, I am especially interested in finding  ways to improve minority entrepreneurship.   Many minority businesses and small businesses have a competitive  advantage in conducting international business due to their cultural  connections. It is important, and I thank the chair for showing the  leadership to at least have this discussion.   STEP has helped minority entrepreneurs gain access to the  international marketplace, which allows their businesses to grow and  thrive.   I was excited to see that STEP awarded my home State of Pennsylvania  a $400,000 grant in 2022. This will go a long way to supporting small  businesses across the State.   STEP needs to be reauthorized and improved. I am asking my colleagues  to support it. I thank the chairperson and my colleagues on the other  side for making this a bipartisan effort and a collective interest.
