 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   As a little bit of history, the gentleman from Alabama wasn't here  when we created the Transportation Security Administration. It was  created in the Aviation Subcommittee of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee. I was the ranking member; John Mica was the  chair. The provisions he referenced were not intended to oppress the  workforce.   Before 9/11, all of the securities were provided by the airlines, and  they never met a low bidder they didn't like. We had people who were  felons and people who were in the country illegally who were doing the  screening.   By the way, it was the lowest entry-level job in the airport, and we  had testimony from the Screener of the Year, once, who said: Hey, you  know, people just move through these jobs because they got to go to  McDonald's. They'll do better.   Now, we aren't treating these professionals much better than that.  They are the lowest paid Federal employees, providing security to the  billion people who flew last year. They worked through the shutdown  with no pay.  [[Page H1487]]  They don't earn much money, so they don't have a lot of savings, but  they worked through the shutdown.   These people deserve not only a pay raise, but they also deserve  workers' rights and whistleblower protections from abusive management.   The gentleman expressed concern about $1.8 billion over 10 years.  Well, join me on my FASTER bill; that is, this administration is  diverting $2 billion a year in passenger security fees. Passengers pay  the fee. It is supposed to provide security. No, it is going into the  maw of the Federal Government and being spent somewhere else. Reclaim  that money.   Don't worry about the stupid scoring stuff. Oh, it is making the  deficit look smaller. Whatever. We are charging passengers for  security. Give them the security. Give these workers a pay raise, and  give them decent workers' rights and protections.
