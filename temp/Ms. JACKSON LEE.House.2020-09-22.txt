 Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees  on the Judiciary, on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, I rise in  support of H.R. 8337, a bill that provides funding to continue the  operations of the federal government through December 11, 2020, and  avoids a wasteful and irresponsible shutdown, and also the underlying  bill.   The House, led by the Democratic majority, did its job, passing 10 of  the 12 appropriations bills earlier this year but Senate Republicans  failed to hold a single markup of appropriations bills, making it  necessary to pass this Continuing Resolution to avert a shutdown that  would only further damage our economy.   Throughout the 116th Congress, House Democrats have worked to deliver  results for the American people, passing legislation to address each  pillar of the ``For The People'' agenda: lower health care costs,  higher wages by rebuilding America, and cleaning up corruption and  strengthening our Democracy.   And over the past two years, under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi,  the House has passed nearly 600 bills, including legislation to lower  health care and prescription drug prices, raise wages, advance economic  and retirement security, end gun violence, act on the climate crisis,  protect Dreamers, and strengthen voting rights.   For example, in this Congress the House has passed and sent to the  Senate the following major legislative bills:   H.R. 1, For The People Act;   H.R. 2, Moving Forward Act;   H.R. 3, The Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act;   H.R. 4, Voting Rights Advancement Act   H.R. 5, Equality Act;   H.R. 6, The American Dream & Promise Act;   H.R. 7, Paycheck Fairness Act;   H.R. 8, Bipartisan Background Checks Act;   H.R. 9, Climate Action Now Act;   H.R. 582, Raise the Wage Act;   H.R. 1425, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act;   H.R. 1585, Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act; and   H.R. 7120, George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.   These along with many, many others are among the 340 bills sitting on  Majority Leader McConnell's desk awaiting Senate action.   Madam Speaker, in truth the Republican-controlled Senate has been  missing in action for much of the 116th Congress.   Whether it the urgent need to fortify our election systems from  confirmed foreign interference, notably from Vladimir Putin's Russia,  or lower prescription drugs prices and expanding and protecting the  right of all Americans to affordable, accessible, high quality health  care, fixing our broken immigration system, or holding a wayward  Executive to account, has failed American people in its basic duty to  promote the general welfare and provide for the common defense.   Nowhere is this more apparent than its failure to take up and vote on  the HEROES Act passed by the House in May of this year to address the  devastating budgetary and fiscal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic which  the President exacerbated by his incompetent response to the crisis.   The numbers are heartbreaking.   As of September 21, 2020, the number of lives lost to COVID-19 has  passed another grim milestone and now exceeds 200,000.   As of September 20, 2020, there were 6,812,470 cases of COVID-19,  which along with the number of lives lost leads the world.   When President Obama left office on January 20, 2017, unemployment  was at 4.7 percent; today, due to the mismanagement of the COVID-19  pandemic by President Trump and Republicans, unemployment is nearly  double at 8.4 percent.   When Trump took office in January 2017, there were 241,000 initial  unemployment insurance (UI) claims for the week ending January 28, 2017  and at the beginning of the 116th Congress in January 2019: there were  236,000 initial UI claims.   Today, due to the mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic by President  Trump and Republicans, there were 860,000 initial UI claims for the  week ending September 12, 2020.   Approximately 30 million Americans have lost the job they had just  months ago because of this Administration's ineptitude and cavalier  regard for the well-being of the American people.   Madam Speaker, during President Obama's last full year in office in  2016, the deficit was $585 billion but under the mismanagement of the  current Administration, we have seen the deficit balloon nearly seven- fold to $3.3 trillion.   Continuing this Administration's unbroken chain of woe, in 2019,  after repeated attempts by Republicans to undermine and sabotage the  Affordable Care Act, there were 33.2 million uninsured Americans, 5  million more than when President Obama left office.   It has been estimated by reputable experts that from February 2020  through May 2020 alone, an estimated 5.4 million Americans became  uninsured because of unprecedented job loss caused by the Republican  mismanagement of this pandemic.   Given the wreckage to the economy and the damage to the lives and  livelihoods of the American people, it is unconscionable that this  Administration is pursuing a lawsuit to strike down the Affordable Care  Act, which would take health care coverage away from 20 million  Americans and take away protections for 132 million persons who have  pre-existing conditions.   Madam Speaker, this country desperately needs and wants change.   While I believe that November 3, will herald that the change we need  is coming, we must keep our ship of state afloat before we can right  the course.   That is why I reluctantly support the Continuing Resolution that will  be before us.   Madam Speaker, let me briefly list several of the programs vital to  Americans that are protected or extended by H.R. 8337.   Section 103. Same Terms and Conditions for Continuing Appropriations  as FY 2020.

Section 152 extends the availability of funding for multiyear  research grants supported by the National Institutes of Health that  were interrupted in fiscal year 2020 by COVID-19 and would have expired  at the end of the fiscal year.   Section 161. Technical Correction on Veterans Benefits.

Section 172. Housing for the Elderly.

Finally, Division B of the bill contains provisions in the  jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,  including a one-year extension for surface transportation programs at  fiscal year 2020 levels and provisions shoring up the Airport and  Airway Trust Fund.   I strongly support this legislation and urge all Members to join me  in voting for its passage.    Madam Speaker, I rise enthusiastically to support  H.R. 8337, because we did our job to keep the government open, but it  is important for my constituents to know that we have supported the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because of food insecurity.   We are keeping the Census Bureau funding. I just got through working  with my constituents: Do your census. Do your census.   In addition, we got flexibility for SBA loans for our small  businesses, and, of course, the SBA disaster loans because of flooding  in my district right now.   This is what we are supposed to do. The flood insurance, we finally  saved that. We know we need it.   Aid to children, we need that as well.   And, of course, housing for the elderly; and our community health  centers are desperate in the midst of COVID-19.   Just a few hours ago, I went to visit the 20,000 flags evidencing  200,000 dead. I stood there. It was overwhelming.    The power of our failures in this administration of not doing a job,  not testing, not telling people to wear their masks, not socially  distancing: 200,000 Americans are dead.   Pass the HEROES Act now. Pass it now. Wear your masks to make a  difference in the lives of Americans.   We must do our job. I support the CR to keep the government alive.                            ____________________
