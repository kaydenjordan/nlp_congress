 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for his lifelong commitment to promoting human rights  throughout the world. I thank him, also, for his leadership in bringing  this legislation to the floor today.   Madam Speaker, I also thank Mr. McCaul, Mr. Engel, and Mr. McGovern  for their leadership, and Chris Smith, who has been working on this  issue for decades.   Madam Speaker, I rise in remembrance of the horror perpetrated by the  Chinese Government 30 years ago today and of the heroism of those who  died demanding human rights and human dignity.   Again, I salute Chairman McGovern, Chairman Engel, Chris Smith, Mr.  McCaul, Mr. Malinowski, and so many others for bringing this resolution  forward, which ensures that we do not merely remember that dark chapter  of history, but that we record it in the official proceedings of the  United States Congress.   Madam Speaker, 30 years ago, 1 million students, workers and  citizens--men and women full of passion, idealism, and courage-- peacefully marched for a better future.   They raised their Goddess of Democracy in the image of our own Statue  of Liberty. They quoted our Founders. They dared to dream of the  democracy we cherish here in the United States--not necessarily the  same kind of democracy, but for democratic freedoms. They stood up for  freedom, only to be cut down by a hail of bullets and a line of tanks.   Earlier this year, the Tiananmen Mothers, who lost loved ones in the  massacre, wrote to the Chinese leaders. Those mothers said: ``30 years  later, while the criminal evidence has been covered up . . . the hard  facts of the massacre are etched into history.   ``No one can erase it; no power, however mighty, can alter it; and no  words or tongues, however clever, can deny it.''   Today, and on all days, we reassure these mothers that we remember  and that the heroism of their children will continue to be etched in  our history.   It falls on us to remember, because China still, shamefully, tries to  hide and deny these heroes' legacy.   As the writer Lu Xun wrote: ``Lies written in ink cannot disguise by  facts written in blood.''   The memory and the spirit of the Tiananmen protestors live on in the  hearts of all those who strive for freedom in China today:   In the hearts of the Uighur communities facing unabated abuse and  repression at the hands of the Chinese Government;   In the hearts of the people living in Hong Kong, where China  continues to make a mockery of the ``one country, two systems'' pledge;   In the hearts of the Tibetan people, who, for decades, have faced a  brutal campaign to erase their religion, their culture, and their  language; and   In the hearts of journalists, human rights lawyers, Christians, and  democracy activists unjustly imprisoned.   They always say--speaking of those in prison--that one great form of  torture of the Chinese officials is to tell the prisoners that no one  remembers them, nobody knows why they are there, they are forgotten.   Well, we are here in the House of Representatives today to tell those  prisoners they are not forgotten: We know many of their names; we  convey them to Chinese officials every chance we get; and we carry them  in our hearts.   As Liu Xiaobo wrote in his final statement, ``I Have No Enemies'':  ``Freedom of expression is the foundation of human rights, the source  of humanity and the mother of truth.''   As we support those fighting for freedom from China's oppression, we  do so in the name of human rights, humanity, and truth.   If we do not speak out for human rights in China because of economic  concerns, then we lose all moral authority to talk about human rights  in any other place in the world.   In their March letter, the Tiananmen Mothers also quoted the  Holocaust survivor and Nobel Peace laureate Elie Wiesel, who once said:  ``If we forget the dead, the dead will be killed a second time.''    With this resolution, the Congress pledges to the Tiananmen  generation that we will never forget. With the spirit of the Tiananmen  protestors in our hearts, we pledge to continue to work toward our  shared dream, a dream of the day when the world's most populous nation  can be called the largest democracy.   And, again, China is a very important country. The U.S.-China  relationship is a very important relationship. At the time when this  oppression took place, China was abusing not only the rights of their  own people; they were not allowing U.S. products into China. They were  abusing our trade relationship, and they were selling technologies of  mass destruction and missile delivery systems to rogue countries.   We thought at the time if we highlighted what happened at Tiananmen  Square, where the trade deficit at the time was $5 billion a year--it  was $5 billion a year, Chairman McCaul--we thought that gave us great  leverage to free the prisoners, open their markets to our products,  stop their violations of our intellectual property rights, as well as  stop their transfer of technologies that were unsafe--$5 billion.   With corporate America, who hoped to benefit from the trade  relationship--not your everyday small- to moderate-sized businesses.  They knew the abuse of China and the trade relationship. But corporate  America weighed in with Democratic and Republican Presidents and said:  We cannot use that trade relationship, that $5 billion as leverage to  free the prisoners and make other changes. If we just proceed as we do,  everything will work out.   Well, now the trade deficit with China isn't $5 billion a year. It is  more than $5 billion a week--a week. We rode the dragon, and the dragon  will decide when we get off.   But as a tribute to corporate America, our policy was to ignore the  violations, whether it was trade violations, human rights violations,  or violations of trading missiles and other technologies to rogue  countries--and now over $5 billion a week. It was a serious, serious  mistake.                                time  1230    But as we made that mistake, we also betrayed our values, our values  of respecting the dignity and worth of every person and respecting  their aspirations for freedom of expression, freedom of religion, and  freedom of belief in this great country of China.   So with respect to our prospects for our relationship with China, I  would hope that in our trade talks with them now, that we are also  bringing up the important subject of our values as well as the dollars  that are involved in the relationship.   Again, I salute those who have been so important in this discussion.  I called  [[Page H4233]]  Mr. McGovern our spiritual leader as we traveled to China and within  China, to Tibet, and Hong Kong, and the rest, for his incredible  leadership as not only the chair of the United States-China Economic  and Security Review Commission, but the chair of the Tom Lantos Human  Rights Commission.   Madam Speaker, I urge our colleagues to give this a big strong vote.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren for  yielding and for her extraordinary leadership.   Congresswoman Lofgren has been an immigration lawyer. She has taught  immigration law, and she has served now as chair of the Subcommittee on  Immigration and Citizenship. She was masterful in bringing elements  together to make today possible. I commend our distinguished chairman,  Mr. Nadler, for his leadership, and Congresswoman Jayapal for making  this success possible.   But also, I commend Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard. When we  passed this bill on the floor a long time ago, it was her legislation.  She is the godmother--they are young godmothers--she is the godmother  of this legislation. And I commend Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez, who  was the chair of the Hispanic Caucus when we passed the bill the first  time; Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, who has been a champion on this  issue; Congresswoman Judy Chu, the chair of her caucus; Congresswoman  Karen Bass of her caucus; and Congressman Joaquin Castro of the  Hispanic Caucus--inside maneuvering, but the outside mobilization is  what made today possible.   The stories of the Dreamers elevated this issue, their stories told  with such dignity and patriotism for our country, the mobilization that  they evoked from their stories for other people to take up their cause  and their case, because it is so important to America. And today, we  are not only honoring and rewarding our Dreamers, but we are also  addressing the temporary protected status and DED recipients so that  they feel much safer.   A year ago, I stood on the floor of this House--yes, in 4-inch heels,  for 8 hours, if you want any more statistics--and told many stories of  our Dreamers. I couldn't yield because then I would give up my time, so  I told the stories of Dreamers. These Dreamers are the constant  reinvigoration of America.   Dreamers such as Fernando, who lives in my district, came to the U.S.  when he was just 9 years old. He had an excellent education, which I  will submit for the Record. He now works at UCSF--that would be the  University of California, San Francisco--Helen Diller Family  Comprehensive Cancer Center, where he is working hard to provide new  insights into deadly diseases and disorders.  [[Page H4289]]    There are other stories to tell.   To our businesses and economy, Javier came from Mexico City when he  was 5 and now employs hundreds of Americans as CEO of an investment  firm.   To technology and innovation, Saba came from Pakistan and is now a  Ph.D. candidate studying cancer and other deadly genetic diseases.   And to our security, Andrea came from Peru and is hoping to follow in  her father's footsteps as a member of the Air Force.   The list goes on and on. My colleague from California,   Mike  Thompson, is always bragging that, in California, 5,000 of our teachers  are DACA, are Dreamers. We want to give back to them.   The courage, patriotism, and determination to succeed of those young  people strengthens our Nation and they must be allowed to stay.   There is nothing partisan or political about protecting Dreamers and  TPS and DED recipients.   If the Dream Act had been brought to the floor in the last Congress  under the Republican majority and leadership, I do believe that it  would have passed under a Republican majority by strong, bipartisan  support.   Every President in recent memory--Democrat and Republican--has  understood the value of immigration to our Nation.    In his last speech as President of the United States, President  Ronald Reagan said he had an important message to communicate to the  country he loves, and he went on to say: ``Thanks to each wave of new  arrivals to this land of opportunity, we're a nation forever young,  forever bursting with energy and new ideas, and always on the cutting  edge, always leading the world to the next frontier. This quality is  vital to our future as a nation.''   President Reagan went on to say: ``If we ever closed the door to new  Americans, our leadership in the world would soon be lost.''   Today, our new Democratic House majority is advancing that leadership  in the world, in a bipartisan way, hopefully, with the American Dream  and Promise Act.   We are pleased that this legislation opens a door of opportunity to  TPS and DED recipients, who are American in every way: raising  families, starting businesses, contributing to our communities, and  fighting in our wars over decades.   Once we pass this bill--we want it to pass the Senate and be signed  by the President. We want it to be a bridge to understand why we need  comprehensive immigration reform for an immigration system that  embraces the contributions of our newcomers.   Protecting Dreamers and TPS and DED Americans is about honoring the  respect for family that is at the heart of our faith and at the heart  of who we are as Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong, bipartisan vote to pass this  legislation, and to safeguard every person's right to pursue his or her  American Dream. And to my colleagues, today, on the floor of this  House, we have the opportunity to be part of history, to be on the  right side of history, but, more importantly, to be on the right side  of the future by voting and recognizing the value of Dreamers to that  future.
