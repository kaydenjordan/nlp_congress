 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for his  leadership, but I also want to recognize Representative Blumenauer for  his decades of work on this issue.   The MORE Act is the most comprehensive marijuana reform bill in  Congress, and it is rooted in social justice. The criminalization of  marijuana and this Nation's failed war on drugs has devastated our  communities of color. It has led to over-policing, mass incarceration,  and the destruction of families. This critical legislation takes steps  to undo these harms.   Today, I urge my colleagues to vote for criminal justice reform, to  vote for an equitable marijuana industry, and to vote for beginning to  repair the harms caused by decades of racist marijuana criminalization  and enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues today to vote ``yes'' on the  MORE Act.
