 Mr. President, let me be frank. Today, our water and our  health is at risk from highly fluorinated chemicals known as PFAS.  These chemicals have been widely used commercially, and they are also  concentrated in firefighting foams used by the Department of Defense.  They are toxic, and they have been linked to serious health issues in  those who are exposed to them.   High levels of PFAS contamination exist at the former Wurtsmith Air  Force Base in Oscoda, MI, and at military sites all across our country.   My resolution would retain the Senate language prohibiting the  Department of Defense from using firefighting foams containing PFAS  chemicals to the end of 2023.   PFAS-free foams are already widely used internationally by military  services and at major hub airports, such as Heathrow and Dubai.   We must protect our troops, our firefighters, our communities, and  our water.   I urge my colleagues to support my resolution.   I yield back all remaining time.
