 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge all my  colleagues to support the Never Forget the Heroes: Permanent  Authorization of the September 11th Victims Compensation Fund Act  because it is the right thing to do.   I would like to thank my fellow New Yorkers Carolyn Maloney, Pete  King, and Jerry Nadler, who have led this fight for years, and Lee  Zeldin, who will work with me to build bipartisan support amongst the  freshman class.   Because 9/11 wasn't just an attack on New York City; Washington,  D.C.; and a field in western Pennsylvania; 9/11 was an attack on our  entire country. This was an attack on the United States of America and  everything that we stand for.   But what thousands of these 9/11 heroes and their families now face  is being forgotten because the Victims Compensation Fund, which  supports these families and these heroes in all 50 States, is running  out of money and cutting benefits by 50 to 70 percent.   That is wrong. And if we fail to make this right, shame on us. Shame  on anyone who says ``never forget'' and then turns their backs and  pretends this doesn't affect their State or their district or they're  suddenly fiscally responsible.   Shame on anyone who says that we can't afford to do this while we  spend trillions of dollars on bombs in Afghanistan.   When it comes to doing what is right, it is about keeping our  promises and honoring those who put their lives on the line and didn't  ask for anything in return.   Now is the chance to put action behind the words ``never forget.''                            ____________________
