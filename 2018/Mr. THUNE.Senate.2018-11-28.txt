 Madam President, I rise today to voice my strong support  for the nomination of Karen Dunn Kelley to be confirmed as the Deputy  Secretary of Commerce.   Ms. Dunn Kelley is well qualified to serve in this critical  leadership role at the Department of Commerce, which she has ably  filled on an acting basis for the past year.   Ms. Dunn Kelley was already confirmed once this Congress, without  opposition. She has served at the Department since August 3, 2017, as  the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, a position to which the  Senate confirmed her by voice vote.   Ms. Dunn Kelley has considerable economic and managerial expertise,  cultivated through her more than 30 years of experience in the  financial investment sector.   In her current capacity as Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, she  leads the Economics and Statistics Administration, which provides  economic analysis and distributes national economic indicators.   She also serves as the Department's administrator of statistical  programs, including the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic  Analysis.   Since being named as Acting Deputy Secretary of Commerce, she has  been responsible for the management, coordination, and implementation  of the Department's Strategic Plan, focusing on job creation and  economic growth across the Department's 12 bureaus and agencies.   The Commerce Department's mission, as stated in its 2018-2022  Strategic Plan, is to ``create the conditions for economic growth and  opportunity.''   The breadth of activities the Department undertakes to accomplish its  mission range from promoting commercial space activities to enhancing  weather forecasting, and from fishery management and trade promotion to  standards setting for emerging technologies, cybersecurity, and  privacy, to name just a few.   The Department of Commerce deserves a well-qualified and experienced  leader to continue to foster the unprecedented economic growth we see  today and preserve American leadership.   Throughout her career, Ms. Dunn Kelley has exhibited the kind of  leadership that will ensure the Department of Commerce will continue  its critical missions to promote economic growth, job creation, and  innovation.   I urge my colleagues to support Ms. Dunn Kelley's nomination.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
