 Mr. Speaker, it is my great pleasure to  introduce my pastor and friend, Dr. Brad Jurkovich, as our guest  chaplain. He has led us in prayer this morning, and we are so grateful  to have him.   Pastor Brad is the senior pastor of the First Baptist Church of  Bossier City, Louisiana. First Bossier is a multigenerational church  dedicated to reaching families throughout north Louisiana, America, and  the world. Our motto is: Every person, every family, experiencing  Christ in every way.   Pastor Brad received his bachelor of arts in biblical studies and his  master of divinity from Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in  Wake Forest, North Carolina. He received his doctor of ministry degree  from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. He  and his lovely wife, Stephanie, have four awesome children: Cassidy,  Carter, Caroline, and Catherine.   Pastor Brad is a gifted speaker and a leader with a true servant's  heart who loves Jesus and seeks to share the message of salvation with  everyone he meets. He is a man committed to reaching this generation  with the hope of Christ.   It is an honor to have him here today to ask God's blessings over us,  our work, and our Nation at this historic time.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to help me in welcoming my friend  and pastor, Dr. Brad Jurkovich.                            ____________________
