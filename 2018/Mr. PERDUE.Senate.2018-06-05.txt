 Mr. President, May 8 of this year marked the 73rd  anniversary of the end of War II in Europe. It was a time to remember  the sacrifice of over 400,000 Americans who were killed and over  650,000 Americans who were wounded while fighting to defend our  freedoms. In that spirit, I would like to call attention to the story  of one of my constituents, James Dalton, and his three brothers:  Robert, Rufus, and Harry. These four brothers served in the U.S.  military during World War II at the same time, which was extremely  rare. Their story is remarkable.   The Dalton brothers, who I am happy to say are still with us today,  were born in Charlotte, NC, along with their sister Sally. While three  of the Dalton brothers still live in Carolina, James Dalton ultimately  settled in Atlanta, GA.   Robert Dalton, Jr., the eldest brother, was deployed in 1944. He  landed in France and served as platoon leader in Company I, 3rd  Battalion, 121st Regiment of the 8th Division. On September 2, 1944, he  was wounded in action. After recovering from his wounds, he spent the  remainder of his time in Europe with the 29th Infantry Regiment and  advanced to the rank of captain. After returning to the United States,  he was discharged with the rank of major. Because of his service, he  received a Purple Heart Medal, the Bronze Star, the EAME Service Medal  with five Bronze Stars, and the World War II Victory Medal.   James Dalton entered military service in 1943 at the age of 20 and  sailed for Europe in November 1944. He served behind the in the  Rhineland and Central Europe campaigns. He achieved the rank of  technical sergeant and was decorated with the American Theater Service  Medal, EAME Service Medal with two Bronze Stars, Good Conduct Medal,  and World War II Victory Medal.   Rufus Dalton was deployed in October 1944, landing in Marseilles,  France. His unit entered the line in the Vosges Mountains in November  1944. They were in constant contact with the German Army until April  1945. At one point, Rufus was injured with a shrapnel wound to the  head; yet he still returned to his unit the next day. Rufus was awarded  the Purple Heart and Bronze star for his service.   The youngest of the four brothers, Harry, entered into military  service the day before his 18th birthday in 1945. Harry entered the  Naval Radio School and served at the Shelton Naval Station in Norfolk,  Virginia. He also received the World War II Victory Medal and achieved  the rank of yeoman third class.   The sacrifice and service of these four brothers is laudable and so  is their work in their communities after the war. Between them, the  four brothers went on to hold leadership positions in business, the  arts, charitable organizations, and their churches over the course of  long and successful careers.   I am proud to take this opportunity to honor the life and military  service of one of my constituents and his family. The story of the  Dalton brothers is an inspiration to us all. I join the entire country  in thanking them for their service in one of our country's darkest yet  most heroic hours.   Thank you.                            ____________________
