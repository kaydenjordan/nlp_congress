 Madam President, first, on appropriations, the Senate is  continuing the process.   I thank Chairman Shelby, Ranking Member Leahy, and Leader McConnell  for their work in helping move this process forward.   It has been a long time since the Senate has successfully processed  appropriations through the regular order. It requires cooperation on  the committee, cooperation amongst the committee staff, and cooperation  here on the floor with the two leaders, and that is happening. If we  are looking to work in a bipartisan way, this is, probably, the best  sprout of bipartisanship that has bloomed in a long time in this body.   The fact that the parties are working together to prevent nongermane  amendments that are intended just to create ruckus and the fact that  even germane amendments that are regarded as poison pills are not being  added to the bills here in the Senate really bodes well for  cooperation. I wish it were the same in the House, where it is strictly  a partisan process. The fact that the Senate is working together on  appropriations bodes well for future legislation, including one farm  bill that some people have an interest in who are in this body--many of  us, actually--including, of course, the senior Senator from the great  State of Kansas.   I hope this appropriations process can continue this way--with  bipartisanship, knocking out poison pill amendments, sticking together,  and getting a good bill done. The fact that yesterday, I think there  were--how many votes?--just a handful of votes against the first  minibus of three of the Appropriations Committee's bills bodes well for  the future.   I would also caution to say there may be some extraneous forces, some  even down the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue, that might want to  blow this whole thing up. If we can stick together, we can make this  happen in a good way, for the good of the country, in terms of the  specific bills and in terms of bringing us back together again to get  things done.   That is the optimistic note of the morning. Maybe we will have more.                            ____________________     Madam President, on immigration, in the past few weeks,  it has not been so optimistic. The Trump administration has created a  humanitarian crisis at our southern border through its cruel family  separation policy. An Executive order signed by the President last week  has barely undone the damage. It largely leaves the original policy  intact and raises a whole series of unresolved questions.   Those in the administration have a lot of questions to answer, and it  is only they who can straighten this out. Legislation might be a good  thing, but we all know the path to legislation is fraught with peril.  Having legislation pass the House, pass the Senate, and be signed by  the President hasn't happened in a while. In the meantime, while people  grapple with legislation--and I encourage people to talk to one  another--we have a lot of questions that the administration must  answer: How many children are separated from their parents? Where are  those children? Where are the parents? What kind of care are these kids  getting? How are they holding up?   I saw on one of the TV shows this morning a little girl, who asked:  Where is my mommy? Where is my mommy? She was a young girl who was,  maybe, 4 years old.   That is not the America any of us--regardless of our party,  regardless of our political philosophy--believe in. We see that in  other countries that are much crueler and less democratic than we. So  we need these questions answered by the administration quickly.   The second thing we need is a plan. The administration, the  President, and  [[Page S4381]]  others have said that we are not going to break up families anymore  even though he was the cause of breaking up the families. What is the  plan to get them back together? What is the plan for the future? They  now say they are going back to the way it was under Obama because they  don't have the resources. What are the resources they need? At the same  time, when Sarah Huckabee Sanders says that they don't have the  resources, President Trump says: I don't want any more immigration  judges. This administration is just contradictory and tied in a knot.   Compounding the problem is the President's ranting--that is what he  is doing; I hate to say it--at these rallies when he says that  Democrats want crime. Democrats want open borders. Well, Mr. President,  I am the author, with John McCain--someone you have also belittled--of  a bill that passed this body with 69 votes that put $40 billion on the  border. It would have been far more effective than any wall. We could  do that now. We could do comprehensive reform now if some people would  be for it on the other side and in the White House.   These rants--these hysterical, nasty, finger-pointing rants--don't  help bring bipartisanship here. Yet we expect that of the President, as  he has been highly partisan, but they don't help solve the problem. He  just shoots from the hip. The different agencies, whether they be the  Department of Justice and the Attorney General, the Secretary of HHS,  and the Secretary of Homeland Security, don't know what to do because  there are so many contradictory signals coming. Who suffers? These poor  little children who are separated from their parents suffer.   Two days ago, Sunday, in New York, I called for a czar--a good czar-- because, when you have different agencies in charge, you need the White  House to direct it all. This President shoots from the hip and is more  interested in nasty rhetoric than in solving problems, and nothing gets  solved. A czar--some capable, level-headed person who has the  President's blessing in the White House, who could help coordinate  between Justice and HHS and Homeland Security and the other agencies  that are involved--could help solve this problem.   Whether it goes for the czar or not, this administration needs to  present a plan--ASAP--of how to unify the kids and how to deal with the  border. It has no plan. It has a lot of contradictory language. Let's  hope it can get there for the sake of humanity and for the sake of what  this country has been all about for its beautiful 229 years.                            ____________________     Madam President, on taxes, one of the chief arguments  behind the Republican tax bill was the idea that giving corporations a  substantial tax cut would compel companies to hire more workers, give  raises, and expand operations.   After a few weeks of news about one-time annual bonuses petered out-- and many of those were staged by CEOs sucking up to the President--we  have started to get a look at how corporations are really using the  profits from the Republican tax bill. What did Harley-Davidson, the  iconic motorcycle company that President Trump talked about in his  campaign and even afterward, do with their tax cuts? They cut domestic  operations, announced a nearly $700 million stock repurchasing program,  and now are moving significant operations overseas. Why didn't Harley- Davidson take that tax break to help continue to employ workers here in  America instead of a buyback so the wealthy CEOs and shareholders would  get a lot of money? President Trump and Speaker Ryan have held up  Harley-Davidson as a success story of their tax bill while they are  cutting jobs in America and using the tax cuts for stock buybacks.   It is the same thing with Carrier. There was a great big hoopla with  Carrier, but Carrier is cutting jobs and still employs loads of people  overseas, even though they got a huge tax break. This tax break has  helped the wealthy, the CEOs, the shareholders--most of whom are rich  and one-third of whom are overseas--but not the workers and not more  productivity in America.   Another one is Walmart. They are cited by the House as a positive  example of the tax bill in action. Walmart laid off 1,000 employees in  recent months and used the tax bill break for a $4 billion buyback of  its own stock.   This tax bill has proven to be a travesty. All the things that were  promised aren't happening. I know our Republican colleagues. They talk  to their wealthy businesspeople, and they think it is great. Talk to  the average person. It has become unpopular again. Do you know why? It  has sunk in that the money ain't going to them, and the big  corporations that are getting these breaks are not benefiting them, by  and large. Listen to this number: $450 billion in stock buybacks have  been announced. That doesn't employ a single worker. That doesn't raise  the salary of a single worker. That doesn't bring new equipment to a  company to make it more productive so they can compete better. An  analysis was just done by JUST Capital, and 7 percent of the capital  allocated by companies from the tax bill's savings has gone to  employees, 57 percent to shareholders--close to eight times as much. We  Democrats predicted that, and despite the initial hoopla after the  bill, the American people are realizing it is happening.   It seems nearly every week, today with Harley-Davidson, there is a  new example of corporate America taking a Republican tax cut and  putting it to work--not for their employees, not for new equipment, not  for new hires but for executives and shareholders. Let's not forget, 80  percent of the stock is held by 10 percent of the wealthiest people.  One-third of the shares in America are held by people overseas. As  voters head to the polls this November, they should remember that  Republicans spent over $1.5 trillion of the taxpayers' money to give  corporate America a handout while working America got left behind.   We Democrats need to fix that.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
