 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of the men and women  who protect our families, our streets, and our communities.   Fifty-five years ago, President Kennedy proclaimed May 15 National  Police Week. Each year, Americans come together to honor our law  enforcement professionals and remember those who have made the ultimate  sacrifice while protecting our families and our communities.   I remember that infamous day, 9/11, when thousands were running away  from burning and crumbling buildings; yet, at the same time, our police  and first responders ran into the same burning and crumbling buildings  to save lives. These brave men and women knew that they were running to  certain death.   Every day, police leave their homes knowing full well that they may  not return that evening. Every day, they have our backs. It is our job  to make sure that they know that we have theirs.                            ____________________
