 Mr. Speaker, I was unable to vote on February 26,  2019 due to my flight being delayed on account of inclement weather.  Had I been present, I would have voted no on Roll Call No. 90, no on  Roll Call No. 91, no on Roll Call No. 92, and no on Roll Call No. 93.                            ____________________
