 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call for an investigation  into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, for  their unethical and potentially criminal actions in Ukraine.   In 2014, after being discharged from the Navy for cocaine use, Hunter  Biden was named a board member of Burisma Holdings. Burisma is a  natural gas company that was being investigated by the Ukrainian  Government for corruption.   This strange hire for a million dollars a year was around the same  period that Vice President Joe Biden was the primary American liaison  to Ukraine, supposedly assisting their new government in combating  corruption.   Just last year, Joe Biden bragged to the Council on Foreign Relations  that he threatened the Ukrainian Government while vice president with  the loss of a billion dollars unless they fired the prosecutor general  leading the ethics probe into Hunter Biden, or America would cut off  that foreign aid.   Talk about quid pro quo.   It is clear: Democrats would rather smear President Trump than  investigate Biden's corrupt bullying of the Ukrainian Government.                            ____________________
