 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Harold  Lee Dick, Gunner's Mate Second Class, who was one of 43 brave men who  paid the ultimate sacrifice on July 24, 1944, aboard the USS Colorado.   While serving aboard the USS Colorado, Gunner's Mate Second Class  Dick supported landings on Tarawa, the Marshall Islands, Saigon, Guam,  and Tinian, where he ultimately lost his life.   Although he was initially listed as missing in action, his body and  those of his deceased shipmates were recovered and preserved in the 4th  Marine Division Cemetery on Saipan. Once the war had ended, Dick's  remains were preserved for identification and transportation back to  the United States.   Unfortunately, Gunner's Mate Second Class Dick's remains were unable  to be identified, so he was buried as unknown at the Manila American  Cemetery in the Philippines. However,  [[Page H4647]]  thanks to modern forensic techniques, Gunner's Mate Second Class Harold  Dick was identified on November 26, 2018.   Now, after 76 years, Harold Lee Dick will finally be returning to his  hometown of Tipton, Missouri, on October 10 to be laid to rest next to  his parents and his sister.   Please join me in honoring Gunner's Mate Second Class Harold Lee  Dick's ultimate sacrifice as he finally returns home.                          Congratulating Ernie Cecil     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my good  friend Ernie Cecil on his retirement after serving nearly 28 years as  senior pastor at Antioch Southern Baptist Church.   Ernie impacted the lives of so many through his weekly services and  through the pivotal role he played in our community as a spiritual  leader. During his time at Antioch, Ernie expanded the reach of the  church by using modern technology during services, a revamped website,  and social media pages.   During the pandemic, Ernie was instrumental in establishing a drive- in worship service even though it prolonged his retirement. These  virtual services, complete with live music, united our community during  these difficult times.   Through his love for his community, his leadership, and his  dedication to his faith, Ernie touched the lives of many people during  his time at Antioch Southern Baptist. His legacy of love and service  will be felt into eternity. Missouri's Fourth Congressional District is  blessed to have Cecil serving others and the Lord.   Mr. Speaker, let us wish Ernie the best and God's richest blessings  in his well-deserved retirement.                       Recognizing Ken and Sue Molzahn     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give recognition to Ken  and Sue Molzahn, the owners of the world's largest display of American  Revolutionary War-era flags.   Recently, I visited their collection in Collins, Missouri, and was  able to see over 315 replica flags used by American colonists and their  allies from 1764 to 1781. I was very impressed by their extensive  collection and their knowledge of the history behind each individual  flag.   During his high school teaching career, Ken began researching  Revolutionary War-era flags and re-creating them for his students.  Eventually, Sue, a skilled seamstress, joined his efforts and has  contributed hand-sewn, museum-quality replica flags to the collection.   Today, Ken and Sue's prominent collection of flags serves as an  incredible learning tool and an interactive way of keeping history  alive.   I greatly appreciate Ken and Sue for taking time to show me their  flag collection. It is a unique educational experience that highlights  the courage and sacrifice of our first patriots.                             Honoring Blake Hurst     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and thank Mr. Blake  Hurst.   Blake has led the Missouri Farm Bureau as president since 2010 with  compassion, family values, fierce support for his members' needs, and a  dose of creative humor.   Blake understands agriculture is a family affair as he raises row  crops with his father, brothers, nephews, and sons-in-law, while also  operating a greenhouse business with his wife, daughter, and sons-in- law.   As Blake prepares to retire at the end of this year, his legacy will  continue to serve as an inspiration for those of us who have worked  alongside him as he aggressively advanced Farm Bureau's priorities for  the past 25 years.   It has been an absolute honor to work with Blake and his team  throughout the years, and Missouri's agriculture industry is better  because of his leadership.   I sincerely hope Blake will be able to enjoy a well-deserved  retirement amid the farm, the greenhouse, and the grandkids, and I wish  him the best.                           Honoring Scott Phillips     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Scott Phillips  as the recipient of the annual Chairman's Award during the 2020  Missouri Pork Expo.   I first met Scott when we were children and his dad wanted to talk to  my dad about raising hogs. Scott's dad had served in the Air Force and  wanted to try his hand at farming.   Scott followed in his dad's footsteps, serving his Nation flying A10  jets in the Air Force and then returning to his lifelong passion of  farming, expanding the operation and now operating two hog farms with  his brother and nephew.   Scott's dedication to producers and his positive influence on the  pork industry can be seen throughout his leadership roles, from the  local level to the national level.   I wish Scott the best and am proud to represent him.                            ____________________
