 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my first general  remarks on the floor of the United States House of Representatives, and  I would like to start by thanking my predecessor, Jim Langevin, for his  22 years of distinguished service representing the people of Rhode  Island's Second District.   As the first quadriplegic ever elected to Congress, Jim was no  stranger to life's challenges. No matter what was thrown Jim's way, he  always persevered.   For over two decades, Jim Langevin made Rhode Islanders proud through  his leadership here in this body. He became widely recognized as an  expert on national security and particularly cybersecurity. He was a  trailblazer for the disability community and shepherded several key  pieces of legislation that have made our society more accessible for  all.   Most of all, Rhode Islanders always knew that they could count on Jim  to listen to their problems and to advocate for their families here in  Washington, D.C.   I thank Jim for all his years of service to Rhode Island.   I am so honored that Rhode Islanders have chosen me to take up the  mantle of representing the Second District. I am deeply grateful for  this opportunity, and I feel a great sense of responsibility to deliver  for the working people who sent me here to fight on their behalf.   I enter Congress as a proud descendant of immigrants. My grandparents  came of age during the Depression.   On my mother's side was Grandpa Bob, the son of Irish immigrants who  grew up in Worcester, Massachusetts. After serving in the Marines in  World War II, Bob took a job as a steelworker at a company that made  airplane parts.   On my father's side was Grandpa Louis, the son of Jewish immigrants  from Eastern Europe who was raised in New York City and served in the  U.S. Army in Europe during World War II. After he returned, Louis  worked as a bookkeeper in New York for a company that canned tomatoes.   Neither of them worked in particularly glamorous jobs, but with a lot  of hard work and a little help from the GI Bill, these two children of  immigrants  [[Page H518]]  were able to buy houses for their families, put their kids through  school, and earn a ticket to the middle class.   That is the way it is supposed to be in this country. If you work  hard and play by the rules, you ought to be able to have a stable life,  a comfortable retirement, and provide opportunity to your children.   We all know that has gotten harder. That American Dream of economic  mobility has broken down for many families, and it was never fully  afforded to others to begin with. There are a lot of statistics to back  this up, but the Rhode Islanders I talk to don't want to see data. They  feel it in their gut. They know that they are working harder and  harder, but they feel that middle-class lifestyle slipping further out  of reach.   This has to change. As a Representative for Rhode Island's Second  District, I am determined to restore the promise of the American Dream  so that everyone who is willing to do the right thing and work hard can  get ahead.   That starts by going to bat for working people against the powerful  interests and their well-funded lobbyists who stand in the way of  better wages, better benefits, and good-paying jobs. We must fight for  the right to organize because you cannot have a broad middle class  without healthy labor unions. We have to take on Big Oil and Big  Pharma, which are keeping record profits for themselves while  overcharging Rhode Islanders at the gas pump and at the pharmacy.   We have to invest in childcare and universal preschool because no  child's future should be limited by whether or not their parents have a  lot of money.   I will advocate for vocational training and apprenticeships so that  we have more people, like my Grandpa Bob, who can make a living by  making things in this country.   I will partner with anyone on either side of the aisle to bring back  more manufacturing jobs and transition to a clean energy economy.   I will always fight to defend the freedoms and democratic ideals that  make us the greatest nation on Earth.   This is my commitment to the people of Rhode Island. There is no  question we have a lot of work ahead of us, but together, I am  confident that we can deliver real change to Washington so that all  Rhode Islanders and all working Americans can have the opportunity to  succeed.                            ____________________
