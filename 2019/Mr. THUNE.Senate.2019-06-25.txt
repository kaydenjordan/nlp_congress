 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the first- degree filling deadline for the cloture motions filed during  yesterday's session of the Senate be at 2:30 p.m. today.    Mr. President, later today we will hopefully be taking up  legislation to address the humanitarian crisis along our southern  border. This year, 2019, has seen an overwhelming flood of migrants. So  far this fiscal year, roughly 600,000 individuals have been apprehended  at our southern border--600,000. That is approximately 200,000 more  people than were apprehended during fiscal year 2018, and we still have  more than 3 months to go.   Agencies that deal with the situation on the border are stretched to  the breaking point. Shelters are overloaded, and providing adequate  medical care is becoming more and more difficult. The Department of  Homeland Security has been forced to pull nearly 1,000 Border Patrol  officers from other  [[Page S4487]]  areas to assist with the surge of migrants. The Department of Health  and Human Services, which is tasked with caring for unaccompanied  children who cross the border, will be out of money to care for these  children by early July. That means that caregivers for these children  would have to work without pay, and private organizations with Federal  grants to care for these children would go without their funding.   The President sent over an emergency funding request to address this  humanitarian crisis more than 7 weeks ago, and Republicans were ready  to take it up immediately. But the Democrat-controlled House was not  interested. Why? Because the President was the one doing the asking.   House Democrats' No. 1 priority is obstructing the President. It  doesn't matter if he is asking for desperately needed funds to address  a humanitarian crisis. Democrats aren't interested.   When it became clear the House was not serious about addressing this  crisis, the Senate decided to move forward, and last week the Senate  Appropriations Committee approved an overwhelmingly bipartisan measure  to provide desperately needed resources for the southern border.   Now the House is seeking to take up a supplemental of its own. This  should be good news, but, unfortunately, the House bill is just another  exercise in partisanship. The House is attempting to take up a bill  that the President won't sign, as House leaders have known from the  beginning. While I suppose we should be glad the House is at least  acknowledging the situation at the border now, passing partisan  legislation that will go nowhere in the Senate or with the President is  no help.   The Senate has come together and will pass a real bipartisan measure  that the President is expected to sign. The House should drop the  partisan posturing and obstruction and pass the Senate bill so that we  can get these desperately needed funds to the southern border.                                 Agriculture    Mr. President, I have been to the floor several times in recent weeks  to talk about the challenges facing our agriculture producers.   While the economy as a whole continues to thrive, our Nation's  farmers and ranchers are struggling. Thanks to natural disasters,  protracted trade disputes, and several years of low commodity prices,  farmers and ranchers have had a tough few years.   As the senior Senator from South Dakota, I am privileged to represent  thousands of farmers and ranchers here in the Senate, and addressing  their needs and getting the ag economy going again are big priorities  of mine. That is why I spend a lot of time talking to the Department of  Agriculture about ways we can support the agriculture community, and I  am very pleased that we have one big victory to celebrate this week-- the Department of Agriculture's adjustment of the haying and grazing  date for cover crops planted on prevent plant acres.   Farmers and ranchers throughout the Midwest are currently facing the  fallout from severe winter storms, heavy rainfall, bomb cyclones, and  spring flooding. Planting is behind schedule, and some farmers' fields  are so flooded that they won't be able to plant corn and soybeans at  all this year. As a result, many farmers will be forced to plant quick- growing cover crops on their prevent plant acres for feed and grazing  once their fields finally dry out and to protect the soil from erosion.   But before last week's Agriculture Department decision, farmers in  Northern States like South Dakota faced a problem. The Department of  Agriculture had set November 1 as the first date on which farmers could  harvest cover crops planted on prevent plant acres for feed or use them  for pasture without having their crop insurance indemnity reduced.   Farmers who hayed or grazed before this date faced a reduction in  their prevent plant indemnity payments--those crop insurance payments  designed to help them cover their income loss when fields can't be  planted due to flooding or other issues.   November 1 is generally a pretty reasonable date for farmers in  southern States. But for farmers in Northern States like South Dakota,  November 1 is too late for harvesting, thanks to killing frost and the  risk of late fall and early winter storms, and it is too late to  maximize the use of cover crops for pasture, since a killing frost is  liable to flatten cover crops before they are grazed.   I heard from a lot of farmers about this November 1 date and the  dilemma they were facing about whether to plant cover crops that they  might not be able to harvest or graze. So beginning in early May, my  office approached the Department of Agriculture about changing the  November 1 date.   I then led a bipartisan group of Senate Agriculture Committee members  in sending a letter to the Department, making our case for farmers.  Then, I followed the letter with a request for a face-to-face meeting  with top Agriculture Department officials so that I could explain in  person the challenges farmers were facing.   A week and a half ago, USDA Deputy Secretary Steve Censky and USDA  Under Secretary Bill Northey came to my office. During our meeting, I  emphasized that not only did the date need to be changed, but it needed  to be changed now so farmers could make plans to seed cover crops. The  decision about whether to plant a cover crop is a time-sensitive  decision, and farmers were rapidly running out of time to make that  call.   One week after our meeting, the Department of Agriculture announced  that it would move up the November 1 date for this year by 2 months, to  September 1--a significant amount of time that will enable a lot of  South Dakota farmers to plant cover crops without worrying about  whether they will be able to successfully harvest or graze them.   I met with South Dakota farmers in Aberdeen, SD, on Friday, and they  were very happy about the Department of Agriculture's decision. Cover  crops are a win-win. They are good for the environment because they  prevent soil erosion, which can pollute streams and rivers and worsen  flooding, and they are good for farmers because they improve soil  health, protect soil from erosion, and can provide an important source  of feed. That second benefit is particularly important for farmers  right now.    Due to last year's severe and lengthy winter, feed supplies  disappeared, leaving no reserves. Cornstalks, a source of grazing and  bedding, will be in short supply this year, and so will the supply of  alfalfa due to winterkill. Cover crops will be crucial to alleviating  this feed shortage.   I am currently working with the Department of Agriculture to ensure  that farmers have flexibility to use existing supplies of available  seed for cover crops, and I will be encouraging the Agriculture  Department to release Conservation Reserve Program acres for emergency  haying and grazing this year to further address the feed shortage.   I am very pleased that the Department of Agriculture heard the  concerns we were expressing and moved the November 1 haying and grazing  date up to September 1 for this year.   South Dakota farmers and ranchers can rest assured that I will  continue to share the challenges they are facing with the Agriculture  Department, and I will continue to do everything I can here in  Washington to support our Nation's farmers and ranchers and to get our  agriculture economy back on its feet.
