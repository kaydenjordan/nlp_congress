 Mr. Speaker, last week, I had the privilege of meeting  with a delegation of young Cuban entrepreneurs. I was impressed by  their vision, dedication, and private-sector experience.   One had founded her business, Beyond Roots, in 2016. It promotes  Afro-Cuban culture through education, product marketing, and artistic  and other collaborations. Her company has been recognized as a project  with significant social impact, and she hopes to generate positive  change in people's lives by promoting a closer connection with their  roots.   Another founded Wajiros Films in 2017. It is an audiovisual creative  group composed of young Cuban artists who want to generate audiovisual  projects based on the stories, characters, and visual content that  reside outside of Cuba's major cities and prominent cultural  industries. They want to create visual arts that show the diversity of  Cuba. They believe in the right to dream and the right to fight for  your dreams.   I talked with the cofounder and creative director of DADOR, a female- founded fashion brand committed to using the entrepreneurial spirit to  make a mark on Cuba's emerging private sector.   I also met with the cofounder and CEO of TostoneT, an information  technology infrastructure company. He created his first enterprise in  2012 and, in 2018, expanded his interests to support academic and  business groups traveling to Cuba from the U.K. and other European  countries.   Mr. Speaker, I could not have asked to meet with a more exciting,  innovative, and visionary group of Cuban entrepreneurs. They reinforced  what I had learned during my last trip to Cuba in December when I met  with several other Cuban entrepreneurs. I came away from my December  trip and my conversations with last week's delegation with three main  conclusions.   First, it can be time-consuming, even difficult at times, to navigate  the Cuban Government's rules and regulations on the private sector.  Overall, Cuba is opening more and more space for private-sector  development, especially for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs.  Cubans, especially young people, are taking advantage of these  opportunities to expand existing businesses and create new companies.  Innovation and collaboration are happening in every sector.   Second, each of the entrepreneurs who I met appreciates the support  and encouragement they have received from the U.S. Embassy. They noted,  however, that they no longer need workshops on how to establish a  budget, handle payroll, or devise a marketing plan.   Third, the greatest difficulty facing small and medium-sized Cuban  entrepreneurs is in the financial sector. They all emphasized how U.S.  policies are strangling their ability to get financing, set up bank  accounts, and market their products outside of Cuba.   They pleaded for Cuba to be removed from the State Sponsors of  Terrorism list so they can open up bank accounts in the U.K. and  Europe, where they have clients eager to purchase, market, and use  their goods and services.   They talked about how difficult it is to travel to the United States,  how difficult it is to go back and forth in order to establish  partnerships and other business relations, and how impossible it is to  set up bank accounts to sell and market their goods.   Financial barriers that stifle the development and expansion of Cuban  entrepreneurs can all be traced, unfortunately, to the United States.  It is our policies and our financial restrictions that are hurting the  very sector that the U.S. proclaims it most wants to help.   If we really want to support them, we should remove Cuba from the  State Sponsors of Terrorism list. There is absolutely no justification  at all for them to be on that list. They were put on the list by the  Trump administration for purely political purposes. We should also get  rid of the financial restrictions imposed by the Trump administration  and now maintained by the Biden administration.  [[Page H2970]]    Mr. Speaker, it has been over 2 years since President Biden took  office. The Cuban people and entrepreneurs should not have to wait any  longer for change to happen.   The Biden administration must take a long, hard look in the mirror  and recognize that its own policies are causing hardship and suffering  in Cuba, including in the private sector.   Cuban entrepreneurs don't need us to lead them by the hand. They are  more than capable of setting up companies and following their own  dreams. We need to get out of their way.   Mr. Speaker, I once again call on the Biden administration to tear  down the financial barriers and restrictions that are strangling Cuban  entrepreneurs and stifling their success.   Let us stop being part of the problem and start being part of the  solution.                            ____________________
