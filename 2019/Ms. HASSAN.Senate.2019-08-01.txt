 Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Erik Becker  of Lancaster, NH, as August's Granite Stater of the Month for his  dedication to improving the community he grew up in and for lending  support to those in need.   As the Student Assistance Program coordinator at Groveton High  School--the very same high school that he graduated from--Erik sees  firsthand how important it is to ensure that students have both  emotional and material support throughout the year, not just during the  school months.   During the summer, kids usually lose the relationship that they have  formed with teachers during the school year. To prevent his  relationships from weakening during the summer, Erik spends 15 hours a  week at the school helping to distribute free lunches to kids in need,  while also acting as a ``big brother'' for students who just need  someone to talk to.   Erik also works at the community homeless shelter, Tyler Blaine  House. He started out as a support staff member but moved his way up to  a full-time case manager position to help individuals seeking to break  the cycle of homelessness and get back on their feet.   In addition, Erik is the founder of the Black Crow Project, which he  and a few friends founded after seeing how the substance misuse  epidemic had negatively affected their community. The Black Crow  Project seeks to act as a support system for those impacted by  substance abuse. Right now, the group is working to revitalize the  Lancaster/Groveton Crowalition, a community coalition that provides  support, training, and guidance to individuals suffering from  addiction. In 2016, the group also helped put on one of the largest  Narcan kit distribution/awareness events in New Hampshire.   One of Erik's favorite projects as part of his work with the Black  Crow Project is the Small Town Loud Fest, an annual event that brings  people of all ages together to combat substance misuse, all while  listening to area bands in a substance-free space.   To top off all of this community involvement, Erik also acts as a  recovery coach for those battling addiction.   In New Hampshire, we have a tradition and ethos of seizing the  initiative in order to make a difference, and Erik's activism and  engagement exemplifies what it means to be a Granite Stater. His  passion and dedication to improving the lives of the people who he grew  up with is making a difference and will spur and enable others to do  the same. New Hampshire is lucky to have him.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the  200th anniversary of Tappan Chairs of Sandwich, NH.   One of the first settlers of Sandwich, Abraham Tappan first created a  ladder-backed Tappan chair in 1819. The chairs became an iconic and  treasured part of the town's history, with subsequent generations of  the Tappan family crafting chairs from stout rock maple and hardy white  ash and selling and trading them throughout the region.   In the 1930s, the business moved out of the family and was run by  various members of the Sandwich community. The business continued in  affiliation with the Sandwich Home Industries, an original incarnation  of the League of New Hampshire Craftsmen. Tappan Chairs almost  disappeared in the early 1960s but was saved at auction. In the 1980s  and 1990s the company was revitalized once again by Gunnar Berg, who  established a national market for this unique type of furniture.   Currently, the business is run by Adam Nudd-Homeyer, who has  dedicated himself to studying the chairs' story, design, and build,  bringing older models back into production and expanding the selection  of the furniture's materials. Adam has also continued the tradition of  using Tappan Chairs to help raise money for local, regional, and  national nonprofits.   Tappan Chairs is the only commissioned chairmaker in the world for  the living Shaker community and is developing a limited edition  historic reproduction piece with the foremost Shaker museum in the  country. This iconic business and pillar of the community is now housed  in the former Sandwich General Store building, having transformed the  space into an open workshop, showroom, and history exhibit.   For 200 years, Tappan Chairs has crafted high-quality, beautiful  chairs, innovating in numerous ways while also staying true to  techniques and designs that have stood the test of time. As the  business has passed from one maker to the next over, from generation to  generation, this wonderful company has encouraged Granite Staters to  treasure our past and embrace the future.   Mr. President, I hope you will join me in honoring the 200th  anniversary of a treasured New Hampshire business, Tappan  Chairs.                            ____________________
