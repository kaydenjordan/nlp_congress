 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the heroic efforts  of Suwannee County Sheriff's Deputy Troy Wadford earlier this month.   On June 4, Deputy Wadford was off duty and traveling with his family  when he witnessed a horrible car accident. He immediately took action  and administered aid to one of the drivers who was pinned in an  overturned car.   His quick thinking and response saved Destiny Romine that day. As you  can see here, Destiny is on the road to recovery because of Deputy  Wadford.   Even when our law enforcement personnel are off duty, they carry out  their commitment to protect and serve. They jump into action and they  put their lives on the line to keep us safe, and for that, we will all  be forever grateful.   I thank Deputy Wadford and all those who wear the badge. His actions  reflect great credit on the Suwannee County Sheriff's Office and  exemplify the best in America.                            ____________________
