 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for offering this  commonsense amendment. The reality is, we have a lot of waste  containing PFAS spread out all across the country. We need a plan to  make certain that it is handled and disposed of safely.   In the past, I have strongly opposed efforts--including efforts in my  district--to incinerate these materials without any proper evaluation  of whether it was--or even could be--done safely.   This amendment is the right approach. It requires DOD to study and  report on the technological options to destroy PFAS before we commit to  incinerating it in a manner that could put public health and the  environment at risk.   There needs to be much greater transparency on what DOD has done to  date and how DOD is planning to deal with PFAS waste in the future, and  I believe Congress has a responsibility to ensure that the methods used  are protective of public health.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support this amendment.
