 Madam Speaker, the Republicans in the House are all  lined up to whine about an investigation that the majority of Americans  want to see happen.   While the President of the United States has the gall to compare this  constitutional process to the horrific history of lynching in this  country, House Democrats are busy working hard to safeguard the  healthcare of Americans.   H.R. 3 is a transformative piece of legislation, a historic step  forward to finally control the extraordinarily high prices of the  pharmaceutical companies. Negotiation is the most effective way to  protect consumers from Big Pharma's predatory pricing practices, and  the Congressional Budget Office said that at least $345 billion will be  realized in savings when we pass this bill.   Madam Speaker, 90 percent of Democrats, 87 percent of independents,  and 80 percent of Republicans want this legislation. Get busy and help  the American people.                            ____________________
