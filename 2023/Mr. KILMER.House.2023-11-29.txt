 Mr. Speaker, my region just lost an extraordinary woman,  Xinh Dwelley, after her lengthy battle with cancer.   Xinh was so many things to so many people. She was an outstanding  chef who treated so many people to amazing meals, who published  cookbooks and took immense joy in feeding people.   She was an inspiration, someone with a powerful immigrant story who  loved America mightily. In fact, one of my favorite moments in this job  was gifting her a flag that was flown over the United States Capitol in  her honor, and she was just so proud.   She was a community icon who supported local people and local causes  with a generous heart and a warm smile. Perhaps most importantly, she  was a friend to so many.   She was kind and caring. She treated me and others like family. She  would give you a long, loving smile and say, I want to cook for you. I  last saw Xinh in August and feel lucky to have been able to celebrate  and appreciate her.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in offering condolences to Xinh's family  and to all who loved her. She will be missed by so many.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, 49 years ago in Port Angeles, Washington, I was born in  what was then called Olympic Memorial Hospital. Over the years, members  of my family and I received good, quality care from what is now known  as Olympic Medical Center and its well-trained physicians and nurses,  and from a staff that genuinely cares about the community.    The future of healthcare in rural communities faces extraordinary  challenges that threaten the ability of folks to access the care that  they need and that they deserve.   Unfortunately, the reality for many Americans in rural areas when it  comes to healthcare is a story of gaps and barriers.   This isn't just a problem for the Olympic Peninsula. Rural  populations often bear the brunt of healthcare disparities. They are  usually older, have less income, and often have complex health issues.   These factors burden rural hospitals, many of which are already  buckling under pressure. In fact, today the rural hospital closure  crisis threatens more than 400 rural hospitals nationwide with imminent  closure.   For folks on the Olympic Peninsula, quality care should be readily  accessible, not a service only available in the shadow of the Space  Needle.   No matter who you are or where you are from, you ought to be able to  find quality, affordable medical care close to home.   This rural-urban healthcare divide is a crisis that demands attention  from Congress. An important piece of the puzzle is addressing the site  neutral payment policy, which has significantly impacted rural  hospitals like Olympic Medical Center.   This policy, originally intended to equalize payment rates between  hospitals and outpatient clinics, often disadvantages rural hospitals,  which rely on higher reimbursement rates to maintain operations and  provide essential services.   By advocating for an exemption for rural Sole Community Hospitals  from this policy, we can ensure these vital institutions receive  adequate funding.   In addition, in July I introduced a bipartisan bill known as the  Rural Hospital Technical Assistance Program. This bipartisan effort  would provide targeted, in-depth technical assistance to vulnerable  hospitals and communities struggling to maintain healthcare services.   That means helping to prevent closures, strengthening essential  healthcare services in rural communities, and improving financial and  operational performance.   Our bill seeks to alleviate the strain felt by many rural providers  by authorizing new Federal funding to support improvements to these  crucial facilities, aiming to ensure that everyone, regardless of where  they live, can stay just as healthy as someone living in a big city.   Consider the hypothetical, but very real situation, of an older  patient in Port Townsend who receives chemotherapy multiple times a  week at Jefferson Healthcare or the pregnant mother in Elma receiving  prenatal and obstetric care at Summit Pacific Medical Center.   Without strong rural hospitals, these patients and others may face a  long and burdensome commute to an urban hospital or go without care  entirely.   The Rural Hospital Technical Assistance Program aims to mitigate  these very real scenarios and keep facilities open and thriving,  ensuring that everyone can access medical care near home.   Our bill is important in bridging the gap of healthcare disparities  that we see every day. It aims to prevent the unfortunate and  unnecessary closure of rural hospitals and to ensure that folks in  rural communities receive the care that they need and that they deserve  without the necessity of long-distance travel or facing financial ruin.   It isn't just about keeping open facilities like Olympic Medical  Center in Port Angeles and Peninsula Community Health Services in rural  Kitsap, Mason, and Pierce Counties.   It is about keeping people healthy, employed with good-paying jobs,  and improving care in rural areas where the need is most critical.  [[Page H5972]]    The Rural Hospital Technical Assistance Program is a commitment to  equity, a promise of access, and a crucial step toward ensuring that  going forward, quality healthcare isn't a privilege confined to big  cities.   We deserve a future where care is not constrained by geography but is  easily affordable and accessible for all. Again, I thank my colleague  for organizing this Special Order.
