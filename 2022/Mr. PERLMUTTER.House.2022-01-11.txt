 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a friend and  adviser, a gentleman named Odell Barry of Northglenn, Colorado, who  passed away on January 3, 2022.  [[Page H21]]    Born on October 10, 1941, in Memphis, Tennessee, Berry spent most of  his childhood in Toledo, Ohio. In 1964, the Denver Broncos took him out  of the University of Findlay in the 19th round of the American Football  League draft. Barry, a very talented and standout sprinter, opted for  pro football over a chance to join the U.S. Olympic team, and he played  a couple of seasons with the Broncos.   Once his football career concluded, Barry began his career in public  and community service, first as the City of Northglenn recreation  director and then as the owner of Colorado's first full-service Dairy  Queen in the early 1970s. From 1972 to '79, Barry served on the  Northglenn City Council and then he became mayor. Along the way, he  took pride in organizing the Multiple Sclerosis Dinner of Champions for  many years and running Northglenn's football camp. Other highlights  include his membership in the Colorado Baseball Commission in the early  1990s, which helped pave the way for the Rockies.   Barry was a devoted husband to Glenda, a loving father of two, and he  loved spending time with his grandchildren. I am deeply grateful for  his lifetime of service to our community and the great State of  Colorado, and I personally will miss him.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 860 and ask for its immediate  consideration.

During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 860. The rule provides for  consideration of H.R. 1836, the Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act  under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs, makes in order two amendments, and  provides one motion to recommit.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 4673, the EVEST Act,  under a structured rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs. The rule also makes in order five  amendments, provides the chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs  with en bloc authority, and provides one motion to recommit.   Finally, the rule provides for recess instructions, suspension  authority, and same-day authority through February 4, 2022.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased we are here today to provide for  consideration of two important bills to support our Nation's veterans.   H.R. 1836, the Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act will make  important improvements to the way GI Bill benefits are calculated for  our National Guard and Reserve veterans. Since 9/11, our seven  individual Reserve and Guard components of the United States Armed  Forces have played a larger and larger role in military operations.  Despite putting on the same uniform and taking on many of the same  risks as their Active Duty counterparts, these servicemembers don't  have access to the same benefits.   Under current law, active component servicemembers receive credit for  every day they serve while reserve component and National Guard  servicemembers earn credit depending on their duty status. H.R. 1836  would expand eligibility for the GI Bill to count every day a  servicemember is paid and in uniform toward benefit eligibility and  ensure parity for National Guard and Reserve members. It only makes  common sense. This service would include all training and general duty  for which basic pay is warranted.   These men and women answer the call to serve without hesitation. Our  National Guard has stepped up these last several years to assist in the  fight against COVID-19, help communities affected by natural disasters,  as in Colorado, we had a terrible wildfire a week ago and the National  Guard stepped up, and even protecting our Capitol following a domestic  terrorist attack. It is past time these servicemembers have access to  the GI benefits they deserve.  [[Page H24]]    I commend Congressman   Mike Levin for sponsoring this legislation to  provide parity, and I am proud to support this bipartisan bill.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 4673, the EVEST Act,  to improve healthcare benefits for departing Active Duty servicemembers  as they transition into VA healthcare and civilian life, again,  something that is just common sense and I thought was already part of  the law.   Approximately 200,000 servicemembers transition out of military  service each year. This service is difficult, demanding, and dangerous,  and the transition from military to civilian life can be challenging  for servicemembers who suffered a service-related injury or a traumatic  experience. A recent survey of 10,000 veterans showed their chief  concern in their first year after leaving the military is their health  and their mental well-being.   At this moment, veterans eligible for VA healthcare must choose to  enroll in the VA's healthcare system using its online, phone, or in- person services. However, veterans are often confused regarding their  eligibility status for enrollment despite all veterans being eligible  for VA healthcare benefits for 5 years after separation from the  military.   A 2014 study found symptoms of PTSD can be significantly improved if  veterans receive prompt mental healthcare, and for each year a veteran  waited to initiate treatment, there was a 5 percent increase in the  odds of their PTSD not improving or even worsening. Simply put, our  veterans cannot afford to not get the healthcare they need and deserve.   The EVEST Act requires the VA to enroll veterans in its patient  enrollment system within 60 days of receiving relevant information and  notice from the Department of Defense. This bill uses existing DOD  systems through the Transition Assistance Program as well as VA's  existing patient enrollment system to enable a warm handoff from DOD to  VA. The bill would require the VA to provide veterans notice of  enrollment and instructions for how the veteran can opt out if they so  wish.   Smoother access to VA healthcare has never been more important than  it is today. It is time to shift the burden from the veteran to the DOD  and the VA where it belongs.   I thank Chairman Takano for introducing this commonsense legislation  to improve the health of our recently separated veterans, and I also  recognize the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his service to the  country as part of our military.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I would say in response to my friend, this is a situation in  the Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act where the National Guard and  the Reserves are standing side-by-side with active military, and they  are entitled to the same benefits that the active military has when it  comes to the GI Bill. So that one, in my opinion, is a no-brainer.   The other, and I would say, the VSOs, the veteran service  organizations supporting the Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act, H.R.  1836, are Student Veterans of America, National Guard Association of  the U.S., Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United  States, and the Reserve Officers Association of the U.S.                                time  1245    With respect so the EVEST legislation, H.R. 4637, again, here we are,  people have acted with military service and then have to opt in as  opposed to just let the system move quickly for them to become part of  the veterans medical care and benefits system. And we have a number of  different organizations that support that.   VSOs supporting that are the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the  Disabled American Veterans, the Nurses Organization of Veterans  Affairs, and the Veterans Healthcare Policy Institute.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Ross), a distinguished member of the Committee on Rules.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comments of Mr.  Reschenthaler and Mrs. Hinson about schools. But this, in a word, is  the Congress of the United States. This is not the Des Moines school  board or the Punxsutawney school board where they may have individual  respective issues for their area.   Madam Speaker, my wife is a teacher--as you are--and in Jefferson  County, Colorado, the schools are open.   Now, are people getting sick? Is there a lot of pressure on teachers?  You bet there is. But those schools are open.   So I appreciate the comments of my friends about wanting to open the  schools in Chicago or maybe wanting to open them someplace else, but  they are open. And so I am not exactly sure what they are railing  against other than maybe the school board of Chicago or the school  board of Des Moines.   Madam Speaker, I yield three minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas  (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I would just respond to my friend from Oklahoma, as  well as the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Obviously, they have some  issues with their school systems if this is the problem that they are  bringing up.   In Colorado, schools are open. I can tell you that my wife, Nancy, is  pretty stressed because COVID is still around and the teaching ranks  have been hit by COVID. There is a lot of stress on teachers, but the  schools are open.   Maybe those gentlemen need to talk to their school boards. In  Colorado, we believe in local control. In Colorado, we have kept these  open.   I would just suggest to the gentlemen to take a look at their own  school boards instead of having some national standard that they want  to create here about keeping schools open, because they are open.   Madam Speaker, Mr. Reschenthaler mentioned something about the  economy. Let's talk about the economy. Let's start with the stock  market.   The stock market is up 10,000 points since Joe Biden took office.  Madam Speaker, 10,000 points. Do you know what that means? It is $1.4  billion per point. It means the stock market is up $14 trillion in 1  year under Joe Biden. Since Donald Trump lost, the stock market is up  $14 trillion.   If that weren't enough, let's talk about how many jobs have been  added since Joe Biden won and Donald Trump lost. Madam Speaker, 6.2  million jobs have been added in the last year.   Wages have increased by 4.7 percent, at levels we haven't seen for  decades.   We had the sharpest drop in unemployment since Joe Biden won and  Donald Trump lost, over the course of the last year, down to 3.9  percent.   The stock market is up. Jobs are up. Wages are up. My friends are  complaining about the economy. Well, they have to complain about  something, so that is what they want to complain about.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the gentleman from Utah,  as well as my friend from Pennsylvania. They are focusing on schools.  Okay, focus on schools. Obviously, I think local control of these  school districts is the appropriate way to go and not kind of a Federal  mandate.   Obviously, we would like to see vaccines used more and COVID  eliminated. If we got everybody vaccinated and people wore masks, I  think that would be the direction we would go.   What these bills are about, and what this rule is about, is the  mental health of our National Guard and Reserve troops. We are talking  about the National Guard, and we are talking about the Reserves.   They may want to bring in a school bill, which is completely  unrelated to the topic at hand, but what we are talking about here  should have been either passed under some kind of an expedited fashion  or it should be the law already. Obviously, they want to argue about  something that is not before the body because they can't argue against  these two bills.   We want to make sure that there is parity that exists between the  National Guard and Reserve and active military when it comes to the GI  Bill and the ability of those individuals to take advantage of the  benefits of the GI Bill, which will benefit this Nation greatly.   My dad had a saying about the original GI Bill. He said: America has  made many investments, but of the two best investments that America  made, the Louisiana Purchase was second only to the GI Bill in terms of  the value to America.   Here we are, talking about all sorts of other things and not parity  for National Guardsmen, Reserve officers, and Reserve troops with the  ability to access the GI Bill.   We are also ignoring the mental health issues that so many coming out  of the military may experience once they are out of the Department of  Defense, out of their active service. We want to make sure there is a  seamless approach to them entering into the VA system.   Madam Speaker, I understand my friends arguing about everything else,  but what we have before us are very important matters that have to be  addressed.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1315     Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time each  side has remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate my friends wanting to talk about the  Chicago Teachers Union because, again, they don't want to talk about  the National Guard; they don't want to talk about the Reserve; they  don't want to talk about the GI Bill; and they don't want to talk about  mental health benefits or health benefits generally for veterans  because they don't have any complaint about that. There is just a whole  other conversation going on here.   Again, I don't know what is going on in Wisconsin, whether the  gentleman has a complaint against collective bargaining in Wisconsin; I  don't know if it is the problem in Pennsylvania if there is an issue  with collective bargaining. That is not the issue before the House  today.   Madam Speaker, we need to get these National Guard and Reserve pieces  of legislation passed, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would just like to thank the  gentlewoman from Louisiana for talking about the need for broadband  because in the American Rescue Plan there is funding for broadband for  rural areas such as she represents as well as in the infrastructure  bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time so my friend can  close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I want to just recognize my friend for his service to our country  both in the military and here in the United States Congress.   I want to thank my colleagues for joining me here today to speak on  the rule, the Guard and Reserve GI Bill Parity Act, and the EVEST Act  and how we provide and care for our Nation's veterans.   We have an opportunity through passage of both bills to improve the  healthcare of our separating servicemembers and ensure our National  Guard and Reserve component members receive parity in their GI Bill  benefits to thank them for their service to  [[Page H30]]  our country. I again want to thank the Veterans' Affairs Committee for  their work along with Chairman Mark Takano and Representative   Mike  Levin for sponsoring these important bills.   As we kick off 2022 and continue the House's work for the people, I  am glad we are starting with our Nation's veterans. I want to thank my  friend and colleague, Mr. Reschenthaler, and the numerous other  veterans who have served in this body for, again, service both in the  military and service here in the United States Congress. I have always  fought hard for our Nation's veterans throughout my time in Congress as  my way to show my gratitude for their service and fulfill my belief  that it is our country's responsibility to care for our Nation's  veterans after they have cared for us.   Madam Speaker, I encourage a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the  previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Reschenthaler is as  follows:        At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 8. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 682) to encourage local educational agencies to       resume in-person instruction at elementary and secondary       schools, and for other purposes. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Education and Labor; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 9. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 682.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time,  and I move the previous question on the resolution.
