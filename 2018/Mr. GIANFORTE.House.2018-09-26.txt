 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia  (Mr. Garrett).                         Honoring Barbara Rose Johns     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring the Chamber's  attention to the wildfires that have devastated our country this year,  consuming nearly 7.7 million acres across 12 States. This figure,  however, doesn't account for the lives tragically lost, the homes  destroyed, or the livelihoods that went up in flames. This doesn't  account for the smoke from these wildfires that swept from many of our  Western States into the Midwest, creating poor air quality.   The House has passed measures to reduce the severity of our wildfires  and improve the health of our forests. Last November, the House passed  the Resilient Federal Forest Act, written by my friend from Arkansas  (Mr. Westerman). The legislation provides commonsense reforms that will  benefit our forests, economy, and the environment.   Conservationists, organizations, foresters, stakeholders, and local  leaders throughout Montana recognize the need for reforms to get us  managing our forests again. Unfortunately, the other Chamber, mired in  obstruction, has not taken up the bill. The House, however, has not  lost our focus, including critical forest management reforms into other  legislation.   Looking across the West and seeing the devastation of the wildfires  this year, I know we can't afford to wait. I am honored that many of my  colleagues are joining me here tonight who recognize the threat of  catastrophic wildfires and want to do something about them. I look  forward to hearing from them.   At this time, I yield to the gentleman from Utah,  John Curtis.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Utah for his  comments, and especially for his leadership on this important issue,  bringing the knowledge of local government here to this House to help  us deal with this devastating situation out west.   At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona, Mr.  Paul Gosar, for his comments on wildfires.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for  his principled approach to getting reform so we can start managing our  forests again.   At this time, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Thompson), for his comments on wildfires.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from  Pennsylvania, especially that he is a member of the Western Caucus  joining us there, and pointing out the national implications of the  massive wildfires we have out west on resources back east; on the  forests that you have in Pennsylvania and the resources there.    The gentleman mentioned many of the things that--the  livelihoods, the lives. You know, the other thing that we often neglect  is the amount of smoke that is discharged into the air and the effect  on people with asthma and other lung issues. I am sure many, many have  died as a result in our communities, so it is a public safety issue as  well.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania  for his comments.   This past summer, nearly 7.7 million acres have burned across  America. Wildfires consumed thousands of acres in Glacier National  Park.   The Howe Ridge Fire in Glacier National Park consumed over 14,000  acres. I was there. I saw the devastation. It destroyed homes on the  shores of Lake McDonald. These are historic national buildings, lost to  fire.   Last year in Glacier National Park as well we lost Sperry Chalet,  which also had historic value and had created memories for thousands of  tourists who had visited that facility.   Our courageous firefighting efforts did save the main Wheeler cabin,  with great effort. It even threatened the Going-to-the-Sun Road. I met  with the incident commanders there and the brave firefighters at the  Howe Ridge Fire.   Last summer, we saw similar behavior. Nearly 8.5 million acres burned  in our country last year. In Montana alone, last summer, Mr. Speaker,  we lost 1.25 million acres.   Just to put that in perspective, 1.2 million acres is the equivalent  of the entire State of Delaware, burned in Montana last summer. And I  saw the destruction firsthand. I was on five of these fires, visiting  with the incident commanders, and seeing devastation.   In one county alone, we burned 270,000 acres, and we had over 60,000  cattle with no grass. Fortunately, we were able to work with the  Department of the Interior to get retired grazing allotments in the  C.M. Russell opened up to fill that need for those ranchers, but those  livelihoods were suspended.   The habitats were destroyed. Smoke hangs in the air. My own driveway  in Bozeman, Montana, on mornings when the fires are burning the worst,  we come out to cars covered with ash that we have to brush off before  we can drive them. The air quality is dangerous and unhealthy.  [[Page H9086]]    And even where there weren't fires, we saw smoke from the tragic,  destructive California fires that filled our skies in Montana.   As bad as the wildfires have been, I have seen the impact of properly  managed forests. This year, when I was at the Glacier National Park  fire, it was interesting to me, as the incident commanders explained  what they were doing there. It turns out there were four fires being  managed, all started by the same lightning storm, through lightning  strikes.   Three of those fires started in national forests where there had been  hazardous fuel reductions. The forest had been managed. One started in  a national park, and it was such a stark example to me to see that the  three fires that had been started by the same storm in the national  forests where there had been hazardous fuel reduction, on the day I was  there, had been constrained to two to 300 acres each. And yet, the one  that started in a national park was burning over 10,000 acres.   Now I am not advocating to go log our national parks, just to be very  clear. But it is a stark example of the impact.   I have been in eastern Montana, southeast of Miles City, and I have  seen where the BLM has done forest management. I saw a situation where  a fire had burned through a landscape and, in an area where there had  been no forest management, no fuels reduction, no thinning of the  forest, the fire burned so hot that, even years later, it still looked  like a moonscape. Nothing was growing.   And yet, when it hit the managed forest, where the forest had been  thinned, the fire quickly dropped into the underbrush, burned the grass  and twigs, but not a single tree was lost. A year later, that forest  was healthier than it was, and yet, the forest that had burned  completely will not recover in our generation. This is a stark example.   In other areas, where forest management has been done, where trees  have been thinned, the water comes back into the streams again, the  surface water. These are healthier habitats.   So there are many benefits of a properly managed forest. We get more  wildlife. There is more habitat. There is more opportunity for  sportsmen and women. We have more recreational opportunities. You can  gain access to the forests again. We have good-paying timber jobs.  Wildfires are less severe, and the health of our communities are not  threatened.   One of the biggest problems is litigation. We need more collaborative  projects, but litigation is one of the greatest obstacles to managing  our forests. A good example is the Stonewall Vegetation Project in  Lincoln, Montana. I toured that site.    It took 8 years to get a permit to thin the forest, and then the  lawyers swooped in, arguing the project would disrupt lynx habitat. A  judge overturned the permit, and that summer, that entire forest  burned.   And, Mr. Speaker, there is no lynx habitat anymore. There is no  habitat for any animal there because that forest is gone.   The House did take action this past year. We passed the Resilient  Federal Forests Act that Congressman Westerman of Arkansas authored and  I cosponsored. It would get us back into our forests, managing them  again. Unfortunately, the Senate, tied up with obstruction, didn't act  on it.   But we have made progress. Back earlier this spring, we overturned  the Cottonwood decision, which has been used as a tool to invalidate  existing forest management permits. We have been cutting red tape to  accelerate the removal of hazardous fuels.   The Forest Service estimates that 6.3 billion dead and dying trees  are across 11 States. I know in my own home State, in our State  capital, Helena, Montana, if you drive west into the Lewis and Clark  Forest, you can look at a hillside and, in some cases, because the  forests have not been managed and they have overgrown, nearly 90  percent of the trees are standing. It is a tinderbox waiting to go up  in flames.   We have also reformed how we pay for catastrophic fires. This was  fixed also earlier this year, through legislation in this House, and it  was signed into law, that will allow us to treat large fires just like  we do large hurricanes when they exceed budgets, because the cost of  these fires has expanded so much, it is consuming the majority of the  U.S. Forest Service budget.   Mr. Speaker, last year, forest firefighting costs consumed 55 percent  of the Forest Service budget.                                time  2030    That takes away money for trail maintenance and recreational  programs. It is consumed in fighting these fires.   We have also added some provisions to the farm bill which is now in  conference, adding Good Neighbor Authorities, extending that capability  for categorical exclusions down to county commissioners and local  government so that they can be involved in making our forests  healthier.   We have also provided for expedited salvage operations so we can cut  dead and dying trees at landscape size without the frivolous litigation  shutting down these projects.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to act. We can't control the weather, but we  can control how we manage our forests. It is time to reform how we  manage our forests by passing commonsense forest management reform. We  need to reduce the severity of the wildfires. We need to get our  forests healthy again.   This is good for wildlife. It is good for recreationists. It is good  for hunting. It creates good-paying jobs in our mills. Montana can't  afford for Congress to continue kicking the can down the road and let  important projects be tied up in unnecessary, frivolous litigation.  This is an urgent issue, and we need to address it quickly.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleagues bringing to the attention of  this Chamber the wildfires and the need for forest management reform.  The House has offered commonsense solutions to get us back to managing  our forests. The evidence shows that a properly managed forest is a  healthier forest. We have less severe wildfires. I have seen this  firsthand in the field.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the efforts of Mr. Westerman, who has been  a leader on the issue and a forester by training, and my colleagues who  know the destruction of a catastrophic wildfire brings us to know how  critical it is to deliver meaningful reforms.   Like my colleagues, I urge the Senate to act on commonsense measures  this Chamber has sent so that Montanans can spend the summer in their  forests enjoying them, not having to breathe them at home.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 32 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, September 27, 2018, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
