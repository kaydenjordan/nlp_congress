 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  5609, the Cattle Contract Library Act of 2021.   My fellow farmers, farm families, and members of the House  Agriculture Committee know the importance of bringing transparency to  the cattle market. Currently, cattlemen are unaware of contract terms  being offered by producers, which leads to a decline in leverage for  smaller producers during price negotiations.   This bill will require packers to report terms of alternative  marketing agreements between packers and producers to the USDA,  equipping ranchers with additional market data needed to make informed  business decisions.   The USDA library will provide producers with key details on cattle  contracts, including the type and duration. Market transparency is a  critical component of price discovery in cattle marketing.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson)  for putting forth this important legislation.
