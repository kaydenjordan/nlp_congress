 Mr. President, I rise to call attention to the trend of  increasing restrictions on basic freedoms in Tanzania, a country that  appeared to be on a path toward greater democracy and political  openness. I am deeply concerned about reports of Tanzanian security  forces' use of repressive laws, decrees, and actions to harass those  who disagree with the current regime and unattributed attacks on  democratically elected opposition party officials. I call upon the  Trump administration to increase its efforts to encourage the  government of Tanzania to support individual and collective freedoms,  freedom of expression, and civil liberties. Such norms are the  hallmarks of a healthy democracy and are among the basic rights and  duties guaranteed to Tanzania's citizens under their constitution.   These reports are troubling because, on the whole, Tanzania is among  the most stable and peaceful countries in the region. Tanzania is a top  African  [[Page S4366]]  contributor of personnel to international peacekeeping operations, and  we honor the sacrifice of the Tanzanian people, who have lost nearly 50  peacekeepers during these vital missions, including 14 killed in the  Democratic Republic of Congo. It is one of the leading African  economies and had the sixth largest GDP in Africa, according to IMF  data published in April.   U.S.-Tanzanian ties have, for many years, been cordial, and U.S.  bilateral aid expanded significantly under the previous two U.S.  administrations. The U.S. has had a robust development relationship  with Tanzania, including investments in some of our premier development  programs, such as Feed the Future, the Global Health Initiative, the  Global Climate Change Initiative, Power Africa, the President's  Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief--PEPFAR--and Trade Africa. Since 1962,  Tanzania has hosted a Peace Corps program. In 2013, Tanzania also  successfully completed a Millennium Challenge Corporation, MCC, funded  Compact.   Upon taking office in October 2015, President John Pombe Magufuli  pledged to stamp out public corruption and make his government  accountable to ordinary citizens, and he has taken some steps to do so.  He made an unannounced visit to the Ministry of Finance to see civil  servants at work on his first day as President and redirected funds  from Independence Day celebrations toward anticholera operations. He  initiated corruption reviews of the Tanzanian Port Authority and  Tanzanian Revenue authority, resulting in the dissolution of an  ineffective board and purging of civil servant rolls of ``phantom  staff.'' According to AfroBarometer surveys, the government's handling  of corruption in public office has had a positive impact, reducing  citizens' perceptions of institutional corruption in key public  agencies.   By many measures, Tanzania is doing fairly well. My purpose is not to  offer gratuitous criticisms of Tanzania or its people, but to register  my strong concern that the progress of the last decade and a half in  the areas of democracy and respect for civil liberties may be  undergoing a reversal right before our eyes. Tanzania's success in  advancing economically and politically is what makes the current  political backsliding so troubling. I fear that while we are all  rightly focused on the resolving the many crises on the continent and  around the globe, the gradual downward spiral of respect for civil  liberties in Tanzania is proceeding unnoticed, unremarked, and  unchallenged by its friends and partners. As we address crises  throughout the region and the world, we must also be mindful of the  maintenance of strong democratic institutions, good governance, and  accountability which ultimately secure resilient communities.   The Magufuli Presidency has been marked by three troubling trends.   First is the rise in recent years in the harassment of opposition  political figures and restrictions on their activities. In September  2017, Tundu Lissu, a Member of Parliament--MP--and Parliamentary chief  whip of the opposition Chadema party was shot by unknown assailants and  seriously wounded. Lissu, who is also the president of the Tanganyika  Law Society, is a fierce critic of President Magufuli and his  government, but also a longstanding critic of corruption who may face  hostility from many quarters. Lissu has often been arrested for his  longstanding criticism of the government.   Other opposition Parliamentarians face police harassment. In late  September 2017, police arrested a Chadema MP after a party event, and  at least two other MPs complained that police were prohibiting meetings  with constituents.   In February of this year, the U.S. Embassy released a statement of  concern about the rise in politically related confrontations after  reports of kidnapping and violence in Tanzania that resulted in the  death of Daniel John, who was a leader of a local opposition party, and  the injury of opposition supporter Reginald Mallya.   Second is closing media space. According to the 2017 World Press  Freedom Index, published by Reporters Without Borders, RSF, Tanzania  dropped 12 places between 2016 to 2017 to 83 out of 180. While this is  the best score in east Africa, RSF stated that the climate for  journalism ``has not improved since John Magufuli's election.''  Tanzania was ranked alongside Turkey, which indicates just how  significantly Tanzania's democratic space has shrunk under the Magufuli  regime. Newspapers have faced suspension or other sanction for coverage  deemed critical of the government. In September 2017, the government  banned the publication of two newspapers, in one case for 90 days and  in another for 2 years, and 3 months after another publication was also  shuttered for 2 years. In January 2018, the Committee to Protect  Journalists reported that Tanzania's regulatory commission imposed  fines on five television stations for ostensibly ``broadcasting  seditious and unbalanced content.'' The stations were fined after  reporting on human rights abuses by security personnel and unidentified  assailants during a November 2017 ward by-election.    President Magufuli signed the controversial media services bill just  a month into his tenure. The bill replaced independent media oversight  mechanisms with a government-controlled one, and requires all  journalists to get accreditation from a government-appointed board.  This leaves them vulnerable to manipulation and undue pressure to  provide coverage favorable to the state and majority party.   In April 2016, then-Information Minister Nape Nnauye ordered a halt  to live broadcasts of Tanzania's Parliamentary proceedings, denying  journalists the ability to report accurate information and denying the  public the right to transparency from their government. In November,  President Magufuli signed in to law the Media Service Act 2016, which,  among other measures, requires media houses to ``broadcast or publish  news or issues of national importance as the government may direct,''  effectively giving the government outsize influence in controlling  media messaging. The government then moved to restrict online content  when, in September 2017, Tanzania's National Assembly passed the  Electronic and Postal Communications (Online Content) Regulations. The  regulations empower the Tanzanian Communications Regulatory Authority  to monitor and surveil online blogs and internet cafes and ban  ``offensive, morally improper'' content. This restricts debate and has  a chilling effect on the expression of views critical of government.   If there is any doubt as to whether the government seeks to control  the media, we have only to look at what President Magufuli himself said  in March 2017: ``I would like to tell media owners--be careful, watch  it. If you think you have that kind of freedom, (it is) not to that  extent.'' A day later, a rap musician was arrested after he released a  song deemed insulting to the government. Magufuli's 2017 warning  followed the late 2016 arrest of a founder of a corruption-reporting  and whistle-blowing website, Jamii Forums, and a police demand that the  site reveal its users' names. The website's cofounder was charged on  several counts of obstructing justice and running an unregistered  website.   These and other actions clearly demonstrate a disturbing deliberate  government effort to censor the press and curtail the constitutionally  guaranteed freedom of expression of Tanzania's citizens. I was pleased  to see the announcement that the U.S. Agency for International  Development or USAID, which supports good governance projects around  the world, is funding a civil society and media-strengthening project  that will work with media houses and radio stations in Dar es Salaam,  Zanzibar, and other areas of the country. I am unconvinced, however,  that this well justified effort alone will be adequate to address the  broad range of worrying trends that I have outlined. I would welcome  additional efforts of a similar nature by USAID and other  organizations, such as the National Endowment for Democracy.   The third troubling trend is the closing space for civil society. In  March, the President promised to crack down on anyone who participates  in demonstrations deemed illegal by the government, vowing not to let  his economic reforms be derailed by street protests. The reforms, some  of which are not endorsed by the International Monetary Fund's most  recent economic review, include reducing tax evasion,  [[Page S4367]]  halting copper concentrate exports, and banning imports of coal and  gypsum. Prior to planned antigovernment demonstrations on April 26, a  senior law enforcement official stated that ``Those who plan to  demonstrate tomorrow will seriously suffer . . . they will be beaten  like stray dogs.'' Because the Tanzanian authorities deployed a heavy  police presence and threatened to use force, the protests failed to  move forward.   Magufuli's repression extends to sexual orientation and HIV policies.  Homosexuality is illegal in Tanzania, and homosexuals and transgender  persons have repeatedly faced threatening comments by government  officials, as well as police harassment. Under previous Tanzanian  governments, the country's HIV policies called for dedicated outreach  to key populations. Such efforts have been halted under Magufuli's  government. In 2016, the government raided and closed drop-in centers  and private clinics that provide services to those in the LGBTI  community, sex workers, and people who use drugs. Several organizations  reported that the crackdown has resulted in HIV-positive men failing to  access their antiretroviral treatment, while others no longer access  testing and preventive services.   Young women also find themselves under attack, for reasons which  remain unclear. President Magufuli forcefully endorsed a law dating  back to the 1960s that allows all state schools in Tanzania to ban  young mothers from attending, saying in June 2017, ``As long as I am  president . . . no pregnant student will be allowed to return to school  . . . After getting pregnant, you are done.'' He said that young  mothers could opt for vocational training or become entrepreneurs, but  should not be permitted to pursue formal education in public schools.  Critics say the ban lacks public support, is misogynistic, and breaks  international human rights conventions. It also contradicts a promise  set out in the ruling party's 2015 election manifesto, which pledged to  allow pregnant school girls to continue with their studies. According  to the Tanzania Bureau of Statistics, about 21 percent of  Tanzanian girls aged 15 to 19 have given birth. This troubling pattern  of discouraging women from completing their education inhibits  Tanzania's potential for economic growth and undermines women's  potential to contribute to Tanzania's workforce. It also is counter to  Tanzania's commitments under the Convention on the Elimination of all  Forms of Discrimination Against Women.    Finally, Tanzania has, for decades, hosted refugees from various  conflicts and political crises in the conflict-afflicted and densely  inhabited countries in the Great Lakes region of central Africa--some  for extended periods--and has played a mediating role in attempts to  resolve such crises. In 2014, Tanzania also naturalized a large number  of long-term Burundian refugees. Instability in Burundi has led to  hundreds of thousands of Burundians to seek refuge and safety in  Tanzania. In fact, Tanzania very generously hosts 245,584 Burundian  refugees and asylum seekers, more than any other country, according to  the latest statistics from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.   In July of 2017, however, President Magufuli ordered the suspension  of the registration and naturalization of thousands of Burundian  refugees. He said, ``It's not that I am expelling Burundian refugees. I  am just advising them to voluntarily return home . . . I urge  Burundians to remain in their country, I have been assured, the place  is now calm.'' During the same month, the Commission of Inquiry on  Burundi, deployed by the U.N. Human Rights Council, reported the  ``persistence of serious human rights violations in a climate of  widespread fear.'' Such violations included ``extrajudicial executions,  acts of torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment, sexual and  gender-based violence, arbitrary arrests and detention and enforced  disappearances.'' With peace talks stalled in Burundi--and the May 2018  constitutional referendum accompanied by widespread violence and  intimidation, including 15 killings--Tanzania risks pushing refugees  back to unstable and unsafe communities.   The pattern of crackdowns on civil society, media, refugee, and  public health providers under the Magufuli administration are contrary  to the values that the United States has long supported both at home  and abroad and are cause for concern. It is essential that the United  States take a strong and proactive stance on these matters. Toward that  end, I recommend that the administration take several actions.   Immediately nominate an ambassador to lead our diplomatic efforts to  push back against the tide of antidemocratic actions. The post has been  vacant for well over a year.   Conduct a review of assistance aimed at ensuring that the democracy,  human rights and governance components of our bilateral assistance  programs, which are an essential complement to sustainability in other  areas of development that we support, are robustly funded and  adequately address current challenges.   Increase assistance to build the capacity of civil society and media  stakeholders in Tanzania.   Join with likeminded partners in the diplomatic community in Tanzania  and in multilateral fora to jointly condemn President Magufuli's war on  democratic freedoms and civil liberties and urge the Tanzanian  Government to take concerted action to ensure that all political and  civic rights guaranteed under the Tanzanian Constitution are fully  respected.   It seems to me that, at the same time President Magufuli is waging a  war against poor governance, there is in fact another more pernicious  effort being undertaken to roll back democratic freedoms and civil  liberties. It is imperative that the United States, as a champion of  democracy and freedom, raise its voice in support of Tanzanians who are  pushing back against growing oppression. The Tanzanian Constitution  states that ``the civic rights, duties and interests of every person  and community shall be protected.'' Let us stand with those who are  fighting to see that those guarantees are protected.                            ____________________
