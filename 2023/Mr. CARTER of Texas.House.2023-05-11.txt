 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2, the  Secure the Border Act.   House Republicans are fulfilling the promises to restore safety and  security at our borders, furthering the goals outlined in the House  Republican Commitment to America.   Included in this border package is my bill, the Protection of  Children Act. We know that human traffickers, cartels, and coyotes  exploit children in order to line their pockets and then abandon them  at the border. These children are then subject to a very slow-moving  bureaucratic system, all the while being separated from their families.   My Protection of Children Act gives these children a choice and  closes loopholes to end the exploitation of children.   By returning these children to their own country quickly and safely,  we prevent these children from experiencing the further trauma of  detention and being released to potential strangers and a long, drawn- out adjudication process.   I thank Representative Biggs and Representative Nehls for  cosponsoring my Protection of Children Act. I thank the House Homeland  Security, Judiciary, and Foreign Affairs Committees for what they have  done on this legislation.   I would like to point out something. When I was the chairman of the  Appropriations Committee's Homeland Security Subcommittee, I was in  Laredo in 2014 at the bus station. There were 700 people waiting to go  somewhere. They told me two people spoke Spanish or English. None of  the children spoke Spanish or English. They were going to be released  into this country once they left Laredo with no one to help them.   We should make this thing right and do the right thing. I asked about  the kids, and they said to send them back where they came from. That is  how this bill got started.
