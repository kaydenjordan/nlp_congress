 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  ``Wildland Firefighter Fair Pay Act,'' which I introduced today.  [[Page S202]]                                       Background    Fueled by climate change, the annual Western wildfire season has  grown longer and more intense. Where the threat used to peak between  August and November, we are now seeing massive wildfire events earlier  in the Summer and continuing through the end of the year.   Last year alone, California experienced more than 9,600 fires which  burned more than 4.1 million acres, consumed more than 10,000  structures, and claimed 33 lives.   It is imperative that we commit enough manpower and resources to  combat the threat that such devastating wildfire seasons pose to life  and property.   Unfortunately, some of our most experienced Federal firefighters work  so many overtime hours each year that they reach an overtime pay cap  and become ineligible for additional overtime compensation. Others are  forced to pay back money they have rightfully earned fighting  wildfires.                             Need for Legislation    Federal firefighters from the Departments of Agriculture and the  Interior are paid on the General Schedule (GS) pay scale based on their  seniority and performance. They make a base salary and are paid  overtime when they exceed eight hours a day.   However, there is an annual premium pay cap that limits how many  overtime hours for which these firefighters can be compensated.   This arbitrary pay cap places an unfair expectation on federal fire  personnel to work long hours for less or even no pay, and serves as a  dangerous disincentive to respond to more fire incidents, especially  later in the fire season. California's worst wildfires often occur late  in the fire season, further illustrating the problem we face.   The Forest Service estimates that up to 500 senior-level firefighters  either stop participating or do not request pay for hours worked once  they reach the pay cap. This has a significant negative impact on  federal wildfire response capabilities.                        What the Legislation Would Do    Our bill would create a statutory waiver for Federal firefighters  responding to wildfire emergencies to ensure they receive fair  compensation for all overtime hours they work.   This waiver would apply to Forest Service and Department of the  Interior personnel engaged in emergency wildland fire suppression  activities.                                  Conclusion    For wildland firefighters, working long hours in dangerous conditions  is often considered a necessary part of the job. It is crucial that  this demanding work be recognized, and that these heroes be  appropriately compensated for the critical service that they perform.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill. Thank you,  Mr. President, and I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  ``Wildland Firefighter Fair Pay Act,'' which I introduced today.
