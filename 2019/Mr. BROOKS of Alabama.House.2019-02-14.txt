 Mr. Speaker, in fiscal year 2018, more than  2,000  [[Page H2002]]  illegal aliens were apprehended by Federal agents for homicides  committed on American soil. In addition, over 70,000 Americans are  killed each year by poisonous drugs, much of which is shipped illegally  into America across our porous southern border by illegal aliens, MS- 13, and other drug cartels.   Stronger border security, which must include wall construction, will  save thousands of American lives each year.   Unfortunately, in the worst betrayal of America in history, socialist  Democrats, motivated by a lust for political power, selfishly elevate  illegal aliens over American citizens because illegal alien families  overwhelmingly rely on welfare, thus making them highly reliable  Democrat voters who elect socialist Democrat politicians by diluting  the votes of American citizens.   Inasmuch as socialist Democrats refuse to protect American lives from  illegal alien homicides, drug deaths, and America's porous southern  border, I urge President Trump to secure our borders and build the wall  under existing law and Presidential powers.   For example, title 10, section 284 of the United States Code empowers  Presidents to order America's military to assist Federal drug and law  enforcement agencies in the fight against drug and transnational  organized crime.   Pursuant to this law, the President may deploy active military and  National Guard troops to establish and operate bases of operations;  detect and monitor surface traffic in Mexico and in the United States  within 25 miles of the southern border; construct roads, fences,  barriers, and lighting to block drug smuggling corridors across the  southern border; and use aerial and ground reconnaissance.   For emphasis, this Federal law empowers President Trump to order  America's military to construct walls and barriers to block drug  smuggling corridors, with the side benefit of stopping illegal aliens.   Mr. Speaker, another example of existing Presidential authority is  the power to declare a national emergency and divert congressionally  appropriated money to border security and wall construction.   America invaded Iraq and Afghanistan based on 9/11 terrorist attacks  that killed roughly 3,000 people. In response, America spent trillions  of dollars and lost thousands of lives in military actions in Iraq and  Afghanistan.    While 9/11 was horrific, 9/11 deaths pale in comparison to hundreds  of thousands of Americans who are dead or will die over the years  because of illegal alien homicides and overdoses caused by deadly drugs  shipped across America's porous southern border.   For emphasis, a minimum of 50 Americans die each day we delay  securing our southern border. That is a minimum of 15,000 dead  Americans each year. This death rate easily justifies a Presidential  declaration of a national emergency. In fact, not one of the 58  national emergencies declared by a President since 1979 is supported by  a worse death rate or threat to America and American lives.   Mr. Speaker, an extraordinarily weak and conflicted Congress is of no  help. Worse yet, this Congress is a hindrance. As such, I urge  President Trump, as America's Commander in Chief, to invoke title 10  United States Code section 284, declare a national emergency, and use  every other authority, statutorily and constitutionally, he possesses  to direct the military to secure our southern border, build the wall,  and protect and save American lives.   America's military protects the borders and lives in South Korea,  Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Europe, and many other countries. America and  Americans deserve no less protection.                            ____________________
