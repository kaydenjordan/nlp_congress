 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, one of the dominant news  stories on both sides of the Atlantic was the announcement by British  Prime Minister Theresa May that she was postponing a much-anticipated  vote on accepting a preliminary Brexit package that had been negotiated  with the European Union. Her decision, unfortunately, continues the  turmoil in her own party and Parliament at large about how to implement  a referendum that was narrowly passed instructing her government to  leave the European Union that the United Kingdom joined 45 years ago,  in 1973.   As a Member of the U.S. Congress that is also divided and struggling  with its own ability to execute basic functions, I have a great deal of  empathy, as I am sure many of my colleagues do, with the frustration  that members of Parliament and the British public are feeling today.   Fundamentally, of course, this is a domestic question for Parliament,  and it would be presumptuous for elected officials from the outside to  weigh in on the agreement's proposals regarding residency, immigration,  visa requirements, and how healthcare coverage will be coordinated if  and when the U.K. exits the European Union. However, there is one  issue, in which myself and many of my colleagues from  [[Page H10034]]  the U.S. have a very keen interest, and I raise it today in a friendly  but firm voice. That is, namely, the status of Northern Ireland under  the Good Friday peace accords.   Unfortunately, Mrs. May, in her announcement yesterday, indicated  that that was the one issue, that her efforts to protect the Good  Friday peace accords were going to be renegotiated and possibly  dismantled.   Mr. Speaker, I wish to remind the House that the Good Friday peace  accords, which were signed 20 years ago last April 10, have the active  and supportive involvement of the U.S. Government and the U.S.  Congress.   The Clinton administration in the 1990s, at the invitation of the  Irish and British Governments, named former U.S. Senator George  Mitchell as Special Envoy to Northern Ireland, and he chaired the all- party peace negotiation over a number of years, which led to the Good  Friday peace accords. His work, along with his successor, Richard  Haass, was crucial to the success of the talks and the execution of the  agreement.   In the U.S. Congress, members of a bipartisan group of lawmakers,  including our colleague Richard Neal of Springfield, Massachusetts,  were frequent visitors and participants during the negotiations.   To this day, Mr. Neal and bipartisan members of the Friends of  Ireland Caucus, of which I am a member, continue to monitor the  progress and success of the Good Friday peace accords and are deeply,  deeply concerned that Brexit, if it reinstates a hard border on the  island of Ireland, will undo one of the great diplomatic successes of  our time.   Mr. Speaker, the successful results of the peace agreement cannot be  denied. During The Troubles, which preceded the accords, more than  3,600 residents of the six counties of the North lost their lives due  to sectarian violence and 763 servicemembers of the British Government  and the Northern Irish Government lost their lives. To put that in  perspective, 464 U.K. troops have lost their lives in the long war in  Afghanistan. The economic results have also been undeniable.   Mr. Speaker, I have a little bit of experience because in 1973 and  1974, I was a student in England and spent the Christmas break in  Northern Ireland visiting a fellow student in the town of Enniskillen.  I took the train from Dublin to Belfast. In the border town o Dundalk,  where I was asleep, I was awoken by a British soldier heavily armed,  poking me to look at my backpack.    While we visited in Enniskillen, there was a bombing in the village.  Looking around, it was clearly a depressed economy because of the hard  borders and because of the isolation of Northern Ireland.   Fast forward, I took a trade mission from the State of Connecticut to  Belfast 2 years ago, and it is a transformed city. It is thriving. It  is healthy. Clearly, allowing the Northern Irish economy to participate  both in the full island as well as Europe has had beneficial effects.  That is why the people of Northern Ireland actually voted ``no'' on  Brexit.   Mr. Speaker, we are at a point today where the British Government  clearly has to make a decision about whether to preserve one of the  great diplomatic successes, which provides a roadmap for sectarian  violence all across the world. Diplomacy succeeded in Northern Ireland.  It is imperative that those in charge there protect the hard-fought  work and remember that there are stakeholders outside of England and  Great Britain, including the United States Government and the United  States Congress, which have skin in the game and have investment in  terms of the great success over the last 20 years.   Protect the Good Friday peace accords. Protect the peace that has  flowed from it. Protect the prosperity that has improved the lives of  the people of Northern Ireland, the Irish Republic, and the world at  large.                            ____________________
