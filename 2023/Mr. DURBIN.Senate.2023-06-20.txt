 Madam President, over the past 17 years, a lot has  changed in the Senate. Back in 2006, we counted two future Presidents  in our ranks: Barack Obama and Joe Biden. The chairman of the Judiciary  Committee in the Senate was the late Arlen Specter, back when he was a  Republican, and I was the most junior member of that Judiciary  Committee.   Well, today, I want to tell you about one thing that has not changed  since those days, and that is the dedicated, diligent public service of  a man who stood by my side every step of the way as I have gone from  the Judiciary Committee's most junior member to serving as chair of the  committee. That man's name is Dan Swanson.   Dan is the embodiment of wisdom, patience, kindness, dedication, and  selfless public service. Sadly, this is his last week as general  counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee.   While Dan would never say it himself--he is just too humble--the  truth is, he has made an indelible mark on the history of this Nation.   For nearly two decades, Dan has been my go-to man in addressing our  Nation's most complicated and urgent challenges. In every one of those  challenges, he has been guided by a love for the law and a belief that  our government can and should help people.   When you consider his background, you can understand. Dan is the son  of two teachers, and you can see their influence in the way he engages  with others. No matter the time of day, he always finds time to talk  through the details of statutes and case precedent, often from memory,  and never--never--loses his temper or patience.   And just about any other staffer on the Judiciary Committee will tell  you: Dan is the best teacher and mentor you could ever hope for.  Moreover, his integrity and intellect are respected by Senators and  staffers of both parties.   He is remarkably consistent. Growing up, he was always calm and kind.  He always knew what he wanted to do. In fact, Dan's parents say he was  just about 10 years old when he first told them he wanted to write laws  when he grew up. While other kids were dreaming of being astronauts or  athletes, Dan knew that his future was in the law.   Years later, he pursued that dream by going to Harvard Law School  because he thought it would help him land a job in the Senate Judiciary  Committee. He then had the courage and determination to leave a well- paying job at a prestigious law firm and accept a job as a legislative  correspondent in my office. Within weeks of joining, we realized Dan  Swanson was indispensable. And soon enough, we were directing the  hardest assignments of all to his desk. No matter how complicated the  topic, Dan always mastered it quickly. Frankly, Dan's legislative  legacy is too long to list in a single speech, but let me tell you  about a few notable accomplishments.   Dan is the mastermind behind what is known in banking circles as the  dreaded ``Durbin amendment,'' a financial reform that has saved  consumers and retailers billions of dollars by setting limits on the  so-called interchange fees which banks charge merchants every time you  swipe a debit card.   I had never heard of a swipe fee or an interchange fee. And I  stumbled into a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee presided over  by then-Chairman Arlen Specter, where he described the process where  retailers across America were forced into signing agreements with the  major banks and credit card companies, Visa and Mastercard--agreements,  which many times they never even had a chance to read. It was a take- it-or-leave-it proposition. And in many ways, it still is.   The notion is, if you are a restaurant or shop or a chain of stores  and you want to use Visa and Mastercard for your customers, you have to  pay what they demand, the so-called interchange or swipe fee.   It turns out, for most of these retailers, it is the third most  expensive item of business. The labor costs, of course, and, of course,  the basics of food in the restaurant or the supplies that are needed in  stores, but the third most expensive thing, which retailers face day in  and day out, are these interchange fees or swipe fees charged by the  big banks and the big credit card companies.   Can you imagine taking on that industry, trying to force through  reform? I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it without him. Dan Swanson  understood. He reached the point where he mastered that particular area  of the law to the point where we offered a change in the way we do  business in America when it comes to debit cards.   It was a long process. We had to offer an amendment on the floor in  the banking reform bill. And Dan, every step of the way, was my guide  as to what we could achieve.   We changed the law, and we reduced the costs to the retailers and to  merchants and restauranteurs of using those debit cards for that  purpose. I don't have many friends in the big banking industry as a  result of it, but I can tell you, we made the big banks pay $8 billion  a year that they otherwise would have collected in these swipe fees.  And by not collecting them, consumers and retailers were the winners.  My lead advocate in that area, my expert in that area, was Dan Swanson.  He understood it, and he did it so well.   He also helped save countless lives from gun violence, a topic on  which he has been my top adviser. Just last year, he joined the group  that wrote the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, the most important gun  safety reform to pass Congress in nearly 30 years.   And Dan Swanson has also been my point person on the Federal judicial  nominees for my State of Illinois. He even helped create the bipartisan  process we use in our State to select candidates to recommend for  Presidential judicial nominations.   Dan has overseen the confirmation process for all but two of the  Federal judges currently serving in the entire State of Illinois. And  the judges he has helped reach the Federal bench bring not only strong  credentials and experience, they have brought vital new perspectives.   With Dan's help, this Senate has confirmed the first women to serve  as judges in the Central and Southern Districts of Illinois, the first  Black and Asian American judges to serve in those districts as well as  the Seventh Circuit. And he was instrumental in the confirmation of the  first African-American woman on the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji  Brown Jackson.   Throughout his more than 17 years of service in my office, Dan has  not only changed America for the better, he has also experienced some  changes of his own.   Dan does not like to be in the spotlight. But 10 years ago--I love  this story--he and his wife Priva made a splash in the Washington Post.  They were on their way to the hospital for the birth of their second  child, but they didn't make it in time. Little Arya was born in her  parents' car. She arrived a few years after her big sister Maya, who  was born in more traditional circumstances.   So while our team regrets losing Dan, I know there are two little  girls, along with their mom, who are going to enjoy a summer of quality  with dad, which is just up around the corner. I hope the four of them  have a chance to head up to Vermont soon with Dan's parents Alan and  Donna, as well as his brother Allie, to take long walks in nature,  watch the Bronx Bombers play, and enjoy countless helpings of Dan's  favorite: Jell-O and pie.   A writer I admire once observed:         With the lives that we live and the choices we make . . .       let our goal be to give the world more than we take.   [[Page S2134]]     Dan, you have given everything you can possibly give to public  service, and I have been a beneficiary. I am grateful. America is  grateful. Thanks, Dan Swanson.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Julie Rikelman to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. She  is a highly skilled litigator with almost 25 years of experience in  private practice, as in-house counsel, and in public interest law.   After graduating from Harvard College and Harvard Law School, Ms.  Rikelman clerked for Justice Dana Fabe on the Alaska Supreme Court and  Judge Morton Greenberg on the Third Circuit. Ms. Rikelman then began  her legal career as a Blackmun Fellow at the Center for Reproductive  Rights--CRR--litigating reproductive rights cases around the country.  In private practice, Ms. Rikelman has handled a wide range of civil and  criminal cases, at both the trial and appellate level, including  securities fraud, commercial breach of contract, State antitrust law,  and election law. As an in-house attorney at NBC Universal, Ms.  Rikelman litigated a variety of matters in Federal and State courts-- including defamation, intellectual property, and employment  discrimination. In 2011, Ms. Rikelman returned to CRR to take on a more  senior role litigating cases, as well as spearheading case strategy.   Over the course of her career, Ms. Rikelman has proven to be a  skilled trial attorney and an accomplished appellate practitioner,  arguing multiple appeals, including two before the U.S. Supreme Court.  The American Bar Association unanimously rated Ms. Rikelman ``well  qualified,'' and she has the strong support of her home State Senators:  Ms. Warren and Mr. Markey. I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting Ms. Rikelman's nomination.    I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Fetterman) and the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Murphy) are  necessarily absent.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2051         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
