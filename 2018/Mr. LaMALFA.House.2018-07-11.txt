 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank President Trump for  his willingness to resolve a major injustice. I am speaking, of course,  about the news that the President has decided to pardon Oregon ranchers  Dwight Hammond and his son, Steven Hammond.   They have already served jail sentences for a controlled burn on  their land, which was adjacent to Federal lands that were already out  of control with a fire. They used the fire tool to try and keep their  own land from being overcome by poorly managed Federal lands and the  fires that frequently occur upon them.   They served a sentence for that already. Yet overzealous prosecutors,  using terrorism legislation in the law, came back after them again and  forced them to serve even more time, unfairly. It was the type of law  that was used in the case of the Oklahoma City bombing. Approximately  139 acres of Federal land was burned accidentally to try and stop fire.  [[Page H6053]]    The Hammonds aren't from my district. They are from Mr. Walden's  district in Oregon, and I commend him for his work to help make sure  this clemency has happened for these people. They are good citizens who  are well-known in Oregon. They have relatives and many friends in my  northern California district as well.   Their case is a prime example of the previous administration's  overbearing regulation and enforcement on the users of public land,  while, at the same time, their poor stewardship has caused these  dangerous conditions.   It is too bad they will never get the time back that they served. But  I am, indeed, glad for President Trump granting clemency to the Hammond  family.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Tenney, my good friend from New  York, as well, for leading this night and for this tribute. It is well  deserved for the great friend Ileana is and a great friend to us here,  as well as an amazing Member for her district, for representing her  people with energy and with all that it takes to be effective for the  many years that she did so. And so you saw that level of energy here in  this place and in our Conference.   I was always pleased to be able to work with her on issues, but just  seeing her for a minute each time because she would--Claudia talked a  little bit about the height disparity, so for her and me, it is quite  something else. But she would always come up to me. And me coming from  a ranching background and farming background in  [[Page H6107]]  northern California, I have always got these cowboy boots on. So I just  got the handle from her: Hey, Cowboy, how are you doing?   And I didn't really know what to call her, so I just went with  ``Cowgirl.'' So she is my Miami cowgirl friend. So that was just part  of the fun of having such a great colleague like that, and I was  really, indeed, disappointed to see and to hear and to know that she  was deciding to hang it up here. But everybody--everybody--has that  time.   She led here with, again, grace and dignity, but also with enough  fire to get the job done. I know she was an amazing Representative for  the people of her district and for all of us to hear the diverse sides  of all the issues that affect her part of Florida and how that might  contrast with my part of California. And you take that into mind  because she is effective at getting a point across respectfully but,  again, with the pizzazz it takes to be an effective leader here. So we  will dearly miss her.   To my friend, from Cowboy: Cowgirl, enjoy your next endeavor here,  and it has been a pleasure to work with you. God bless you.
