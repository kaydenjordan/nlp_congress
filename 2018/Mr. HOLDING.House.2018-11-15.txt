 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  legacy of my friend, Damon Nelson, who passed away only a few days ago.  Damon was a gifted individual who dedicated his life to serving his  country.   A short time after graduating from college, Damon enlisted into the  United States Air Force as an in-flight refueling specialist. Damon  distinguished himself in the Persian Gulf War for which he was awarded  an Air Medal and three Air Achievement Medals.   Yet Damon's service to his country did not end when he left the Air  Force. For the past 15 years, Damon has worked as a senior level  congressional aide here in Congress, first in Congressman Nunes' office  and most recently as staff director of the House Permanent Select  Committee on Intelligence.   Mr. Speaker, we are all shaken and heartbroken by the news of Damon's  untimely passing. He was loved by all who knew him for his good humor,  his cheerful optimism, and his friendly personality. You could always  count on Damon to lend a hand or provide some much-needed guidance.   At work he earned a reputation as a highly intelligent and  enthusiastic doer capable of attacking any challenge that came through  the door. Damon Nelson will be remembered as a loving husband and a  gifted individual who dedicated his life to public service and as a  good friend.   My prayers are with his wife, Dana; his family; his colleagues; and  his many, many friends.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Hurd).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great  State of Arkansas (Mr. Crawford), who is my colleague and friend.
