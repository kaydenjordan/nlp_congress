 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk for  the House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Duckworth for the House managers:         If the hold on aid to Ukraine was meant to be kept secret       until the President could gather internal U.S. government       information on Ukraine corruption and European cost sharing,       then is there any documentary evidence of this? For example,       is there any evidence that the President was briefed on those       issues by the NSC, DOD or State Department during the period       of the hold in the summer of 2019, or any evidence that he       requested specific information on anti-corruption reform       measures in Ukraine? Prior to releasing the aid on September       11, 2019, did the President order any changes to       Administration policy to address corruption in Ukraine or       burden sharing with our European allies?    Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you, Senator, for that  question.   Let's just take a moment and address what the process should have  looked like, because, as we have already established and as President's  counsel has conceded and we have conceded, this does happen. Right?  There is a legitimate policy process for review and for determination  on hold because there is, indeed, legitimate policy reasons to hold  aid. And we have never said that corruption is not one of those or  burden-sharing wouldn't be one of those. What we are saying is that  there is no evidence that what we are talking about today--- that the  President was concerned or engaged in that process.   So what would normally happen is Congress would come together as we  did. We passed appropriations bills, and we made the determination that  funding was appropriate for the aid, which 87 Members of the Senate did  this past year. The President would then rely on the advice of  government experts from the National Security Council, the Department  of Defense, State Department, and the Office of Management and Budget  regarding that aid. That is the interagency process that we have talked  so much about--the interagency process that we went through earlier  last year. And at the conclusion of that interagency process, it was  determined that it had met all the conditions for the aid and all the  agencies determined that it should go forward. The President would then  seek permission from Congress that he intended--normally, if there was  a reason, the President would go back and seek permission from  Congress--to hold the aid. So let me repeat that. If there were a  reason to hold it, the President--and President Trump has done this in  the past under legitimate processes, as has President Obama and prior  Presidents--would go back to Congress under predescribed processes and  make sure that they are not violating the Impoundment Control Act and  seek permission to hold it. That did not happen.   Congress would then weigh in on the request by approving or denying  the President's request. Unless Congress specifically approves the  President's request, the aid must be made available. Of course, none of  that happened.   In this instance, a hold was put in place. We don't know exactly when  because the President and his agencies have prevented us, and his  counsel prevented us, from getting that information. But a hold was put  in place. No reason was given. The only one in the United States  Government who apparently knows why that hold was put in place is  President's counsel, who tried to tell us last night why he thinks the  hold was put in place, but nobody else knows.   So yes, the answer is if there was a legitimate policy process put in  place, there will be a lot of information about burden-sharing, about  corruption, about any of the other concerns to which we have no  evidence.   And if burden-sharing--to the last point of the question--was a  concern, then the person who should have been asked to discuss those  concerns with the EU and our European partners would have been  Ambassador Sondland, because he is the United States Ambassador to the  European Union. And not once did President Trump go to Ambassador  Sondland and say: Discuss these issues with the EU and the Europeans,  saying they need to provide more money. Not once did that happen, and  it didn't happen because it wasn't the real concern.   All the evidence shows the President withheld taxpayer money, foreign  aid to our partner at war to coerce them to start a political  investigation to benefit his 2020 election campaign. That is what the  evidence shows, and that is why we are still here. And there is one  person that can provide additional information on that, and that is  Ambassador Bolton. And, yes, it is still a good time to subpoena  Ambassador Bolton.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Maine.
