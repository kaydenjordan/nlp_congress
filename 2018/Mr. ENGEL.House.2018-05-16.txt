 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, and I rise in  opposition to the rule. SNAP is a lifeline for 40 million low-income  Americans and millions of working families. It is the most effective  antihunger program in the country.   It is a proven pathway out of poverty for America's most vulnerable  families, and yet, instead of protecting successful programs like SNAP,  this cruel bill would take over $23 billion in benefits away from  children, seniors, veterans, individuals with disabilities, and working  families struggling to make ends meet.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle argue that the  requirements in this farm bill would help people find work. But if they  are really interested in promoting jobs that allow people to care for  themselves and their families, I would invite them to consider  legislation to raise the minimum wage, ensure fair work scheduling,  provide paid family and medical leave and paid sick days, and address  basic living standards.   Instead, we are considering a callous farm bill that cuts benefits  for those who need it most in order to pay for massive handouts to  corporations in the top 1 percent. I urge my colleagues to vote against  this rule.
