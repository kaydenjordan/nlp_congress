 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  Select Committee on Intelligence have leave to meet after 2 p.m. today.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, I rise today on a matter of great  importance to everyone in this body and everyone in America: the future  of the Supreme Court. Last night, the President nominated Judge Neil  Gorsuch. We in the Senate have a constitutional duty to examine his  record robustly, exhaustively, and comprehensively, and then advise and  consent if we see fit. We have a responsibility to reject if we do not.  We Democrats will insist on a rigorous but fair process. There will be  60 votes for confirmation. Any one Member can require it. Many  Democrats already have.   And it is the right thing to do.   On a subject as important as a Supreme Court nomination, bipartisan  support should be a prerequisite; it should be essential. That is what  60 votes does.   This is nothing new. It was a bar met by each of President Obama's  nominations. In my mind, 60 votes is the appropriate way to go, whether  there is a Democratic President or a Republican President, Democratic  Senate or a Republican Senate.   Because a 60-vote threshold is essential, those who say that at the  end of this process, there are only two possible results--that the  Senate will confirm this nominee or the Republicans will use the  nuclear option to change the rules of the Senate--are dead wrong. That  is a false choice.   If this nominee cannot meet the same standard that Republicans  insisted upon for President Obama's Supreme Court nominees--60 votes in  the Senate--then the problem lies not with the Senate but with the  nominee.   The answer should not be to change the rules of the Senate but to  change the nominee to someone who can earn 60 votes. Sixty votes  produces a mainstream candidate, and the need for a mainstream,  consensus candidate is greater now than ever before because we are in  new territory in two ways; first, because the Court, under Chief  Justice Roberts, has shown increasing drift to become a more and more  pro-business, pro-special interest Court, siding more with corporations  and employers and special interests over working and average Americans.  This in an environment where starkly unequal concentrations of wealth  and ever-increasing corporate power--aided and abetted by the Citizens  United decision--has skewed the playing field even more decisively  toward special interests and away from the American citizen. A  mainstream nominee would help reverse that trend, not exacerbate it;  and, second, another important reason we are in a new world here,  making a 60-vote margin even more important than it was before--as  important as it was before--is this: This administration, at least  since its outset, seems to have less respect for the rule of law than  any in recent memory and is challenging the Constitution in an  unprecedented fashion. So there is a special burden on this nominee to  be an independent jurist.   Let's go over each point. First, we have a special responsibility to  judge whether this nominee will further tip the scales on the Court in  favor of Big Business and powerful special interests instead of the  average American because over two decades this Court has shifted  dangerously in the direction of Big Business and powerful special  interests.   According to a study by the Minnesota Law Review, the Roberts Court  has been the most business-friendly Supreme Court since World War II.  It is the most corporate Court in over 70 years. It was pro-corporate  when it frequently favored forced arbitration as a way to settle  disputes, a process that limits the ability for individuals to form a  class and collectively go after large corporate interests; it was pro- corporate when it repeatedly refused to hear legitimate cases where  individuals have been harmed by faulty products, discriminatory  practices, or fraud; and it was pro-corporate when it came down with  one of the worst decisions in the history of the Court: Citizens  United. By equating money with speech, the Citizens United decision cut  right at the heart of the most sacred power in our democracy: the  franchise of our citizens. It has poisoned our politics by allowing  dark money to cascade into the system, entirely undisclosed.   With absolutely no precedent, the Roberts Court came up with the  theory that money necessarily equals speech, and under the First  Amendment, you are allowed to put your ad on TV 11,000 times to drown  out all others, especially average Americans. That dampens the power of  their voices, dilutes the power of their votes. The Citizens United  decision was the worst decision in 100 years, and it is the embodiment  of this new era of the corporate special interests Court.   At a time when massive inequality plagues our economy, dark money  floods our politics, and faith in institutions is low, this rightward  shift in the Court is an existential threat to our democracy.   Now, more than ever, we require a Justice who will move the Court  back in the direction of the people, not only because that is what the  law requires but because that is what our system of government  requires--summed up, of course, by President Lincoln's declaration that  it is ``a government of, by, and for the people.''   Second, we must insist upon a strong, mainstream, consensus candidate  because this Supreme Court will be tried in ways that few Courts have  been tested since the earliest days of the Republic, when  constitutional questions abounded, because, again, this administration  seems to have little regard for the rule of law and is likely to test  the Constitution in ways it hasn't been challenged for decades.  [[Page S543]]    Just 2 weeks in, the new administration has violated our core values,  challenged the separation of powers, stretched the bounds of statute,  and tested the very fabric of our Constitution in an unprecedented  fashion. The President has questioned the integrity of our elections  without evidence, issued legally and constitutionally dubious Executive  actions, such as the one on immigration and refugees, and fired his  Acting Attorney General for maintaining her fidelity to the law, rather  than pledging obedience to the President. For that, the White House  accused her of betrayal.   Acting Attorney General Sally Yates offered her professional legal  opinion, but because it contradicted the administration's position, she  was fired, even though the very purpose of the Department of Justice is  to be an independent check on any administration.   We are just 13 days into this new administration. How many more of  these dismissals will take place over the next 4 years?   This is not even close to normal. Many of us have lived through the  first few weeks of several administrations of both parties. This is not  even close to normal.   Now, more than ever, we need a Supreme Court Justice who is  independent, who eschews ideology, who will preserve our democracy,  protect fundamental rights, and will stand up to a President who has  already shown a willingness to bend the Constitution.   The Supreme Court is now the bulwark standing between a President  who, in too many instances, has little regard for the law, for the  separation of powers, for American ideals, for the power of the  legislative branch, and for the sanctity of the Nation.   Now, more than ever, we require a Justice who will fulfill the  Supreme Court's role in our democracy as a check and balance on the  other branches of government.   Because this President has started out in such a fundamentally  undemocratic way, we have to examine this nominee closely. As to the  nominee himself, I have serious concerns about how he measures up on  these two great issues I just described.   First, Judge Gorsuch has consistently favored corporate interests  over the rights of working people. He repeatedly sided with insurance  companies which wanted to deny disability benefits to employees. In  employment discrimination cases, Bloomberg found he has sided with  employers a great majority of the time. In one of the few cases he  sided with an employee, it was a Republican woman who alleged she was  fired for being a conservative.   He wrote in an article in 2005 that securities class actions were  just tools for plaintiffs' lawyers to get ``free ride[s] to fast  riches,'' ignoring the fact that these lawsuits often bring justice to  thousands and thousands of people who have no power without the class  action suit.   On money and politics, he seems to be in the same company as Justices  Thomas and Scalia, willing to restrict the most commonsense  contribution limits.   It seems President Trump, who has said he would be for the working  man and woman, has not chosen someone who routinely sides with the  average American. Instead, it seems he has selected a nominee to the  Supreme Court who sides with CEOs over citizens.   Second, Judge Gorsuch lacks a record demonstrating the kind of  independence the Court desperately needs right now. He has shown a  tendency to let ideology influence his decisions, criticizing  ``liberals'' for turning to the courts to advance policy. The irony is  this: Those who blame liberals for legislating through the courts are  usually activist judges themselves. In recent years, conservative  judges have proven to be the true activists, completely reimagining the  scope of the First Amendment through Citizens United, gutting key  provision of the Voting Rights Act that had lasted for decades and  decades, and attempting to roll back the established law of the land,  Roe v. Wade.   Judge Gorsuch has shown disdain for the use of the courtroom to  vindicate fundamental rights, a viewpoint that should be anathema to  anyone in the legal system but is particularly inappropriate for  somebody who seeks a seat on the highest Court in the land. Because of  this, women are duly worried about the preservation of their rights and  equality, as is the LGBT community. With an administration that has  already challenged fundamental American rights and will do so again,  the courtroom must be a place where those rights can be vindicated.   As Senators, we are endowed with an awesome power to judge whether  this man, Judge Gorsuch, has the right to a title that is higher than  all the others in our judicial system, the title of ``Justice.''   Therefore, we must be absolutely certain that this person is a  strong, mainstream candidate who has respect for the rule of law and  the application of basic constitutional rights to all Americans, a  deference to precedent, a nonideological approach to the Court, and the  resolve to be a bulwark against the constitutional encroaches of this  administration.   Judge Neil Gorsuch, throughout his career, has repeatedly sided with  corporations over working people, demonstrated a hostility toward  women's rights, and, most troubling, hewed to an ideological approach  to jurisprudence that makes me skeptical that he can be a strong,  independent Justice on the Court. Given that record, I have very  serious doubts that Judge Neil Gorsuch is up to the job.   The Supreme Court now rests in a delicate balance. We cannot allow it  to be further captured by corporate influence or bullied by Executive  overreach.   The Senate has a responsibility to weigh this nominee with the  highest level of scrutiny, to have an exhaustive, robust, and  comprehensive debate on Judge Gorsuch's fitness to be a Supreme Court  Justice. We Democrats will ensure that it does.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  request in relation to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence be  vitiated.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, I am coming back to the floor to  correct the record on my earlier comments, where I said Republicans  ``insisted'' on 60 votes for each of President Obama's nominees. Sixty  votes is a bar that was met by each of President Obama's nominees, but  at the time, there was no need for a cloture vote because we knew each  of them would garner 60.   This is important to clarify because I believe 60 votes is the right  standard  [[Page S546]]  for this nominee--not because they did it to us or we did it to them  but because 60 votes, as I mentioned in my remarks, produces a  mainstream candidate and, as I laid out earlier, the Supreme Court  requires a mainstream candidate now more than ever.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Coons)  and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin) are necessarily absent.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis).
