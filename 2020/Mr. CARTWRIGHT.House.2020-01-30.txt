 Mr. Speaker, we have cause for bipartisan  celebration. The USMCA trade deal was signed into law yesterday.   I want to congratulate the Democratic House negotiating team and  thank them for their hard work for the better part of a year to make  this a better deal.   Heading the push to lower drug prices and strip out a massive  giveaway to Big Pharma were Representatives Earl Blumenauer and Jan  Schakowsky.   Representatives Jimmy Gomez and Mike Thompson handled the negotiation  to strengthen labor rights in the deal, and they got it to where they  earned an AFL-CIO endorsement.   Representatives Susan Bonamici and John Larson improved protections  for clean air and clean water in the deal.  [[Page H716]]    And Representatives Terri Sewell and Rosa DeLauro strengthened the  all-important enforcement provisions in this deal.   While we can't fix NAFTA overnight, this is a good start, and it will  help our farmers and manufacturers create jobs. So I am glad we came  together and passed this deal.                            ____________________
