 Mr. President, today I am introducing the State Flood  Mitigation Revolving Fund Act of 2017 along with Senators Kennedy and  Menendez.   The purpose of this bill is to reduce flood risk and the costs  associated with flooding by establishing a State revolving loan program  to fund mitigation projects for homeowners, businesses, and  communities. This includes activities such as home elevations, flood  proofing, acquisitions, and environmental restoration. By funding  projects that reduce risk, the bill also provides an avenue to help  middle-income and low-income property owners reduce their flood  insurance premiums.   Mr. President, flooding is the most common and costly hazard facing  American property owners. Every year, we are reminded of this when we  see catastrophic flooding in communities across the country. Since  2010, my home State of Rhode Island has experienced two Presidentially- declared flooding disasters, which have cost the Federal government  over $86 million in payments from the National Flood Insurance Program.  Nationally, disasters like these have caused FEMA to pay out an average  of nearly $3 billion a year in flood insurance claims over the last  five years--not to mention the billions in disaster payments for  uninsured damage.   Almost universally, experts remind us that the best way to reduce the  cost of flooding is to engage in proactive, not reactive, flood  mitigation. This is what the State Flood Mitigation Revolving Fund Act  seeks to do.   Modeled on the successful Clean Water and Drinking Water State  Revolving Funds, this bill creates a straightforward and easily  accessible program through which States can offer low-interest loans to  homeowners, businesses, and communities who want to mitigate their  flood risk. By creating a revolving fund, the bill will allow States to  design and more efficiently implement their own flood mitigation  strategies provided that they help achieve Federal objectives such as  reducing disaster payments.   Within this construct, the bill gives States the flexibility to  undertake flood mitigation projects without the red tape associated  with other Federal disaster mitigation programs. The bill requires  state to provide a match of 20 percent, but they would have an  incentive to further leverage Federal dollars, as many already do under  the drinking water and clean water SRFs.   Additionally, the bill ensures mitigation assistance is focused on  where the flood risk is greatest and where people are most vulnerable.  The bill requires States to prioritize mitigation assistance for low- income homeowners and geographic areas, pre-FIRM buildings, and severe  repetitive loss and repetitive loss buildings. Finally, it gives States  the option of providing additional subsidization for low-income  property-owners and-communities that simply do not have the wherewithal  to assume additional debt.   Mr. President, as we talk about appropriate investments in  infrastructure, mitigation is one place where we should be putting our  money. FEMA reports that every $1 we spend on mitigation generates $4  in future savings. Not only will this legislation lead to a healthy  return on investment, it will  [[Page S3863]]  also create jobs through the work it funds   I invite my colleagues to join me, Senator Kennedy, and Senator  Menendez in supporting this legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am introducing the State Flood  Mitigation Revolving Fund Act of 2017 along with Senators Kennedy and  Menendez.
