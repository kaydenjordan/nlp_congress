 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Charles ``Charley'' Stewart, who passed away this past October in  Brunswick, Georgia.   Charley was born here in Washington, D.C., where his life of service  began. He spent time here working in the National Science Foundation.   After college, he joined the Air Force Reserve and was based at  Andrews Air Force Base, where he achieved the rank of sergeant.   Charley eventually moved down to St. Simons Island in 1975, where he  continued his military service in the Air National Guard and achieved  the rank of master sergeant.   In addition to his service in the military, Charley also served his  community through time in government. Charley served as the finance  director for Glynn County, and he served as a Glynn County  administrator for a combined two decades.   Charley will be remembered for his life of service. Whether it was  the country, community, or his family, he always put others first. He  is an example we should all strive to emulate.                            Celebrating Ron Adams     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  achievements of my friend Ron Adams. Ron is retiring after a fruitful  career as clerk of Glynn County Superior and Magistrate Courts.   When Adams first took office back in 2017, it was a very difficult  time for the courts as a former clerk had stolen more than $1 million.  Ron ensured that the court continued to operate smoothly under his  leadership while efforts to secure the money were made.   Throughout his career, he overcame challenges, including the high- profile Ahmaud Arbery murder case.                                time  1015    Adams' hard work made sure that this very emotional case could  proceed smoothly and effectively.   Adams' dedication and loyalty to his community will continue to serve  as a blueprint on how to be an effective clerk, a position that is  essential to our justice system's success.   I congratulate Ron on his achievements and on his recent retirement.                 Commemorating Wade Benson On His Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Wade  Benson as he retires after 27 years as a Young Harris College chief  financial officer.   Wade began at Young Harris College in 1986, coming to the college as  an  [[Page H6821]]  auditor with his father's accounting firm. He joined the Young Harris  College administration in 1996 and has had various titles, including  business manager, vice president for finance, chief financial officer,  and board treasurer.   The business office at Young Harris has been renamed The Benson  Business Center in honor of Wade's career and service to the  institution.   Wade oversaw a number of areas in the institution and acted as his  project manager for the many construction projects on campus. He  balanced operating budgets, reconciled financial statements, and always  worked with integrity and accuracy.   Wade Benson was the go-to person, but most importantly, Wade  exhibited a true love for the college, its staff, faculty and students,  and always performed his duties in the best long-term interest of these  constituents.   I congratulate Wade on a great career. Enjoy your retirement.                    Recognizing Glynn County School System     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  recent success of the Glynn County School System.   Glynn County's graduation rate has increased from 95.2 percent in  2022 to 96.5 percent this year. This is much higher than our State-wide  average of 84.4 percent.   This improvement is not a fluke either. Glynn County is focused on  tailored school improvement plans for individual schools and broad- based foundational structure changes to address the needs for all  students.   None of these changes could have been implemented without the help of  individual teachers, students, and administrators throughout Glynn  County.   I am very proud of Glynn County's achievements, and I look forward to  seeing continued improvement.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of  Dale C. Critz, Sr., who passed away at the age of 91.   Dale graduated from Duke University in 1955 with a BA in political  science. After graduating, he was commissioned as an ensign in the  United States Navy.   While attending Duke University, Mr. Critz met his wife, Lila. The  two were married in Tallahassee in 1957, and shortly after they moved  to Savannah. He had a successful 45-year business career with car  dealerships spread across Georgia, South Carolina, Louisiana, and  Florida.   Mr. Critz served on endowment committees at the Georgia Historical  Society, the Savannah Community Foundation, and the George Washington  Foundation. His efforts were noticed and greatly appreciated by the  community. Dale once said in an interview that one of his main goals in  life was to make Savannah a better place to live.   Dale Critz was a devoted father, a grandfather, and a philanthropist.  He will be dearly missed by all.                            ____________________
