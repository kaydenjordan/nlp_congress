 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.J. Res. 43  which is another baseless and dangerous attack on women's health care  providers.   The title X Family Planning Rule, passed almost 50 years ago, already  requires states to base title X funding on a provider's ability to  provide title X services. This rule protects title X providers from  facing unwarranted discrimination and allows them to continue doing the  important work 4 million Americans rely on every year. Title X services  include family planning services, cancer screenings, birth control, STI  testing and basic care. To diminish these services will result in  women, men and young people with the greatest need being denied the  opportunity to have any health care.   Whether or not a provider provides safe and legal abortions with  private funds is irrelevant to their ability and capacity to provide  title X services. In fact, it is preventive services and family  planning offered through title X programs that help to lower the number  of unintended pregnancies. But attacks on these providers and the  services they offer in their communities persist.   This resolution rolls back protections that should already be  guaranteed, but repeated attacks on family planning providers have  resulted in the need for rules like the one this resolution dismantles.  That is why I strenuously oppose this resolution. It should be rejected  as an unjustified and unnecessary attack on title X programs and the  services they provide for millions of low income Americans.
