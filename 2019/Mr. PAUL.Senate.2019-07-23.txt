 Madam President, today I will offer an amendment to pay for  the spending in this bill. This is not something unusual. I do this day  in and day out. It has been part of the reason I ran for office--that  we shouldn't add more debt to our country without trying to pay for it  by maybe reducing spending from wasteful spending.   In the last week or so, we have seen a manufactured crisis. Rarely  has there been a manufactured crisis so intense--a fake furor  instigated by partisans more concerned with scoring points than telling  the truth. But, for some of us, the truth is still important.   The mob and demagogues in this body accuse me of holding up this bill  for political points. They obviously don't know much about politics,  because there certainly hasn't been any political gain by my holding  this bill for debate and amendment. But I think it is important we do  this, rather than rush through and everybody says: No questions asked,  please. It sounds a little more like an authoritarian atmosphere than  it would be a democracy, to actually have debate, discussion, and  amendments. That is all we have asked for.   In fact, last week when we were granted the amendments, we said to  the other side: Let's have the vote--last week. And all of those who  were in such a furor, all those who were so hysterical that the world  was ending said: Oh, we cannot vote on it--it was not convenient last  week--because some of our Democrat Members have already gone home for  the weekend. So when the mob was told last week they could have the  vote, they said no. It is a manufactured crisis. As of today, the fund  in question has $2 billion in it, and no one is being denied medical  care.   So let's have an honest debate. Let's have an honest debate about  whether it matters to this country whether we are $2 billion in debt,  and whether or not, when we have new spending programs--no matter  how charitable, no matter how needed--whether or not we are going to  pay for them by reducing spending in wasteful programs.    It is perhaps a historical anomaly that this bill appropriates  unlimited funds for a virtually unlimited time period.   What would you think if someone came to you, they had a good cause,  and they said: You know, my neighbors' house has burnt down, and I want  to help them, and I want to give them unlimited money for an unlimited  period of time?   That wouldn't be wise. No one would do that. So why do we, in our  hysteria, throw out all common sense and say that we are going to  approach this as if we don't have a problem?   We have this enormous problem in our country. We are borrowing over  $1 million a minute. My amendment today is to offer to pay for the $10  billion in the first 10 years. Realize that this bill as written is not  a 10-year bill. It is a 72-year bill. It goes to the year 2092. To my  knowledge, we have never, ever had a bill that was unlimited in the  dollar amount and unlimited in the time period. Mine would be to pay  for the first 10 years of this. The pay would come by reducing  mandatory spending by 0.06 percent. That is 6/100th of 1 percent of  other mandatory spending.   At the same time, we would exempt Medicare, Social Security, and  Veterans Affairs from cuts. We would exempt the vast bulk of mandatory  spending, but we would still say: If this is a wise expenditure of  money, if we need more money for this fund, we would simply take it  from something that is less pressing.   No matter how good a cause may be, it makes no sense to borrow from  China to pay for our immediate concerns. Spending someone else's money  is not charity. Spending borrowed money is just not wise or sound  governance.   Being a legislator should be about making choices, about deciding  priorities.   For example, which is more important--spending $275 million teaching  foreign countries how to apply for U.S. foreign aid and teaching  foreign countries how to get our money and how to fill out the grant  process? Is that more important than the spending in this bill? We will  never know because the people who promote this bill aren't willing to  cut any spending. They are not going to look at waste.   We wonder why we have waste run from top to bottom in our government?  Because no one is willing, even for a good cause, to say: Why don't we  cut out some of this waste? Why don't we  [[Page S4995]]  quit spending money teaching foreigners how to apply to get more of our  money?   To pay for more pressing concerns, shouldn't someone ask whether it  is wise to spend $300,000 studying whether Japanese quail are more  sexually promiscuous on cocaine? That is your money. So when somebody  is being asked for a good cause, ask why we couldn't eliminate money we  are spending on awful things that should never have been wasted in the  Federal Government.   To pay for more pressing concerns, shouldn't someone ask why we  continue to spend $50 billion a year building bridges and roads and  hotels and gas stations in Afghanistan? Perhaps that money could be  better spent here at home.   The debate today is not over the spending of the money. It is over,  when we do spend money--even for a good cause--whether or not we should  cut corresponding money that we are wasting around the world, much of  it not helping American citizens and much of it going to foreign  countries and foreign people.   To pay for more pressing concerns, shouldn't someone ask why we had a  study last year that spent $2 million seeking to know the question: If  someone in front of you in the cafeteria line sneezes on the food, are  you more or less likely to pick up the food and eat it?   Seriously, this is where your tax dollars are going. If we have a  better cause, and we want to fund this fund we are talking about today,  couldn't we say we will not spend $2 million next year studying  whether, if someone sneezes on your food, you are more or less likely  to take the food?   Shouldn't we be forced as a Congress to make decisions, instead of  just saying: Well, it is a good cause. So, therefore, we should not use  our brain. We should put on blinders. We shouldn't think about it, and  we should just say: Well, it is a good cause so let's just borrow the  money from China.   Do you think that helps us as a country? Isn't part of legislating  trying to prioritize spending, not just adding to the debt?   The leftwing mob maintains that Republicans have lost the moral high  ground and can't talk about debt anymore because we supported a tax  cut. Poppycock. This is misinformation. This is fake news. This is  plainly people just not paying any attention to what goes on around  here.   During the tax cut, which I supported, I offered cuts to mandatory  spending to pay for the tax cut. The media seems to have forgotten  this. But I forced a vote on the floor to say: Yes, we may be cutting  taxes and, if it affects the deficit, we should pay for it.   Interestingly, though, the leftwing mob doesn't want to admit that  when we actually cut tax rates, we actually got more money. The revenue  coming in last year was actually greater than the previous year. The  tax cut didn't add to the deficit. The deficit went up because we  continue to spend money and we actually added more spending. The curve  of spending increases actually rose faster than the revenue coming in.   When the tax cut happened, I offered an amendment to cut spending to  pay for it. This is a fact. The leftwing mob and all of their buddies  in the media can do and say whatever they want. It is a free country,  but it is an absolute out-and-out lie that Republicans who voted for  this tax cut also were not concerned with spending. I, for one was, and  I offered an amendment to cut spending.   The tax cut also was passed under a law we have had on the books for  some time. It is called the pay-go law. This is a law that should be  working even on a bill like this current bill. But we exempt ourselves  from it all the time. The current bill actually exempts the pay-go  rules: If you increase spending by $10 billion, you have to decrease it  by $10 billion somewhere else.   It has been on the books for a long time, but like everything else  Congress does, they try to bring in rules to say: Do you know what? We  are going to try to control the debt and spending by forcing ourselves,  when we come up with some new spending of $10 billion, that we will  have to come up with something to cut to pay for it.   What happens is, Congress just waives the rules. It is not that we  don't have rules that should help with the budget; we have hundreds of  rules. The pay-go rule is a good rule, but it gets ignored. We passed  the tax cut. If the projections were that the deficit was going to go  up, guess what, the pay-go rules would say there has to be automatic  spending cuts across the board. This is something I support.   So what happened? About a month after the tax cut, a big spending  bill comes through here. Both parties are guilty, Republicans and  Democrats. They love to spend money more than anything else. A big  spending bill comes through, and guess what. They waive the rule on  pay-go.   At that time, I also brought up an amendment that said: Hey, you guys  shouldn't waive the pay-go rule. If the tax cut causes the debt to go  up, we should cut spending across board.   Let's be very clear around here. There are those of us who have been  consistent from day one that the debt does matter. There is no  particular animus toward this bill. In the last year, I have done this  probably a half dozen times. In the last 2 years, I have probably done  it two dozen times. That means every spending bill.   A month ago, it was spending for the border. I support money to be  spent on the border, but I don't support doing it if it adds to the  deficit.   The amendment I have today is identical to the amendment I had a  month ago, saying: Border spending, even if you want to do it, we  should cut money from somewhere else where it is not as much needed and  where it is being wasted.   I did it 3 months ago for the hurricane disaster relief. Every bit of  new spending--it doesn't matter whether it is a good cause, bad cause,  or an in-between cause, we need to not keep adding to the debt. This is  a problem. We borrow over $1 million--close to $2 million every minute.  This is a problem for our country. We are eroding the foundation of  this country with so much debt--$22 trillion in debt.   The tax cut was passed under the pay-go rules. I voted not to suspend  the pay-go rules. I voted to actually have spending cuts to offset any  increase in the deficit from the tax cut.   The establishment of both parties moved to waive this pay-go  requirement. I forced a vote, and only eight Senators voted, which  shows you where the real problem is. Why does the deficit go up so  much? There is not one Democrat in Congress who cares a flip about the  deficit. Not one Democrat in Congress will lift a finger to refrain  from government spending. Therefore, everything--you name it, they are  for it.   The problem is, Republicans aren't so good on this either. There are  only a handful of Republicans who actually care about the debt, and  many of them will vote consistently to raise the debt limit and vote to  add new debt.   Today's vote, though, is but a prelude of next week's vote. This is  the preliminary. This is the introduction to our problem in our  country, over $10 billion. Next week, it is the enormity of the entire  budget. Next week, both parties--and watch this closely. People say:  Oh, Republicans can't get along with Democrats. Guess what. They get  along just swell when it comes to spending money and adding to the  debt.   This bill will pass overwhelmingly today without any concern for the  debt or paying for it. Next week will be even worse. We have something  called the debt ceiling. Every time we spend more money that comes in,  in taxes, it approaches a debt ceiling, and the debt ceiling says you  can't borrow any more money. So conservatives say: Well, we should  reform our ways and quit giving away money to Afghanistan and Mexico  and all these different countries. We should have reform involved with  raising the debt ceiling.   What is going to come about next week is no debt ceiling for 2 years,  until after the next Presidential election. It is a terrible idea. It  is fiscal insanity. They also will vote to forever get rid of the  sequester caps.   In 2011, amongst the tea party movement, when more people became  concerned about the deficit spending, we actually came in and had a  reform. For the first time, we didn't cut spending; we slowed down the  rate of growth of spending. In doing so, the deficit was narrowing. For  a couple of years, we were doing better. Then what happened  [[Page S4996]]  was basically both parties once again came together. The Republicans  said: We want to be in every war overseas we can possibly get involved  in, and we want to have more money spent on the military.   The liberals said: We need more money for welfare.   Guess what. They are not at odds. You scratch my back; I will scratch  yours.   The Republicans and Democrats agree on one thing: Spending money is  the most important thing they can do. The deficit doesn't matter.   So when we come back, when we address this issue next week, what we  are going to find is they are going to explode the debt ceiling. There  will be no limits on the debt ceiling for 2 years, and they are getting  rid of all pretense of having any spending caps.   A majority of Republicans, unfortunately, will even vote to get rid  of the budget caps and to eliminate the debt ceiling for 2 years. This  is sad.   Today, though, the Senate has a chance to vote to pay for this $10  billion bill with very modest reductions in mandatory spending-- reductions that actually exempt Medicare, Social Security, and Veterans  Affairs.   Americans, particularly conservatives, need to sit up and watch  closely how their Senators vote, for today's vote is about whether your  representative really cares at all about the disaster that is our $22  trillion debt.                              Amendment No. 929    Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 929 and ask that it be  reported by number.
