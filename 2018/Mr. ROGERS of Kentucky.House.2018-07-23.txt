 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding me the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5979, the Mill Springs  Battlefield National Monument Act, legislation that I introduced that  directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish the Mill Springs  Battlefield National Monument as a unit of the National Park System.   On January 19, 1862, the small Kentucky town of Logan's Cross Roads  erupted in a blast of artillery and musket fire as Confederate and  Union forces clashed in the Battle of Mill Springs.   When the smoke cleared, it was clear that the Union was victorious  and had secured its first significant victory in the Civil War. To  honor the site, the Mill Springs Battlefield in Pulaski and Wayne  Counties in Kentucky was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark  district in 1994.   Realizing the need to preserve and protect the battlefield for the  future,  [[Page H6628]]  the Mill Springs Battlefield Association was founded in 1992. That  association currently owns more than 900 acres of the battlefield that  they have pieced together over the years with their own money and grant  money from various sources. They even built a $1.7 million, 10,000- square-foot visitor center and museum at the site, which is adjacent to  the Mill Springs National Cemetery, which, of course, was started by  the deaths from this battle.   Mr. Speaker, while the association is currently doing an exemplary  job in maintaining the battlefield, it simply does not have the  financial resources to adequately preserve and maintain this site in  perpetuity.   To ensure that the Mill Springs Battlefield is protected for future  generations, I introduced this legislation to add the battlefield to  the National Park System. This will ensure that the battlefield where  the Union first tasted victory is protected, preserved, and promoted  well into the future.   Mr. Speaker, this effort is supported by the Secretary of the  Interior, Ryan Zinke, as well as the National Park Service.   It is also supported by many in Kentucky, including our Governor, our  friends in our congressional delegation, and countless local and  regional leaders.                                time  1730    It is also supported by the Battlefield Association which is willing  to donate their property, some 900 of the acres, to make this national  monument a reality.   I am particularly grateful to Chairman McClintock, Chairman Bishop,  and their staff who worked closely with us to bring this bill to the  floor. I can't thank the chairman enough for the great work that he  does.   I would also like to specifically thank my friend and colleague,  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is ushering companion  legislation through the Senate.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the men and women of the Mill  Springs Battlefield Association. Without their decades of work to piece  together and preserve this important site, none of this would be  possible today. They stage an annual reenactment of this battle which  is realistic to the nth degree, and I would invite everyone to attend  the annual reunion of this battle in January of next year.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of the Mill Springs Battlefield  National Monument Act.
