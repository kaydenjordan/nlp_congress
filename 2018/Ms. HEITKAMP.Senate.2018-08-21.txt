 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for yesterday's  votes on S.A. 3705 and S.A. 3706 to H.R. 6157 so I could join the  Secretary of the Air Force during her visit to Grand Forks Air Force  Base in my home State. Had I been present, I would have voted yea on  the amendments.                            ____________________
