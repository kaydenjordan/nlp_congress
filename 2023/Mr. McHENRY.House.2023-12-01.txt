 Madam Speaker, small businesses are the lifeblood of the  American economy. When you burden small business, you limit job growth,  economic gain, economic opportunity, and American growth. With more  regulation on businesses, it drives up the cost of doing business.   I commend the chair of the Small Business Committee for this  resolution that we have on the House floor today that is in support of  American small business. This resolution would stop the CFPB's small  business data collection rule, which is onerous, overly complex, and  difficult to implement. All American businesses would be burdened by  it--disproportionately, the small businesses that create most of the  jobs in America.   This rule would stifle American businesses' access to affordable  credit, and it will facilitate the naming and shaming of lenders whose  business practices are legal, nondiscriminatory, and safe and sound.   The progressive activists on the left want to use that database so  they can call out the things that they don't like for political  activism. I don't think that is responsible. I don't think that is in  the interest of the American economy, and it surely is not in the  interest of consumer protection.   Madam Speaker, let's support this resolution. Let's oppose the rule.  Let's support small business.
