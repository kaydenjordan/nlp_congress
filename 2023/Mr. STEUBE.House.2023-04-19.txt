 Mr. Chairman, Genesis 1:27: ``So God created mankind in  His own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female He  created them.''   Genesis 5:1-2: ``When God created mankind, He made them in the  likeness of God. He created them male and female and blessed them.''   Jesus stated in Mark 10:6: ``But at the beginning of creation, God  made them male and female.''   Also in Matthew 19:4: ``At the beginning, the creator made them male  and female.''   For thousands of years in human history, we have recognized as a  species that there are women and there are men, who are obviously  biologically different, dare I say even scientifically different. Even  science agrees with this premise.   Yet, over the last several years, there has been a perversion in our  culture by the enemy, and the left has completely embraced the lie to  erase the lines of gender and to convince you there isn't really gender  and that gender is fluid and can be whatever you want, whenever you  want--again, more lies.   The left has taken gender identity so far that many on the left today  cannot even define what a woman is for fear of retribution by trans  activists. Even the latest Supreme Court Justice appointed by President  Biden could not define what a woman is during questioning, and she now  sits on the highest court in the land.   The radical left has adopted completely made-up terms that didn't  even exist just a few short years ago, like nonbinary, cisgender, trans  male, trans female. You can even find that there are 74 made-up  genders, 74 that you can choose from, everything from agender to  omnigender. There is even an astral gender, which is having a gender  identity that feels to be related to space. I don't even know what that  means.   Just a few short years ago, even Democrats would say that this is  ridiculous, but today, it is common speak for the radical left. If you  question these fictitious terms, they label you transphobic--again,  another leftist idiom.   I have three dictionaries in my house. One was copyrighted in 1828;  one was copyrighted in 1959; and one was copyrighted in 1988.  Shockingly, nowhere in any of these dictionaries are the terms  ``nonbinary'' or ``trans man'' or ``trans woman.'' Even if you look on  Webster today, just Google Webster, it says that ``trans man'' and  ``trans female'' are terms that were first used in 1996. During the  entire history of mankind, you were either male or female until the  last few years.   In worship to the trans movement, the Biden administration has moved  at warp speed to infiltrate every aspect of the Federal Government with  trans speak.                                time  1315    Most recently, just a couple weeks ago, I am assuming in response to  this bill moving to a vote, the Biden administration was looking to  insert rules on Title IX to force biological men into women's sports in  complete defiance of the laws this body passed over 50 years ago.   Congress in 1972 created Title IX to protect women's sports to enable  women to have an equal playing field in athletics. In worship to their  trans idols, the administration wants to flip that on its head. It is  insane.   Title IX was created for women's sports, and now the left wants to  kill it. In them giving homage to the trans movement, they are  abandoning women all across the country.   Parents do not want biological men in locker rooms with their  daughters, nor do they believe it is equitable that a male can compete  with women in female athletics. It is the whole purpose that Title IX  was created to begin with.   The radical left wants you to believe that this never happens, and  there are only a few instances of this happening. However, the facts  bear this statement as false.   There is an entire website that documents examples of females who are  displaced by males in women's sporting events. It includes the place  ``she would have won'' had the male not been competing.   There are hundreds of examples documented on SheWon.org and Concerned  Women has a spreadsheet with, again, hundreds of examples where women  faced men in competition.   In my own district in Sarasota, Florida, my constituent, Emma Weyant,  an incredibly talented swimmer and Olympic medalist, lost the 2022 NCAA  women's swimming championships title for the 500 freestyle by 1.75  seconds to a man who formerly competed for years on the men's swimming  team, who took home that title after identifying as a woman.   It is a sad day in America when the Democrats have regressed so far  backward that they are willing to erase the rights that women have  fought decades to obtain, all to elevate biological males to the top of  women's podiums.   The integrity of women's sports must be protected. H.R. 734 preserves  women's sports and ensures fair competition for generations of women to  come, just as Title IX originally intended.   If my liberal colleagues truly believe in supporting women's rights,  as they so often tout, they will vote in favor of this bill.   I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand for  women's free and fair opportunity in athletics and to stand for truth,  not lies.
