 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.   The amendment shifts workers who repair super yachts and large,  luxury watercraft out of coverage under the Longshore and Harbor  Workers' Compensation Act and into coverage under State workers'  compensation programs.   But it doesn't just amend the longshoremen act. Rather, it creates a  problem with the Coast Guard law. The Coast Guard opposed an identical  amendment last year because it creates widespread damage to Coast Guard  regulatory and enforcement authorities, implicates U.S. treaty  obligations, and could affect the collection of tonnage taxes on  foreign flagged vessels.   The Department of Labor also opposes the amendment because it could  lead to uncertainty and foster litigation under the longshoremen  coverage. Moreover, by shifting workers out of longshoremen into the  weak State workers' comp laws such as Florida, it could permanently  impoverish workers.   Last year, the Florida Supreme Court held that the Florida workers'  compensation law was so anemic that it was unconstitutional.   If the goal is to provide reasonable insurance rates, then it should  be in the insurance industry not by complicating the Coast Guard, by  complicating the Department of Labor, and denying workers their  benefits under the Longshoremen's Compensation Act.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the Committee on  Education and the Workforce opposing this amendment.           Committee on Education and the Workforce, House of             Representatives,                                     Washington, DC, July 12, 2017.      Re Opposition to Making Amendment 302 in Order as part of the           National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2018 (H.R.           2810)       Hon. Pete Sessions,      Chairman, Committee on Rules,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Louise McIntosh Slaughter,      Ranking Member, Committee on Rules,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Sessions and Ranking Member Slaughter: I am       writing to request that you not make Amendment 302 in order       as part of the rule for the FY 2018 National Defense       Authorization Act (H.R. 2810).        The amendment offered by Representatives Frankel and Byrne       changes the definition of a ``recreational'' vessel under       U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) boating safety authorizing       legislation. The amendment authors' goal is to change       workers' compensation coverage for those repairing luxury       water craft and superyachts by shifting coverage for these       workers from the Longshore and Harbor Workers Compensation       Act (LHWCA) into state workers' compensation programs.        However, the amendment does not amend the LHWCA. Rather it       changes the definition of ``recreational vessel'' under       Section 4301 of Title 46 (the Federal Boat Safety Act of       1971). According to the Coast Guard, this approach to       amending the LHWCA will have adverse collateral impacts on       Coast Guard regulatory and enforcement authorities, implicate       U.S. treaty obligations, and affect collection of tonnage       taxes on foreign flagged vessels. The USCG statement,       attached to this letter, notes that this provision could:        Exclude vessels now covered under the U.S. implementing       legislation for the International Convention on the Control       of Harmful Anti-Fouling Systems on Ships, and reduce       available civil monetary penalties to deter violations;        Allow a foreign vessel owner to exempt itself from tonnage       taxes by declaring its vessel to be under repair; and,        Allow foreign flagged vessels to avoid requirements for       safety management systems under the International Safety       Management Code.        The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) objected to this       provision in the last Congress, as it would ``lead to       uncertainty and foster litigation regarding Longshore Act       coverage'' because the definition of ``recreational'' vessel       introduces subjective criteria.        This identical amendment was included in the House National       Defense Authorization Act for FY 2017 as Section 3512, but       was removed in the House-Senate conference following the       numerous objections raised by the U.S. Coast Guard and the       U.S. Department of Labor.        None of these concerns have been considered in hearings       within the respective committees of jurisdiction for USCG or       DOL, and deserve careful consideration before being brought       to a vote.        I thank you for your consideration of this request.            Sincerely,                                             Robert C. Bobby Scott,                                                    Ranking Member.        Encl: U.S. Coast Guard Views on Amendment to the National       Defense Authorization Act (this set of views applied to the       identical language included in Amendment 302 that was adopted       in Section 3512 the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization       Act).       Coast Guard Views on Sec. 3512 of H.R. 4909, the NDAA for FY17         The Coast Guard would oppose the previously referenced       amendment to 46 U.S.C. Sec. 4301. As a general matter, it       seems like this proposed amendment is out of place. Sec. 803       of the American Investment and Recovery Act amended sec.       2(3)(F) of the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act       (33 U.S.C. Sec. 902(3)(F)), a statutory regime squarely       within the purview of the Department of Labor (DOL). Indeed,       in 2011, it was DOL--not the Coast Guard--that promulgated       the rule in question that, according to industry background       documentation, would appear to be the root cause of this       issue. Thus, any changes to address this issue should be more       properly directed either to the Longshore and Harbor Workers'       Compensation Act or to DOL and its implementing regulations.        Aside from the amendment's misplaced statutory location,       the proposed amendment contains numerous drafting issues. For       example, the proposed amendment contains no limitation of the       ``dismantling'' language to those activities ``in connection       with the repair of such vessel.'' Irrespective of the       drafting issues, the proposed amendment would not provide any       immediate relief as the draft language contains terms       undefined by statute that prevent it from being self-      executing. Finally, if adopted, the amendment would likely       create a wholly unnecessary bifurcated regulatory scheme       between the DOL regulations under 20 C.F.R.       Sec. Sec. 701.501-701.505 and additional regulations       promulgated by the Coast Guard.        The proposed change to the definition of a ``recreational       vessel'' to include ``any vessel, including a foreign vessel,       being repaired or dismantled [. . .] during such repair or       dismantling if the vessel (1) shares elements of  [[Page H5838]]       design and construction of traditional recreational vessels       (as so defined); and (2) when operating is not normally       engaged in a military, commercial, or traditionally       commercial undertaking'' has significant impacts on Coast       Guard regulatory and enforcement authorities.        The change in the definition would expand the current       exclusion for ``recreational vessels'' from the U.S.       implementing legislation for the International Convention on       the Control of Harmful Anti-Fouling Systems on Ships.       Specifically, civil penalties for owners of ``recreational       vessels'' are statutorily limited to $5,000 as compared to       the $37,500 maximum penalty for all other vessel owners.        The change in the definition could be construed to allow a       foreign vessel owner to exempt itself from tonnage taxes       required under 46 U.S.C. Sec. 60301, by claiming that its       vessel is ``being repaired'' and thereby a recreational       vessel exempted from tonnage taxes.        The change in the definition could also be construed to       allow foreign flagged vessels to avoid the requirements to       maintain a safety management system onboard under 46 U.S.C.       Sec. 3201, et seq. by claiming that its vessel is ``being       repaired'' and thereby a recreational vessel exempted from       Safety Management Requirements under the International Safety       Management Code.        In addition to these statutory impacts, there are numerous       Coast Guard regulations not related to Longshoreman and       Harbor Workers' Compensation Act authorities that would be       impacted by the change. These include:        33 C.F.R. Sec. 95.001        33 C.F.R. Sec. 151.51        46 C.F.R. Sec. 2.01-7        46 C.F.R. Sec. 4.03-50        46 C.F.R. Sec. 67.11        46 C.F.R. Sec. 136.105        This list is by no means exhaustive. Given the time for       review, the Coast Guard has not been able to conduct a       comprehensive review of statutory and regulatory impacts that       would be implicated by this change. Furthermore, as drafted,       this change would require the Coast Guard to reallocate a       substantial amount of financial and personnel resources to       ensure that its regulations were in alignment with the       revised definition. Such an undertaking is wholly       incompatible with the current fiscal climate.     Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.
