 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise because I love my  country, and I rise today with a very special message concerning some  of the disasters that confront us in this country.   I rise because, last night, this House passed H.R. 3702. This was a  piece of legislation designed to deal with emergency management after  these disasters. It is styled the Reforming Disaster Recovery Act of  2019.   This is an important piece of legislation that passed, and because it  has passed the House, it is most appropriate that we do several things.  The first is to acknowledge the support that it had in the House and  give thanks to those who have supported the legislation. I have to  thank all the 290 Members of this House who voted to support this  legislation--290 Members. It was bipartisan.   Mrs. Ann Wagner was the Republican lead on this bill, and she did  great work in bringing along the bipartisan effort that was necessary  to pass the legislation--Mrs. Ann Wagner, a cosponsor of the  legislation to deal with natural disasters.   I would also like to thank my chairwoman of the Financial Services  Committee, the Honorable Maxine Waters, who fought fearlessly to help  us get this passed.   But I cannot do this without acknowledging the ranking member, the  Honorable Mr. McHenry, who also fought to get it passed. In fact, it  passed out of the committee unanimously because of Waters and McHenry,  and because of the Honorable Ann Wagner. It passed out of the committee  unanimously.   The bill came to the floor, and again, 290 of the Members of this  Congress voted for it. I salute all the persons who helped to make this  possible.   Just a quick word about the bill, and 5 minutes is not nearly enough  to thank all the people associated with it.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a long list of persons, not the  least of which, of course, will be the staff.        Rep. Wagner, Chair Waters and Ranking Member McHenry,       Leaders Hoyer and McCarthy, Democratic and Republican Staff,       Office of Inspector General, Department of Housing and Urban       Development; Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Dr.       Ben Carson, Chair DeFazio and Ranking Member Sam Graves,       Chair Lowey and Ranking Member Kay Granger, Houston Mayor       Sylvester Turner, Harris County Judge Hidalgo, Harris County       Commissioner Rodney Ellis, Harris County Commissioner Adrian       Garcia.                                 Endorsements          National Housing Resource Center.         National Fair Housing Alliance.         National Low Income Housing Coalition.         Disaster Housing Recovery Coalition, 800+ members,       including: The Arc of the United States, Autistic Self       Advocacy Network, Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities       Housing Task Force, Disaster Law Project, Enterprise       Community Partners, Fair Share Housing Center, Habitat for       Humanity International, Hispanic Federation, Local       Initiatives Support Coalition, National Association of       Councils on Developmental Disabilities, National Coalition       for Healthy Housing, National Community Development       Association, National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty,       Paralyzed Veterans of America, Texas Low Income Housing       Information Service.     Mr. Speaker, the staff really worked diligently  and tirelessly to get this bill passed as well.   But the bill itself, after natural disasters in this country, we have  been relegated to starting a process to accord various areas in the  country that are impacted funding to help them rebuild, to help them  restore order to their lives.   In doing this, we have not codified the methodology by which we would  perfect the assistance that is needed. We never codified it. Twenty-six  years ago, HUD received the responsibility to respond, but we didn't  give any codified rules.   The HUD OIG indicated that there was a necessity to codify some rules  so that we could respond in a timely manner but, also, do it in an  efficacious manner such that we would not reinvent the wheel each and  every time, which is what we have been doing, reinventing the wheel.   Well, this bill does that. It codifies the whole process of dealing  with management after a disaster.   FEMA deals with the emergency side of it, in terms of an immediate  response, providing persons with someplace to live, providing persons  with the necessities of life. But the long-term response is what HUD  deals with.   Under this long-term response legislation that we passed yesterday,  HUD now can work with municipalities directly, in some cases. If a  municipality has demonstrated that it can handle large sums of money,  then funding can go from the Congress to the municipality, as opposed  to some other agency within the State and then trickle down to that  municipality.   Houston, Texas, by way of example, has demonstrated that it can  handle these large sums of money. They have a great accounting  department. Mayor Turner is there, and he has done an outstanding job.   With this kind of opportunity to get direct funding, people will  receive help more efficaciously. They will receive it immediately.   Also, in small areas of the country, small cities, they will get a  better understanding of how they can approach this process and how they  can get the funding accorded them in a faster way.   The bill really is something that has been needed, not only for the  hurricanes and the flooding but also for the tornadic activities, for  the earthquakes that will visit some parts of the country, and for the  fires that we will have.   This legislation is meaningful, and I will say more about it in the  future.                            ____________________
