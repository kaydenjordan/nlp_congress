 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Trone, and I appreciate the  opportunity to be able to join this Special Order on behalf of the late  Senator Paul Sarbanes.   Mr. Speaker, I want to just thank   John Sarbanes, our distinguished  colleague from Maryland, for being here, for accepting our joint and  individual condolences over the last several days, and for being so  very, very much like his father.   I also want to extend that same thanks to Michael Sarbanes and to  their sister, Janet, and to the larger Sarbanes family of in-laws, many  of whom we have not met, all of whom share in this hour of this  overwhelming sense of loss. It is loss both for the family and,  obviously, I hope we would agree, for the entire Nation, regardless of  what side of that aisle that we sit or stand on.   I first came to know, if I may use that term, Paul Sarbanes in May of  1974, when, as a student of political science, I devoured every  opportunity I could to watch political proceedings. And I remember the  assignment that we got that May: to make sure that we watched,  understood, and learned from what was then the impending impeachment  proceedings against Richard Milhous Nixon.   So on a small, fuzzy TV, I got introduced to Paul Sarbanes. And along  with him, I got introduced that month to Peter Rodino of New Jersey,  the chair of the Judiciary Committee, and to Larry Hogan, Senior, the  only Republican to vote for all Articles of Impeachment.   I was just struck by the fact that no matter how much I had heard or  believed or given into the fact that politics was just posturing and  that politicians would say anything and do anything in order to secure  a vote, I saw three men that day, led by Paul Sarbanes, who  exemplified, to me at least, the highest ideals of moral character that  I had seen coming out of Washington--or any other chamber--because of  the way they conducted themselves, but more importantly, because of the  principles that they held onto, that in many instances could, in fact,  and might, indeed, cost them votes.   But they believed, nonetheless, that the sacred oath of office that  we all took when we came to this Chamber, or when others have gone to  the Senate, must be something that we abide by.   And so I got a special sense of pride when I realized that not only  was this Paul Sarbanes, this dashing young man who was absolutely  brilliant on details, not only was he saying and doing and representing  all of us, I thought, in the best way possible, he was also from the  State of Maryland, which gave me extra pride and extra pause.   I said to myself, if I were to ever be elected to the office, that is  the standard that I should subscribe to, that is the standard that I  should emulate, and that is the standard that I think all of us benefit  from, a standard bequeathed by Paul Sarbanes and others that is just as  important today as it was that hot day in May of 1974.   And so while the House has a sense of loss because of Paul's time  here and his work with so many of us, because the Senate has that same  sense of loss, I would dare suggest that in Annapolis, Maryland, that  the State legislature feels that same way for the many days that he  walked those halls and the many bills that he helped usher through  them.   We all think about Sarbanes-Oxley, but Paul Sarbanes, lest it ever be  misunderstood, fought like crazy to expand affordable housing and to  stabilize Social Security and Medicaid trust funds and Medicare trust  funds. He fought, as John mentioned earlier, for the little things that  may escape many of us, that we might feel that we are too big or too  proud to do, just the notion of making sure that people got the same  mail delivery on a block who happened to be Black and who happened to  be citizens.   So there are a lot of things that can and will be said, I think and I  know, about Paul and his life and what he stood for and what he  believed in. Let me say a couple of others.   Paul Sarbanes had a good heart. He loved Christine. Whenever I saw  him, I saw her. And I said to him once: Paul, isn't Christine tired of  you dragging her out to this dinner and to this event and to this  speaking engagement?   He said: No, she is actually dragging me out, because there are some  times when I don't want to go out.   But he had a very, very good heart, and they represented just the  best of matrimony.   I sent a text to John an hour after I learned of the passing of his  dad, and I said, among other things: John, you and your sisters won the  parents sweepstakes. You just had great parents, great role models, who  were great Americans.   So Shakespeare said of that kind of good heart long, long ago,  something that he took to pen with, he said that a good heart is like  the Sun and the Moon, for it shines bright; it never changes because it  keeps its course.   Paul Sarbanes kept his course. He was unawed by opinion, unseduced by  flattery, and undismayed by disaster. He instinctively knew that  America was not like a blanket: one size, one shape, one texture, or  one color; but, rather, and instead, he realized that the America that  we all love is so much more like a quilt: different shapes, different  sizes, different textures, and different colors, all woven and held  together by a single precious thread of democracy.   Paul has taught us so much, and as students who followed him, worked  with him, believed with him, loved him, and now miss him, we could  never be more thankful.                                time  2000
