 Madam President, I rise to recognize Mr. Mark Covall,  who, after 34 years with the National Association for Behavioral  Healthcare, NABH, is retiring.   For the past 24 years, Mark ably served as the president and CEO of  the NABH, which was founded in 1933 to advocate for the interests of  behavioral healthcare systems and providers that treat children,  adolescents, adults, and senior citizens with mental health and  substance use disorders. Under Mark's steadfast leadership, NABH helped  to secure parity in mental and general healthcare services, paving the  way for the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and  Addiction Equity Act of 2008. More recently, Mark and NABH helped to  ensure that Congress enacted the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery  Act and 21st Century Cures Act in 2016 and the SUPPORT for Patients and  Communities Act in 2018.   Mark's leadership in coalition-building, as well as his work to  develop strong relationships with behavioral healthcare providers,  government officials, and associations such as the American Hospital  Association, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Mental Health  America, and the Kennedy Forum, explain why he has been as effective in  influencing regulation as he has been in advancing legislation. I am  told others in the behavioral health field would go to Mark for his  insight, knowing he is one of the behavioral healthcare community's  most well-informed and strongest advocates.   Today, I join others in the mental health community in thanking Mark  Covall for his decades of leadership, dedication, and passion for  ensuring that millions of Americans have access to quality mental  health and addiction treatment services.                            ____________________
