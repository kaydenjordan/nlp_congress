 Madam President, I rise today in strong support of my  amendment with the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Jones, to this domestic  spending package.   Our amendment will permanently block an impending $1.2 billion cut to  Federal investments and Federal transportation. Without our legislative  action to block this cut, public transit agencies across the country  will suffer a 12-percent across-the-board cut. These cuts will be  devastating to all of our communities.   Transit funds in my home State in Arizona are critically important to  our quickly growing communities. Maricopa County was the fastest  growing county in the United States last year, and cities such as  Flagstaff and Tucson are also attracting more jobs and more families.  Our State continues to have to meet the demands of our expanding cities  and towns, and that is true from Phoenix to Flagstaff and all  throughout the State.   Our amendment would block more than $15.4 million in cuts to Arizona  transit agencies. These cuts could result in drastically reduced  services, including those for low-income individuals and individuals  with disabilities, and reduce funds necessary to modernize bus and rail  fleets, as well as slow construction of news stations and shelters.   A broad coalition of over 30 associations--including the American  Public Transportation Association, the Associated General Contractors  of America, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--support our efforts and  this amendment to block these cuts.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record a copy of a letter from the 32 national associations urging  Congress to support our amendment.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                  October 22, 2019.      Hon. Richard C. Shelby,      Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Susan M. Collins,      Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on           Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and           Related Agencies, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,      Vice Chairman, Committee on Appropriations U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Jack Reed,      Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee on           Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and           Related Agencies, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Shelby, Vice Chairman Leahy, Chairman       Collins, and Ranking Member Reed: We greatly appreciate your       bipartisan efforts to advance S. 2520, the Transportation,       Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD)       Appropriations Act, 2020. Although S. 2520 includes many       critical investments for public transportation, it reduces       total funding for public transportation by $457 million       compared to the Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 enacted levels. As you       continue working together on the bill, we strongly urge you       to increase investment in public transportation and       permanently block the impending $1.2 billion across-the-board       cut to transit formula funds.        Infrastructure investment is critical for our nation's       economic growth and now is the time to invest more, not less,       in public transportation. Increased investment will provide       the necessary resources to begin to address the more than $90       billion state-of-good-repair backlog in our nation's transit       systems and meet the mobility demands of growing communities.        In addition, we urge you to include a provision in the bill       permanently blocking the impending 12 percent across-the-      board cut to each public transit agency throughout the       country. We greatly appreciate your leadership in ensuring       that the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020 (P.L. 116-59,       Division A) included a provision temporarily preventing this       cut, but further and immediate action is needed to ensure       that this harmful provision does not take effect in FY 2020.        Americans ride public transportation 10 billion times a       year, and every trip meets a need or provides an opportunity.       It gets people to work, their doctors, local businesses, and       schools. It is a lifeline that connects communities. We urge       you to support increased investment in public transportation       for critical projects in small, medium, and large communities       across the nation.        In summary, as you continue working together on the Senate       THUD Appropriations bill, we strongly urge you to increase       investment in public transportation and permanently block the       impending $1.2 billion across-the-board cut to transit       formula funds.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,        American Public Transportation Association, Amalgamated       Transit Union; American Association of State Highway and       Transportation Officials; American Concrete Pipe Association;       American Council of Engineering Companies; American Planning       Association; American Road & Transportation Builders       Association; American Society of Civil Engineers; Associated       General Contractors of America; Association of Equipment       Manufacturers; Association of Metropolitan Planning       Organizations; The Bus Coalition; Community Transportation       Association of America; Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute;       The Intelligent Transportation Society of America;       International Union of Operating Engineers; National Asphalt       Pavement Association.

Madam President, I urge my colleagues to join Senator  Jones from Alabama and me in supporting this important bipartisan  amendment.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     Madam President, I rise in strong support of my  amendment with Senator Jones from Alabama. As he said, this is a very  important amendment to block $1.2 billion in cuts to these transit  agencies that are impacting every single one of our States. Across  Arizona, this is millions  [[Page S6322]]  of dollars, a 12-percent cut in every State, and we are going to stop  that from happening here today.   As Senator Jones mentioned, this is impacting people of low income,  of disabilities, and in rural communities across the board. A broad  coalition of over 30 associations--including the American Public  Transportation Association, Associated General Contractors of America,  and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--support our efforts today to block  these cuts.   I urge our colleagues to please join us and vote for our amendment.   I yield the floor.
