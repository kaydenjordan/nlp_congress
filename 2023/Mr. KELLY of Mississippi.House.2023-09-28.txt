 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my  amendment to reduce funding for the Global Environment Facility fund  from $139 million to $129 million, or by $10 million.   We do well what we measure. That is what my father told me growing  up. We do well what we measure. Unfortunately, many of the  organizations and much of the money that is spent by America are not  measured well.   We need to force people to prioritize and to account for the funds  that they spend. This is a small, little cut.   Americans are struggling every day as they face high gas prices,  inflation due to the reckless spending of this administration, and the  radical climate change agenda of the Biden administration.   My amendment claws back just a little bit of those hard-earned tax  dollars going to fund climate change initiatives outside of our  borders.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to vote in support of my  amendment. Remember, we do well what we measure.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I point out that we spend a lot  of money overseas to preserve our environment. None of it is measured.  There are no metrics of success. We spend billions and billions of  dollars outside of the United States for climate preservation, which  countries like China just refuse to acknowledge, or other areas in  South America that do not do those.   Mr. Chair, I ask for support for my amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I ask people to remember that we  are asking for a small cut. We do well what we measure and what we  account for.   Mr. Chair, I ask for a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
