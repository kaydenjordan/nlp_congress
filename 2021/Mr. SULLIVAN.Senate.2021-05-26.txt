 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, for decades, even centuries, America's  universities have been the envy of the world and one of America's  biggest comparative advantages. At their best, they are hubs for  innovative thinking, places where free exchange of ideas are not only  encouraged but expected on campus. They have been the backbones of  innovations that have changed countless lives in America and, really,  across the world for the better.   Now, of course, freedom of speech is enshrined in the First Amendment  of our Constitution. The birth of our Nation was the result of our  Founding Fathers escaping tyranny and pursuit of freedom of thought and  expression.   And since the inception of our country, we have prevailed over every  country an empire that we have competed with, in part, because of  America's commitment to the free exchange of ideas, and our  universities have traditionally amplified this longstanding American  ideal and comparative advantage.   But, unfortunately, this is changing. Today, it is becoming  increasingly clear that many of our universities too often stamp out  the exchange of ideas for certain politically correct narratives. This  is having a chilling effect on our students, on campus, and most  importantly, their ability to express themselves.   Let me present some disturbing findings. A recent Gallup survey of  3,000 undergraduate students found that 81 percent of students widely  support a campus environment where they are exposed to all types of  speech, even speech they find offensive--81 percent. However, that same  survey found that only 59 percent of college students believe that free  speech rights are secure, and that is down from 73 percent just 4 years  ago.   That same survey also found that 63 percent of university students in  America agree that the climate on their campus deters students from  expressing themselves openly, almost two-thirds of American students.  That is remarkable. It is dangerous, not just for university life but  for American life, and I believe it is unacceptable. Fortunately, we  can do something about it with the simple amendment that I have offered  today.   This bill that we are debating right now, the Endless Frontier Act,  will be sending billions, tens of billions, of dollars--taxpayer  dollars--to America's universities. My amendment says, in return for  these billions of dollars when applying for National Science Foundation  funds, universities will be required to attest that they are protecting  free speech, religious liberty, and prohibiting discrimination on  campus and explain what steps they are taking to ensure compliance.  That is it, a letter to the NSF once a year for billions in Federal  research dollars.   Now, already, we are hearing that some universities oppose my  amendment, calling it ``burdensome.'' Well, here it is. It is 2 pages.  It is simple. It is easy. This university opposition actually  illustrates the problem that, in exchange for billions of dollars in  Federal research money, America's universities can't be bothered to  demonstrate to Congress and the American people that they are committed  to the principles of the First Amendment which, by the way, have made  our country and our universities so exceptional.  [[Page S3477]]    Censorship, oppression, and one-sided thoughts are characteristics of  Communist China, not America, and certainly should not be the  characteristics of America's great universities--to the contrary.   One of the most important ways to compete with and win against  Communist China is to ensure that America--and, yes, our universities-- remain what they have traditionally been: laboratories of free  expression, free thought, creativity, innovation, and ingenuity.   My simple amendment will help make sure this happens, and I encourage  all of my colleagues to vote yes to support this amendment, an America  of free liberty, free thinking, and innovation.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, with all due respect to my colleague  from Washington, when the universities say they can't do this because  it is too burdensome, again, to me that actually demonstrates the very  problem my simple amendment is trying to resolve.   All it is saying is in exchange for the tens of billions of dollars  that America's universities will be getting as part of the Endless  Frontier Act, they have to do one simple thing: once a year, send a  letter to the National Science Foundation saying--and this is in the  amendment right here--they have committed to protecting free speech,  viewpoint diversity, the free exchange of ideas, academic freedom, and  the protection of religious liberty, and prohibiting against  discrimination.   That is it, Mr. President. It is very simple. This is what  universities should be doing. It is a letter, once a year, that is very  simple in exchange for billions and billions of Federal research  dollars. I certainly hope all of my colleagues will support this  amendment--simple, needed.   Again, this is how we outcompete communist China, which is all about  what the Endless Frontier Act is focused on.   I encourage my colleagues to vote yes.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1911     I ask for the yeas and nays.
