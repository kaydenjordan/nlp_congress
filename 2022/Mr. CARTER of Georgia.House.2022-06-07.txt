 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of Albert  Earl Klein, Sr., known as Al, a veteran, a fellow pharmacist, and a  small business owner.   Born in Mt. Pleasant in 1925, Al acquired a love for the outdoors,  playing multiple sports, and spending his free time boating, becoming  an accomplished fisherman at the young age of 18.   Al went on to serve in the Army, training at Fort Bragg and  eventually traveling to Guam as a rescue boat operator. He was  honorably discharged after receiving multiple citations and  decorations.   Upon returning home, Al earned his doctorate degree in pharmacy at  the College of Charleston and obtained his Georgia pharmacy license  shortly thereafter.   Al opened several drug stores, one of them in my beautiful hometown  of Pooler, Georgia, and he enjoyed a successful career of over 60  years.   After retirement, Al and his wife, Ethel, enjoyed traveling,  gardening, and visiting their four children and 12 grandchildren.   Al was a veteran, an honorable business owner, and a family man whose  love for the outdoors made sure he lived life to the fullest. He will  surely be missed.                            ____________________
