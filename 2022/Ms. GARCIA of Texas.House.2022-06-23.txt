 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate President  [[Page H5826]]  Biden's massive accomplishment of slashing the Federal deficit by more  than any other President in the first 16 months.   Mr. Speaker, this is huge. But even better news: Biden is on track to  double down on building a better America for generations to come.   This year's deficit is on track to fall by $1.7 trillion which is the  single largest 1-year reduction in American history. I repeat: This is  the single largest reduction in American history.   In contrast, the Trump administration increased the Federal budget  deficit. Every single year in office, it went up.   I can't say I am surprised, however. This accomplishment of the  President is not coincidence. It is the result of a well-designed and  well-managed recovery plan from the pandemic.   It is a result of President Biden and Congress passing key  legislation like the historical American Rescue Plan which got people  back to work, kids back in school, and families healthy again.   It is the result of a President who puts people first--not politics,  people.   But on another note, it is no secret that the recent price hikes that  have been caused by the war criminal Putin are burdening hardworking  families. In fact, Putin's price hike has increased gas prices by $2 a  gallon in many places since Russian troops began to threaten Ukraine,  and families are seeing higher prices in the grocery aisles, too.   Sadly, Putin is increasing inflation, not only here in America, but  also throughout the globe. House Democrats and President Biden won't  stand for this. My colleagues and I are working side by side with the  President to lower costs for working people at the gas pump, at the  grocery store, and across the shelves.   That is why House Democrats passed critical bills like the Lowering  Food and Fuel Costs Act, Ocean Shipping Reform Act, and the Consumer  Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act.   These key bills will strengthen our supply chains, create more  maritime jobs in communities like my home district, and lower both gas  and goods prices.   Just yesterday, Mr. Speaker, the President announced that he is in  favor of taking a pause of 3 months on the Federal gas tax. He has  challenged Congress to pass that, to put a pause on the Federal  gasoline tax for 3 months.   Now, our tax is 18 cents. That would be 18 cents per gallon every  time someone fills up. He challenged all of the Governors to do the  same.   Some Governors, like the Governors of Florida and Georgia and others,  have already done this. In my State of Texas, that means an additional  savings of 20 cents. Added together, that would be 38 cents a gallon.   That is huge. That is a huge savings in cutting prices down. For an  average tank of 15 gallons, that would be a savings of $5.70 every time  they fill up.   So I hope that our Governor does like Florida and Georgia and rises  to the challenge that the President has made yesterday and puts a pause  on Texas' gasoline tax.   House Democrats are taking strong steps. We are joining hands with  the President to make sure that we lower rising prices caused by  Putin's cruel war in Ukraine. I call on all my Republican colleagues  across the aisle to join us.   Most Republicans voted against all those bills that I just mentioned.  It is time to act. Enough is enough. I urge them to fight with us for  hardworking American families. Together, we can build a better America  for today and for generations to come.                            ____________________
