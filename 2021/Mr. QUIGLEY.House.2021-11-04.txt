 Mr. Speaker, author and historian Timothy Snyder said in  his book, ``On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century,''  that ``history does not repeat, but it does instruct.''   Indeed, we must constantly work to preserve our democratic  institutions from those who wish to threaten them because one of the  most powerful instructions or lessons from the last century is that  democracy is deeply fragile, and more importantly, it can trend and  fall into authoritarianism.   There are those in this country who are ignoring the lessons of the  past, or worse. Some of the most popular news programs, Facebook  groups, and social media networks are those that spread deliberate or  negligent misinformation for partisan gain, sure, but for financial  gain especially.   In 2018, the American Institutional Confidence Poll found that only  69 percent of Americans believed democracy is always preferable to any  other kind of government. The remaining 31 percent either reported that  they were open to authoritarianism under some circumstances or they  were so disillusioned with politics that the type of government didn't  matter.   While 69 percent may not seem alarming, it is nearly the same number  of Hungarians who reported that democratic values, such as multiparty  elections, were ``very important'' the same year that autocratic  Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban began his ascent to power.   Alarmingly, American conservative pundits have been praising Orban  for his brand of strongman authoritar ianism for months, while Orban's rule has been marked by state control  of the media; restrictions on LGBTQ and immigrant communities; and  suppression of free speech, a free media, and political opposition.   Despite Orban's assault on global democratic values, conservative  commentators here at home have endorsed his policies and have held him  up as an example of what Americans should look for in a leader. These  pundits have praised him for rejecting immigrants and refugees and have  embraced his brand of ethnoreligious nationalism.   This praise for autocratic leaders and authoritarianism is dangerous.   Perhaps many believe that what happened in Hungary, the swift  consolidation of political power and manipulation of political  institutions, could not happen here. But one of the important lessons  of the Trump Presidency is that we cannot afford to be complacent.   Over the past 4 years, we watched media and leaders on the right  excuse or even support former President Trump as he leaned into  authoritar ianism and incited violence. During his time in office, the former  President's actions often echoed those of strongmen like Orban.   The former President used his office to target political rivals,  including the efforts in Ukraine that ultimately led to his  impeachment, treated the Department of Justice as his own personal  police force, violently put down protests against him, used the  Presidency to enrich himself, embraced political strongmen across the  globe, and intentionally inflamed political tensions to his own  benefit.   I believe history can and should continue to inform us, but we don't  have to look back very far. The trends developing around the world and  in our own country are warning about the threat of authoritarianism.   At a time when political polarization has led to violent attacks on  democratic institutions across the country and in this very room, it is  reckless to be feeding into these divisions.   They are preying on deep ideological divides in this country and on  their followers' fears. They exploit economic anxieties and concerns  over immigration and globalization. They advocate for a society where  the voices of those who offer different opinions are threatened or  silenced.   A poll just released by the Public Religion Research Institute found  that 40 percent of those who subscribe to the farthest right media  agree with the statement that ``true American patriots may have to  resort to violence in order to save this country.''   These statistics should be alarming to all of us. But those who  peddle incendiary and harmful rhetoric are using the trends toward  authoritar ianism to their cynical advantage.   Authoritarianism thrives on polarization and uncertainty. Those who  exploit, not repair, these cracks in our democracy do so for the  explicit purpose of increasing their own power.   We must recognize their true intentions and work to preserve the  democracy they seek to threaten.   All media outlets have an obligation to present Orban and others like  him as they are, repressive demagogues who threaten liberty and the  rule of law.   We must continue to recognize our common interests and those that  have made our country the envy of the world: our freedoms of  expression, economic mobility, and our deep cultural richness.   Orban's rule is a warning to all of us.                            ____________________
