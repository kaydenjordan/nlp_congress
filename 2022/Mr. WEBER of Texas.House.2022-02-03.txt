 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the  life of Officer Christopher Wayne Berry, a member of the Vidor Police  Department in Orange County, Texas.   Officer Berry was a dedicated public servant and an inspiration to  the community that he cherished so dearly.   Ever since he was a boy, Chris wanted to be a police officer, Madam  Speaker. Not only did he achieve that dream, Chris went on to serve  honorably as a keeper of the peace for over 30 years.   Those who knew him will tell you that he always treated anyone he met  with the utmost respect. He will forever be remembered as a kindhearted  community servant who was always willing to lend a helping hand.   In addition to being a well-respected member of the Vidor Police  force, Chris was also an avid outdoorsman who enjoyed hunting, fishing,  beekeeping, and gardening.   Officer Berry is survived by his wife, Brenda, and their three  children: Bailey, Brayden, and Amber. He is also survived by his  parents, Norman and Loretta Berry, as well as his brothers: Mike,  Stephen, and Michael Berry.   Madam Speaker, may Officer Chris Berry rest in peace. He will be  sorely missed.                            ____________________
