 Mr. Speaker, here is my 1-minute breakdown on why I oppose  repealing ObamaCare without replacement:   First, this law protects all Americans with preexisting conditions;  second, it keeps all young adults on their parents' insurance until age  26; third, it protects all Americans from bankruptcy if they get sick  by removing lifetime caps.   Before the act, millions of Americans were simply kicked off their  insurance when these problems arose. We Democrats support keeping these  protections for all Americans, and the Republicans want to repeal them.  We support improving the act, and the Republicans want to eliminate it.   While many have stoked fear and spread false information for  political gain, it is clear that repeal without replacement equals  disaster. It will eliminate these protections for all Americans, create  chaos for working families, and send our country into another  recession.   It is clear we need to improve the act rather than repeal it. It is  time to do the right thing for all Floridians and for all Americans.
