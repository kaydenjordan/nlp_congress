 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I would like to first express my thanks and appreciation as well to  the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks), who is bringing this  legislation forward, H.R. 1973, of which I am a proud cosponsor. The  bill is the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act.   Every year, Mr. Chair, thousands of amateur athletes begin their  journey with the goal of one day being able to represent the United  States at the Olympics. This journey is often filled with years of  dedication, of sacrifice, of multiple setbacks, all in the hopes of  rising to the top of their craft.   Unfortunately, for some, this journey has also been scarred by sexual  abuse, and often this abuse comes from those who are closest to our  young athletes. These are the individuals that have been entrusted by  families all around the country to look after them, to take care of  them, to look after these loved ones during their training.   The bill today in the House that we are taking up is a step in the  right direction to help ensure that athletes are better protected. It  requires mandatory and immediate reporting of incidents of child sexual  abuse to both local and Federal law enforcement. No organization should  be able to stand idly by when a child is placed in harm's way and  becomes a victim.   The bill also directs our amateur athletic governing bodies to  develop and implement rigorous training and oversight practices to  prevent abuse of athletes in the future. Mr. Chair, our amateur  athletes and their families should never ever have to worry about their  children being abused by those who are closest to them, often in a very  trusted relationship.   We need to pass this critical legislation to give families the peace  of mind and prevent abuse. I urge all of my colleagues to support this  bipartisan bill.
