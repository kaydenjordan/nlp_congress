 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and I  salute him for his extraordinary leadership and being a champion for  America's working families. I commend him and the Democratic members of  the House Ways and Means Committee for putting forth the facts on what  is in this bill.   Mr. Speaker, today we choose what kind of country America will be:  one that champions the ladders of opportunity for all or one that  reinforces the power of the wealthiest and well connected.   Outside the Congress, the American people have already made their  decision. Polling shows that Americans oppose the GOP tax scam by a  margin of 2 to 1. Hardworking families see right through the brazen con  job Republicans are trying to sell them.   So why aren't our Republican colleagues standing with their  constituents? Why aren't they joining us on insisting on A Better Deal  for American families? Why aren't they joining us in demanding that we  write real bipartisan tax reform that puts the middle class first?   Because helping the middle class has never been their goal.   From day one, the donors, lobbyists, and the wealthy and well  connected came first. The Frankenstein monster of giveaways and special  interest loopholes we are voting on today proves it, and this monster  will come back to haunt them, as Frankenstein did.   Republicans claim that their bill is a middle class tax cut. The fact  is, according to the Tax Policy Center, their bill raises taxes on 86  million middle class households.   When The Washington Post asked Edward Kleinbard, former chief of  staff for the Joint Committee on Taxation, if the tax package in  aggregate would mean a middle class tax cut, he said: ``That is  delusional or dishonest to say. It is factually untrue. The only group  you can point to that wins year after year and wins in very large  magnitude is the very highest incomes.''    That is from the Joint Committee on Taxation former chief of staff.   The only greater delusion in this bill is the ludicrous Republican  insistence, their claim that these giveaways to the wealthiest will pay  for themselves.   Bruce Bartlett is the architect of Jack Kemp's supply-side economics.  As Bruce Bartlett has testified in our hearing and in public, when it  comes to tax breaks for the wealthy paying for themselves, he said:         It is not true. It is nonsense. It is BS.    He said the whole words.   In a few minutes, Republicans will vote to explode catastrophically  our national debt at minimum of $1.5 trillion, likely $2.2 trillion or  more.   Where are the vaunted Republican deficit hawks? Are they endangered?  Are they extinct? Do they care about the deficit when we pass giveaways  for the rich and big corporations?   They don't care about deficits, then. Tax breaks for the rich,  corporate tax breaks: they don't care about the deficit.   Do Republicans only care about the deficit when the issue is helping  children, seniors, our veterans, who are a large part of hardworking  Americans?   My colleagues, my fellow Americans, remember this vote. Remember the  vote, when they will cheer at the end of this vote, they will stand up  and cheer, adding trillions to the national debt in order to give tax  breaks to the wealthiest 1 percent and to big corporations. They will  cheer that.   They will cheer when they say we can't afford to protect the health  of our innocent children. They will cheer that.   Remember, they will cheer when they tell you we can't afford the next  step, we can't afford Medicaid, Medicare, and a dignified retirement  our seniors spent a lifetime earning. That is an applause line for  them.   Remember this day when Republicans cheer for a bill that hands a  $4,000 child tax credit to families of four earning $400,000 a year. If  you earn $400,000 a year, you get $4,000 in a child tax credit.                                time  1330    But if you are poor, a single mom, a mother of two earning only  $14,500, guess how much you get?   Seventy-five dollars. Seventy-five dollars.   Today we gather on this floor in the midst of a holy season. In this  season, we celebrate the miraculous blessings of God. We reflect on the  wondrous joy of children and our responsibility to them.   We remember our duty to live justly. For those of us blessed to serve  in this Congress, we must remember our special responsibility to govern  fairly, to meet the needs of all of God's children.   In this holy time, the moral obscenity and unrepentant greed of the  GOP tax scam stands out even more clearly.   As the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said early on, ``. . .  this proposal appears to be the first Federal income tax modification  in American history that will raise income taxes on the working poor  while simultaneously providing a large tax cut to the wealthy. This is  simply unconscionable.''   They will be cheering it. Unconscionable. Remember what the Bishops  said.   Now, here, get back to the Republicans. This is in sharp contrast to  the words of Senator Hatch. Now, he is the chairman of the Finance  Committee in the United States Senate and an author of this bill. He  said: ``I have a rough time wanting to spend billions and billions and  trillions of dollars to help people who won't help themselves, won't  lift a finger, and expect the Federal Government to do everything.''   How about that?   Tell that to the moms we just saw speaking out with their children,  children with disabilities, who wonder how this could be so cruel.   This is an act of misery, but not according to Senator Hatch. And  that is in terms of getting back to our Bishops. In his encyclical, God  is Love. And I have said this to my colleagues before, but with,  obviously, no effect on the Republican side.   Pope Benedict quoted the urgent moral wisdom of St. Augustine 17  centuries ago, my colleagues. Seventeen  [[Page H10210]]  centuries ago, St. Augustine said: ``A State which is not governed  according to justice is just a bunch of thieves.''   Pope Benedict went on to say: ``The State must inevitably face the  question of how justice can be achieved here and now.''   In his words, he cautioned against ``the danger of certain ethical  blindness caused by the dazzling effect of power and special  interests.''   Mr. Speaker, is there justice in a bill that rewards corporations  shipping jobs overseas? Jobs of hardworking American men and women and  veterans, shipping those jobs overseas? Is there justice in that?   No, I don't think so.   Is there justice in a bill that spikes healthcare premiums and may  add 13 million Americans to the ranks of the uninsured?   No justice there.   Is there justice in a bill that raises taxes on 86 million middle  class families?   Here we are. Raises taxes on 86 million middle class families, and  they try to present the delusion that it is a middle class tax cut.   Is there justice in a bill that hands a breathtaking 83 percent of  its benefits to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans? Eighty-three  percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent?   Is there justice in a bill that explodes the national debt to give  the wealthy and the well connected a break and sticks the debt with our  children? Is that justice?   I didn't think you thought so. I wish our Republican colleagues would  join us.   This GOP tax scam is simply theft, monumental, brazen theft from the  American middle class and from every person who aspires to reach it.  The GOP tax scam is not a voice for an investment in growth or jobs. It  is a vote to install a permanent plutocracy in our Nation. They will be  cheering that later.   It does violence to the vision of our Founders. It disrespects the  sacrifice of our men and women in uniform, who are a large part of our  middle class, and to whom we owe a future worthy of their sacrifice. It  betrays the future and betrays the aspirations of our children.   It morally demands a ``no'' vote from every Member of this House of  the people.
