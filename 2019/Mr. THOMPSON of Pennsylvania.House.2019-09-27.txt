 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize September 27 as National Chocolate Milk Day. Chocolate milk  is adored by millions of Americans nationwide, and it is a favorite  among children. Seventy percent of the milk children consume is  flavored, with chocolate being the most popular.   Why?   Because chocolate milk is low in fat, high in nutrients, and packed  with flavor.   Milk consumption has been declining, however, and when the National  School Lunch Program removed the most popular and the most nutritious  options from the schools to serve only fat-free milk, the numbers  continued to drop. This was partially reversed by the USDA when the  decision was made to, once again, allow 1 percent flavored milk back in  school lunches.   To build on this momentum, I introduced the Whole Milk for Healthy  Kids Act earlier this year to once again allow whole milk--both  flavored and unflavored--to be offered within the program because  children can greatly benefit from the essential nutrients whole milk  provides.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to celebrate National Chocolate  Milk Day accordingly.                            ____________________
