 Mr. Speaker, sometimes it seems that the United States  moves from one crisis to the next. We have to keep our eye on the ball.   As Members of Congress, we have a duty to protect everyone in this  country from unnecessary suffering. We cannot forget that the Trump  administration is still holding children in cages, ``Cages `R' Us.''   Congress should step up and end this terrible policy. We cannot  forget that thousands--maybe even millions--of people in this country  are served by water systems that violate the Safe Water Drinking Act.  Congress should invest in rebuilding community water infrastructures.   We cannot forget that this year there is nearly one school shooting a  week. Congress needs to dump the NRA and pass reasonable gun laws.   Mr. Speaker, ignoring the problem doesn't make it go away, and each  moment we fail to act puts human lives at risk.                            ____________________
