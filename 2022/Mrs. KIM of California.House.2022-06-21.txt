 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this important bipartisan  legislation, the Promoting United States International Leadership in 5G  Act.   Mr. Speaker, the Chinese Communist Party does not hide the fact that  they will do whatever it takes to become the prominent global power,  especially by taking control of the world's 5G networks. The CCP's  espionage tactics, theft of U.S. intellectual property, and cyber  hacking threaten our national security and our competitiveness in the  international community. Allowing the CCP to establish the global  standards for 5G and push countries to adopt 5G technology from CCP- linked companies like Huawei will only increase the amount of control  and influence that the CCP has globally.   This bill provides increased cooperation between the United States  and our allies to identify and counter security risks posed by Chinese  Communist Party-linked companies in 5G. In addition, the bill requires  the State Department to develop a diplomatic strategy to increase  engagement with partners at the international standards setting bodies,  such as the International Telecommunications Union, ITU, which sets  global standards for technologies such as 5G.   There is an important upcoming election at the ITU which will decide  the future of global telecommunications for years to come. It is  imperative that we pass this bill today so that the United States and  our allies can put up a united front against a Russian- and CCP-aligned  candidate for Secretary General of the ITU. Russia's campaign to elect  a Russian national, who is a former Huawei executive, to serve as the  secretary general of the ITU is indicative of Russia's and China's  efforts to use the international organization to promote their  interests and malign influence.   The United States should ensure that we are coordinated in driving  support for the United States candidate, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, for the  Secretary General of the ITU, but the State Department should also be  engaging on the important down-ballot races at the ITU.   There are four other posts of significance within the ITU's  leadership structure, including the director of the ITU Development  Sector, ITU-D. The ITU-D plays a particularly vital role in  [[Page H5709]]  supporting multilateral cooperation for fair and open internet  governance through trustworthy deployment of digital technologies in  the developing world. The United States must be doing everything we can  to ensure Russian and Chinese malign influence does not grow. This bill  will help.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank Ranking Member  Mike McCaul and  Representative Cuellar for their work on this legislation. This bill  will help ensure that the United States is doing all we can to stop  Russian and Chinese malign influence taking control of the world's 5G  networks.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Con. Res. 59, condemning  the October 25 coup in Sudan. I thank Chairman Meeks, Ranking Member  McCaul, as well as Chairwoman Bass and Ranking Member Smith of the  Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health and Global Human Rights.   Mr. Speaker, the people of Sudan have worked tirelessly for freedom  and democracy since the ousting of 30-year dictator, Omar Al-Bashir.  Unfortunately, the path toward civilian-led democracy was halted when  military junta leaders detained civilian leaders and took over the  government last fall. These actions undermined months of progress made  under transitional authorities and hope for a new future in Sudan.   Military leaders, like General Burhan and General Hemeti, have once  again prioritized power as well as personal and financial gain over the  will of the people. While I am glad Congress is sending an important  and unified message condemning the October 25 coup, more must be done.   That is why I am leading the Sudan Democracy Act, which passed out of  committee earlier this year. The same military junta that overthrew the  civilian-led transitional government and are undermining peace and  stability in Sudan, are also some of the same individuals implicated in  gross violations of human rights, corruption, and illicit finance  schemes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the administration to utilize all existing  sanctions authority to demand accountability for these actions while we  continue to work here in Congress to find a path forward for new,  important sanctions authority.   I stand firmly behind the people of Sudan, or anywhere else in the  world, where people are fighting for freedom and democracy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this important  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   In closing, I again thank my colleagues on the Committee on Foreign  Affairs and the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health and Human Rights  for offering this important resolution.   Last month, the Senate unanimously passed an identical resolution,  and  [[Page H5711]]  Congress is speaking clearly with one voice in support of the people of  Sudan and their tireless fight for democracy.   The United States should continue to support human rights defenders,  journalists, and civil society leaders in Sudan who are standing up for  democracy. But it is also critical that the Biden administration  rethink any foreign assistance intended for Sudan under this new  military junta leadership.   Prior appropriations bills provided over $700 million to solidify a  fledgling civilian-led transitional government. Unfortunately, that  government is no longer in power and precious taxpayer resources should  not be beholden to this unfortunate new reality in Sudan.   I again commend the people of Sudan for their steadfast support of  democracy, and I am proud that today, the United States Congress sends  a strong message of solidarity.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 720 that I am  co-leading alongside my colleague, Representative Sara Jacobs. I thank  Chairman Meeks and Ranking Member McCaul for their support, as well.   This resolution calls for a cessation of violence and condemns ISIS- affiliated terrorists in northern Mozambique. Since 2017, ISIS- affiliated extremists launched an armed insurgency in northern  Mozambique and have brutalized communities, displaced civilians, and  attacked schools, homes, and hospitals.   Last year, terrorist elements took over the town of Palma, further  causing chaos, displacement, and gruesome civilian casualties. The  largest private U.S. investment on the continent--a natural gas  project--was forced to halt work and temporarily withdraw.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly condemn these violent attacks, and I commend  the Government of Mozambique's efforts to dedicate resources to  addressing this threat and early steps to partner with the United  States and allies to build the capacity and professionalization of  security forces, bolster the justice system, and ensure governance and  services to communities in previously marginalized areas of Cabo  Delgado Province. I also commend the troop deployment by the Southern  African Development Community to stabilize the region.   We have seen this elsewhere--whether the early days of ISIS in Syria  or Boko Haram in Northeast Nigeria. Terrorist insurgency movements  cannot be left unaddressed, and early steps to address the root causes  of such movements can prevent costly interventions and massive loss of  human life later on.   The United States has key economic, security, and diplomatic  interests in urgently addressing this terrorist threat.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   This resolution condemns the terrorist attacks and ISIS insurgency in  northern Mozambique and urges the administration to prioritize efforts  to address this threat.   I am pleased that the administration selected Mozambique as a  priority country to implement a 10-year strategy for U.S. diplomatic,  development, and security engagement. This type of long-term  interagency planning is critically important to coordinating U.S.  efforts and ensuring the most effective use of resources to target the  root causes of the instability and terrorism. This issue cannot wait,  and the administration must implement the requirements of the Global  Fragility Act without further delay.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 45. I thank  Representative Zeldin for championing this important resolution.   As the world focuses on the horrors of the war crimes being committed  by Vladimir Putin's invading forces in Ukraine, we must not forget the  victims of the past war crimes still awaiting justice.   Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi were three American brothers from New  York State who are suspected of having been killed in July 1999 by  Serbian authorities. After disappearing while in the custody of Serbian  special police, they were executed, shot in the head with their hands  tied behind their backs. Their bodies were later discovered in a mass  grave at a training compound of the Serbian secret police.   Tragically, nearly 23 years later, there has still not been a full  investigation into their deaths, and the Bytyqi brothers' murderers  have yet to be brought to justice. This is unacceptable.   This case, among others, illustrates the continued need for Serbia to  resolve outstanding war crimes investigations. Holding accountable  those who committed and covered up the murder of the Bytyqi brothers is  critical to continuing bilateral relations between the United States  and Belgrade.   Therefore, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this  resolution. Congress must be on the record calling on Serbian  authorities to once and for all deliver justice for the Bytyqi brothers  and their family.   Mr. Speaker, 23 years is too long for the Bytyqi brothers and their  family to go without justice.   Seriously dealing with the past and bringing justice to all victims  of war crimes committed in the wars that followed the breakup of the  former Yugoslavia is needed to ensure reconciliation and peace  throughout the region.   Mr. Zeldin reintroduced this bipartisan resolution last year. I urge  Belgrade to commit to a proper investigation and full accountability  for these three Americans so this resolution does not have to be  reintroduced once again next Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 892, calling for the  release of Paul Rusesabagina on humanitarian grounds. I am proud to co- lead this resolution alongside Representative Castro. I thank him for  his leadership.   Paul Rusesabagina is a legal permanent resident of the United States  who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his heroic  actions during the Rwandan genocide.   In August 2020, he was extrajudicially transferred from Texas to  Kigali, Rwanda, by way of the United Arab Emirates, and subjected to an  enforced disappearance for 3 days before the Government of the Republic  of Rwanda acknowledged his detention.   He underwent trial proceedings for terrorism-related charges, and the  American Bar Association has subsequently determined that his fair  trial rights have been violated.   Pursuant to the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking  Act, the Department of State has determined that Mr. Rusesabagina was  wrongfully detained.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the Rwandan Government to urgently work with the  State Department and authorities in Europe to secure a path forward for  his release and return to the United States.   It is also critically important that the Government of Rwanda grant  access to his U.S.-based doctor to assess his health and well-being.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  resolution and efforts to bring Paul Rusesabagina home to his family.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  this resolution offered by Representative Castro and myself. I want to  recognize Paul's family, especially his wife and children, who have  tirelessly advocated for his release.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of Otto Frederick Warmbier. He is an American who was horrifically  tortured and killed by the North Korean regime 5 years ago.   Otto was a dedicated young man. He was the valedictorian of his high  school and at the University of Virginia. At the age of 22, he was  taken hostage and suffered the worst of the North Korean regime's  brutality.   Although Otto is no longer with us, his wonderful family carries on  his legacy every day with their advocacy and strength.   As one of the first Korean-American women to serve in Congress, and  as a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I will always-- always--be a loud voice for global human rights and hold violators  accountable.   We remember and honor Otto always.                            ____________________
