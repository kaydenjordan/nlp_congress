Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor tonight to discuss a  trip that was recently made to our southern border in Arizona with the  sovereign state of Mexico. Mr. Biggs headed that party up, and at this  time, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Gosar).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs) for a  question.   Mr. Speaker, in listening to the gentleman's remarks, of course I was  there and saw this rope as well, but I think the folks back home need  to be aware of this rope. We are not talking about some massive rope.  We are talking about--what?--an inch, half-inch, quarter-inch rope?    Mr. Speaker, in fact, was it not accurate that you  could actually roll back part of the barbed wire fence once you took  the rope off and you could have multiple people coming through at any  given moment?    Mr. Speaker, the reason that illegal immigrants or drug  cartels would like it that way is that they can roll that back and,  wearing their carpeted shoes which prevent tracking, they can then come  in there, put it back, and that way the border agents who are working  that area won't have any idea that somebody has actually come through  there because they can't really tell. There is a well-worn track, but  you won't know when somebody has come through.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the gentleman if that is his impression as well.    Mr. Speaker, in fact, there, they had a road as well,  which our border agents told us was very helpful. When you have a wall,  you have a road next to it to help catch those folks who are trying to  come through. But they had a device up, also, made of heavy metal and  concrete to prevent the drug traffickers from using vehicles at that  point and bringing their stuff in and just loading it onto a vehicle.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the gentleman if that isn't correct.    Mr. Speaker, continuing in this colloquy with my friend  from Arizona, I ask if he would agree that when we heard from the  border agents that the wall--this bollard fencing, wall, however you  want to describe it--is important, but things like having roads where  you can get in are also important, because we heard numerous stories.    I would like for the gentleman to maybe tell one, about how the  agents may be able to see through electronic devices that somebody has  crossed the border, but then it may take them hours to get there. I  remember several specific stories, but I just wondered if Mr. Biggs  remembered any stories like that.    Mr. Speaker, I would say that we heard this repeatedly,  and what we heard is that we need the wall to help channel this flow of  illegal immigrants. We need the wall to make sure that we have some  idea of what is going on. We need the electronic surveillance.   So this is not a one-size-fits-all kind of situation, but we need the  electronic surveillance to help when we are monitoring the wall. We  need additional folks on horseback. We need additional canine units.   We heard from one agent that we need, at the Customs department,  density equipment so they can test to see if a tire is supposed to be a  certain density. If it is twice as dense as it is supposed to be, they  know that something is being hidden in that tire, some contraband, most  likely drugs, and so this is important.                                time  1715    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs) for  additional questions. I would like to continue our colloquy. I don't  know if his colleague, also from Arizona, Mr. Gosar, would like to join  in that colloquy as well.   I would say to the gentleman, Mr. Biggs of Arizona, did he also find  it interesting that almost everybody who we talked to, and certainly  all of the border guards and all of the ranchers right on the border,  specifically said a wall would be helpful; but there were other things  that needed to be done as well?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Gosar). Would the gentleman tell me some of the stories related to  fencing or additional equipment and how those fences will channel  people; where it makes it easier to keep track of who is crossing that  border? Did he have any stories that he might like to speak of?    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I will tell that  story, because what happened is very interesting.   The Border Patrol was there and an individual did cross the fence.  Sometimes people say: Well, the people can climb over the fence. They  can, but it slows them down and allows the border agents, using cameras  and being there live on the scene, to intercept those people.   And, sure enough, there we are, standing--I think we kind of acted as  blockers. This fellow comes over the fence and drops down. The border  agents are moving fast, and there we are standing where the natural  escape route would be. While we didn't do anything heroic, and we had  to watch the border security agents do their job very professionally,  they got the gentleman into custody fairly quickly, it was because  there was a wall, agents, and a whole team of equipment working  together: the cameras, the wall, and the agents working together.   If you don't have a wall there, they are never seeing that guy; they  are never catching that guy, because he had to rise up and be seen in  order to cross the border wall/fence.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Budd).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs) for  the conclusion on this great trip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
