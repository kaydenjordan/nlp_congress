 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a small group of  artists with big dreams, the Vanguard Theater Company.   The company began in Maplewood, New Jersey, 4 years ago with one  goal: It wanted to increase diversity in theater acting, directing, and  training. The company is based on a dream of diversity, reciprocity,  education, awareness, and mentorship, with a strong emphasis on  mentorship.   Vanguard has run several programs and camps to connect young artists  with skilled performers. Recently, it received a grant from the New  Jersey State Council on the Arts. The grant will fund acting lessons  for 40 students. Then these new actors will put on shows for hospital  patients, senior citizens, and children across the area.   I am proud of the Vanguard for encouraging youth of color to pursue  their dreams in theater, and I wish them all the best.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership  on this subject. Since coming to Congress, she has been one of the  foremost advocates for education, specifically HBCUs. Prior to her  arriving, it has always been an issue that has been very important, but  she has really raised awareness and highlighted and been consistent in  her leadership in this area.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the FUTURE Act in minority- serving institutions. I thank Representative Adams once again for  anchoring tonight's discussion of this very important subject.   Minority-serving colleges and universities--not to be mistaken as  HBCUs--serve a critical role in our society. I, in New Jersey, do not  have an HBCU, but we have many minority-serving institutions, and  several in my district. These are students who find more support with  teachers and professors who come from their culture.   Studies have shown that they get better grades in classes with  teachers of the same culture and race. This starts even before the  students enter college.   Minority students in the same race classes have fewer behavioral  problems, regardless of income level or family structure. They are far  more likely to end up doing well and coming along on the collegiate  level at HBCUs. They are more likely to be held to a higher academic  standard and pushed harder to excel in these schools. They perform  better in reading, mathematics, and other core courses.   That is where MSIs become vital to their continued success. Low- income, low-performing students' upward mobility skyrockets on these  campuses.   Take Bloomfield College, for example. And let me commend its new  president, Marcheta P. Evans, for her vision for Bloomfield College.   Bloomfield is a minority-serving institution of almost 1,700 students  located in my 10th District, in Bloomfield, New Jersey. Of these  students, 70 percent are low-income or first-generation college  students; 95 percent get financial aid; and 75 percent are eligible for  Pell grants. They come from families and communities that do not have  many advantages. One Bloomfield college student was even homeless and  struggled for meals before entering college.   But the college steps in and addresses more than their academic  needs. Instead, they come out of MSIs and become engineers. They become  nurses, teachers, and professors. Bloomfield College even graduates  simulation designers for video games and medical technicians.   Like most MSIs, Bloomfield takes low-income students and turns them  into middle- to high-income graduates, and they do it at rates that far  exceed other universities. In other words, they solve several social  problems at once.   HBCUs are criticized in this country for their necessity, but the  creation of HBCUs comes out of the inability for the larger population  to accept minority students at colleges that were already in place.                                time  2015    So where do they have to go?   So it is disingenuous to criticize HBCUs for remedying a problem of  equality that still exists in this Nation. They keep today's low-income  students on a path to success. They help close the wealth gap between  Whites and non-Whites, and they provide hope and a future to a segment  of America that needs it so much.   So, in closing, Madam Speaker, we will continue to advocate for these  institutions because, although I did not go to an HBCU, so many of my  distinguished colleagues--the whip, Ms. Adams, and so many others--were  educated at HBCUs. We see their talent and their brilliance every day  on these floors of the House of Representatives.   So we need HBCUs to continue to strive and be strong and continue to  do the service that they have done for this country for decades.
