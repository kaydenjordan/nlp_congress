 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this amendment.   Our work to lower healthcare costs for working families could not be  more urgent. I am here to say that we will not fund the  administration's attempts through litigation to threaten and tear down  the critical protections of the Affordable Care Act.   Fifty-one percent of the non-elderly in my district in Minnesota have  a preexisting condition and rely on the ACA's critical protections. If  the ACA were repealed, 35,000 of my constituents would lose healthcare  coverage.   To these Minnesotans, the results would be life-threatening and  financially devastating. We cannot allow that to happen. We need to  build on the ACA, not tear it down.   That is exactly why I introduced the bipartisan State Health Care  Premium Reduction Act to lower the costs of healthcare for those in the  individual marketplace, and it is why I am proud to support this  amendment today.   I urge my colleagues to join us in fighting to preserve and build  upon healthcare for millions of Americans.
