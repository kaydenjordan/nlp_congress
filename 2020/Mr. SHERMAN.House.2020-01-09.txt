 Madam Speaker, this resolution imposes extraordinary  restrictions on this President, an extraordinary President who needs  extraordinary restrictions.   This is best exemplified by the President's gratuitous comment that  he would hit cultural sites in Iran. Not only is that a war crime, but  it is a mistake because it drives the Iranian people toward the regime  while alienating our European allies whose support for our sanctions is  critical for them to work.   The minority leader came to this floor and said Democrats were dupes  of the Islamic Republic. I will compare my record of efforts against  the Islamic Republic of Iran with those of any other Member.   You could argue whether Soleimani's death makes us safer or not over  the next few months. We have removed a terrorist mastermind from the  battlefield, but we have inspired the other terrorists.   The real issue is the effect on Iran's program. That program is more  robust today than it was a week ago, as Iran has employed more  centrifuges and is building a larger stockpile, all without our  European friends, who are still in the JCPOA taking any action against  Iran.   There was no policy process on the golf course where the President  made this decision. He heard not from a single expert on Iranian  politics, religion, or the economy.   Our maximum pressure campaign is designed to put such pressure on the  Iranian people that they choose not to endure it, but demand that the  nuclear program be scaled back or ended, or that the regime that has  that program be swept away.   This assassination undercuts that effort by building support for the  regime and its nuclear program with most of the Iranian people by  making Soleimani a martyr in front of a Shiite population, a Shiite  religion that lionizes martyrdom, we increase the likelihood of an  Iranian nuclear weapon.
