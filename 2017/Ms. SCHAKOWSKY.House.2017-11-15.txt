 Mr. Speaker, everyone knows that the Republican tax  scam gives massive tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires and  corporations, and they do it, in part, by increasing healthcare costs  for millions of Americans. Over 36 million middle class households will  see a tax hike under this bill.   Families with big medical bills will take the hardest hit. That is  because Americans will no longer be able to deduct major medical  expenses such as cancer treatment or Alzheimer's from their Federal  income taxes.   This is a middle class tax hike. Seven in ten households using the  medical expense deduction make under $75,000 a year. Repealing the  deduction would especially hurt seniors who use it for long-term care  expenses.   The bill takes a second swipe at American seniors and people with  disabilities. According to the Congressional Budget Office, by not  paying for tax cuts for the wealthy, Republicans would trigger  automatic cuts to Medicare, slashing $25 billion from Medicare in 2018  alone.   But the $25 billion cut to Medicare is just the beginning. The same  Republican budget that cleared the way for $1.5 trillion in tax cuts  for the superwealthy proposed cutting Medicare and Medicaid by, no  coincidence, $1.5 trillion.   Now, Senate Republicans want to pay for additional tax cuts by  repealing a key part of the Affordable Care Act. This change would  increase the number of uninsured Americans by 13 million and increase  premiums by 10 percent.   Middle class families, people with disabilities, and seniors  struggling to afford healthcare should not foot the bill for  billionaires to get a tax cut. I urge my colleagues to make the healthy  choice for Americans and vote against the Republican tax scam.
