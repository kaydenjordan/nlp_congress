 Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness that we say goodbye  to Damon Nelson, an Air Force veteran, a tireless public servant, and a  friend to so many.   I was fortunate enough to know Damon through my role on the Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence where he protected some of the  Nation's most classified information and navigated complicated national  security issues with absolute confidentiality and professionalism  during a highly polarizing and rocky time. Damon provided a steady hand  when our country needed it most.   I want his wife, Dana, to know that her family is bigger than she may  realize, and we all love her so very much.   Ernest Hemingway said: ``Every man's life ends the same way. It is  only the details of how he lived and how he died that distinguish one  man from another.''   Damon did much to distinguish himself in this life, and he is finally  home. We will miss him.
