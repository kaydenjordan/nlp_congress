 Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight some of  our unsung heroes of eastern North Carolina, our schoolbus drivers.   Mr. Speaker, our schoolbus drivers go above and beyond when it comes  to getting the job done, and Ms. Annie Daye, at Central Elementary  School in Jackson, North Carolina, is without exception.   A native of Northampton County, Ms. Daye has been a schoolbus driver  for nearly 50 years in the county where she grew up, making a daily  impact on the lives of her 40 young passengers.   In addition to being the first person to offer students a warm smile  and greeting in the morning, she creates a caring, safe environment  where children can feel secure and understood.   Mr. Speaker, we need to do all we can to support schoolbus drivers to  ensure every child across the First Congressional District and America  has a champion like Ms. Daye.   Let's tell a schoolbus driver thank you. I thank Ms. Daye for her  nearly 50 years.                            ____________________
