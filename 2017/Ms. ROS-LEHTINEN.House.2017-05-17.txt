 Mr. Speaker, last night I had the honor of  presenting the International Republican Institute's 2017 Freedom Award  to great freedom fighters in my native homeland of Cuba, the Ladies in  White, las Damas de Blanco, although my dear friend Berta Soler, the  leader of the Ladies in White, was not able to be there. Why? Because  the Cuban regime refused to allow her to leave the island. We were  lucky enough to have one of the organization's founding members, Blanca  Reyes Castanon, with us accepting the award on the group's behalf.   I have had the privilege of knowing both Blanca and Berta for so many  years, and it has been an honor for me to be able to raise awareness  about the brave and inspiring Ladies in White, whether I do it here  from the House floor or by hosting them here in our Nation's Capital or  in my district in Miami, Florida.   Each Sunday in Cuba, the Ladies in White fight for their relatives  and all political prisoners in Cuba, demonstrating peacefully as they  walk to church.   Yet each Sunday, Mr. Speaker, they are harassed. They are beaten.  They are arrested by the regime's thugs.   As a Cuban refugee myself, fleeing the island with my parents when I  was only 8 years old, I have seen how the regime has morphed and  evolved its methods of repression over the years.   Its treatment of the Ladies in White is emblematic of how it treats  all political dissidents, with intimidation, with harassment, with  arbitrary arrests, with short-term detentions, with denying them the  ability to travel, by trying to bully dissidents into silence.   It attempts to disguise its tactics of repression, trying to fly  under the radar so that outside eyes are fooled or placated or feel  that they can simply look the other way. But we won't, Mr. Speaker. We  won't look the other way.   Despite all of the propaganda, despite all of the misguided policy  over the past years, the reality is that the regime's repression is  only getting worse, and dissidents like the Ladies in White are bearing  the brunt of the regime's intimidation and violence.   The regime is terrified of anyone who speaks for their God-given  human rights in Cuba. It wants to project an image to the outside world  that the situation in Cuba is improving, but we must not be fooled, Mr.  Speaker. The regime will do whatever it takes to remain in power. That  is its sole desire, to remain in power. We must be clear-eyed.   We must be honest about what is really going on in Cuba. We must not  be placated by the regime's lies or by those who repeat them. We must  fight for the truth and show the Cuban people that they are not alone,  that together we all stand in solidarity with them in the pursuit of  freedom, in the pursuit of democracy and the ability to practice their  religion, to live without fear of arbitrary arrests, to live without  fear of torture, and finally one day to be able to choose their own  leaders.   And we can start by supporting the faces of Cuba's future, the  dissidents, the human rights champions, the defenders of freedom, like  the brave women of the Ladies in White. They represent the true Cuba.  They are Cuba's future. And it was my honor to present them with the  IRI's 2017 Freedom Award last night.   Congratulations to las Damas de Blanco, the Ladies in White.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman and the  ranking member for working to help bring this important bill to the  floor in a timely manner and, more importantly, for conducting the  affairs of our full committee in an even-tempered, professional manner  that is an example to the rest of the House. It is an honor to serve  under their leadership.   I also want to thank my good friend Nita Lowey because she is the  author of this bill, but I want to thank her for her leadership in  fighting anti-Semitism across the world. She has been at this fight for  many a year. We have worked closely together on defeating this hatred,  one of the world's oldest forms of discrimination. I am proud to be an  original cosponsor of her bill, and I thank the gentlewoman from New  York.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is an important initiative for our Bipartisan  Taskforce for Combating Anti-Semitism, a task force of which I am proud  to be a cofounder and a co-chair along with Mrs. Lowey, Mr. Engel, of  course Chris Smith, Ted Deutch, Kay Granger, Peter Roskam, Marc Veasey,  so many good Members. But more than that, Mr. Speaker, it is an  important initiative for the Jewish communities across Europe who have  been facing a troubling increase in anti-Semitic incidents and attacks  over the past years that have put their safety and their security at  risk.   Mr. Speaker, all across Europe, Jews have been targeted. Their places  of worship have been targeted, their homes, targeted; their businesses,  targeted. Why? Because of their faith.   They have been the target of deadly attacks in European cities,  democratic societies that we call allies: France, Belgium, Denmark,  elsewhere--horrific. This is simply unconscionable, Mr. Speaker.   There is no time to delay in taking action. We cannot allow for an  atmosphere of intolerance and hatred to once again rear its ugly head  in Europe. That is why this bill is an important first step.   We have identified growing anti-Semitism as a problem before, but  this bill will enhance reporting requirements so that we can more  acutely identify the problems and, equally important, Mr. Speaker, we  can identify the security challenges facing these Jewish communities.  Then we can learn how to best tackle this, and we can learn how we can  partner with our European allies and our friends and local law  enforcement, along with civil society, to protect against anti-Semitic  acts. We can get a better understanding of how our partners in Europe  can better educate their children. We can get a handle on how to better  promote awareness in their societies to the dangers of such blind  hatred.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to say that the first step in  fighting anti-Semitism is identifying the problem areas and then  developing a plan to address it. This bill will help us identify the  problem. It is an important first step in taking the necessary action  to protect the Jewish communities of Europe. I urge my colleagues to  support this important bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the time.   I applaud the work that both Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel  have done in helping to focus more of our foreign policy priority here  in our own Western Hemisphere.   I also applaud Congresswoman Norma Torres for authoring the measure  that we have before us today, H. Res. 145, reaffirming our dedication  to the fight against corruption in Central America. It is an important  measure, Mr. Speaker, and it is an important fight.   For years, I have been a strong advocate for this fight because,  where corruption is allowed to spread, drug trafficking and crime  inevitably thrive;  [[Page H4280]]  and this is negative for our neighbors, it is bad for us, and it is bad  for our interests. That is why it is vital that we make battling  corruption in the region more of a priority of our foreign policy.   In fact, earlier this year, I traveled to Honduras and Guatemala with  my good friend Albio Sires, and we saw firsthand how these governments  are attempting to tackle corruption in their countries. It is not easy,  Mr. Speaker. They are making progress and taking some of the tough  decisions necessary, but there is so much more to be done and so much  more that they need to do, but they need help from the United States.   That is what we heard when we hosted the attorneys general from the  Northern Triangle countries here in Washington, D.C., just last month  to discuss what they are doing to fight corruption and what assistance  they might need from us. That is why this resolution before us is so  important and so timely.   We must urge the governments of Central America to do more to battle  corruption, but we also must pledge to do more ourselves because they  cannot do it alone. Central American governments must take a stand and  voice their support for anticorruption programs. They must respect and  defend the authority of the judicial branch, and they must make it a  priority. That is not easy for them to do.    Some of these governments have shown a willingness to take these  steps, but, sadly, Mr. Speaker, not all of them have. While we urge  willing partners to take the steps necessary to fight corruption, we  must be willing to do more for those unwilling.   That is why I have reintroduced my NICA Act, which aims at tightening  the economic screws on the Ortega regime until we see some drastic  reforms, including efforts to end corruption. It is our duty to support  our neighbors so that our partners to the south can live in far more  open, free, and democratic societies.   It is also in the benefit of our security and it is in the benefit of  our national interests to do so. That is why I urge my colleagues to  support H. Res. 145. I also urge my colleagues to support my NICA Act  and to take a more engaged role in our foreign policy interests in our  own Western Hemisphere.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce again for  yielding the time.   Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of Ranking Member Eliot  Engel's Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, H.R. 1677, of which I am  proud to be an original cosponsor, and I commend him and the chairman  for all of their hard work in authoring the bill and bringing it before  us today.   During our committee's hearing on Syria in April--and we have had so  many hearings--one of our witnesses made a point that I think bears  repeating, a point that highlights the importance of the ranking  member's bill before us today. As long as Assad remains in power, there  is very little chance that we will be able to defeat ISIS or its  offshoots because Assad, in many ways, has facilitated the growth of  the very jihadist groups for which he claims are protecting Syria.  Hogwash.   As we talk about how to stop the slaughter in Syria, we must remember  that no one bears more responsibility for that slaughter than Assad. He  and his regime are the ones dropping barrel bombs. They are the ones  unleashing chemical weapons on their own people. And if we want to have  any chance of stopping the bloodbath, of defeating ISIS, or of putting  an end to the immense humanitarian challenges spreading throughout the  region and beyond, we must put a stop to Assad.   This bill ratchets up the pressure on Assad and his collaborators,  especially his main allies--Russia and Iran--while expanding on the  Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act, a bill which I  authored and which became law in 2012. It gives the administration new  tools to go after individuals and entities working with Assad in the  finance, aircraft, transportation, telecom, and energy sectors, as well  as  [[Page H4290]]  it gives them the tools to target individuals complicit in human rights  abuses.   I am glad to have worked with the ranking member and our esteemed  chairman to include my amendments in this bill, amendments that would  determine that denying or hindering access to humanitarian aid is a  serious human rights violation, and, as such, it would allow the  administration to sanction any individual responsible for doing so.   All of these tools, Mr. Speaker, are vital components of doing  something that we still desperately need in Syria: a comprehensive,  holistic strategy that looks beyond short-term tactical successes and,  instead, targets the foundation of so many of the problems rippling  through the region.   If we continue to narrowly focus on ISIS without getting at the root  of the Syrian conflict--Assad, Russia, and Iran--then we will only be  treating the symptoms instead of the disease.                                time  1730    If we are to have any hope of finding a solution in Syria, the kind  of pressure that this bill would achieve is an essential piece of that  puzzle.   I offer my full support for this bill, and I urge my colleagues to do  the same.
