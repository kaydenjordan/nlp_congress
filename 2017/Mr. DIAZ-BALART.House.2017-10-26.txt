 Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank the chairwoman  for a phenomenal job.   Look, our current fiscal environment, according to the CBO, they  project that the growth of our economy will be 2 percent or less for  the next decade.   I am reminded of what a good friend and Democratic colleague in the  Budget Committee said one day: That 3 percent growth, that is just a  dream, that is unrealistic.   Yet, before the storms hit, what did we see as far as our economic  growth of the country: 3.1 percent economic growth, something that one  of our colleagues, Democratic colleagues, said was a pipe dream.   This is, in large part, because excessive regulations have been  curtailed by both the administration and by Congress; but to keep that  momentum, we need to pass tax reform.   It will lead to a sustained strong economy. It will again lower the  tax burden to our families. It will lead to increased wages for  families, for the middle class, for individuals for the first time in  such a long time, allowing the American people to keep more of their  hard-earned money. It would make small-, mid-, and large-sized  businesses more competitive so they can create millions of additional  jobs here in the United States.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation will allow us to do real tax reform to  keep the economy growing, to get the economy going, to get the American  people working again, and this is an essential part.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone's support.
