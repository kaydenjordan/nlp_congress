 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the  objection.   Tonight, my heart is heavy as we consider the dark acts that  transpired in this Chamber today. But, Madam Speaker, the American  people can be assured that violent and irrational attacks on this body  cannot derail the constitutional responsibility that lies in front of  us.   This has always been about upholding the law. It has always been  about protecting government of, by, and for the people. Preserving the  rule of law is more important than ever.   We must acknowledge that unconstitutional acts unduly impacted the  Presidential election in Pennsylvania. Contrary to law, the supreme  court extended the deadline for mail-in ballots for 3 days beyond the  election day. Contrary to law, the secretary of the Commonwealth  discarded mail-in ballot signature verification safeguards. These  leaders took advantage of a deadly pandemic and seized the State  legislature's rightful authority.   I took an oath to uphold the law and defend the Constitution. I  pledged to protect free and fair elections. I cannot, in good faith,  certify electors that were selected under an unlawful process.   I will object to the electoral college certification to protect the  will of Pennsylvania voters, to uphold the law, to restore trust in our  electoral system, and, ultimately, to save our Constitution.   At Gettysburg, which is in my district, President Abraham Lincoln  spoke about the great task of ensuring government by, of, and for the  people shall not perish from the Earth.
