Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5949 to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 615 North Bush  Street, in Santa Ana, California, as the Judge James Perez Post Office.   Judge James Perez was born in Metcalf, Arizona, on April 27, 1926,  and was the first Latino judge appointed in Orange County.   In July 1932, his family moved to Santa Ana, California, where he  attended Santa Ana High School and worked in the tomato fields in  southern California until he was drafted into World War II. He proudly  served in the U.S. Army Air Corps from 1944 to 1946 as a technical  sergeant.   Upon returning home, he enrolled in the University of Southern  California, where he earned a bachelor's degree in accounting. In 1955,  he continued his education, earning a law degree from the University of  Southern California Gould School of Law.   In December 1966, Governor Pat Brown appointed him to be a judge of  the Orange County Municipal Court. Nine years later, Governor Jerry  Brown elevated him to the Orange County Superior Court. After serving  as a superior court judge for 11 years, he retired in 1987. In 1994, he  was asked to come back to fill in on a part-time basis.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in celebrating  the doors that Judge Perez opened for the Latino community by naming a  post office in Santa Ana, California, after him.

She was discovered at the local airport, where she worked on the  assembly line of Radioplane Company.   Ms. Monroe went on to become an iconic actress, model, and one of the  most famous and recognizable icons of the 20th century. Her big-screen  highlights include ``Some Like It Hot,'' ``The Seven Year Itch,''  ``Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,'' among many others.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7832, to designate the  facility of the U.S. Postal Service located at 396 South California  Avenue in West Covina, California, as the Esteban E. Torres Post Office  Building.   Esteban E. Torres was born in Miami, Arizona, on January 27, 1930.  His family moved to Los Angeles in 1936 where he attended the local  public schools.   From 1949 to 1953, Mr. Torres served in the U.S. Army, fought in the  Korean war, and was honorably discharged with the rank of sergeant  first class.   Mr. Torres was introduced to politics through his activism in the  local branch of the United Auto Workers union. He held various  positions, such as chief steward, UAW organizer, UAW international  representative, and the director of the Inter-American Bureau for  Caribbean and Latin American Affairs.   In 1974, he made his first bid for elective office representing  California's 30th Congressional District but lost to incumbent George  Danielson.   Mr. Torres was eventually elected to the House of Representatives in  1982, where he was a member of the Committee on Banking, Finance, and  Urban Affairs and the Committee on Small Business. In addition, Mr.  Torres chaired the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in late 1988.   During his tenure as chairman of the Banking panel's Subcommittee on  Consumer Affairs and Coinage, he pushed measures to empower customers  of financial institutions, authored the Truth in Savings Act, and  advocated for legislation that would give consumers better access to  their credit histories.   In 1998, Mr. Torres announced he would retire from the House at the  end of the 105th Congress.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in honoring the  life of public service of former Representative Torres by naming a post  office in West Covina, California, after him, and I reserve the balance  of my time.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7873, to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 400 Southern  Avenue Southeast in Washington, District of Columbia, as the ``District  of Columbia Servicemembers and Veterans Post Office.''   Our Nation's veterans enlist knowing full well that they may be  injured or killed in service to our country.   According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, there are almost  30,000 veterans living in the District of Columbia, with just over  22,000 of them being wartime veterans.   Unfortunately, these brave individuals fight for a country that does  not afford them the same right to representation enjoyed by other  Americans.   This is an oversight that must be remedied.   It is our responsibility to remember and honor their sacrifices. This  bill will ensure that their service is never forgotten.   I encourage my colleagues to join me in honoring the sacrifices of  our veterans by naming a post office in the Nation's capital after  them.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7082, to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 2200 North  George Mason Drive in Arlington, Virginia, as the ``Jesus Antonio  Collazos Post Office Building.''   Mr. Collazos was born on April 3, 1952, in Cali, Colombia. Despite  the adversity he faced, he became the first in his family to graduate  from high school.   After high school his mother and sisters decided to immigrate to the  United States, but he elected to stay in Colombia and pursue a degree  in accounting.   In 1978, Mr. Collazos decided to follow his family to Washington  D.C., in hopes of making the ``American Dream'' his reality. He worked  a job in maintenance where he suffered a horrible accident.   After his accident, he got an accounting position at the Channel Inn  and later the Sheraton Hotel. Motivated by his own struggles, he helped  countless immigrants find work and housing during this time.   He eventually grew unhappy with accounting and pursued a career at  the U.S. Postal Service, where he made countless connections with the  clients on his route.   Unfortunately, at the start of the pandemic, he was diagnosed with an  aggressive form of cancer and COVID-19. He passed away on June 26,  2020.   I encourage my colleagues to join me in honoring the sacrifices of  Mr. Collazos by naming a Post Office in Arlington, Virginia, after him.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 7082.

Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7514 to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 345 South Main  Street in Butler, Pennsylvania, as the Andrew Gomer Williams Post  Office Building.   Mr. Williams was born in Richmond, Virginia, on September 8, 1840. At  the age of 10, he went to work as a nail cutter in the local factory.   At age 21, he helped to raise three companies of men to become part  of the newly created 63rd Pennsylvania Volunteers. He was elected  captain of Company E but declined the honor and rank to initially serve  as the third sergeant.   In 1862, Mr. Williams was promoted to second lieutenant on the field  during the Second Battle of Bull Run. He fought in over a dozen battles  and was wounded four times.   During the Battle of the Wilderness, he was struck in the left temple  and was found barely alive 4 days later on the battlefield. He was then  mustered out with the rest of his regiment on August 6, 1864.   After his return home, he was unable to work due to his wounds. He  entered Duff's Business College in Pittsburgh to become a bookkeeper  and also read law at home.
