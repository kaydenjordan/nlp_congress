 Mr. President, today I wish to honor and  remember my good friend John Smith.   On Saturday, December 31, 2016, we lost one of Wyoming's best leaders  and diplomats on the Wind River Reservation. John Smith was a member of  the Northern Arapaho tribe. For 27 years, he served as the director of  the department of transportation for the Eastern Shoshone and Northern  Arapaho Tribes of the Wind River Reservation. Mr. Smith played a major  role passing transportation legislation that will save and improve  lives on the Wind River Reservation and across tribal communities.   John was a wonderful friend and a wonderful man. I admired him  greatly for his big heart, his warmth, and his larger than life  personality. John cared deeply about the lives of people who lived and  traveled through the Wind River Reservation. John's commitment to  improving his community's roads can be seen today all over the Wind  River Reservation. He was a hard worker, innovative and creative. He  was always doing more with less. His jokes and sense of humor always  made that hard work a little easier. Indian country did not have a  better advocate or finer person to represent them in Washington, DC.   Since John's work ethic and personality were so big, he naturally  lived up to his nickname ``Big John'' in every respect. As a former  football and basketball player, you could see Big John coming from  blocks away.   In 2014, John was in Washington, DC, to receive the White House  Champions of Change award from the Secretary of Transportation, Anthony  Foxx. Big John was being recognized for bringing tribal, State, and  local leaders together to complete construction of the notorious 17  Mile Road. When he received the award, Big John took off his cowboy hat  and placed it on the head of Secretary Foxx. The unforgettable smile on  Big John lit up the room with laughter. This special man left a lasting  impression on all those who had the privilege of working with him.   Last April, John testified before the Senate Committee on Indian  Affairs. He talked about dangerous roads that were costing lives in  tribal communities. His testimony led to important legislation being  passed to improve those roads. His efforts not only changed lives, it  saved them, and we are all grateful. It has been an honor and privilege  to work with Big John on highway bills. It has been a higher honor to  be his friend.   John leaves big boots to fill, and I am confident the Wind River  community will fill those boots and continue his hard work.   As we lift up our hearts and celebrate Big John's life, we also thank  him for his selfless service on behalf of the people of Wyoming. Big  John, thank you, and we will miss you.                            ____________________
