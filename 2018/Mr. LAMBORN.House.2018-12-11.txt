 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the bill (S. 3119) to allow for the taking of sea lions  on the Columbia River and its tributaries to protect endangered and  threatened species of salmon and other nonlisted fish species, and ask  for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.
