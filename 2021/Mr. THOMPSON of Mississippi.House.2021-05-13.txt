 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  Alcorn State University on their 150th anniversary.   Founded in 1871, Alcorn State University is the oldest historically  Black land-grant institution in the United States and the second-oldest  supported institution of higher learning in the State of Mississippi.   Alcorn State University is one of the most important institutions to  nurture and develop African Americans. Alcorn has laid the foundation  for many professionals by giving them a valued education. Their mission  is to intellectually develop young Americans, produce graduates to be  lifelong learners, prepare them to be well-rounded leaders of high  character, while equipping them with the necessary skills to be  successful in a global marketplace.   Alcorn's vision is to develop diverse students into globally  competitive leaders that will benefit communities, States, nations, and  the world. I know Alcorn State University will continue to provide  students with the tools they need to claim success.   As Alcorn celebrates its 150th anniversary, their reservation is  well-suited for many more successful years.                            ____________________
