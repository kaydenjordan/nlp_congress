 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 777.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Senator Tester and Senator Moran for leading  this bill through the Senate. I also thank the Disability Assistance  and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee's ranking member, Mr. Pappas, for  joining me and co-leading the House companion to S. 777.   As Chairman Bost said, this legislation is necessary to ensure that  veterans' and survivors' compensation benefits keep pace with rising  inflation.   There are veterans in my district who are struggling to make ends  meet. Without their disability compensation benefits, they may not be  able to do just that.   Finances and the ability to pay bills can be a major source of stress  and anxiety for so many veterans, survivors, and their families.  According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in just 1 year, the  consumer price index has risen 4.9 percent, with housing and gas prices  at the front of the charge. This bill is crucial to ensure that  veterans can keep pace with this widespread inflation.   Mr. Speaker, I know many of my colleagues are committed to helping  their veteran constituents, and I urge my colleagues to support this  bill.
