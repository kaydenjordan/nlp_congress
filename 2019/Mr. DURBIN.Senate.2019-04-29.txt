 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is hard to imagine that the U.S.  Congress was once guarded by a lone watchman, but when the legislative  branch of our government moved from Philadelphia to Washington, DC,  that was the case. His name was John Golding. He was charged with  protecting the U.S. Congress. A generation later, after several  incidents, President John Quincy Adams asked that a Capitol Police  Force be created. It was created with four officers working 15-hour  shifts. Today, there are over 2,000 officers and civilians who work for  the Capitol Police.   When you put it in perspective, 3 million to 5 million people from  all over America and all over the world come to this building complex  each year to personally witness the foundation--at least on the  congressional side--of our democracy. We want to make certain they are  safe.   We know we live in a dangerous world. The threats facing Congress  today are far different than at the time of John Golding. Our exposure  to risk is higher, as we learn every day and every week about horrible  shooting incidents that occur. One, of course, did occur in the Capitol  not that many years ago. We know we have the best protection possible  in this increasingly dangerous world thanks to the dedicated, talented,  and committed men and women of the Capitol Police Force.   There is an important reason why I have been able to do my job as the  Democratic whip for 14 years. It is because R.D. Moore, a member of the  Capitol Police team, has led my security detail during that period of  time. At the end of this month, R.D. is retiring after 39 years of  service to his country and more than 30 years with the U.S. Capitol  Police.   Renoard Moore joined the Capitol Police in 1988, after serving 9  years in the U.S. Army. He also served with the Dignitary Protection  Division, protecting the Senate and House leadership.   In 2005, when I joined the Senate leadership, R.D. became part of not  just my Senate family but my family. As a team leader, he has been  responsible for keeping the detail up-to-date on the logistics of every  event and making critical decisions for the safety and security of our  office team. Simply put, R.D. has been an important part of my life  every day that he has been willing to put his life on the line for me.  He has become an honorary Illinoisan in the process due to countless  trips he has made back to my home State. There is even reason to  believe we have made him a Cubs fan, but I am not going to say that  with certainty.   Even with his commitment to duty, R.D. has always found time for his  own family, putting thousands of miles on his car each year to travel  across the country to Kentucky, Michigan, and other places to visit his  mother, his siblings, and his cousins. Whether it was in Michigan,  Kentucky, or North Carolina, he found the time for family. No matter  where he was, R.D. was always willing and able to respond to a phone  call or email from his extended family.   I am going to miss R.D. personally, and our office is also going to  miss him. He is a caring, larger than life presence and one of the best  known members of the Capitol Police detail here on Capitol Hill. If  someone had a rough day, R.D. was always there with a piece of wrapped  candy and a smile. If any of us needed advice on new technology, R.D.  always seemed to be on top of it, whether it was the latest smartwatch  or smartphone or something else that I basically didn't understand. His  great sense of humor was a calming influence in the most stressful of  times that we faced. He always took his job seriously, but he never  took himself seriously.   As R.D. Moore retires this week, I want to thank him personally and  wish him well. I do it personally and on behalf of my wife, Loretta, my  entire family, and the entire Durbin Senate staff. He is a dedicated  law enforcement professional who should be remembered in the Capitol,  along with all of his colleagues on the Capitol Police who each and  every day come to work, put on their badges, and risk their lives to  keep this building and the people who come here safe. I want to  congratulate Special Agent R.D. Moore on a job well done.                          Remembering Richard Lugar    Mr. President, I want to take a moment to celebrate the life of an  exceptional American, a statesman, a gentleman, and a friend. Senator  Richard Lugar of Indiana passed away yesterday. He was a man of great  intellect and accomplishment and very little ego. He possessed an  overabundance of the best qualities of American character.   He was a problem-solver. He believed that America can and must be a  force for good in the world, and he was a visionary who had a genius  for devising thoughtful, effective solutions to complex problems before  many people even knew they existed.   When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, many people believed naively  that the threat of nuclear Armageddon that had haunted the world for  nearly 50 years was over, but Senator Lugar  [[Page S2474]]  knew better. Working with Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, then chairman of  the Senate Armed Services Committee and a Democrat, Senator Lugar  crafted a bipartisan response, the Soviet Threat Reduction Act of 1991,  to prevent the huge arsenals, once controlled by the Soviet Union, from  falling into the hands of terrorists and other murderers.   The bill created the CTR Program, the Cooperative Threat Reduction  Program, within the Department of Defense, better known as Nunn-Lugar,  and led to the deactivation of more than 7,600 nuclear warheads. Before  Nunn-Lugar, there were enough nuclear weapons and materials in the  former Soviet Republic to destroy a good portion of the world. Much of  these armaments of nuclear Armageddon were housed in ramshackle,  degraded facilities watched over by guards who hadn't been paid in  months and were sometimes drunk on duty. It was like a fire sale for  terrorists and madmen. Under Nunn-Lugar, Dick Lugar urged America to  actually pay off our old adversary to secure these nuclear stockpiles,  and America and the world were safer as a result.   Sadly, today, leaders in both the White House and the Kremlin seem to  be rushing to discard the nuclear arms agreements and rebuild nuclear  arsenals. That is absolutely the last thing in the world we should see  happening. We can only hope that the inspiration and success of Nunn- Lugar will cause them to rethink this. The state of our world is  perilous enough without reigniting a nuclear arms race.   I want to make a personal note. I am deeply and personally grateful  to Senator Richard Lugar for agreeing, in 2010, to be one of the two  Republican cosponsors of the DREAM Act. It is a bill that I introduced  many years ago to give those undocumented young people brought here as  infants and toddlers and children a path to legal status and  citizenship. It is the kind of thing that when you ask the American  people whether it is the right thing to do, they don't hesitate.  Republicans, Democrats, Independents--they believe these young people  should have a chance to go to school, make America a better place, and  not worry about their citizenship status.   It was always difficult to find Republicans to join me in this  effort, except for Dick Lugar. Dick Lugar time and again stepped up and  said: I am going to do this. America was recovering from the great  recession at that time, and anti-immigrant sentiment was already strong  and growing. It was being exploited, as we see today, almost on a daily  basis.   Standing up for these Dreamers, who were not legal in the United  States and couldn't vote in the United States, was an act of political  decency and courage--just what you might expect from Senator Dick Lugar  of Indiana. And 2 years later, after 36 years as a Senator and a  statesman, Senator Lugar lost his seat in a primary challenge to a tea  party firebrand. Analysts suggested that his support for Dreamers was  one of the reasons he was defeated.   After that election, Dick Lugar defended his support for the DREAM  Act and other decisions that may have hurt him in the primary, and he  said: ``[Those] were the right votes for our country.'' He added: ``I  stand by them without regrets.''   Dick Lugar was also a cosigner of a letter, which I sent to then- President Barack Obama. When we couldn't pass the DREAM Act, Senator  Lugar joined me in sending a letter to the President, asking if there  was anything he could do by Executive order that might give these young  people a chance--just a chance--to prove themselves and become part of  America's future. Dick Lugar and I were the two cosigners of that  letter that went to the President.   It was that letter and the thought behind it which led to the  creation of DACA, a program that 790,000 of these young people signed  up for. They paid their filing fees; they went through their criminal  background checks; they checked all the boxes; and they were given,  under the DACA Program, 2 years to go to school in the United States  and work in the United States without fear of deportation. It had to be  renewed every 2 years, but it was Dick Lugar who stuck his neck out to  help me with that letter as well. When others just wouldn't join me, he  did and did it willingly. I will never forget him, and neither should  anyone else.   Our friend Dick Lugar is gone, but he left a legacy of courage,  decency, civility, service, and statesmanship that we would all do well  to emulate and for which I am personally grateful. Dick Lugar was the  best of the U.S. Senate on a bipartisan basis. This Republican  colleague of mine was someone I came to respect time and again because  he always put country before politics.   Loretta and I got to know his wife Char. Char and he were married  when they met in college and became fast friends and built a family  around that friendship and their love--a wonderful couple, great to be  with and to spend many hours together. I extend my condolences, along  with Loretta's, to Char, Senator Lugar's beloved wife of more than 60  years; to their sons, Mark, Bob, John, David, and their families; and  to Senator Lugar's many friends.   When I think of an internationalist hailing from the Midwest who  could stand there smack-dab in the middle of this country with all of  that flatland and look in every direction and see how important the  rest of the world was to us, I think of Dick Lugar, and I think of the  contribution he made to the State of Indiana and to America and to the  U.S. Senate every day of his public service.   Most people don't know that he also had a passion for planting trees.  It was one of the things we used to talk about. He would buy farmland  and plant trees. I think it is a suitable metaphor for his life that  planting a tree is like planting a good idea. Maybe it will not come to  full growth in your lifetime, but if it is good solid stock, it is  going to be something that is a legacy for generations to come.   Senator Dick Lugar's contribution to Indiana, to America, and to the  U.S. Senate planted many trees that will benefit future generations to  come.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1230         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
