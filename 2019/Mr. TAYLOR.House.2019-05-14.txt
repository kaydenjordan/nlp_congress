 Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the McKinney  Independent School District school resource officer program that was  recently named a model agency by the National Association of School  Resource Officers.   Every day, these officers go above and beyond their job description  to educate and protect the youth of McKinney ISD. School resource  officers are a vital part of our education system. For some students,  this program provides a positive first interaction with law  enforcement.   We could not ask for better role models or protectors.   I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join me in  thanking the school resource officers of McKinney ISD as they continue  to make a positive difference in the lives of students across Collin  County.                            ____________________
