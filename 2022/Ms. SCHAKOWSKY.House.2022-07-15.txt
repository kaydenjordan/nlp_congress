 Madam Speaker, I lived the days before abortion was  safe and legal in the United States of America, and I remember the  desperation of women, some of them my friends, some of whom had to make  really dangerous decisions about how they were going to be able to  exercise control over their own bodies and make this most personal  decision on their own. Some women died because they sought these  dangerous methods on their own to end a pregnancy.  [[Page H6650]]    Let's be clear: Roe v. Wade wasn't the beginning of women having  abortions; it was the end of women dying from abortions.   Abortion is healthcare. When Roe v. Wade finally became the law of  the land, women were able finally to control their own bodies.   This bill is about freedom, and one of the most precious freedoms  that we have is the freedom to travel from State to State in the United  States of America.   What happens to the woman who is happily pregnant and who may be  going to visit her family in Illinois, where, thank God, abortion is  still legal? Are you going to check her out? Is she going to have to  prove somehow that she is not going for an abortion? How are you going  to enforce this without going into all the personal history of women  who are traveling across State lines?   Enough is enough. In the United States of America, the right to  travel is sacred. It is protected under the Commerce Clause, and we  will not go back. Women will not go back.
