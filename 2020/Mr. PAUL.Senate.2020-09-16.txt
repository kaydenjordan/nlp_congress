 Mr. President, a special little girl named Zoey is  celebrating her first birthday on September 28, 2020. In recognition of  this day, Spencer County Judge Executive John Riley is declaring it as  Zoey's Congenital Cataract Awareness Day. It is the hope of her parents  that every primary care clinician in Spencer County, the Commonwealth  of Kentucky, and beyond, is aware of this rare cause of blindness that  can be surgically treated when diagnosed early enough. As an  ophthalmologist, I have had the privilege of participating in these  surgeries and know how life-changing early intervention can be.  Fortunately for Zoey, after three surgeries, she has a very promising  prognosis. I am honored to help make Zoey's birthday wish come true by  sharing her story and thereby raising awareness for the early detection  and treatment of congenital cataracts.                            ____________________
