 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 286, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $986,292,000)''.        Page 288, line 15, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $634,600,000)''.        Page 297, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $352,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Polis) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, my amendment would simply restore the funding cuts to the  Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy account just to fund at the same  levels it was funded last year. That is $986 million. And I will tell  you where we find those funds and take it from in a minute. It takes  them from two programs: the fossil fuel energy and research account and  the nuclear weapons account.   So we should invest in our future for energy efficiency and renewable  energy rather than throwing more money at the past and into nuclear  weapons.   Fossil fuel research and development is a dead end for America, for  our economy, for the clean air that we need, and for our water.  Continuing to fund fossil fuels, whether it makes them marginally  cleaner or not, is simply throwing money at the past rather than the  future.   Regardless of how clean we make fossil fuel extraction, it is never  as clean or, more importantly, as sustainable as renewable energy, and  definitely won't be as cheap or sustainable as clean energy.   I am the proud sponsor of a bill for our country to reach 100 percent  renewable energy by 2050, but to be able to do that, we need the  investment in research and development.   Frankly, investing in nuclear weapons when we already have enough  nuclear capabilities to destroy every man, woman, and child on this  planet seven times over is simply wasteful. Nuclear weapons receive  over $10 billion, while renewable energy receives a measly $986  million.   I was talking to one of my constituents a little while ago, Nancy  Cronk from Colorado, and she agreed that we simply spend too much on  potentially having the capability of destroying the world through  nuclear weapons, rather than investing in a renewable energy future.   We don't live in Cold War times. We don't need Cold War-level  spending for facilities that the military hasn't used in over 20 years.                                time  2045    We should be following the advice, in this case, of the Department of  Defense and focusing on the renewable energy account, which helps fund  national labs like the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden.   The most recent study of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's  economic impact alone shows it totaled over $800 million nationally. In  addition, CU Boulder and NREL jointly operate the Renewable and  Sustainable Energy Institute, which is located in Colorado, which helps  advance renewable energy science, engineering, and analysis through  industry partnerships and education.   That is the future of our country, Mr. Chairman, and the future of  the world. And by undercutting our investment in our future and  throwing money at the past, and being able to kill every man, woman,  and child seven times instead of six times, we are losing the forest  through the trees, and we are making our country less secure, not more  secure.   The Building Technologies Offices, NREL, and many others receiving  funds under this account do amazing work to pull us into the 21st  century, like using 3D printing for wind blades. Not only that, their  work helps save consumers money because of energy efficiency.   In fact, an estimate shows that from 2009 to 2015, the work of the  Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy program has saved consumers more  than $543 billion and reduced carbon pollution by 2.3 billion metric  tons.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for recognizing the  importance of the Energy Efficient & Renewable Energy account. It is an  incredibly high priority for economic development. We talked about the  jobs and technology transfers that come out of that fund. We also  talked about its need for energy independence in our future.   I hope the chairman is willing to work on finding other agreeable  funding sources to hold that account harmless and plus it up.    I want to highlight a couple of other important projects funded from  the EERE account, large and small. One example is the EERE's Vehicle  Technologies Office which awarded $500,000. It doesn't sound like a  lot, but it makes an enormous difference on the ground for the Clean  City Coalition to support Project FEVER, to foster the development of  Colorado State's acceleration of plug-in electric vehicles, which are  in extremely high demand.   The Clean Cities project helped to develop a comprehensive electric  vehicle strategy, including supply readiness and implementation. The  project has already saved over 7.5 billion gallons of petroleum.   These are just some of the many projects that we should be focused on  because they are truly our future. Rather than expanding our nuclear  arsenal, rather than throwing money into the past with additional  fossil fuel research, we can move toward cleaner air, cleaner water,  more jobs, a stronger economy, and energy independence through clean,  renewable energy.   That is why I ask you to support my amendment that will increase EERE  funding and decrease funding for fossil fuel research and unnecessary  and dangerous nukes that would destroy the world more than is  reasonably needed as a deterrent.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to adopt my amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis).   The amendment was rejected.                   Amendment No. 42 Offered by Mr. McKinley    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 42  printed in House Report 115-259.   Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         On page 286, line 24, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $33,400,000)''.        On page 288 line 15, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $33,400,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman  from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley) and a Member opposed each will  control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West Virginia.   Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is simple. We are merely  restoring the Fossil Energy Research & Development program back to the  levels of 2017--merely back to the levels of 2017.   We must put it in perspective. It is still $300 million less than it  was under President Bush.   Let's also put it in perspective. As I showed earlier on the chart,  the consumption of fossil fuels make up 81 percent of all the country's  energy consumption; 81 percent fossil fuels of coal, natural gas, and  oil. But the level of research is only at 18 percent of the money that  we have currently.   Now, I just heard a minute ago someone say this is pretty balanced.  Look, I may be just an engineer, but I don't think 18 percent is the  equivalent of 81 percent. There is something wrong with that.   I am not here to argue that America shouldn't be investing in  renewables and nuclear. That wouldn't be appropriate. But the reality  is that America and the entire world will be relying on fossil energy  for years to come.   The Energy Information Administration estimated that by 2040, fossil  energy is still going to make up 78 percent of the world's consumption.  So shouldn't it be America's goal to lead the world, to have that  mantle of leadership, to develop the technologies that we can export to  other countries around the world that are going to continue to use coal  and gas and oil in the cleanest and most efficient way? Shouldn't we,  again, be that global leader on this?   But we can't do this without leadership.   Mr. Chairman, let's consider the history of this, the fossil research  from the Federal Government. Just remember the threat years ago, back  in the eighties, we had of acid rain. It was the research in our  Federal labs all across America that reduced the emissions of SOx and  NOX gases and addressing cleaned up acid rain and reduced  it.   The reduction in CO2 emissions around the globe and around  America have come as a result of fossil fuel research. On a per capita  basis today, we are now emitting--on a per capita basis, this is the  lowest level of CO2 emissions we have had in over 50 years,  thanks to fossil fuel research.   And the shale gas revolution that made America the biggest producer  of gas in the world, it originated in our Federal laboratories in  research. That is just part of where we have been.   Now go into the future. Someone said this is a fuel of the past. How  can it be when the R&D money--look what they are working on in our labs  all across America, virtually in every one of our districts across this  country. We are doing a carbon capture, utilization, and storage. We  are doing chemical looping. They are studying and understanding methane  hydrates.   You talked earlier about rare earth elements are being detected now  in coal seams all across America.   What about oxy-combustion?   All of that is coming out of current research, fresh research that we  will be able to export around the world so that other countries will be  able to burn their coal more cleanly.   So, look, Congress should not be in the way, picking winners or  losers, and it shouldn't jeopardize the work of our laboratories. If we  are serious about reducing emissions, Congress should be putting more  money into this program, not reducing it.   In an ideal world, the funding level for R&D should be much higher.  As I said, under President Bush it was $300 million more than it is  today. But I understand the fiscal constraints we have.   So let's utilize our domestic energy source, energy supply in the  most efficient and clean way possible. We do that through our research  from our Federal laboratories.   Mr. Chairman, I urge the House to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.
