 Mr. President, in the last few years, I have watched  attempt after attempt to restrict a woman's right to choose. This  legislation bans a woman's access to abortion after 20 weeks of  pregnancy, regardless of the risk to her health, and it weakens the  protections for women who are victims of rape and incest. It would also  allow for criminal prosecution of doctors and nurses who provide  healthcare to a woman in these most difficult circumstances.   For years we have seen politicians at the Federal and State levels  push to limit a woman's access to reproductive healthcare. The goal is  to completely eviscerate this right. From 2010 to 2016, States adopted  334 restrictions on women's access to comprehensive reproductive  healthcare. These include laws that require mandatory waiting periods  which have no medical basis, force doctors to give patients inaccurate  medical information, and restrict access to contraceptives.   In just 1 year, the Trump administration has attempted to restrict  women's access to birth control, attempted to defund Planned  Parenthood, supported legislation to dismantle the Affordable Care Act  and its protections for women's health, created new government offices  to undermine women's healthcare, and nominated judges who openly oppose  women's privacy rights under Roe v. Wade.   This bill is yet another attempt to harm women by criminalizing their  healthcare, even threatening the doctors who care for them with years  in prison.   Think of a pregnant woman who is planning for her family's future,  and then something goes terribly wrong. She is experiencing a  miscarriage. This happens to women every day. It is not just scary  medically, it is extremely painful and emotional. Under this bill, a  woman's health is put at risk, and her doctor could be threatened with  criminal prosecution. If a woman's miscarriage hasn't completed, her  health could rapidly deteriorate from fever and infection. If this bill  passes and a woman goes to the hospital, no doctor could help her.  Because under this legislation, there is no exception to protect a  woman's health. None.   Only if a doctor can be certain that a woman is close to death could  they legally intervene, and that I think is unconscionable.   I have heard from women in California who were thrilled to be  pregnant, only to receive the devastating news that their babies had  fatal anomalies and would not survive. Let me give you an example.  Rosalie, from Northern California, wrote to me and stated:         Our baby's heart was severely deformed. He was missing       parts of his brain, and his lungs likely would not have       supported him breathing on his own, ever.        We found all of this out at 19.5 weeks. . . . If we were a       few days late under this bill, we would have been forced to       carry our baby to term only to have him suffer for a few       minutes, days, weeks, and then die.    Families dealing with situations like Rosalie's deserve compassion  and support for this heart-wrenching situation. But instead, this  legislation leaves them with no options.   Last Congress, at a Judiciary Committee hearing, we heard from  Christy Zink, who learned late in her pregnancy that her baby was  missing the central connecting structure of the two parts of his brain.  She told us in public testimony:         At no point in this decision and the resulting medical care       would the sort of political interference under consideration       have helped me or my family.        What happened to me during pregnancy can happen to any       woman.    This bill is not only harmful to women like Rosalie and Christy, but  it is unconstitutional, and it violates Roe v. Wade. Look at the  challenges to two States that enacted 20-week bans--Arizona and Idaho.  Both were struck down at the circuit court level as unconstitutional.   Let me read that again. Two States, Arizona and Idaho, with this  legislation--it was struck down at the circuit court level as  unconstitutional. The Supreme Court refused to review Arizona's case.  Idaho didn't appeal.   It is also important to point out that this bill weakens protections  for women who have been victims of rape or incest. Rape victims would  no longer be able to access healthcare unless they could show proof  that they received medical treatment or counseling for the rape or  reported the assault to law enforcement. I find this shocking.   Think of a young girl who is a victim of sex trafficking. She is  beaten, imprisoned, and raped by multiple men each night. She gets  pregnant. This law would require this rape victim to go to law  enforcement or a government official to access medical care. These  girls don't have control over their own bodies. They have no freedom.  To deny medical care to rape and incest victims because they don't have  the right paperwork or have not reported their assault to police is  unworkable and, I believe, cruel.   It is deeply troubling that we are using valuable floor time for this  dangerous bill. The current funding bill expires in 10 days, and we  still don't have a legislative solution for Dreamers. That is what we  should be taking up right now. Instead, Republicans have chosen to  spend the Senate's time trying to turn back the clock, debating on  legislation that would drive us back to pre-Roe v. Wade.   I remember those days. I know what it was like. We knew then and we  still know today that banning abortion does not end it; it just means  that women undergo unsafe procedures, and lives are lost.   It is 2018. Women are more than half the population of this country.  We run Fortune 500 companies. We are leaders in government. We are the  heads of households. The Constitution of the United States guarantees  our right to privacy and our right to access to reproductive  healthcare. I, for one, will not see these rights stripped away.   Thank you very much.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.    Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution in  observance of National Trafficking and Modern Slavery Prevention Month,  to bring awareness to the terrible scourge of modern slavery and human  trafficking around the world.   In 2016 alone, the National Human Trafficking Hotline received 26,727  calls to report incidents of human trafficking in the United States.  From those calls, 7,793 victims were identified. These individuals were  trafficked across various sectors, economies, and geographical regions  under conditions of force, fraud, or coercion.   The United States must not turn a blind eye to this scourge. The  State Department estimates that 14,500 to 17,500 people are trafficked  into the U.S. each year. Amongst federally identified trafficking  victims in 2016, the top three countries of origin include the United  States.   Importantly, more than a quarter of the trafficking cases identified  by the National Human Trafficking Hotline involved U.S. citizen  victims. According to a recent study by Polaris, modern slavery and  trafficking operates throughout a range of U.S. industries including  our factories, our agricultural centers, as well as our hospitality and  domestic work businesses.   We must all, as Americans, raise our awareness of this pernicious  crime that often goes unnoticed and undetected in our communities.   Part of the reason it is undetected is that traffickers prey on  vulnerable populations--like those in the juvenile justice system--and  use numerous physical and psychological techniques to control their  victims behind closed doors: isolating them from the public, exploiting  language and cultural barriers, and threatening victims with violence.   These techniques are specifically designed to prevent victims from  coming forward to authorities and they are extremely effective. This is  why we must do better. We must do everything we can to raise public  awareness so that we can all recognize the warning signs.   I have been heartened that in recent years, various private entities,  such as hotels, the travel industry, and recently those in the  convenience-store industry, have all come together to commit to  training their employees to better detect human trafficking and modern  slavery.   In addition to raising awareness, January is also a month to renew  our commitment to enforce--and enact laws to help eradicate modern  slavery and trafficking.   Back in 2000, Congress enacted the Trafficking Victims Protection  Act, which marked a strong commitment to prosecute traffickers and  better aid victims. This Congress, Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley  and I authored the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2017, which  was complemented by the Cornyn-Klobuchar Abolish Human Trafficking Act  of 2017, to update our trafficking laws to better aid victims.   These bills passed the Senate in November, and the House should adopt  these measures quickly so they can be signed into law.   Finally, in introducing today's resolution, I would like to thank  Senator Grassley, Senator Cornyn, and Senator Klobuchar for  cosponsoring the resolution, and for all of their leadership in this  area.   Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the Floor.                            ____________________
