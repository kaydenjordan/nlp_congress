 Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the life of Dr.  Anthony Ortegon of Pueblo, Colorado.   Dr. Ortegon and his amazing, strong, powerful wife, Vera, realized  their American Dream early on. He will be remembered by those he loved  as a God-fearing, country-loving, family man who was defined by his  strong work ethic and love for helping others.   Dr. Ortegon was born in Bogota, Colombia, and made a courageous move  to America, determined to create a better life for himself and his  family. He finished college in 2\1/2\ years and attended the University  of Miami's medical school to begin his passion for medicine and his  patients, whom he loved. His work ethic was guided by his faith in God,  and he trusted that he could build a life for himself in America.   He served the community of Pueblo for over 40 years, providing care  to thousands of southern Coloradans through his medical practice, and  he owned several small businesses. His spirit will live on through his  strong wife, Vera; his sons, Anthony and Arthur; his four  grandchildren; and through his impact on the community as a constant  reminder of the potential of the American Dream.                            ____________________
