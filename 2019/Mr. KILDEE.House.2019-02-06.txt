 Madam Speaker, last night, the President came to the  floor here and highlighted important issues like the need to fix our  aging infrastructure and lower the cost of prescription drugs.   These are issues that I know I and many of my colleagues are ready to  work with the President on. However, the President does have some  history of saying things and then not necessarily following through.   In fact, last State of the Union, the President promised a $1.5  trillion infrastructure plan, but the next month, released an  inadequate proposal that put nearly all the burden on States and local  governments to fund those necessary repairs.   In October of 2016, then-candidate Trump promised in Michigan that  not one plant would close on his watch. But this year we saw General  Motors slash 14,000 jobs in North America, including in my district.  And while the President has promised to protect public health, we have  seen his own administration refuse to act on important drinking water  and health protections.   Throughout his calls to fix the broken immigration system, he  continues to govern by tweet, chant, and manufactured crises. The  President has to rise for the occasion. We have an agenda that is for  the people, and I look forward to working with my colleagues across the  aisle to enact it.                            ____________________
