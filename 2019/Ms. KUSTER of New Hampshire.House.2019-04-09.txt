 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call for  urgent action to reduce carbon pollution and save our planet.   We know climate change poses serious environmental and economic  threats to communities across New Hampshire and throughout the United  States. Let me give you one unusual example:   In New Hampshire and Maine, researchers have found a 70 percent  mortality rate among young moose calves between 2014 and 2016. That is  up from 15 percent just two decades ago. These deaths are caused by the  prevalence of winter ticks that are thriving with warmer winters.   Another recent study found that warming rivers could have an impact  on the health of brook trout.  [[Page H3141]]    The loss of wildlife diversity wouldn't just be a tragedy for our  environment in New Hampshire, but also for our economy that relies on  tourism. That is why I am committed to addressing climate change.   House Democrats recently introduced the Climate Action Now Act, which  would require the Trump administration to remain in the Paris climate  accord and to establish a plan on how we will meet our commitments to  reduce carbon pollution.                            ____________________
