 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the Biden  administration to launch the Great Lakes Authority as passed by  Congress last year. Don't leave our region out.   For decades, the Great Lakes watershed, the largest body of  freshwater on Earth, has endured atypical economic stress, job loss due  to disastrous trade policies, underinvestment, and major  deindustrialization.   Now, with Democratic economic recovery initiatives that passed in the  last 3 years, our region is beginning to see major reinvestment,  starting with the long-delayed Soo Locks modernization so vital to our  ports and maritime trade.   For decades and decades, the Great Lakes region lacked authorization  for a regional development instrumentality that might begin to emulate  the success of the Tennessee Valley Authority.   Now, coupling the Great Lakes authority with the Bipartisan  Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, our region stands  poised for new investment in good-paying jobs and economic opportunity  to turbocharge revitalization.   Our need is no different than the TVA, which for nearly 100 years has  uplifted that formerly neglected region. All our Great Lakes region  asks the Biden administration for is equal footing. Don't leave us out.                            ____________________
