 Mr. President, on November 11, 2001--exactly 2 months  after the September 11 attacks--President Bush spoke to the United  Nations General Assembly about the universal threat of terrorism.   I want to share just a few lines from that speech:         The suffering of September the 11th was inflicted on people       of many faiths and many nations. All of the victims,       including Muslims, were killed with equal indifference and       equal satisfaction by the terrorist leaders.        Time is passing. Yet, for the United States of America,       there will be no forgetting September the 11th. We will       remember every rescuer who died in honor. We will remember       every family that lives in grief. We will remember the fire       and ash, the last phone calls, the funerals of the children.        And the people of my country will remember those who have       plotted against us. We are learning their names. We are       coming to know their faces. There is no corner of the Earth       distant or dark enough to protect them. However long it       takes, their hour of justice will come.        Every nation has a stake in this cause. As we meet, the       terrorists are planning more murder--perhaps in my country,       or perhaps in yours. They kill because they aspire to       dominate.    Now, 21 years later, I fear that President Biden and many of my  Democratic colleagues have forgotten the lessons they learned from that  day and in the years that have followed.   What I recall most about the weeks and months following the attacks  is that everyone I talked with, no matter their politics, believed that  we were facing a battle of good versus evil.   There was a real clarity of conviction that demanded we all choose a  side. Would we stand with freedom or with the enemies of freedom? You  can dither and dally all you want on national security policy, but  there was not much dithering to be done on that point, at least not in  2001.    But now, in the mainstream media and at the highest levels of the  Democratic Party, we see that clarity of conviction ceding ground to  moral relativism. It infected this weekend's remembrance. It infected  the debate surrounding Joe Biden's disastrous withdrawal from  Afghanistan. And it has all but derailed any serious discussion about  emerging threats, not just from terrorist organizations but from  hostile regimes that the Biden administration seems determined to  appease.   During this past August work period, I had the opportunity to visit  two of the hot spots. Working with our counterparts in Taiwan and  Israel was illuminating for many reasons. I wish every single one of my  colleagues would get off their computers, get on a plane, and go talk  to them about what it is like to spend every day on the frontlines in  this battle against the new ``axis of evil.''   Here in the United States, we are blessed by the benefit of physical  distance from the hot spots. And it is no guarantee of protection, and  I believe it has lulled many of my colleagues into a false sense of  security concerning the threats we face.   Our friends in Taipei and Jerusalem don't share this benefit. They  spend their days watching missiles fly closer to their homes and  listening to authoritarian propaganda from Beijing and Iran that  threatens innocent families with extinction for the crime of simply  existing.   In Israel, they are gravely concerned about the Biden  administration's desire to enter into a new nuclear deal with Tehran.  They worry that this will move Iran closer to a nuclear warhead. They  are concerned about what would happen with the billions of dollars that  would flow into Iran's coffers. What would happen with sanctions  relief? How will they use this money?   Overall, their fears are dominated by the knowledge that, yes,  indeed, Iran is the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism. How  will they use the money to finance the work of their proxies? They are  particularly concerned how this will instigate growth and expansion of  terrorism in Palestine.   In Taiwan, they are concerned about the growing intensity of Chinese  Communist Party aggression. I have also heard grave concerns from other  island nations that if China overruns Taiwan, they could be the next to  fall.   But above all, they conveyed a strong desire to continue working with  the United States. Yes, we are their preferred partner. They need our  foreign military sales. They want to be able to defend themselves. It  means they have to increase their defense capabilities.   Taiwan and Israel aren't the only hot spots that should concern us,  but they both represent the first line of defense against the growing  influence of the new ``axis of evil.''   The one thing I heard, over and over again when I was overseas, is  that if we allow these nations to become overrun, it will start a  domino effect in the Indo-Pacific and the Middle East that will be  difficult, if not impossible, to stop.   And as we have seen before, when we give nations like China and Iran  an inch, what do they do? They take a mile.   So it is incomprehensible to me that Joe Biden and the Democrats are  not doing everything--everything--in their power to stop this from  happening.   Over the past few years, I have watched the President and his allies  treat the threat posed by the new ``axis  [[Page S4561]]  of evil'' like an academic problem, rather than what it is, a true  threat to our freedoms.   There is no excuse for this. They all have access to television and  the internet. They know exactly who is in charge in Tehran and Beijing  and what they are willing to do to expand their power.   So why have we made so little progress repatriating our supply chains  and protecting our economy from the Chinese Communist Party? Why is Joe  Biden trying to force the American people into another failed nuclear  deal with Iran? Why are they not listening to our closest allies and  partners in these regions? Why is this administration having Russia  negotiate a new Iran nuclear deal?   If this country continues to treat China and Iran like difficult  neighbors instead of a threat to our freedoms, eventually the balance  of power will shift in their favor. Nations like Taiwan and Israel will  fall. The United States could suffer another devastating attack.   Joe Biden and the Democrats have wasted time rejecting reality in  favor of appeasement. They believe that they can negotiate the upper  hand and settle things diplomatically. But this isn't diplomacy; this  is a hostage situation. If it weren't, images of missiles flying  towards civilians would have reignited the same clarity of conviction  we all felt after the towers fell and the people in charge of our  government would be shouting warnings from the rooftops rather than  negotiating away our security behind closed doors.    I would remind my Democratic colleagues that U.N. human rights  reports and strongly worded statements and all the other trappings of  your current brand of diplomacy mean nothing if you are not willing to  put lives and livelihoods on the line to defend them.   So it is time to decide: Will you stand with freedom or with the  enemies of freedom?   I want to reiterate President Bush's assessment of the terrorists who  attacked our country 21 years ago this week because it is an apt  comparison to be made. ``They kill because they aspire to dominate.''  Think about that one. ``They kill because they aspire to dominate.''   What the regimes in Tehran and Beijing are doing right now to our  friends in Israel and Taiwan looks different from what al-Qaida did to  us on 9/11, but their goals are the same. They seek global domination,  and they are growing impatient. We can either wait to see what they  will do next or we can stand with our allies and partners and  demonstrate our resolve to ensure that the new axis of evil fails.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, the attacks of September 11, 2001,  exposed the American people to a level of vulnerability we had not  encountered since the Second World War. While the terrorists failed in  their objective of breaking us, they were successful in forcing the  rest of the world to decide if they would give in to fear and remain  silent or take a stand against the violent hatred that motivated the  murders of almost 3,000 innocents.   For me, the memory of 9/11 is and always will be dominated by fear  for the safety of my own children. The hours that passed without  hearing from them were among the loneliest of my life, and indeed, that  loneliness was shared by every American who spent the next few terrible  days waiting for the phone to ring. Our sense of isolation was  compounded by a growing chorus of voices that blamed Americans for the  bloodshed in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania.   When Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II broke with centuries of tradition  and directed the band of the Coldstream Guards to play the ``Star- Spangled Banner'' outside Buckingham Palace just 2 days after the  attacks, she did much more than make a political statement. Her small  act of rebellion confirmed that the special kinship between our nations  will unite us forever under a common cause of freedom. While some chose  cowardice in the wake of the attacks, she recognized the anguish of a  friend and offered a gesture meant only to assure us that we were not,  and never would be, alone.   For more than 70 years, the Queen ruled with the same grace and  dignity she afforded the American people in our darkest hour. On behalf  of all Tennesseans, I offer my gratitude for her long life of service,  my condolences to the royal family, and my assurances to the people of  the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth that, should great need arise,  there will be no need to ask for our help, for we are already standing  beside you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Claire  Gute and Ashley Martin, interns in my office, be granted floor  privileges for the remainder of the Congress.
