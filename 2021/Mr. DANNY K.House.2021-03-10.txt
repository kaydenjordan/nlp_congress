 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, this is the day that  millions of Americans have been waiting for, and now it is here.   This is the day that we get serious about cutting child poverty in  half, about putting millions of doses in the arms of people,  vaccinations that they will get.   This is the day when individuals know that their unemployment check  is coming. They have hope because now they can pay their rent, pay the  mortgage, buy the baby milk, get the automobile repaired.   This is the day that the pastor at my church would say that the Lord  has made, let us rejoice and be glad in it. I say this is the day that  we restore the economy of America and save our Nation.
