 Mr. President, media outlets have begun reporting that  President Trump is looking into granting pardons to certain military  personnel who have been convicted of committing war crimes in both Iraq  and Afghanistan. If these reports are true, I find this to be most  troubling.   I have an article here that appeared CNN that says:         The idea of pardons of accused servicemembers who have not       yet gone to trial and been convicted that is raising the most       concern from some military law experts.    The United States' global influence is due, in large part, to its  reputation for upholding human rights and adhering to international  humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict, otherwise known as the  law of war. As Stephen Preston, a former general counsel of the  Department of Defense, wrote in the Department of Defense's Law of War  Manual:         The law of war is part of who we are . . . the laws of war       have shaped the U.S. Armed Forces as much as they have shaped       any other armed force in the world . . . The law of war is a       part of our military heritage, and obeying it is the right       thing to do . . . the self-control needed to refrain from       violations of law of war under the stresses of combat is       the same good order and discipline necessary to operate       cohesively and victoriously in battle.    Five interdependent principles serve as the foundation of the law of  war: military necessity, humanity, proportionality, distinction, and  honor. These principles are pillars of America's moral standing in the  world that allow our military to be the most lethal fighting force  against our adversaries but also the most respected and revered by  citizens of the world.   The principles of the law of war are aligned with the constitutional  values that our Founding Fathers set forth and that all generations of  U.S. military servicemembers have sworn an oath to uphold and defend  against all enemies, foreign and domestic.   Department of Defense policy states that ``each member of the armed  services has a duty to: (1) comply with the law of war in good faith;  and (2) refuse to comply with clearly illegal orders to commit  violations of the law of war.'' By virtue of their oath and training,  members of the U.S. military are accountable for their individual and  collective actions through the Uniform Code of Military Justice.   The U.S. Government is also obligated to implement and enforce the  law of war as required by our Nation's own domestic laws, policies,  regulations, orders, and by the multiple treaty obligations we have  with other countries.   U.S. military members who are investigated and convicted of violating  the law of war, through the prescribed Department of Defense  investigative and judicial procedures, have violated international and  domestic laws and have failed to uphold their oath and professional  ethics. Whether it was My Lai during Vietnam or Abu Ghraib in Iraq, we  have seen how the horrific acts committed by a small group of rogue  actors can strategically diminish America's global standing, moral  leadership, and strengthen our enemies.   We Americans combat extremism, tyranny, and hate to preserve our way  of life. Under no circumstance is adapting to the behaviors of our  worst adversaries ever justified--ever. If we willfully allow our  institutions or the individuals within them to deviate from the laws  and standards of conduct that underpin our great Nation, then we lose  our way, and the world loses its champion of righteousness and  internationally recognized norms and values.   I do not believe anyone in this Chamber disagrees with the laws and  values of this country. The matter at hand is whether we will hold  people accountable who violate those laws and fail to act on behalf of  America with honor. To me, the right answer is very clear: The United  States will not willfully commit or condone war crimes, and we must  bring those who do commit them to justice regardless of citizenship,  affiliation, or background. That is what we stand for as a nation.  Those are our values, and that is America's leadership.   Even in the fog of war--especially in the fog of war--we must  endeavor to act with the moral clarity that distinguishes the United  States of America as a shining city upon a hill.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, on this Memorial Day, I join all Americans  in recognizing the brave men and women in uniform who have made the  ultimate sacrifice while serving our country. Freedom is not free; it  costs the blood shed by America's sons and daughters, who unselfishly  served their country and laid down their lives for its protection. The  impact of their sacrifice is enduring, forever felt by the parents,  spouses, children, friends, and loved ones they left behind.   Army CPT Brian Bunting, known by all his friends as Bubba, grew up in  Potomac, MD. He was a distinguished athlete and scholar during his 6  years at the Bullis School, and chose to attend the U.S. Military  Academy. Shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks, Brian  graduated in 2002 and was commissioned as an Army officer. Brian was  known for his infectious laughter and humor and eventually married  Nicole Pascal Bunting in 2006; Nikki had known Brian since the sixth  grade. Shortly after Nicole gave birth to their infant son, Connor,  Brian would answer the call of duty when activated by the Individual  Ready Reserve to deploy to Afghanistan with the 27th Infantry Brigade  Combat Team. During his deployment, he returned home for leave and was  able to spend a short period with his wife and son, Connor. A few days  after his return to Afghanistan, Brian was killed by a roadside bomb in  Kandahar on February 24, 2009. At the age of 29, not only did Brian  leave behind his wife Nikki and infant son Connor, but he also left  behind another son, Cooper, who would be born months after Brian's  death.   I remember the sacrifice of Baltimore native SGT Damion G. Campbell.  The Forest Park High School faculty described Damion as being ``very  mild-tempered and sophisticated,'' as someone who served as a leader  and role model for younger students. Damion's mother, Donna Robinson,  described him as an ``outgoing, fun-loving and joyful person'' who was  passionate about the Army. Sergeant Campbell was a 23-year-old Army  medic serving in Afghanistan and was killed in action on August 26,  2005, when a bomb exploded near his vehicle during a patrol in the  Khayr Kot district. We remember him today for his ultimate sacrifice  and thank him for his service and passion for America.   Like Sergeant Campbell, Army SPL Toccara Green of Rosedale, MD, also  excelled at Forest Park High School, where she spent all 4 years in the  Junior ROTC program. She graduated from high school in 2000 and  attended Norfolk State University in Virginia,  [[Page S3098]]  where she studied telecommunications and broadcasting. In 2002, Toccara  joined the Army and was assigned to the 10th Mountain Division. While  she was deployed to Iraq, part of her job was operating a 50-caliber  machine gun on an Army supply truck during convoy operations, a  critical role to protect the convoy and thwart enemy attacks. She once  told her family ``her ideal situation was to go out fighting for our  country.'' Toccara had an opportunity to return home to Baltimore on  leave during her deployment. Less than a week after redeploying to  Iraq, Specialist Green was killed at the age of 23 by a roadside bomb  and became Maryland's first woman soldier killed in combat in Iraq.   Across Maryland and across the country, there are countless others  like Captain Bunting, Sergeant Campbell, Specialist Green, and their  families who have made the ultimate sacrifice throughout the history of  this country. Their sense of duty, honor, and country defined their  character and were reflective of their actions. They not only represent  the best of who we are as a nation, they are examples of who we all  should aspire to be.   Freedom isn't free. The incredible courage and actions of those who  have fallen have enabled our freedom and way of life to continue and at  such a profound price. This weekend, I will pray for the families in  Maryland, and across the United States, who have lost loved ones  defending our freedom. I will also pray for the safe return of our  brave men and women currently serving abroad. Let us never forget their  service, and may we forever honor their sacrifice.                            ____________________     Mr. President, each year during the month of May, Asian  Pacific American Heritage Month calls us to celebrate and reflect on  the rich history of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. These  communities draw from an incredibly diverse range of cultures,  languages, and religions that all come together to make the United  States a more vibrant nation. Whether as natives or as immigrants,  Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have long played a pivotal role  in the history of the United States since even before its founding.   Congress first recognized the contributions of Asian Americans and  Pacific Islanders with the introduction of a resolution in 1977 by  Representatives Frank Horton of New York and Norman Mineta of  California and, later, Senators Daniel Inouye and Spark Matsunaga, both  of Hawaii. This resolution proclaimed the first 10 days of May as Asian  Pacific American Heritage Week. It took Representative Horton's  reintroduction of a modified resolution in 1978 for Congress to pass it  and for President Jimmy Carter to sign it. Presidents would then go on  to issue annual proclamations for Asian Pacific American Heritage Week  until 1990, when Congress expanded Asian Pacific American Heritage Week  to the entire month, and President George H. W. Bush designated May  1990 as the first Asian Pacific American Heritage Month. In 1992,  congressional passage of a final resolution permanently designated the  month of May as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.   Since the beginning, the choice of the first several days and, later,  the month of May served to honor the memory of the arrival of the first  Japanese to the United States on May 7, 1843, as well as the completion  of the Transcontinental Railroad on May 10, 1869.   The Census Bureau estimates that there are more than 20 million Asian  Americans and Pacific Islanders currently residing in the United  States, and by many accounts, they represent one of the fastest growing  minority groups. Almost 7 percent of Marylanders, more than 400,000  people, identify as Asian American and Pacific Islander. Particularly  in the counties surrounding Washington DC, Maryland has increasingly  become home to communities of Chinese, Taiwanese, Korean, Filipino,  Vietnamese, and Indian Americans. Over the years, they have contributed  substantially to making Maryland a thriving State recognized for its  leadership in business, education, culture, and many other fields.  Asian Pacific Americans have been and always will be an integral part  of our community.   Archeological evidence indicates that humans first began to settle in  the Pacific Islands, including those of Hawaii, Samoa, and Guam, which  would later become part of the United States, thousands of years ago.  In what was one of the first crossings of the Pacific Ocean from Asia  to the Americas, Filipinos were aboard a Spanish galleon that landed in  California in 1587. In the 17th century, the British East India Company  brought the first South Asian Indians to the country as indentured  servants. In time, the Colonies and, later, the United States would see  continued influxes of immigrants from Asia and the Pacific, in addition  to the arrival of the first men and women coming from China, Korea, and  Japan in the 19th century. Many came as contract labor for plantations,  factories, and, famously, the California Gold Rush and the  Transcontinental Railroad. In the 20th century, immigration reforms  coincided with the Cold War and a new wave of globalization to spur an  unprecedented boom in arrivals from these countries and elsewhere in  the region. As these populations continue to grow, it is crucial to  recognize that Asian Pacific Americans have been in the United States  for centuries. Their stories are a testament to how our Nation is one  of immigrants that is made stronger, not weaker, through its diversity.   Today, many of the iconic buildings we take for granted originate in  the work of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Here in Washington  DC, many might walk beside the majestic East Building of the National  Gallery of Art without recognizing it to be the work of the famous  architect, I. M. Pei, who passed away on May 16, 2019, at the venerable  age of 102. Beginning with the Mesa Laboratory for the National Center  for Atmospheric Research in Colorado, Pei built a distinguished career  over several decades as an eager and ground-breaking artist. In  addition to these buildings, Pei would also design the John F. Kennedy  Presidential Library and Museum in Massachusetts, the Dallas City Hall,  and countless other projects here and abroad, such as the Louvre  Pyramid in Paris, France.   Throughout their history, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have  been and continue to be leaders. Indeed, one of the best demonstrations  of this is the pivotal role Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders  played in the Civil Rights era. Contemporaneous with the movements of  the 1950s and 1960s, numerous Asian American and Pacific Islander  activists and organizations advocated for the equality of all races and  social and economic justice. In 1969, it was Yuji Ichioka who first  coined the term ``Asian American'' and later taught the first course on  Asian American Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, in  addition to founding the major advocacy group, the Asian American  Political Alliance. Larry Itliong was a major figure in the American  labor movement when he helped organize agricultural workers in the  western United States to form the Agricultural Workers Organizing  Committee, which would later merge with Cesar Chavez's organization to  create the United Farm Workers.    Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have committed themselves to  serving their communities and the United States. For centuries, Asian  Americans and Pacific Islanders have participated in almost every war  the United States has fought. Although often serving in segregated  units, these men and women enthusiastically fought for what had long  been their country, serving as early as the War of 1812. In recent  years, Asian American and Pacific Islander soldiers and support  personnel have proved essential in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  Their sacrifices have been great; we should never forget them. For that  reason, the President of the United States has awarded the Medal of  Honor to numerous brave Asian American and Pacific Islander warriors.   Many also have gone on to serve as dedicated public servants. Asian  Americans and Pacific Islanders have held elected offices at the local,  State, and national levels for over a century. Leaders such as Senator  Hiram Fong and Senator Daniel Akaka made history when they became the  first Asian American and Native Hawaiian, respectively, to serve in the  U.S. Senate. I was honored to serve alongside Senator  [[Page S3099]]  Daniel Inouye, who became the highest ranking Asian-American politician  in our Nation's history when he became the President pro tempore of the  Senate. Beyond elected office, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders  constitute an indispensable portion of the civil service at all levels  of government. There, too, they have clearly demonstrated the  commitment they have to their community.   In addition to the many contributions made by individuals, Asian  Americans and Pacific Islanders have also imprinted onto our society  the marks of distinctive cultures. Though perhaps taken for granted  today, many ubiquitous aspects of American life and identity ultimately  derive from the men and women who brought pieces of their home  countries with them when they came to the United States. From  philosophy to religion and entertainment to cuisine, Asian and Pacific  Islander cultures have helped influence and form the American way of  life as we know it today.   As minorities, many Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have  endured persistent forms of systemic racism that still have yet to be  eradicated. Historically, countless individuals were denied the same  rights as other Americans and were even excluded from citizenship. Laws  barred many from working in certain fields and codified school  segregation and prohibitions on property and business ownership.  Immigration itself became a target of exclusionary policies that  prohibited immigrants of certain ethnicities from coming to the United  States. Widespread xenophobia, captured best by the ``Yellow Peril,''  dehumanized entire communities and instilled prejudice in the hearts of  many Americans. This discrimination reached a peak when President  Roosevelt ordered the incarceration of over 100,000 Japanese Americans  in internment camps as war began with the Empire of Japan in World War  II.   Although we have made much progress in recent decades, we still face  persistent issues of xenophobia, underrepresentation, and  discrimination. Opportunities such as Asian Pacific American Heritage  Month allow us to educate all Americans and spread the stories and  perspectives unique to this community. We must do all that we can to  bridge the divide by supporting policies and ideas of acceptance and  equality. There is still much work to be done, but with the effort of  all of our community acting together, I believe we can reach our goal.   Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders represent more than just a  demographic category. They are our neighbors and coworkers, our friends  and family. They are small business owners and entrepreneurs who have  helped transform our economy for the better. They are prize-winning  scientists and researchers who have made countless discoveries that  have advanced our knowledge. They are creative artists and performers  who have captured our emotions and introduced us to innovative  concepts. In short, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders represent an  essential pillar of the United States. Their story in this country  reaches back to its very founding, and it will only continue to shine  on for the entire world to see, for they are, above all, Americans.                            ____________________
