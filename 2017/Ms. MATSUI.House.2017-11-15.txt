 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1. When I was  home last weekend, my constituents shared how devastating this bill  would be for them.   A fifth grade teacher, Sarah, talked about how harmful the  elimination of the deduction to purchase classroom supplies will be for  teachers. She said:         How out of touch do you have to be to cut a tax credit for       public school teachers?    A senior citizen, Mark, spoke about how devastating the repeal of the  medical expense deduction would be for him and his wife with  Alzheimer's.   How can House Republicans justify helping corporations over families  in need?   A father, Devin, who works two jobs to support his family, spoke  about how he counts on the student loan interest deduction to plan for  his future. He said:         All I ask is that Congress keep the promise they made to       us. We planned based on the promises they made. I hope they       don't break that promise. I hope they don't make life a       little bit harder on our families.    How can Republicans defend making the lives of middle class families  like his more difficult?   To make matters worse, this bill will explode the deficit and lead to  devastating cuts to Medicare. I ask my Republican colleagues to think  about the families that will be hurt by this bill instead of  prioritizing handouts to billionaires and corporations.
