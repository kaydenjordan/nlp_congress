 Mr. Speaker, we live in a country where CEOs can make as  much as 320 times what their workers make. We live in a country where 1  percent--the top 1 percent economically controls more wealth than the  bottom 90 percent of our country. We live in a country where three  individuals own more wealth than the bottom 50 percent of our Nation.  In a democracy with a Constitution such as ours, this economic  inequality cannot stand.   The PRO Act seeks to empower workers, workers who built this country  with their blood, sweat, and tears, who work overtime and extra time  and weekends and do not take a vacation so that our economy can thrive.  The PRO Act gives workers the opportunity to unionize and organize  without being oppressed within the plantation capitalist system. I rise  to ask bipartisan support of this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support for this  legislation from the United Food and Commercial Workers International  Union.                                                            UFCW,                                      Washington, DC, March 8, 2021.                 TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS       Re UFCW Action: Vote YES on H.R. 8421 | Protecting the Right           to Organize (PRO) Act.        Dear Senator and/or Representative: On behalf of the 1.3       million members of the United Food and Commercial Workers       International Union (UFCW), I urge you to vote ``yes'' on the       Protecting the Right to Organize Act when it comes to the       House floor and oppose any motions to reconsider or weaking       amendments. UFCW members are essential frontline workers       risking their lives to keep food on our tables, grocery       shelves stocked, and our prescriptions filled during this       pandemic. By strengthening the right to organize,       collectively bargain, and keep our workplaces safe, the PRO       Act will provide a better life for our current and future       members. We will be scoring this vote.        Workers face many difficulties on the job including       hazardous working conditions, diminishing value of benefits,       and stagnating wages. The best way for workers to increase       workplace safety, wages, and benefits is to form a union--      however, the right to organize has been eroded. The PRO Act       would modernize the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to       strengthen the rights of workers to organize, place       meaningful penalties on employers who violate workers'       rights, and return power to workers to bargaining for fairer       wages, benefits, and working conditions.        The UFCW believes that restoring our middle class is       dependent on strengthening the collective strength of workers       to negotiate for better pay and benefits. Please vote ``yes''       on the PRO Act and help us build an economy that works for       all working families.            Sincerely,      Anthony M. Perrone,        International President.      Shaun Barclay,        International Secretary-Treasurer.
