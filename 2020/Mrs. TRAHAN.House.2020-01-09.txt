 Mr. Chair, I would like to commend the sponsor of this  bill, my friend from Michigan, Congresswoman Dingell. She is a true  champion of clean air and water.   Families across my district are rightfully concerned about a chemical  legacy that they and their children will bear unless we pass this bill.  Sampling of wells is ongoing in the community of Devens, as well as its  neighbor, the town of Ayer.   PFAS contamination was likely due, at least in part, to the  firefighting foam used at the Fort Devens Army base over the past  century. The town of Hudson has had to contend with its own PFAS  issues, such as in its Cranberry Bog well.   The EPA has failed in its duty of care to the American people, so I  urge my colleagues to protect public health and to pass H.R. 535, the  PFAS Action Act. Clean drinking water is something to which everyone in  this Nation is entitled.
