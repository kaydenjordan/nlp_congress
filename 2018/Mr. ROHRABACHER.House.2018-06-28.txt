 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn the brutal  persecution of the Sindhi people in Pakistan.   Throughout the Sindh Province, and especially in Karachi, millions of  Sindhi people are victimized by the Punjabi-dominated regime in  Islamabad.   This grave injustice and massive human rights crisis involves  extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, and tactics common in  many totalitarian dictatorships.   This oppression of the Sindhis is the work of the Inter-Services  Intelligence, that is the ISI, of Pakistan, and the corrupt Pakistani  Army.   More than 154 Sindhi people have been reported missing just since  August 2017. Among those includes Dr. Anwar Laghari, who is a physician  who actually led the Sindhi people and the stalwarts in opposition to  violent Islamic militarism, and that is why he was targeted by the ISI.   Pakistan has made their choice to drop its alliance with the United  States and form a new partnership with China and radical Islam, and  they are now making war on their own people.   The United States should stand with the people of Pakistan, not their  oppressive government.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn the brutal persecution of the  Sindhi people in Pakistan.

[[Page H5968]]    More than 154 Sindhi people have been reported missing just since  August 2017. Among the hundreds abducted and killed include Dr. Anwar  Laghari, a physician and human rights leader who is a hero to the  Sindhi people. Like Dr. Laghari the Sindhis are stalwarts in their  opposition to violent Islamist militants, which is why they have been  targeted by ISI.   Pakistan has made its choice to drop its alliance with the United  States and form a new partnership with China and radical Islam. Blatant  betrayals like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project and  sheltering Osama Bin Laden indicate that Pakistan has long ago morphed  away from being our friend and is now our enemy.   And, Pakistan is at war with its own people, not only the Sindhis,  but the Baluch and many of the Pashtun tribes are also targeted for  harsh human rights abuses. America needs to face reality--stand with  these persecuted peoples--and treat Pakistan like the corrupt narco- trafficking gangster regime allied with radical Islam that it is.                            ____________________
