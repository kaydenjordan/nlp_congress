 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for doing this, and I  am sorry to sort of jump people in line, but we are in a committee  markup, so I have to get back.   Mr. Speaker, I have to say that my friend, Paul Mitchell, grew up the  eldest of seven kids. Literally, a natural born leader of the pack. He  was the first of his extended family to graduate from college. He has  noted that his mom raised him to believe that those with talents and  resources were expected by God to make a difference in the world. And  by God, he did.   Tenacious and focused like a laser beam, he set and met goals. A  scrappy fighter, he has now met his most formidable foe, that is for  sure, and he is all in for that fight.   And in a text that I got from him a little bit earlier today, he  said, ``as you know, I am one tough cuss.''   Yes, Paul, you are. And you know what, everybody knows it--not only  your Republican and Democratic colleagues, but certainly the former  President, and probably all of your constituents back in Michigan as  well. You are a tough cuss.   Yesterday, my colleague, Diana DeGette, and I introduced a discussion  draft called 21st Century Cures 2.0.   Mr. Speaker, 392 of us in this Chamber, including Paul, voted for the  21st Century Cures enacted in 2016, which expedites the approval of new  drugs. This bill that we are working on now, 2.0, could well indeed  speed the approval of new drugs even faster. So it indeed could be the  very lifeline for Paul and so many like him--thousands of Americans and  around the world--that somehow are impacted by this terrible disease  that we all want to survive.   Paul's life is characterized by exceeding expectations, defying the  odds. And we know that is what he intends to do now, for sure. And if  anybody can, it is Paul. So we are with you, Paul--you may be  watching--every step of the way. All of us.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record Paul's farewell address that he  stated back in July of 2019 as part of this tribute.  Representative Paul Mitchell's (MI-10) Floor Remarks on Wednesday July                                  24, 2019         Madam Speaker, America is an amazing place and we too often       as Americans take that for granted. Opportunities exist in       this country that simply aren't available in much of the       world. And my life is an example of the many possibilities in       the United States of America.        I ask you: Where else can a kid born into poverty,       beginning life in a subsidized housing project, become a       national legislator? Yet--here I stand as a Member of       Congress.        In how many countries can the oldest of seven children with       parents that were an hourly autoworker and a Salvation Army       office manager become the first in their extended family to       graduate from college, build a career and become CEO of a       major workforce development company and, after retiring, be       elected to Congress?        America is truly a unique and special place that we must       love and respect with all our heart and soul.        My mother raised me to believe that those with talents and/      or resources were expected by God to make a difference in the       world. I have tried to do that throughout my life.        My mission for 35 years was to assist people in identifying       and securing career opportunities. My professional career       allowed me to support my family while assisting adults of all       ages and backgrounds develop skills to support their families       and build careers.        I assisted individuals ranging from laid off steel workers       and autoworkers to long term public assistance recipients       develop the skills they needed to secure a job and build a       new career.        I worked with individuals requiring literacy education or       ESL and adults that had worked in the same job for years and       suddenly found their jobs and industries had evaporated, and       their lives turned upside down.        I worked, in some way or another, with tens of thousands of       people searching for assistance in securing a job and a       career path.        I believed then, and I continue to believe, that most       Americans find value and opportunity in working--sometimes       they just need a hand and assistance to overcome adversity.        I brought that passion and commitment to Washington. I was,       and remain, committed to making a difference in the world. I       literally approached being a Member of Congress like my       earlier career--full tilt and leaving no stone unturned to       have a meaningful impact, and to make a difference on issues       where I could.        It is an honor to stand on this floor, debate issues, and       represent the people of Michigan's 10th Congressional       District. I am proud to be among the 12,500 or so Americans       that have had the privilege of serving in Congress.        But I have also begun asking myself about making a       difference for my family. My children of all ages--but the       youngest just nine years old--have accepted their dad       traveling this country extensively, working a demanding       schedule, and frequently interrupting ``family time'' with       calls, emails and text messages. My spouse Sherry has been so       supportive and more patient than probably warranted.        A career in Washington has never been my objective. My       objective has always been simply to work to address       significant challenges this nation faces: health care,       immigration, and infrastructure for example.        However, it appears to me that rhetoric overwhelms policy,       and politics consumes much of the oxygen in this city.        The time has come to make a difference for my family--to       focus my time and energy upon them--their needs and goals.        As George Washington is quoted: ``I would rather be on my       farm than emperor of the world.''        As a result--I have decided I will not seek to continue to       represent Michigan's 10th District next term. After serving       out the remainder of the 116th Congress--I will return to my       family and our small farm..    Mr. Speaker, I thank Elissa, again, for organizing this  time for many of his friends that would like to say a few words tonight  and push him forward to get to that finish line and come back.   God bless you.
