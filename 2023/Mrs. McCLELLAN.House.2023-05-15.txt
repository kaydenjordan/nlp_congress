 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my House  Republican colleagues to end their debt ceiling brinksmanship and  prioritize the needs of the American people over their party's  interests.   An unprecedented debt default would jeopardize health benefits for  over 315,000 people in my district who rely on Medicare, Medicaid, or  Veterans Affairs health insurance and raise the cost for all Americans  by raising interest rates on every loan they have.   Unfortunately, the Republican solution is no solution at all, as  their default on America act would devastate American families,  seniors, and, especially, our veterans.   This bill would immediately rescind $2 billion in funding to support  veterans, which would mean 30 million fewer outpatient visits and  81,000 jobs lost across the Veterans Health Administration. This would  exacerbate backlogs and wait times for important medical appointments,  particularly at facilities like the Richmond VA Medical Center in my  district.   Our brave veterans deserve better. These are not viable options.   I call on House Republicans to stop holding the American economy  hostage and raise the debt ceiling cleanly, just as we did three times  under the former President.                            ____________________
