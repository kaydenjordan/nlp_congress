 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  his leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of today's waters of the United  States, WOTUS, joint resolution of disapproval, and I stand in  opposition to the Biden WOTUS, which is an attack on the Clean Water  Act, an attack on States' rights to have oversight over non-navigable  waters, and an attack on private property rights.   As the chairman and former ranking member of the House Agriculture  Committee, I have spent the last 2 years traveling to more than 40  States to hear directly from producers about the challenges they face.  I was proud to be with Chairman Graves in his district, where we had a  gathering and a hearing, a listening session on this very topic-- burdensome regulations, record inflation, high input costs, the  politicization of crop protection tools, supply chain disruptions, and  now you can add an egregious government land grab to the list.   Make no mistake about it, this rule isn't about clean water. It is  about the Biden EPA's appetite for power.   America's farmers, ranchers, and landowners deserve a WOTUS  definition that is fair to agriculture and maintains the historical  reach of the Clean Water Act, neither of which is accomplished by the  Biden administration's flawed rule.   Simply recognizing longstanding agriculture exemptions that have been  too narrowly applied for decades does not make up for once again  plunging our rural communities into regulatory ambiguity.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Transportation and Infrastructure Committee  Chairman Sam Graves and Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee  Chairman   David Rouzer for leading this important effort, and I urge a  ``yes'' vote.  [[Page H1226]]         Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the outstanding management of Straub Brewery in St. Mary's,  Pennsylvania, whose vice president, Cathy Lenze, recently earned the  Patriot Award for her exceptional support of military employees.   The Patriot Award is awarded by the Employer Support of the Guard and  Reserve to recognize supervisors with outstanding commitment to support  citizen warriors through a wide range of measures, including flexible  schedules, time off prior to and after deployment, caring for families,  and granting leaves of absence, if needed.   Cathy Lenze was nominated for the award by Straub employee Sergeant  First Class Wendy Traynor.   Since 1872, Straub Brewery has had a long tradition of excellence in  brewing and operations. Now in its seventh generation of family  ownership, Straub has endured over a century and a half of changes,  including Prohibition, and remains a proud part of life and history for  western Pennsylvania.   Mr. Speaker, as the proud father of a U.S. Army soldier, I commend  Straub Brewery and its vice president, Cathy Lenze, for their example  to businesses throughout our community for their commitment to our  Nation's heroes.                            ____________________
