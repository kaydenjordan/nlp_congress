 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today marks the 40th anniversary of the  U.S. invasion of Grenada. This short and  [[Page S5158]]  largely overlooked conflict is one of the most successful military  interventions in history. In just 4 days, President Ronald Reagan  toppled an anti-American regime, rolled back communism in the  hemisphere, and saved American lives. In the years that followed, we  built a strong, genuine, and enduring partnership with the people of  Grenada.   But this success was far from certain. It was only possible because  of President Reagan's decisive and overwhelming military response to a  crisis on the island. The seeds of this crisis were sown--like many  others--during Jimmy Carter's disastrous Presidency. Under President  Carter, communism began to metastasize in Latin America, and in the  especially pivotal year of 1979, both Nicaragua and Grenada fell to  communists.   As he returned from Managua, Fidel Castro boasted, ``Now there are  three of us.'' The Cuban dictator had big plans to add more captive  nations to his anti-American axis in the hemisphere.   Grenada is a small island located in the southeast Caribbean and  strategically vital to both Cuba and Soviet Russia during the Cold War.  Barely 150 miles off the coast of Venezuela, the island could serve as  an offshore arms depot for communist rebels in Latin America and other  Caribbean nations. Russia could also use Grenada as a base to launch  submarines into the Caribbean Basin.   Most concerning was Grenada's proximity to Africa, which made it the  potential final link in a chain of communist air bases from Southern  Russia to North Africa, to West Africa, to Grenada, and then finally to  Cuba. Soviet bombers and heavy-cargo planes could fly between these  lily pads of bases for refueling and largely beyond American detection.   This grave threat materialized when Grenada welcomed hundreds of  Cubans to construct a massive airport with a 9,000-foot runway. What  Ronald Reagan called a ``suspiciously huge'' runway was far larger than  anything Grenada's commercial aviation required. It was, curiously  enough, just big enough to support the largest Soviet bombers and cargo  aircraft.   This airbase posed a two-way threat. Russia could use Grenada as a  launching pad in the hemisphere to arm Cuba and other Latin American  communists. Going the other way, Castro could export revolutionaries to  the bloody war in Angola and elsewhere in Africa.   Tensions boiled over into crisis in October 1983 when an even more  radical, bloodthirsty gang of communists toppled the ruling communists  in Grenada. The new government killed the former Prime Minister and  instituted a 24-hour shoot-on-sight curfew that threatened hundreds of  American medical students on the island. The Reagan administration  feared a replay of the Iranian hostage crisis, and the Organisation of  Eastern Caribbean States pleaded with the administration to intervene  and prevent communism from spreading further in the region.   Within days, Reagan had concluded that we had ``no choice but to act  strongly and decisively,'' as he put it, and he authorized an invasion.  This wasn't an easy decision. We had only spotty intelligence on  Grenada's forces and capabilities and the presence of Cuban or other  communist forces, we had little time to execute the mission, and many  in Washington still hesitated to use military force due to Vietnam  syndrome. But Reagan was undaunted.   Then a disaster halfway around the world threatened to derail the  operation. Just after Reagan authorized the invasion planning, a  suicide bomber killed 241 marines in their Beirut barracks. Although  heartbroken and enraged by the attack, Reagan didn't let the crisis in  Lebanon crowd out the crisis in our backyard. He declared:         There are Americans there and they are in danger. We are       going.    This is an important point. Contrary to liberal smears, Reagan did  not authorize the Grenada invasion as cover for his withdrawal from  Lebanon or to flex his muscles after the Beirut bombing. He authorized  the invasion planning before the bombing happened in Beirut. The  historical record on this is absolutely clear. Unlike Democratic  Presidents, Reagan didn't act tough to conceal his true weakness;  Reagan was tough on America's enemies and tough in defense of America's  interests.   On October 25, barely a week after the coup, around 8,000 American  troops embarked on Operation Urgent Fury. They had a clearly defined  mission: save the endangered Americans, depose the communist regime,  and reestablish order on the island. Our troops had some setbacks, but  they adapted, overcame, and prevailed.    The incomplete intelligence and short timeframe for preparation  hampered the operation yet vindicated Reagan's judgment. Military  leaders anticipated only 200 Cuban construction workers on the island.  In reality, 700 well-armed Cuban soldiers awaited American forces. Our  troops also discovered huge weapons caches at the airbase, enough to  arm the Cuban forces and thousands more communist rebels. Reagan had  acted just in time.   The war ended after 4 lopsided days. Our troops took fewer than 150  casualties, while the communists suffered nearly 500 casualties, and  more than 600 Cubans surrendered. Our citizens on the island were safe.  Reagan hit hard, he hit fast, and America won.   Fidel Castro's dreams of hemispheric revolution soon turned to ash.  Reagan destroyed communism in Grenada and besieged the communist regime  in Nicaragua. A year after Reagan left office, Nicaragua ousted Daniel  Ortega in a democratic election, made possible by American pressure.   The Grenada operation was the first successful military rollback of  communism during the Cold War. We had eliminated a deadly threat on our  doorstep, and we had liberated a grateful people, who enjoy freedom and  democracy to this day.   Reagan worked to stabilize the island and later traveled there in  1986. Tens of thousands of Grenadians lined the streets and welcomed  Reagan as a liberator. Grenada's Prime Minister described Reagan as  ``our own national hero'' and ``our rescuer after God.'' Reagan passed  banner after banner that read ``God Bless America'' and later wrote  that ``I probably never felt better during my presidency than I did  that day.''   What Reagan felt that day was the joy of American success, made  possible by American strength and confidence. This success stands in  stark contrast to other interventions, like the one we saw in Somalia  10 years later under Bill Clinton.   I spoke here 3 weeks ago to mark the 30th anniversary of the Battle  of Mogadishu. While Reagan delivered a crushing and decisive blow  against a regime that threatened American interests, Bill Clinton used  insufficient forces for an ill-defined, expansive mission in a nation  where our interests weren't at stake. He then cut and ran after the  first sign of resistance, emboldening our enemies, including Osama bin  Laden.   No two interventions were more different in rationale, execution, or  result, and they offer important lessons for today.   The most profound is that weak interventions with vague and self- righteous missions usually fail. Strong military action with well- defined missions focused on America's interests usually succeed.   We must never confuse the U.S. Army for the Salvation Army. Our  military is not a charitable organization, and it is not a tool of  mankind. It is the most fundamental instrument of our national power  and ours alone, and it should be used to pursue American interests and  American interests alone. It is not the military's responsibility to  right every wrong in the world or to be an avenging angel of liberal  democracy.   One of America's great statesmen, John Quincy Adams, once wrote that  America is ``the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all.  She is the champion and vindicator only of her own.'' Indeed, he  famously observed that America ``goes not abroad, in search of monsters  to destroy.''   I have to observe, though, that Adams wrote that we do not ``search''  for monsters to destroy, but the architect of the Monroe Doctrine and  chief defender of Andrew Jackson's conquest of Spanish Florida was no  pacifist. When monsters rear their heads and challenge America,  especially in her own hemisphere, America must indeed not hesitate to  destroy those monsters. From Tripoli to Berlin, to Tokyo, to St.  George's, we have done it before, and we must be prepared to do it  again.  [[Page S5159]]    When we must go abroad to destroy monsters, we must use overwhelming  force. If Washington is unwilling to use the force necessary to win, we  ought not use force at all. It is unfair and cruel to both American  troops pursuing the mission and to our friends in the nation where the  mission is being conducted.   As we look for examples to follow in this new moment of international  crisis and chaos, we should look to Reagan, not to Clinton. We need  more Grenadas and no more Somalias.   On this 40th anniversary of the invasion of Grenada, I would also  like to recognize and thank the veterans of that conflict, along with  their families, for their invaluable service. They made our country  proud and helped bring communism to its knees in this hemisphere. God  bless them all, and God bless the United States of America.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
