 Mr. President and my colleagues, I applaud the comments of  my colleague from Georgia deeply.   My first job after school was in Macon, GA, working for a Federal  judge, Lanier Anderson. I learned a lot about integrity and a lot about  law from him. I also learned some sad lessons, that in the history of  Georgia--and, indeed, Virginia and many States--so many people,  especially people of color, had been disenfranchised over the course of  our history. Our late friend, John Lewis, a Congressman from Georgia,  was savagely beaten on Bloody Sunday just for marching for voting  rights. That act of violence inspired this body, the U.S. Senate, to  come together in March of 1965 and work to pass, in a bipartisan  fashion, the Voting Rights Act.   We should be coming together today--after acts of violence--as a U.S.  Senate, to affirm the votes of all who cast ballots in November.  Instead, we are contemplating an unprecedented objection that would be  a massive disenfranchisement of American voters.   The Georgia result was very clear: a 12,000-vote margin, 2  certifications by Republican officials, 4 separate recounts and  canvases, 7 lawsuits, as in the other States. If we object to results  like this, the message is so clear. We are saying to States: No matter  how secure and accurate your elections are, we will gladly overthrow  them if we don't like who you voted for. But, more importantly, what we  will be saying--really, what we will be doing--is as the body that  acted together to guarantee Americans the right to vote, we will become  the agent of one of the most massive disenfranchisements in the history  of this country.   So I urge all of my colleagues: Please oppose these objections.   Thank you.   I yield to my colleague from New Jersey.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from New Jersey.
