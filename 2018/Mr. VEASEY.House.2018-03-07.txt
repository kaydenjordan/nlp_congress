 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Trini Garza  High School for earning the designation of National Title I  Distinguished School for the 2016-2017 school year.   This exclusive designation is given to high-poverty schools that  excel in either student performance or for its work to close the  achievement gap. Garza, with a student body that is 86 percent  economically disadvantaged, was one of 34 schools across the Nation to  be praised ``for its exceptional student performance for two or more  consecutive years.''   Garza's designation would not be possible without the strong  partnerships of its educators, parents, students, and the Oak Cliff  community in Dallas. Each of you have made sure that we are doing our  part to empower our future leaders with the tools they need to succeed.   Congratulations, Trini Garza High School, for your well-deserved  recognition.                            ____________________
