 Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, before we can conclude our debate, I  wanted to thank Chairman Calvert and Ranking Betty McCollum of the  Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee for their  work; and also the Financial Services and General Government  Subcommittee Chairman  Tom Graves and Ranking Member  Mike Quigley for  the great job they did; and for the men and women behind them that make  up the professional and personal staff of the Appropriations Committee.   As of today, all 12 appropriations bills have been released. With the  passage of this legislation, the full House will have halfway done all  of our bills on the floor.   Mr. Chairman, we continue our momentum by passing H.R. 6147. I guess  that will be tomorrow, and I urge support of the bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
