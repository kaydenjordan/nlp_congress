 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to condemn the extreme  Republicans' action to hold our economy hostage and their refusal to  pass a clean bill to raise the debt.   Today, we are 7 days from defaulting on our Nation's debt, 7 days  from seniors losing their Social Security checks, 7 days from our  veterans losing their healthcare benefits, 7 days from our country  losing all financial credibility.   Not only are the Republicans determined to cut billions from vital  programs, they are also now telling Members to go home for the weekend.  Hard to believe.   We came to Congress to work on issues important to our States and our  country. American families are depending on us to pay our bills on  time, just like they do every single month. But as our Nation is on the  brink of an economic tailspin, Republicans are headed to the airport.   Well, America is running out of runway to avoid a default. It is time  we acted like it.                            ____________________
