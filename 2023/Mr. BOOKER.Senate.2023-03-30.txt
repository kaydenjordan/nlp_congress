 Reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, I am here on behalf of Senator Sanders,  who was pulled away from the floor on an important matter, and he asked  me to object on this matter. He gave me some documentation and some  points. I don't want to burden the Senate with reading everything I was  given, but I would like to ask unanimous consent to enter into the  Record the objection on behalf of Senator Sanders, if there is no  objection to that, sir.   And I will say, I really feel so blessed to be a Senator, and one of  the great blessings for me has been getting to know my colleagues. I  know folks on both sides of the aisle and have sincere friendships and  admiration.   Senator Lee is one of the people I respect in this body the most. He  is learned. I have learned from him. My positions on issues have  evolved by taking time to actually listen to my colleague from Utah  speak.   I see both colleagues from Utah are here. I need to get Menendez down  to this floor and get some firepower here.   But I have also learned a lot about Utah itself, and when he talks  about the reasons for getting rid of this, they are very compelling to  me. The reality is, tourism is one of our greatest industries. It  creates jobs and opportunities.   When he talks about sports teams--I am not sure if it is because he  is a sports fan--I think he understands that sports teams help promote  economic growth and economic opportunity. And even more than that, what  I have learned from my colleague and my friend is that Utah is a very  special place.   I remember the Senator from Utah told me that I think one of the  cities in Utah is one of the places in America that most foreign  languages are spoken and mastered in all of our country, and I imagine  because of the extensive foreign travel, there are real connections.   And he said something that resonated with my spirit, which is this  idea that it is affecting families; that we might have blended  families. Americans do often marry people from outside of our country.   All of those reasons I feel are very compelling. When I read Senator  Sanders' remarks here, though, I found them compelling as well. And one  of the things I found most compelling--I don't know about the Senator  from Utah, but I actually have a science degree, a political science  degree, so I tend to rely on health professionals.   And then Senator Sanders' remarks, all of which I will put in the  Record, talk to the point about the fact that people are still dying in  the United States from COVID, but they also point out that COVID didn't  originate here.   We know it came from another country. We know that a zoonotic disease  spread from wet markets in other countries into human beings. It then  traveled to our Nation, most likely, and spread to us. We know that  variants are still happening. Many of them can come from outside of our  country, and there are many health professionals who believe that doing  the right thing, ensuring people are vaccinated, may help us to stop a  future variant.   Now, again, there are reasonable objections on the other side on  this, and my hope is that perhaps we as a body can come together and  find a just way forward.   We are, indeed, a body where a lot more happens in a bipartisan way  than I think most of the public understands.   And I know from my experience of 9 years in the Senate that a lot of  the bipartisan legislation I respect most, Senator Lee, especially on  our Judiciary Committee, has been involved in those.   So I, on behalf of Senator Sanders, am objecting because of his  reasons, but I do hope to continue my personal conversations with  Senator Lee on that.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         H.R. 185 would terminate the current requirement from the       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for proof of       COVID-19 vaccination for foreign travelers entering the U.S.       The requirement was first imposed in October 2021, and       renewed in April 2022 and specifically requires that incoming       travelers are ``fully vaccinated'' against COVID, which means       they've received the primary series of the COVID vaccine.                    Vote Recommendation: Oppose H.R. 185         1. Senator Lee's bill proposes to overturn the current       COVID-19 vaccination requirements for foreign travelers       entering the United States by air.        2. COVID vaccines are one of the most important tools we       have to protect against the pandemic.        3. While I know many people want the COVID pandemic to be       over--Americans are still getting sick and dying from this       illness every day.        4. This bill not only undermines the recommendations from       our public health officials--it further harms public       confidence in our public health system.        5. It is irresponsible to take away tools from the       Administration that they might need in the future to protect       against COVID.        6. I object.    So, officially, I object.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays, or whatever  means yes and no.
