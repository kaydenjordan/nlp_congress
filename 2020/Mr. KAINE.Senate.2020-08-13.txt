 Mr. President, here we go again. Another day has passed.  Nothing has happened--no incremental progress, no compromise. To some  it might just be one day, but for too many Americans, another day  fighting for your health or how you will pay your rent or how you will  feed your kids is a brutal and terrifying thing.   What is one more day to an average American? It might be a day closer  to the rent being due without having money to pay it. It might be  another day with insufficient unemployment benefits while bills pile  up. It might be another day closer to possibly needing SNAP assistance  or help from a food bank.   One more day could mean constrained testing supplies don't pick up as  many cases of COVID-19, so the carriers can isolate and protect others.  One day today means for one of my staffers--it was move-in day for his  oldest daughter at college, but because she couldn't get her test  result back quickly enough, that experience, which is an exciting one  for a young person, could not happen.   These are not simple legislative days while we follow a negotiation  strategy. These are days when Americans are struggling and suffering,  and we are not responding.   Democrats are here. We are ready to compromise any day. In fact, we  have already offered to meet the White House halfway on the size of the  relief effort. Our meet-in-the-middle offer was rebuffed Friday, and it  was rejected by the White House again yesterday.   I have heard the majority leader today and on other days characterize  the Heroes Act in his remarks as a Democratic wish list. So what I  would like to do is walk through the Democratic and Republican  proposals side by side. At every step I hope listeners will ask  themselves: Which of these agendas is oriented to helping Americans  through hard times?   The Democratic proposal includes this: continuing expanded  unemployment benefits for the duration of this  [[Page S5405]]  crisis; cash assistance for struggling families to avoid eviction and  foreclosure rather than just delaying bills and piling up debt;  sufficient funding and flexibility for State and local governments so  that we don't have a second wave of job loss when those governments are  forced to cut their budgets, and so they don't have to cut vital  programs and lay off first responders during a global health pandemic;  sufficient childcare funding both to help working families and to allow  childcare providers to reopen so that we can get back to work;  providing K-12 schools with the funding they need regardless of how  they choose to reopen so that they can effectively educate students;  ensuring every American can have access to free treatment for  coronavirus; helping families keep food on the table by giving an  increase in the SNAP benefit plus additional funding for nutrition  programs; continuing support for America's small businesses; protection  for the integrity of our elections during a period of uncertainty and  fear. Those are the proposals that are contained in the Heroes Act.   The Republican proposals, combining both the HEALS Act--the Senate  GOP proposal--and President Trump's Executive orders, include this:  $1.75 billion to keep the FBI headquarters in DC so as to prevent  potential hotel competition for the Trump International Hotel; expanded  corporate tax writeoffs for business lunches--another top priority for  the White House; sharp cuts to unemployment benefits for workers who  are suffering and out of work; broad immunity for large corporations  even if they are not taking any actions to protect their workers; the  effective elimination of State rules, including a rule in Virginia  designed to facilitate the safe reopening of businesses and the  economy; undermining important protections and enforcement of  longstanding civil rights and disability laws; punishing public schools  that choose to follow public health guidance but still want to provide  their students with an education by reopening virtually; pushing a tax  credit program that would make donations to private school scholarships  already deductible as charitable contributions--that would make those  now preferred over any other charitable contribution, likely draining  money away from other charities and hurting government funding, as  well; and finally, stopping payroll tax contributions into the Social  Security trust fund, creating huge uncertainty for employers and  employees but also threatening to undermine the fiscal future of Social  Security retirement benefits.    These are elements of the Republican HEALS Act and President Trump's  Executive orders.   Equally important is what is not in any of the Republican proposals-- either that offered in the Senate or implemented by the President's  Executive orders. Food aid for hungry kids and families? Nothing.  Rental assistance? Nothing. Mortgage assistance? Nothing. Aid to the  States and localities where Americans live and work? Nothing. Funding  to ensure the integrity of the upcoming elections? Nothing.   So I would ask anyone, which of these proposals seems more likely to  help Americans who are experiencing hard times? If anyone is in doubt-- and I don't think any are--about what kinds of hard times people are  in, yesterday I shared some stories from Virginians who have shared  them with me, just as they are sharing them with all Senators. Here are  a few more of the constituents who have reached out to me.   The owner of a small business with 18 employees in Northern Virginia  wrote me: ``My business is struggling, my employees are suffering, and  we need further assistance.'' He went on to describe how his business  was completely shut down in the crisis. Even now that they are open,  they will be operating at less than half their normal revenue for the  foreseeable future. Their PPP and EIDL loan funds--they were glad to  get them--have run out, and they need Congress to act to prevent the  business from shuttering and those 18 jobs from disappearing  permanently.   A woman from Henrico County, which is right outside of Richmond,  wrote:         As I watch the news, it gets harder and harder. We       desperately need help. . . . My son had COVID, he is still       struggling with health issues and cannot work.    A woman in Springfield, here in Fairfax County, has been waiting for  information that she needs mailed to her so she can get access to  unemployment benefits, but the delays in the Postal Service have left  her without the benefits she earned and is entitled to. She is a single  mother of five and said: ``At this point, I am struggling to feed my  family.''   A woman from Dumfries in Prince William County said:         I'm asking for help with the aid for the unemployed workers       like myself that Covid has affected. We are a family of 4 and       I have lost my unemployment that we depended on for       groceries. My husband's salary covers the bills but I worked       for groceries and any extras. As of now I may be able to get       $190 a week from the state if they reevaluate my claim.       Please, I'm asking for bipartisan support on an unemployment       package that will help families like mine to make it through       this pandemic.    Finally, a woman from Alexandria--just across the Potomac--wrote:         I would like to request consideration for more emergency       funding for daycare and preschool facilities. My 14 month old       little girl attends daycare 5 days per week. Her daycare is       wonderful, but it's at risk of closing in the very near       future because it only has 1/3 of the minimum number of       enrollees that it needs to be able to afford to stay open.       I'm an essential worker in healthcare, specifically in       pediatric care, and my husband is an essential Department of       Defense employee. If I have to stay home with my daughter, I       can't take care of the children of others, and I'm honestly       very worried about the prospects of eventually finding a new       job, as healthcare facilities are also suffering a large       reduction of daily patients. I ask this from the bottom of my       heart. Please provide funding for our daycare and preschool       facilities, so they can be here for us through and after the       pandemic, so parents in Virginia will be able to continue       work now or return to work when it is safe to do so.    It is not about politics. It is not about credit. It is about coming  through for Americans when they need it. It is the case that,  yesterday, Democratic leaders reached out again to the White House and  repeated what they had offered last Friday. Let's meet in the middle.  Let's meet halfway between the Republican proposals laid out in the  HEALS Act and the President's Executive orders and the Democratic  proposal passed by a sizeable majority in the House nearly 3 months  ago.   That is what Americans want--negotiate, compromise, meet in the  middle, and find common ground, just as we did in the CARES Act. The  White House response was, no dice. They refused the Democratic proposal  to meet halfway. They said that is not going to happen.   We need to get serious. Days continue to tick by as families face  hard decisions. Democrats are here, and we are ready. The White House  must stop its ``no compromise'' position to meet the needs of American  families. Let's buckle down, make a deal, and get this done. The  American people can't afford to wait any longer.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
