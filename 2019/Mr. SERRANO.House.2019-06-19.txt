 Mr. Chair, as the chairman of the Commerce, Justice,  Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, I would like to talk about  the fiscal year 2020 Commerce, Justice, Science bill, which is  contained in division A of the minibus.   The budget proposed by the Trump administration for the agencies in  this bill was totally inadequate. The President proposed eliminating a  large number of programs that Members on both sides of the aisle  strongly support.   Thankfully, with an allocation of $73.895 billion, this subcommittee  was able to address these problems and to invest in the future of our  Nation.   This legislation makes significant investments in justice reform,  economic development, and the science agencies. We increased funding  for programs and research focused on climate change, as well as for  efforts to address gun violence and to implement the 2020 Census.   Let me highlight a few issues.   In order to address the ongoing challenges faced by the Census Bureau  leading up to next year's decennial Census, this bill provides $8.45  billion for the Census Bureau, of which more than 90 percent directly  funds the 2020 Census. This amount is $2.3 billion above the  administration's very inadequate request.   In addition, this legislation carries language that prevents funding  from being used to include a citizenship question on the 2020 Census  form.   This bill also rejects the administration's proposed cuts to climate  change programs. We provide over $2 billion for NASA Earth Science, a  significant increase over fiscal year 2019, as well as a 17 percent  increase for NOAA climate research activities. Significant increases  are also included for NOAA programs that address the impacts of climate  change.   To address the epidemic of gun violence in our Nation, this bill  increases funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and  Explosives by $122 million over fiscal year 2019. We also provide $80  million for grants to help improve firearms background checks and $125  million for school safety grants authorized by the STOP School Violence  Act.   To ensure our Nation's science agencies have the resources needed to  continue our leadership in research and innovation, this bill adds  substantial funding to NASA, the National Science Foundation, and NIST.   The bill also includes strong funding increases for economic  development activities and infrastructure improvements in hard-hit  rural and urban areas--in particular, for the Economic Development  Administration and the Minority Business Development Agency.   We also provide large increases for the Legal Services Corporation,  the Violence Against Women Act, opioid reduction initiatives, and the  First Step Act, among many others.   In sum, there is a lot in this bill that both sides support, from  science to economic development to justice reform.   I thank the staff on both sides of the aisle who have worked so hard  to put this bill together and to manage the amendments offered on the  majority staff. I thank our clerk, Bob Bonner, as well as Jeff Ashford,  B.G. Wright, Matt Smith, Shannon McCully, T.J. Lowdermilk, and Trisha  Castaneda. And on the minority side, I thank Stephanie Gadbois and  Kristin Richmond. I also thank, on my personal staff, Marcus Garza,  Angel Nigaglioni, and Matt Alpert.   I want to take a moment to say that, as you will hear, we don't  always agree, Mr. Aderholt and I, but it has been a pleasure working  with him in the tradition of the Appropriations Committee, which tries  to find common ground.   I know that even if he tells you that he doesn't like the bill, there  is a lot in here that he likes. So I am looking for maybe a ``maybe''  vote from him.   I also thank Chairwoman Lowey and Ms. Granger. It has been said  before, but it hasn't been said by me, that we make history every day  in this House, and what a historic moment it is that the ranking member  and chairwoman are both women. That is the first time in history.   I think this is a good bill that envisions the people and priorities  of this Nation, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, my primary objection with the gentleman's  amendment is with the offset. The National Telecommunications and  Information Administration, or NTIA, is not very well known by the  American people, but it is quite important.   The NTIA is critical to the deployment of 5G wireless network  technology around the country, which is an expressed goal of the  majority of Members on both sides of the aisle, as well as the White  House.   Additionally, NTIA is working to expand FirstNet, which ensures cell  phone connectivity for our first responders in disaster scenarios.   This amendment would cut NTIA's budget by 8 percent. For all these  important programs to continue, NTIA's role as the policy leader in the  area of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and data privacy, I  cannot support a big cut to this budget.   Madam Chair, I oppose the amendment and I urge my colleagues to do  the same.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                    Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Scalise     Madam Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 445, I offer  amendments en bloc, which are at the desk.    Madam Chair, the amendments included in the en bloc were  made in order by the rule. I support the amendment and urge its  adoption.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I urge adoption of the amendments en bloc.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 445, I offer  amendments en bloc, which are at the desk.    Madam Chair, the amendments included in the en bloc were  made in order by the rule and have been agreed to by both sides. I  support the amendments and urge its adoption.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gonzalez).    Madam Chair, I support the amendment and urge its  adoption. I hope everyone votes for it, and I yield back the balance of  my time    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, the inclusion of the citizenship question  was a unilateral decision by Secretary Ross last year. Secretary Ross  chose to overrule recommendations from nonpartisan experts at the  Census Bureau and ignore the potential impacts, including those the  question would have on response rates to the Census, without rigorous  testing and analysis.   Even more recently, additional evidence on the other side's attempts  to abuse the Census in an effort to gerrymander districts has come to  light. Files recently discovered from a Republican redistricting  specialist revealed that the citizenship question would result in a  structural electoral advantage for Republicans and non-Hispanic Whites.   The Voting Rights Act enforcement excuse the Republicans lean on is  nothing more than a ruse and their solution in search of what they view  as a problem.   It is unfortunate that they have turned to the Census to play this  political game to undermine the American people.   Most changes to the Census undergo years of testing and analysis  before being added to the decennial Census form. The reason we have  that process is to better understand the impact a change can have on  the response rate and accuracy of the Census. It allows for the Bureau  to better plan and adjust its operational and outreach strategies.   Census is only testing the impact of the question this summer with  results anticipated in October, after critical milestones have passed.  The administration leaves no time for the Census to mitigate the  potential impact of what they may find.   Wilbur Ross refused to listen to the expert advice of advocates and  experts at the Bureau who did not recommend adding an untested question  so late in the process.   Additionally, there is no doubt that including this question will  have a serious negative impact on the self-response rate of the Census.  People would simply choose not to respond to the Census form, and the  Bureau will be forced to engage in expensive, in-person follow-up that  was not originally assumed in their cost estimate.   This should not be an issue that divides us. It should not matter  whether you live in a red or blue State or whether you represent an  urban or rural district. The question will impact everyone.   This amendment will reduce the accuracy and increase the undercount  in places like Florida, Texas, Alabama, Michigan, California, and New  York. This, in turn, will affect reapportionment and the distribution  of Federal funds for the next decade in many of the communities we  represent.   We can and should do better. Our Constitution is clear. It requires  that we count all persons every 10 years.   In conclusion, the issue is very simple: If you represent a community  that will be undercounted by this question, then you should oppose the  amendment. If you support the strict interpretation of the  Constitution, then you should also oppose this amendment.   Madam Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, the gentleman is correct: There is a  campaign of fear, but it is not by what we are doing here. It is what  Wilbur Ross wanted to do.   The Constitution is clear. Count all the people: not the Whites, not  the Blacks, not the Hispanics, not women, not men, Republicans or  Democrats--all the people.   And so it is really strange to me that people in many districts that  do not support our position are not yelling. After all, you may not  like undocumented people in your district, but they, if they get  counted, bring more Federal dollars, allow for more redistricting  properly. So why would you oppose that?   Let us speak to the Constitution.   Yes, there is a campaign of fear, and it was fear to try to put into  people who were undocumented to say: We are going to ask you your  citizenship. Although we are not supposed to ask you that, we are going  to ask you that, and maybe that will turn you away from filling out the  form, which is what will happen, and we will not get an accurate count.   Lastly, it is in everyone's interest in this country to get an  accurate count.    Madam Chair, may I inquire how much time the other side  has remaining.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I rise in opposition to the amendment,  although I am not opposed to it.    Madam Chair, I commend the gentleman and his cosponsors  on this amendment, highlighting July 20, 1969, the 50th anniversary of  the United States landing a man on the Moon.   I have no opposition to the amendment.   I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wilson).    Madam Chair, I urge bipartisan support and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the amendment. This  amendment is consistent with the trend in recent years to acknowledge  that States, D.C., and the territories are taking charge of their  marijuana policy.   I urge that the amendment be agreed to.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the amendment, if adopted, would pose  serious risks to our economic and national security. It would undermine  our efforts to help create jobs, address the deadly opioid crisis, and  increase critical scientific research and legal services for  underserved communities.   A 14 percent decrease would, for the Department of Commerce, close  over 30 foreign commercial service posts and 10 domestic field offices  and lead to the dismissal of hundreds of Commerce personnel who support  and create U.S. jobs by leveling the playing field for U.S. businesses  in overseas markets; cut over $1 billion from the U.S. Census Bureau,  which undermines the Census Bureau's ability to invest in critical  information technology infrastructure to safeguard Census data as it  moves to an online platform; and limit Census' flexibility to conduct  important outreach and follow-up activities in hard-to-count  communities, including rural parts of the country.   This amendment would also cause massive cuts in an array of agencies  and programs critical to national security, anticrime efforts, and the  constitutionally required 2020 Census. It would slash funding for  efforts to create jobs, fix aging infrastructure, and respond to the  reality of climate change.   I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, very briefly, in closing, we get folks on  the  [[Page H4894]]  floor who tell us how much money we have to cut from the budget, from  the appropriations, but they really never take time to ask their  constituents how they feel about new roads, about hospital help, about  education, about climate change, about other issues. You would be  surprised how many people who may not scream out in support or against  a certain amendment would feel the pain of our cutbacks and would not  be for them. So I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of the amendment.   The Commerce Department has illustrated that it requires additional  oversight. This increase to the inspector general will restore critical  positions that will provide transparency to Congress on what Secretary  Ross is up to.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Cartwright) having assumed the chair, Mr. Phillips, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3055)  making appropriations for the Departments of Commerce and Justice,  Science, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30,  2020, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow for morning-hour  debate and 10 a.m. for legislative business.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 50 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, June 20, 2019, at 9 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
