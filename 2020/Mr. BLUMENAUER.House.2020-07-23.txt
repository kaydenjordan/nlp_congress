 Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a joy to acknowledge  my one-quarter century relationship with our friend, John Lewis. The  better I got to know him, the deeper my respect for his courage, his  determination, and his strength.   People have remarked about his gentle spirit, his kindness, and his  generosity. I watched countless young people be introduced to him in  awe, including my own grandson.   I just heard Leader McCarthy acknowledge being in Selma with John on  the 50th anniversary of that Bloody Sunday. It was beyond my ability  for words to express watching John. On that stage near where he was  once almost beaten to death, he spoke as a Member of Congress and then  he introduced the first Black President of the United States, Barack  Obama.   It is heartening to hear so many who were polar opposites of John  politically honor and praise his life and his service. They sincerely  mourn his passing and salute his career. I would hope, Mr. Speaker,  however, that we would not just repeat his words, but listen and  understand and honor his lifework and his lifetime commitment to  lifting people up and helping them find their voices and express their  wishes by exercising the precious right of voting.   When John started, the vote was suppressed by violence and  intimidation. Today people are suppressing the votes using computers,  legal challenges, and capricious voting standards against the poor,  people of color, the young, and the marginalized. These are people John  knew should have special help, but instead he was outraged in his own  gentle but forceful way that they got special barriers shutting them  out.   I would hope that those who come to the floor to issue their tributes  to John Lewis would join me in respecting his life's work. Let's find  ways to work together to protect the political process for those whom  he fought so valiantly to be able to engage and protect.   I will be forever grateful for his friendship and his example. I hope  we will all find it in our hearts to honor his mission which should be  the mission of us all.                            ____________________
