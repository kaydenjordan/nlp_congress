 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  2792 and to thank the gentlewoman from South Dakota for her tremendous  effort on this piece of legislation.   This is a good bill which improves existing law and sends an  important message: taxpayers should not provide benefits to individuals  wanted by the police under outstanding warrants or parole violations  for felonies or other serious crimes. Let me say that again. This  improves existing, actually, bipartisan law, and it is not a new  concept. It only applies to individuals with outstanding warrants for  serious crimes.   The bill provides 4 years for the Social Security Administration to  implement this law and to ensure benefits are not unfairly or  improperly discontinued.   It also provides a process under which SSA notifies beneficiaries of  issues with an outstanding warrant or parole violation and provides  time for them to address the concern with law enforcement.   In addition, SSA is empowered to provide compassionate allowances for  those with serious disabilities or medical concerns who are unable to  clear their warrant in a timely fashion.   Mr. Speaker, this is a narrow bill which protects both law-abiding  beneficiaries and taxpayers. It is important that we have these funds  to help the needy families who are benefiting from the MIECHV program,  the home visitation program, a unique Federal program that actually  shows that it makes a positive difference in the lives of young people  and young families.   Mr. Speaker, it is important that we look at the entire issue in a  fiscally responsible way, where we have the funds through this bill to  pay for the needs among needy families across America.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take  from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 3823) to amend title 49, United  States Code, to extend authorizations for the airport improvement  program, to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend the  funding and expenditure authority of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund,  to provide disaster tax relief, and for other purposes, with the Senate  amendment thereto, and concur in the Senate amendment.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when  the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday, October 2,  2017, when it shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m.  for legislative business.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 4 o'clock and 2 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday,  October 2, 2017, at noon for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
