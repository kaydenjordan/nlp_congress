 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1222) to amend the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration  Act to facilitate the establishment of additional or expanded public  target ranges in certain States.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1222         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Target Practice and       Marksmanship Training Support Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--        (1) the use of firearms and archery equipment for target       practice and marksmanship training activities on Federal land       is allowed, except to the extent specific portions of that       land have been closed to those activities;        (2) in recent years preceding the date of enactment of this       Act, portions of Federal land have been closed to target       practice and marksmanship training for many reasons;        (3) the availability of public target ranges on non-Federal       land has been declining for a variety of reasons, including       continued population growth and development near former       ranges;        (4) providing opportunities for target practice and       marksmanship training at public target ranges on Federal and       non-Federal land can help--        (A) to promote enjoyment of shooting, recreational, and       hunting activities; and        (B) to ensure safe and convenient locations for those       activities;        (5) Federal law in effect on the date of enactment of this       Act, including the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act       (16 U.S.C. 669 et seq.), provides Federal support for       construction and expansion of public target ranges by making       available to States amounts that may be used for       construction, operation, and maintenance of public target       ranges; and        (6) it is in the public interest to provide increased       Federal support to facilitate the construction or expansion       of public target ranges.        (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to facilitate the       construction and expansion of public target ranges, including       ranges on Federal land managed by the Forest Service and the       Bureau of Land  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Target Practice and Marksmanship Training Support  Act amends the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act to authorize  a State to pay up to 90 percent of the costs of acquiring land for  constructing a public target range. Under the current law, the State is  authorized to pay up to only 75 percent of the cost.   This bill also allows the State to allocate 10 percent of its Federal  wildlife restoration funding to building public target ranges.   This bill was part of the negotiated historic lands package that was  signed into law in March of this year, but this specific section had to  be pulled from the final package because language in the bill is  required to originate in the House.   I would like to commend Congressman Kind for his continued support of  sportsmen and sportswomen and his work to send this last piece of the  negotiated package to the Senate.   This is, again, a good opportunity to celebrate the rightfully named  lands package, the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and  Recreation Act, which was a product of many months of negotiations and  many years of committee process.   The lands package benefits all Americans by protecting ecosystems,  preserving our cultural heritage, and connecting people to their lands.  By protecting ecosystems, preserving our cultural heritage, and  connecting people to their lands, we demonstrate this Congress'  commitment to public lands that serve all Americans.   Not only did the package permanently authorize the Land and Water  Conservation Fund, but it also added over 1 million acres of  wilderness, designated four new national monuments, and expanded three  national parks, just to name a few of the over 100 provisions. H.R.  1222 is simply the last to get over the finish line, and I am proud to  support it.   I urge my colleagues to continue to support the lands package and  support this bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                       Conress of the United States,         House of Representatives,   Committee on Ways and Means,                                     Washington, DC, April 29, 2019.      Hon. Raul M. Grijalva,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Grijalva: I am writing with respect to H.R.       1222, ``Target Practice and Marksmanship Training Support       Act.'' As a result of your having consulted with us on       provisions on which the Committee on Ways and Means has       jurisdictional interest, I will not request sequential       referral on this measure.        The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within our jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation, and request your support for such a       request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 1222.            Sincerely,                                                   Richard E. Neal,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                     Washington, DC, April 29, 2019.      Hon. Richard E. Neal,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for consulting with the       Natural Resources Committee on H.R. 1222, ``Target Practice       and Marksmanship Training Support Act'' and agreeing to forgo       a sequential referral request so that the bill may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your declining to pursue a referral in this       case does not diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the       Committee on Ways and Means nor prejudice its jurisdictional       prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the       future. I would support your effort to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees from your Committee over any       parts of this bill or similar legislation under the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means to any House-      Senate conference.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this bill and look       forward to continuing to work with you as this measure moves       through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                  Raul M. Grijalva,                                                       Chairman,                                    House Natural Resources Committee.     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 91) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to assess  sanitation and safety conditions at Bureau of Indian Affairs facilities  that were constructed to provide affected Columbia River Treaty tribes  access to traditional fishing grounds and expend funds on construction  of facilities and structures to improve those conditions, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 91         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Columbia River In-Lieu and       Treaty Fishing Access Sites Improvement Act''.       SEC. 2. SANITATION AND SAFETY CONDITIONS AT CERTAIN BUREAU OF                     INDIAN AFFAIRS FACILITIES.         (a) Assessment of Conditions.--The Secretary of the       Interior, acting through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, in       consultation with the affected Columbia River Treaty tribes,       may assess current sanitation and safety conditions on lands       held by the United States for the benefit of the affected       Columbia River Treaty tribes, including all permanent Federal       structures and improvements on those lands, that were set       aside to provide affected Columbia River Treaty tribes access       to traditional fishing grounds--        (1) in accordance with the Act of March 2, 1945 (59 Stat.       10, chapter 19) (commonly known as the ``River and Harbor Act       of 1945''); or        (2) in accordance with title IV of Public Law 100-581 (102       Stat. 2944).        (b) Exclusive Authorization; Contracts.--The Secretary of       the Interior, acting through the Bureau of Indian Affairs--        (1) subject to paragraph (2)(B), shall be the only Federal       agency authorized to carry out the activities described in       this section; and        (2) may delegate the authority to carry out activities       described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (d)--        (A) through one or more contracts entered into with an       Indian Tribe or Tribal organization under the Indian Self-      Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5301 et       seq.); or        (B) to include other Federal agencies that have relevant       expertise.        (c) Definition of Affected Columbia River Treaty Tribes.--      In this section, the term ``affected Columbia River Treaty       tribes'' means the Nez Perce Tribe, the Confederated Tribes       of Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of       the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon, and the Confederated       Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation.        (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized       to be appropriated to the Secretary of the Interior such sums       as are necessary, to remain available until expended--        (1) for improvements to existing structures and       infrastructure to improve sanitation and safety conditions       assessed under subsection (a); and        (2) to improve access to electricity, sewer, and water       infrastructure, where feasible, to reflect needs for sanitary       and safe use of facilities referred to in subsection (a).       SEC. 3. STUDY OF ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES.         The Comptroller General of the United States, in       consultation with the Committee on Indian Affairs of the       Senate, shall--        (1) conduct a study to evaluate whether the sanitation and       safety conditions on lands held by the United States for the       benefit of the affected Columbia River Treaty tribes (as       defined in section 2(c)) have improved as a result of the       activities authorized in section 2; and        (2) prepare and submit to the Committee on Indian Affairs       of the Senate and the Committee on Natural Resources of the       House of Representatives a report containing the results of       that study.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 91 authorizes the Bureau of Indian Affairs to  assess sanitation and safety conditions on land set aside to provide  Columbia River Treaty Tribes access to traditional fishing grounds, and  to enter into contracts with Tribes or Tribal organizations to improve  the identified conditions.   The Columbia River Treaty Tribes, through a series of treaties in  1855, established access to ``usual and accustomed fishing areas'' and  ancillary fishing facilities on the Columbia River.   Starting in the 1930s, construction of the dams of the Columbia River  Power System resulted in flooding and destruction of Tribal villages,  homes, and traditional fishing sites, severely impacting the Tribal  members' ability to exercise these treaty rights. The tribes and their  citizens have never been fully compensated for their losses.   In a series of agreements and laws starting in 1939, the Federal  Government acquired and developed small parcels of land to serve as  ``in-lieu'' and treaty fishing access sites, providing members of the  Columbia River Treaty Tribes access to exercise their rights to fish in  the Columbia and reside at their traditional fishing places and fishing  stations.  [[Page H3291]]    Additionally, Congress enacted the Columbia River Treaty Fishing  Access Sites project in 1988, which authorized improvements for the  existing ancillary fishing facilities and directed the Army Corps of  Engineers to acquire new lands to provide unencumbered river access for  Tribal members.   Today, there are 31 Tribal fishing sites located along the Columbia  River, 27 of which are managed by the BIA. The sites were intended to  be used primarily for in-season fishing and some temporary camping.   However, out of both a need for housing and a desire to be closer to  traditional fishing areas, many Tribal members now use these areas as  permanent residences.                                time  1645    These sites were not designed for and cannot sustain this  accommodated use. In fact, many people at these sites are living in  extremely distressed, unsafe, and unsanitary conditions as a direct  result of decades of unmet obligations by the BIA.   Passage of H.R. 91 will result in vast improvements to the conditions  of these sites. As such, I urge the quick adoption of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 317) to reaffirm the action of the Secretary of the Interior  to take land into trust for the benefit of the Santa Ynez Band of  Chumash Mission Indians, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:  [[Page H3292]]                                       H.R. 317         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Santa Ynez Band of Chumash       Indians Land Affirmation Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

(2) On October 31, 2017, the Board of Supervisors for the       County of Santa Barbara approved the Memorandum of Agreement       on Camp 4 and authorized the Chair to sign the Memorandum of       Agreement.        (3) The Secretary of the Interior approved the Memorandum       of Agreement pursuant to section 2103 of the Revised Statutes       (25 U.S.C. 81).       SEC. 3.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 317 will reaffirm the action of the Secretary of  the Interior to take certain lands into trust for the benefit of the  Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Mission Indians in California.   The current Chumash reservation is just under 100 acres, but only 40  of those acres are able to be utilized for government offices, economic  development, and a few Tribal homes.   It is obvious that there is not enough Tribal land for housing needs.  Only 17 percent of Tribal members and lineal descendants are able to  live in Tribal housing.   In 2010, the Tribe purchased approximately 1,400 acres of ancestral  land in an effort to provide suitable housing for the Tribe's members  and their descendants. Even though this land was taken into trust  administratively, a number of parties continue to file lawsuits  appealing the decision.   The Chumash leadership has been forthcoming in their desire to  acquire this land only for additional Tribal housing, and they have  attempted to be a good neighbor by engaging local elected officials and  groups to mitigate any concerns.   It is a shame that it has taken almost a decade for this issue to be  resolved, but now we are at the point where we can finally put an end  to this process.   Passage of H.R. 317 will reaffirm the Secretarial decision that put  the land  [[Page H3293]]  in trust, clearing the way for the Chumash to finally provide  additional Tribal housing for their members. The bill will also  incorporate a memorandum of agreement between the Chumash Tribe and the  Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors in relation to the land.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Chumash leadership for their work and  for their persistence on this issue, and I encourage adoption of this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak  about an outstanding member of south Jersey.   Ceil Smith of Salem County has served south Jersey's community for  many years as the editor of the South Jersey Times south edition,  founder of The Partners of Salem County program, and most recently as  executive director of the Salem County College Foundation. The Partners  of Salem County program contributes to numerous local community and  educational programs and has raised more than $1 million in scholarship  funds.   Mrs. Smith has also served on several boards for local organizations  that serve and help our entire community.
