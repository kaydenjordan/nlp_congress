 Mr. Speaker, in the richest country in the world, every  American deserves clean drinking water, but for millions of our fellow  citizens, including many in Michigan and all across the country, this  is just not their reality.   Hundreds of communities are dealing with PFAS chemical contamination  that pollutes their drinking water.   Congress has to act to address this contamination to help keep  American families safe.   Earlier this year, the House and Senate both passed National Defense  Authorization Act bills. Both contain important provisions meant to  address PFAS chemicals were included in those bills. These provisions  would fund cleanup of contaminated sites, stop PFAS from polluting our  drinking water in the future, and ensure that servicemembers, first  responders, and families exposed to PFAS have the healthcare they need.   As the co-chair of the congressional PFAS Caucus, a bipartisan task  force from States across the country, we worked successfully to include  many PFAS provisions in both the House and Senate-passed bills.   Now it is critical that the final NDAA, which is being negotiated  right now, include very strong PFAS provisions. This is what we need to  do to protect public health.                            ____________________
