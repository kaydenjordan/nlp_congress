 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the University  of California at Santa Cruz Banana Slugs, specifically, their rocket  team, the so-called Rocket Slugs, for not only being selected to  compete in NASA's elite Student Launch Week, but for medaling in the  Best Rocket Fair Display.   The annual competition in Huntsville, Alabama, allows students to  research and develop projects related to NASA's Space Launch System.  That is America's deep space exploration rocket that is built to return  astronauts to the Moon and possibly even send them to Mars.   Their work is a testament to UC Santa Cruz and team cocaptains Kent  Roberts and Zafar Rustamkulov. These students pushed the limits of  design and engineering, pushed themselves through trial and error, and  proved that they can push their dreams to the Moon and beyond.                            ____________________
