The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.    I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.    I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.    Mr. President, I have come to the floor as we have  just filed a resolution--a bill actually--with 26 cosponsors that would  repeal the immigration ban placed by President Trump. President Trump's  Muslim ban is unnecessary, it is unconstitutional, and it is un- American. It should be repealed immediately.   The Executive order prohibits individuals from Iran, Syria, Iraq,  Sudan, Somalia, Libya, and Yemen from entering the country. It even  bars relatives of Americans from visiting. The order suspends the  entire U.S. refugee program, and most egregiously, Syrian refugees are  banned indefinitely unless they are Christian. These provisions are not  what America is all about.   First, the order is unnecessary. Individuals from the 7 targeted  countries and 150 other nations are already thoroughly screened.  Visitors fill out visa applications. They submit photographs that run  through biometric databases. Their personal information is reviewed,  including names, addresses, and dates of birth. They are interviewed at  a U.S. consulate. The process could take months to complete and  eliminates the need for the travel ban.   In addition, the move to ban refugees has no legitimate national  security reason because these refugees undergo an even more thorough  screening process that can take up to 2 years to complete. The vast  majority of refugees are women and children who have experienced the  absolute worst of humanity.   Let's not forget the heart-wrenching image of the small body of Aylan  Kurdi, a 3-year-old Syrian boy, washed up on a beach, dead. I will  never forget this small boy in his short pants, his shoes, and his  socks, lying on that beach. To turn away women and children and men in  their time of dire need is not what this Nation is all about.   Let me make this point: The poor execution of this Executive order  has resulted in chaos and confusion. It is unclear whether the Justice  Department or Homeland Security had any input. There seems to have been  a disagreement about whether it would apply to green card holders.  There was confusion about whether it applies to  [[Page S492]]  individuals already in transit or approved for travel. Even airport  directors--I have spoken directly with the directors of Los Angeles  International and San Francisco International, and there was confusion  about how it applies. Even airport directors were left in the dark  about how many people were detained and who they were.   Sara Yarjani was one Californian caught up in this mess. She is an  Iranian national studying at the California Institute for Human Science  in San Diego under a valid student visa. After being detained at LAX  for 23 hours, she was sent back to Europe, a clear violation of the  nationwide stay against the order. What I am saying is that the court  stay was actually violated. This is just one of more than 100 stories  from the weekend.   I believe this order is also unconstitutional. The First Amendment  prohibits government from establishing a religion or prohibiting the  free exercise thereof. The order violates this First Amendment by  targeting Muslims and favoring Christians. The order may also violate  the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which forbids the government  from burdening the person's exercise of religion. The law bars any  discrimination based on national origin in the issuance of a visa.   Finally, detaining people at airports may violate their Fourth  Amendment rights.   This was an ill-considered overreach, as the courts showed over the  weekend, and it should be repealed.   So the bill that 27 of us are introducing rescinds the President's  Executive order. The text is simple because the message is simple: We  won't stand for these types of actions.   In conclusion, I would like to say that I am so proud of the peaceful  demonstrations we saw, and I join those who are so passionate about the  free exercise of religion and free speech. These are our values, Mr.  President, as a nation, and I will be right there with you if anyone  tries to violate them.                                  ______                                         By Mr. HOEVEN (for himself, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. McCain, Mr.          Lankford, Mr. Moran, and Ms. Heitkamp):   S. 245.
