 Madam President.    Madam President, I rise today in support of S. 1251,  the Growing Climate Solutions Act. I first want to thank my partner in  this landmark legislation, Senator Braun, and my partner and ranking  member on the committee, Senator Boozman, for his leadership and  helping us improve this bill and getting it to where we are right now.   Our farmers and ranchers are battling the consequences of carbon  pollution and other greenhouse gases every day. They are on the  frontlines every day. Producers are having to deal with higher highs  and lower lows more so than ever before.   Even as we speak, the Southeast is recovering from catastrophic  flooding as a result of Hurricane Claudette, and the West is facing  record heat that threatens the health of farmers and farmworkers in an  unprecedented wildfire season. Nearly half of the country is in  drought, including 90 percent of my home State of Michigan--90 percent.  It could not be clearer that climate is in crisis.   The good news is that farmers and foresters are already leading the  way on the climate crisis, as my colleagues have said, through their  many conservation efforts. They work to reduce their impact every day  through conservation practices that cut down on emissions and store  carbon in their soil and trees.   According to the National Academies, scaling up these climate-smart  agriculture and forestry practices in the United States could offset  the annual emissions of nearly 110 million cars. And I am from the car  State, Madam President. I still want you to buy an automobile. But this  is very significant.   The Growing Climate Solutions Act is a key piece of the enormous  potential that land-based solutions have to help solve this crisis.  This bill gives producers even more effective tools to lead and new  opportunities for economic successes as well.   The bill equips producers to succeed by doing three things. First, it  sets up a network of trusted outside experts and third-party verifiers,  certified by the USDA, to provide technical assistance and help  producers generate and sell their voluntary carbon credits, which, by  the way, Senator Lee's amendment would gut, which is why I do not  support that amendment.   Then it creates a comprehensive online resource, a one-stop shop, to  help our farmers get the information they need and create income by  providing sustainable practices through voluntary carbon markets and  traditional USDA conservation programs.   Finally, it sets up a very important advisory council made up of a  majority of farmers and foresters with tremendous diversity, as well as  representatives from the research community and the private industry,  to help guide the USDA as they put this together.   The bottom line: It gives them the opportunity to work with the U.S.  Department of Agriculture to design a carbon market that works for  them, not Wall Street. In other words this, bill puts farmers and  foresters first.   More than 175 advocates, organizations, and companies support this  bill. They see it as a win-win for agriculture and the environment.  That coalition is mirrored in the broad support we have here in the  U.S. Senate, with now upwards of 55 cosponsors who have joined in this  bill. Given today's politics, that says a lot about what this bill  represents.   Solving the climate crisis is a critical challenge for all of us, and  today we are taking landmark steps toward supporting agriculture and  forestry leadership in addressing this.   I encourage all of my colleagues to vote yes on the Growing Climate  Solutions Act, to vote no on the Lee amendment, which would essentially  gut the bill, and allow us, in this tremendous bipartisan effort, to  move forward on something very important.   I yield the floor.                          Vote on Amendment No. 2119    Madam President, I would ask unanimous consent that the scheduled  vote occur immediately.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak about how far our  Nation has come in the past 6 months.   Just for a moment, think back to where we were in January. Every day,  hundreds of thousands of Americans were being diagnosed with COVID-19,  and on many days, more than 3,000--or even 4,000--of our moms and dads  and brothers and sisters and children and friends and neighbors were  dying of this horrible disease. Meanwhile, millions of Americans were  out of work just 6 months ago, and small businesses were unsure whether  or not they could reopen safely. During these cold, dark days, it was  easy to wonder if things would ever get better.   But something else happened in January. On January 20, President Joe  Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were sworn into office, and with  their inauguration came a laser focus on defeating this horrific  disease and getting our country moving again.   They had some amazing tools in their arsenals: vaccines that proved  to be more effective than anyone could have hoped--thank goodness. And  I am so proud that Michigan workers at Pfizer have played a big role in  producing these lifesaving vaccines and getting them shipped all over  the country.   When President Biden and Vice President Harris took office, only 5  percent of American adults had received at least one shot. Now, only 6  months later, 70 percent of Americans over age 30 have received at  least one shot. That is a total of 300 million vaccine shots in only  150 days, and we are seeing the results.   This week, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer was able to drop our  State's pandemic restrictions. That is great news for our small  businesses and our restaurants and our entertainment venues, just in  time for peak travel season in beautiful Michigan.   Nationwide, more than 2 million jobs have been created since  President Biden took office--2 million jobs since he took office just 6  months ago. Half as many people are applying for unemployment each  month as were in January. And, next month, families will begin to  receive advance child tax credits that are going to lift half of the  poor children in our country out of poverty--incredible. These monthly  payments of $250 or $300 per child will help families pay for the  things they need to care for their children, and it will also boost the  economy.   We have made amazing progress, and it wouldn't have been possible  without leadership from the White House, around $20 billion in funding  for vaccines from Congress, the dedication of our medical  professionals, the hard work of our small businesses that have done so  much to keep their employees and their customers safe, and the  willingness of so many Americans to literally roll up their sleeves to  protect themselves and each other.   It is true that we have a lot more to do, of course. Many families  and communities are still struggling to get back on their feet. We need  to continue to support our small businesses that have been through so  much.   We know that some States and regions are lagging behind on  vaccinations for a number of reasons. That is so unfortunate because we  know that these vaccinations are safe, they are free to receive, and  they are amazingly effective. The numbers prove it.   On January 23, 3,322 Americans died of coronavirus in a single day,  and, yesterday, 370 people died of coronavirus in the United States. Of  course, that is still 370 too many lives lost. Each one of those lives  was precious, and our hearts are with everyone who is grieving.   There is still a risk that variants will spread and cases could rise  again, especially in areas with low vaccination rates, which is why it  is so critical that people get vaccinated. It is so important to get  vaccinated, not only for yourselves but for your friends, for your  neighbors, and for your children.   We have come a long way--a really long way--in the last 6 months. It  is really amazing, and it is just in time for the Fourth of July.  Americans have a lot to celebrate this Independence Day. It is a day  when we give thanks for our Nation and for the freedoms we enjoy as  Americans, and this year we have a few extra freedoms to celebrate: the  freedom to get together with friends again, the freedom to eat dinner  at a favorite local restaurant, the freedom to attend a live music  event or go to a movie, the freedom to live our lives with a lot less  fear--a lot less fear--and the freedom to give our loved ones a hug.  And I know I am cherishing every hug I can give my 95-year-old mom.   All of these freedoms are thanks to science and an administration  that believes in science, and the willingness of Americans to trust the  science.   To my fellow Americans, thank you for that.   Thank you to our President, and happy Fourth of July.   I yield the floor.
