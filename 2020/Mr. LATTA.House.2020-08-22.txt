 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the ranking member, for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill, which has not gone  through regular order and was put together in  [[Page H4285]]  response to misinformation and conspiracies online.   Since the closure of the Toledo, Ohio, processing plant in 2012, mail  in northwest Ohio has been sent to the Metroplex Processing Facility in  Michigan. As my constituents can attest, this new arrangement has not  worked. We have experienced countless delays and destroyed and lost  mail for years, including more than 1,000 absentee ballots in the 2016  general election.   That is why I have continuously engaged with the USPS to fix these  problems and get our mail sorted in Ohio. They have committed to  working with me and officials in Ohio to implement procedures for  election materials.   Unfortunately, under H.R. 8015, the USPS would be prohibited from  making any changes to their operation if it is determined that the  changes would impede prompt, reliable, and efficient services.   It doesn't specifically say who will be making this determination, so  it is safe to assume it will be the unelected bureaucrats, individuals  who have told me for years that the preferred way to sort mail would be  through the Metroplex. Now, this bill could legally prohibit absentee  ballots from being processed in Ohio-based sorting facilities.   I cannot in good conscience support this new Democratic political  sideshow because it threatens the rights of my constituents to have  their voices heard in November.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this legislation.
