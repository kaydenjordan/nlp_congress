 Madam Chair, I rise in support of amendment No.  116 with Mr. Massie to ban the funding of gain-of-function research.   For decades, scientists have been warning that gain-of-function  research with potential pandemic pathogens could cause an outbreak.  From 2014 to 2017, we had paused funding for gain-of-function research  after a series of lab accidents and due to fear of a lab-caused  pandemic.   However, Dr. Fauci and others recommended that the prohibition be  removed, and unfortunately our worst fears came true. Among many  others, the FBI, Department of Energy, and a majority of Americans now  believe that a laboratory in Wuhan, China, that was conducting NIH- funded gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses caused the COVID- 19 pandemic. This was a wake-up call.   Last month, during a Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic  hearing, Dr. Gerald Parker, former commander of the United States Army  Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases and the current head  of the Federal committee that oversees gain-of-function and biosecurity  testified to Congress that gain-of-function research with potential  pandemic pathogens has not contributed significantly to biodefense and  that its benefits have been exaggerated. Dr. Parker also stated there  are safer alternatives available.   Fortunately, last year Congress passed and enacted commonsense  language in the Labor-HHS bill to prohibit gain-of-function research  with pathogens in hostile foreign nations, including Russia and China.  We must now expand that effort and prohibit taxpayer funding for this  dangerous research on U.S. soil and other nations where oversight is  lacking. Prohibiting taxpayer funding of dangerous gain-of-function  research with potential pandemic pathogens is a commonsense solution to  protect public health and national security.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.                                time  2140     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment  No. 123, which seeks to ban funding from going towards funding the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's firearm injury and  mortality prevention research.   President Biden requested $35 million for this program in his fiscal  year 2024 budget request, which is a $22.5 million increase from fiscal  year 2023.                                time  2220    Mr. Chair, I was the director of public health in the great State of  Iowa before coming to Congress and was a practicing physician for  decades. Not only have I served in public health, but I also value  public health and believe that robust public health infrastructure  nationwide is crucial to the health and well-being or our country.   That is why I released a request for information earlier this year on  how to strengthen and reform the CDC to ensure that our Nation's  leading public health agency is performing as it should.   Part of evaluating our public health departments is realizing when  there are programs that do not add value or belong in the public health  landscape.   The CDC was originally created in 1946 as the Communicable Disease  Center with the mission of preventing the spread of malaria or other  communicable diseases. Since then, the agency has grown into a massive  bureaucracy, and it now is the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention with a $9 billion budget that supports research and  initiatives that are not within the communicable diseases landscape.   As we saw, there were failures of this institution in both the  initial testing for COVID-19 and the response to COVID-19.   My amendment is an important first step in eliminating costly  programs at the CDC and urges the CDC to get back to its main mission  to help prevent a pandemic in the future.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, again, let me say that the mission of  the CDC should be to combat communicable diseases.   As we saw during the COVID-19 pandemic, the agency lost part of its  focus and has been distracted. There are multiple agencies that collect  data on gun violence and also intervention strategy and research. I  think that we can refocus the CDC on its true mission so that another 1  million American lives are not lost in the next pandemic.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
