 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I want to first thank the members  of the Appropriations Committee for recognizing the ongoing and  critical shortage of primary care physicians and behavioral health  specialists, a trend that is projected to continue into the coming  years, by requesting that HRSA, the Health Resources and Services  Administration, issue a report to Congress on how to better recruit and  train these health professionals, as well as recommendations to address  health professional staffing shortages.   My amendment serves to underscore the importance of the requested  report and to encourage HRSA to not just analyze how these efforts can  improve staffing shortages in underserved areas, but how we can  increase the number of physicians serving in community health centers  located in those areas.  [[Page H4610]]    Delaware, like many States around the country, is facing a severe  primary care physician shortage. In 2018, there were just 815 primary  care physicians in Delaware, down 5.4 percent from 2013.                                time  0145    According to HRSA, of the three counties in Delaware, two of them,  Kent and Sussex, exceed the 2,000 to 1 primary-doctor-to-patient ratio,  which is a benchmark for shortages.   According to a study commissioned by the Delaware Department of  Health and Social Services, this trend is going to significantly impact  the State's rural, downstate communities.   As HRSA develops recommendations for addressing physician shortages,  they should also focus on how we can incentivize primary care  physicians, in addition to other physicians experiencing health  staffing shortages, to not just practice in underserved areas, but at  community health centers.   Community health centers bring comprehensive primary care to  underserved areas, improving not only access to healthcare, but health  outcomes.   People in my State depend on community health centers for a variety  of reasons. La Red Health Center, located in Georgetown, Delaware,  shared that their patients appreciated their access to primary care,  behavioral health services, and oral health care all in one place, and  that medical services focused on the full lifecycle. For some, they  face the inability to access care at private practices.   Community health centers will continue to be a vital source of care  for underserved communities, and we should know the best ways to  attract physicians to serve in them.   Madam Chair, I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro), a tireless advocate and distinguished Member, the  chairwoman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and  Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies.    Madam Chair, I encourage my colleagues to  support H.R. 2740 and this commonsense amendment. It will ensure that  we have the best information available to help all communities, both  rural and urban.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
