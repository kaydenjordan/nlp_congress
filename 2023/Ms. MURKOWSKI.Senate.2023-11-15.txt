 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on November 18 of 1923, a young couple  living in Indianapolis, IN, George and Gertrude Stevens, welcomed their  third child to the world, and they named him Theodore Fulton Stevens-- ``Ted,'' for short.   And like all new parents, I am sure that George and Gertrude were  filled with hope and optimism about their boy's future: the things that  he would do, the places that he would go, the life that he would have.  But I suspect that even they didn't realize what an extraordinary life  he would lead, a life of service and accomplishment during which he  earned his place as a giant in the history of this Chamber and  certainly in my State of Alaska.   So we are looking forward to the 100th anniversary of the birth of  the late Senator Ted Stevens. This is coming up on Saturday. So I have  come to the floor this afternoon to make sure that all of us who serve  here and all who are listening know why it is important that we  continue to remember and celebrate this truly great man.   Ted's service to our country began during World War II when he  enlisted in the Army Air Corps as a pilot. He supported General  Chennault's Flying Tigers in the China-Burma-India theater, flying  missions over the Hump many, many times behind enemy lines.   After the war, Ted Stevens completed law school. He moved ``north to  the future,'' to Alaska, where he served as a U.S. attorney in  Fairbanks. It was just a few years later, during the Eisenhower  administration, that he joined the Department of the Interior, where he  served as Secretary Fred Seaton's right-hand man in the successful  fight for Alaska's statehood. Then, after statehood, Ted was elected to  the Alaska House of Representatives. That was 1964.    He was then appointed to the U.S. Senate in 1968. He would go on to  win reelection to the Senate seven straight times, receiving almost 80  percent of the vote back in 2002. In all, he served his State and his  country for a total of 40 years and 10 days as a Senator--pretty  extraordinary.   And Ted was a pretty busy legislator. He chaired four different  committees, including Appropriations. His colleagues chose him to be  their minority whip, the majority whip, and the assistant Republican  leader. He led the Senate's Arms Control Observer Group, the U.S.-China  interparliamentary group, and he also spent several years as our  President pro tempore.   Ted was, by all accounts, a very powerful legislator, but he used his  power for a single purpose, and that was to help his country and to  help his State. For him, it was pretty basic.   He helped us settle Aboriginal land claims and create Alaska Native  corporations. He secured the authorization to build the Trans-Alaska  Pipeline System, which remains, to this day, our State's economic  backbone and provides for our energy security.   Ted was an outdoors guy. He loved fishing. He was able to write the  framework that continues today to guide Federal fisheries management.  That is the Magnuson-Stevens Act. He was a champion for national  defense as well as international competitiveness, and he truly helped  America become a superpower and, I believe, the economic envy of the  world.   He helped to fund breast cancer research. He promoted women's  participation in sports through title IX. It was incredible what he did  for women's athletics and sports.   He also--very proudly and unabashedly; sometimes maybe even  gleefully--brought home what I imagined to be billions of dollars. We  are calling those now congressionally directed spending. It used to be  earmarks back in the day. But they were specifically targeted to build  basic infrastructure and to meet community needs across our still young  and undeveloped State.   We have terminology in the Senate for those who have been around for  a while who observed the traditions and the history of the Senate, but  Ted was really an ``old bull'' in Senate parlance. He was a statesman.  He was a patriot. He was a force to be reckoned with.   He was known to have just a little bit of a temper; although, I found  that, oftentimes, that temper was just used for effect. He would don an  Incredible Hulk tie just to show you all that he really meant business,  and on those days when you saw him on the floor and he was wearing the  tie, you would know maybe it was best to stay out of his way that day  or, certainly, to be with him when he was fighting for Alaska's  interests.   But as much as he was a fighter in that way, he was also one who  worked across party lines. He legislated in the good old-fashioned way.  He had a relationship with Senator Dan Inouye from Hawaii--often  referred to him as his brother--and they led as a model, that duo of  Alaska and Hawaii. They would rotate--literally rotate--on  Appropriations being the senior appropriators. One Congress, one would  be the chairman; the next Congress, majorities come and go. And there  would be no daylight between the two of them. It was an extraordinary  relationship built on respect and an understanding that you stand up  and you fight for your State's needs.   Ted was one of those who really tried to let the politics stand down  and just focus on what was good. He had a saying, and it is certainly  one that has been emblazoned on many things that I have seen in these  past couple of decades. But he would say:   [[Page S5524]]              To hell with politics. Just do what's right for Alaska.    And those are words that many of us still follow and that I think  those in the Senate here would do well to live by: Do what is right for  the people that have sent you here. Do what is right for your State.   I am so immensely fortunate to have worked with Ted. I was actually a  high school intern for Ted Stevens when I graduated from high school-- and then to have the privilege to serve alongside him, to have him as a  mentor, a friend, a partner over the course of so many decades.   I have said and have been quoted in different articles about the role  that Ted played in Alaska's history:         There is nothing that has happened in my lifetime, there is       nothing that has happened since statehood, that Ted Stevens       did not touch, that he did not build, did not create.    He had that much influence. There really was no one like him. He had  a vision. He was determined to achieve it no matter who or what stood  in the way.   He won medals for his distinguished military service. He was chosen  as ``Alaskan of the Century.'' For the entire 20th century, we  designated that honor, that respect for him, for his remarkable service  in statehood and in the Senate.   Now, it is true that a Federal investigation and extreme  prosecutorial misconduct tipped an election that prematurely ended  Ted's time in public office. That type of debasement would cost many  their faith in the institutions that they had served for so long. But  not with Ted--not with Ted. He kept his faith in the institution, not  only in the institution of the Senate but in the institution of the  judiciary. He knew he was innocent and maintained that, and he was  ultimately exonerated.   But he left a reminder with all of us when he gave his departure  speech in 2008. He left the Senate saying that ``my future is in God's  hands. Alaska's future is in yours.''   We actually have had buttons made up with Ted's smiling face--I  believe it is exactly this picture--and it says:         Alaska's future is in your hands.    Believe me, I look at that every single day. I take it very  seriously.   We tragically lost Ted in a plane crash, just 2 years later, after he  left office. This was August of 2010. It is still really hard for me to  believe that he has been gone for 13 years. But, in so many ways, he is  still with us; he is still around.   I see it in my office. I have the same office in the Hart building  that he had. The same totem pole that he had in his office is now in my  office. I visit his portrait here in the Capitol right outside that  door there and visit his grave in Arlington National Cemetery.   At the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, which I am flying  in and out of just about every week, it seems there is a statue that  sits in kind of a main open area, and it is life size, with Ted sitting  there with a briefcase at his feet and just kind of talking  extemporaneously. And I walk by and give that hand a little squeeze  every time I leave to go somewhere.   I certainly continue to pay my respects, but I often think about how  Ted would face the issues that we confront today--not only the issues  but how we are confronting them as legislators and lawmakers.   I mentioned Ted's legendary temper. And, understand that we all have  different ways that we can respond and react, but, in fairness, I think  that Ted would be very discouraged by what he is seeing with the  politicization, the disrespect, I think, that sometimes we see with  whether it is name-calling or just not treating one another with the  level of decorum that the office demands.   As I say, he was an institutionalist. He believed in this  institution, as I do, and I think he recognized that if we don't show  respect for others, for one another, how can we expect that that  respect will be reciprocated from others who are observing us?   Ted sometimes referenced the ``pace of forgetting.'' It was his  recognition that times change, people come and go, and how things  happened or why they mattered isn't always recorded. Only 26 out of the  100 Members of the current Senate--barely over a quarter of this  Chamber--ever had the privilege of serving alongside him. But, while  Ted may be gone, he is certainly not forgotten. You don't forget  legends like Ted Stevens, not here in the institution that he loved,  and, certainly, not back home in Alaska.   We remember ``Uncle Ted''--that is what we still call him--Senator  Ted Stevens. We miss him. But as we near his 100th birthday, we will  celebrate him. We honor his service and thank him for his life of  dedicated work on our behalf.   And just a couple of days from now, on Saturday, November 18, I would  encourage everyone to just stop for just a second and think about the  contributions of great leaders like Ted Stevens. Certainly, I am going  to be standing by to wish this great man a happy 100th birthday and to  count the blessings he left behind.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record,  following my remarks, a really great editorial from the Anchorage Daily  News, which was published on Sunday, November 12, about Senator  Steven's birthday.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               [From the Anchorage Daily News, Nov. 12, 2023]                        The Man Who Reshaped Alaska                          (By the Editorial Board)         As we approach the 100-year anniversary of former U.S. Sen.       Ted Stevens' birth on Nov. 18, the magnitude of change he       wrought in Alaska has only become more important since his       death. There are certainly others who were instrumental in       making our state what it is today--for example, former Gov.       Jay Hammond for the creation of the Permanent Fund and its       ensuing dividend; ``Mr. Alaska'' Bob Bartlett, whose advocacy       for statehood as a territorial delegate and later career as       senator put the Last Frontier on the map in Washington, D.C.;       Elizabeth Peratrovich, who championed civil rights for Alaska       Native people and played a major role in ensuring the       territorial Legislature's passage of the Equal Rights Act of       1945. But when it comes to the breadth, pervasiveness and       longevity of his legislative accomplishments, it's hard to       argue that anyone else has had as great an impact on Alaska       as Ted Stevens.        Although he became notorious on the Beltway for his       unashamed embrace of pork barrel projects that benefited       Alaska, Stevens had a formative role in almost every major       federal law relating to the state. The Alaska Native Claims       Settlement Act. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act.       The creation of Title IX, which sought to ensure parity in       sports opportunities between women and men--as well as       several revisions that expanded or restored Title IX tenets       after attempts to curtail them. The Amateur Sports Act of       1978, which established the U.S. Olympic Committee and laid       the groundwork for the U.S. athletic powerhouse of today. The       Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. And the       Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act that       governs fishing in U.S. federal waters. Those are just the       topmost highlights of Stevens' four-decade career in the U.S.       Senate.        And, of course, Stevens' reputation for bringing home the       bacon to Alaska was well-earned. As with his legislative       accomplishments, the list of projects Stevens funded in       Alaska is far too long to enumerate. Just in Anchorage,       everything from port funds, trail system expansion, social       services at Covenant House and Bean's Cafe, the creation of       the Alaska Native Heritage Center, the Potter Marsh       Conservation Center, the expansion of the Alaska Zoo, the       Anchorage Museum, Ben Boeke Arena and Hilltop Ski Area, the       Alaska Botanical Garden and the Eagle River Nature Center--      all benefited from funds Stevens allocated. As Sen. Lisa       Murkowski said, ``There is nothing that has happened in my       lifetime, there is nothing that has happened since statehood,       that Ted Stevens did not touch, that he did not build, did       not create.        Stevens was upfront about his (usually successful) quest to       fund Alaska infrastructure at levels well above the per-      capita funding flowing to other U.S. states. His rationale       was that as a state that entered the Union more than a       century after the vast majority of the others, Alaska had a       lot of catching up to do in bringing its federally funded       development up to parity with the rest of the country. And       while watchdog groups and legislators from other states       chafed at the allocation of funds to a state few of them       valued, Stevens' perspective makes good sense to most anyone       who has ever been here for any length of time and seen what       Alaska has and doesn't.        Stevens' legacy, like most major figures in Washington,       D.C., was not unblemished. He ultimately lost his Senate seat       after a jury found him guilty of making false statements       related to his financial dealings. That verdict was       ultimately tossed and the case vacated after a special       investigation by then-Attorney General Eric Holder, who was       shocked by the degree of prosecutorial misconduct in the       case. In hindsight, it's clear that he shouldn't have been       charged, much less convicted. But the damage had been done to       Stevens' political prospects, and his  [[Page S5525]]       closeness to disgraced oilfield services executive Bill Allen       surely lost him votes and colored Alaskans' perceptions of       their larger-than-life U.S. senator.        Ultimately, however, it is the work Stevens did in the       Capitol that has gone on to define him since his death in a       2010 plane crash. And the through-line of that work was a       style of politics that is now almost entirely absent in       Washington, D.C., today: A willingness to put partisan       differences aside in service of the work being done, for our       state and the country. ``To hell with politics, just do       what's right for Alaska,'' was Stevens' mantra. If we could       return to that way of thinking in Juneau and Washington,       D.C., we would all be better for it.                            ____________________     With that, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  stand in recess until 2 p.m.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 1:06 p.m. recessed until 2  p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer (Ms.  Rosen).                            ____________________
