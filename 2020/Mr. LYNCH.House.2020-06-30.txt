 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio for yielding. I also  thank the committee's amazing staff for the great work they have done  in putting together really a remarkable and powerful surface  transportation bill.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank Chairman DeFazio for including several  pieces of legislation that I had put forward. One is to provide $1.7  billion for zero-emission buses.   My legislation earmarks 10 percent of that amount, 10 percent of  those zero-emission buses, for low-income communities, oftentimes,  majority-minority communities that have major health disparities within  their communities, such as lung disease, asthma, and other respiratory  diseases.   These zero-emission buses will make a big difference in cities like  Brockton, Massachusetts, that I represent. We have gotten a fair number  of zero-emission buses for them in the past, and this will really help  us rebuild our fleet.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank the chairman for including a  measure that I had put in to protect bicyclists and pedestrians in  urban areas and other suburban areas where we have had repeated  accidents. It requires the Department of Transportation to do a survey  on those areas that have had high numbers of accidents.    Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for including my  bill on establishing an aviation task force to make it safer for the  public to fly during this pandemic period.
