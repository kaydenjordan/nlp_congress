 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this bill is  not about contraception; it is about abortion.   The bill defines ``contraception'' as ``any drug, device, or  biological product intended for use in the prevention of pregnancy,  whether specifically intended to prevent pregnancy or for other health  needs, that is approved by the FDA.''   The FDA has approved dangerous chemical abortion drugs that can also  be used as contraceptives off-label. There is a huge difference between  a drug that blocks fertilization and a drug that can end a life.   This bill also includes a provision that would act as a guaranteed  earmark for Planned Parenthood. Under the bill, the government could  not directly fund a health organization unless it provides abortion  drugs.   Finally, this bill does not respect freedom of conscience for  healthcare providers. It would no longer allow for religious exemptions  for organizations that have deeply held objections to providing  abortions.   The bill uses intentionally vague language to hide its ulterior  motive of protecting access to abortion drugs. For these reasons, I  object.
