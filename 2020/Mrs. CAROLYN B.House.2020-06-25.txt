 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentlewoman for yielding and her leadership, along with the  Congressional Black Caucus, in moving this important bill to the floor.   I rise today with Americans across the country who are demanding  change. I rise in strong support of the George Floyd Justice in  Policing Act.   This vital reform package addresses police brutality, law enforcement  accountability, and racial injustice. It creates data collection  standards, bans racial and religious profiling, ends the use of  chokeholds that killed Eric Garner and George Floyd, and bans no-knock  warrants like the one that took the life of Breonna Taylor. It ends  qualified immunity to allow full accountability.   This bill is a critical first step toward a more just nation. We  cannot be a country that declares Black lives matter if we fail to make  lasting change to protect the lives of Black people.   We are facing a historic moment, and we must deliver historic change.  Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 7120.
