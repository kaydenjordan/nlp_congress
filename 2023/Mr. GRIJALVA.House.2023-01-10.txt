 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the time.   As Ranking Member Nadler from the Judiciary Committee said, H. Res.  12 is a dangerous government attempt to interject extremist politics  into our justice system and shield MAGA extremists from legal  consequences for their actions, including January 6 and the follow-up  and investigations that are ongoing now. He is right about that  Republican strategy. H. Res. 12 is both political cover and a political  weapon.   Like any legislation, H. Res. 12 is driven by the motivation of its  sponsors, the Republican majority in the House of Representatives. For  example, legislative action on climate change is motivated by urgency  and our collective health and life, but H. Res. 12 is intended to  intimidate, scare, and ultimately cower our public institutions into  standing down as our descent into division and fascism continues.   Power for the sake of power is truly dangerous. H. Res. 12 is just  that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.
