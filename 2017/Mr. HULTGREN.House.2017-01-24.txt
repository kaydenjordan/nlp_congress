 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming. I  am so grateful to be here to talk on this important subject.   Madam Speaker, Thomas Jefferson once said: ``The care of human life  and happiness, and not their destruction, is the first and only object  of good government.''   It is with Jefferson's words in mind that I rise today as an original  cosponsor in support of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and  Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act.   This legislation sustains Mr. Jefferson's vision of good government.  It makes permanent the Hyde amendment restricting Federal funding for  abortions and thereby ensuring the care of human life and not its  destruction. Most Americans oppose the use of their tax dollars to pay  for abortions.   Since 1976, the Hyde amendment has saved nearly 2 million unborn  children and continues to save more than 60,000 lives in the United  States every year. Americans also deserve to know--before they purchase  it--if their healthcare plans cover elective abortion.   H.R. 7 addresses the abortion secrecy clause in the Affordable Care  Act. It requires qualified plans to disclose to enrollees at the time  of enrollment whether a plan covers abortion. Americans should never be  forced to pay for someone's abortion. This legislation will restore the  status quo on government funding for elective abortions and make this  policy permanent and consistent across the Federal Government.   I commend Congressman Smith and Congressman Lipinski for their  bipartisan cooperation in introducing this bill, and I am pleased to  support it.   Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Davis).   Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, let me tell you about  Chelsea, a mother of two young children, who was on Medicaid when she  was diagnosed with cervical cancer. She never missed her birth control  pills, but when she went to the clinic for treatment, she was told that  she was pregnant and could not get the surgery she needed because of  the pregnancy.                                time  1315    Why is that? Because of the Hyde rule, Medicaid would not cover the  abortion care that she needed, and her cancer treatment was delayed,  obviously compromising her health.   Instead of discussing ways to make Chelsea's situation better, we are  considering a bill that would make the ban on abortion care services  under Medicaid permanent.   This is not about women asking for free, federally funded abortions.  This is about women like Chelsea being able to receive the medical care  they desperately need.   We saw this weekend millions of women took to the streets throughout  our country in a historic movement. So let's show them that we are  listening by rejecting this bill that makes bad policy permanent.   Madam Speaker, let's leave a woman's medical decision between her and  her doctor and reject this far-reaching bill.
