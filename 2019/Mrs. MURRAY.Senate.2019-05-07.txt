 Mr. President, I, too, want to thank the Senator from  New Mexico for organizing today's effort on this very important issue.   I rise today to join my colleagues in really shining a spotlight on a  crisis that has brought terror and pain to Tribal communities across my  home State of Washington and the Nation for far too long. It is an  alarm that has been sounding, actually, for generations and one that  has impacted literally countless families, robbing them of their  mothers and grandmothers, their sisters, their aunts, their daughters.   ``Family of missing Native woman demands answers in Wapato.''   In Yakima County:         A year after her body was found, officials are now       officially calling the death of this young woman a homicide.    A year after.   In Toppenish:         16-year-old . . . disappeared after Christmas Eve in 1971.       Her sister refuses to give up the search.    Those are just a few of the headlines that have appeared in news  outlets in Washington State within just the last few months  highlighting the scope of the crisis of missing and murdered indigenous  women and girls in our communities.   For far too long, our Nation has ignored or misclassified the  terrible stories of violence against women and girls in Tribal  communities, who have been reported missing or murdered at much higher  rates than their non-Native counterparts or, worse, not reported at  all.   It is a crisis that is particularly salient in Washington State,  which ranks second among States with the highest number of reported  cases of missing and murdered Native women. Even worse, Seattle ranks  No. 1 among cities with the highest number of cases. But it isn't just  Seattle; it is the Yakama Nation, Spokane, Tacoma. The epidemic of  missing and murdered Native women isn't an urban problem or a rural  problem. It is not an issue just for western Washington or eastern  Washington. This is an alarming trend that is devastating communities  every day throughout Washington State and across the country, one for  which Native women and girls are paying the ultimate price.   Now, thanks to the determination of Native women who have spent years  raising their voices to bring attention to this tragic pattern of  injustice, we are beginning to develop the tools and resources we need  to combat this epidemic.   I am very grateful for Native leaders and organizations like the  Seattle Indian Health Board, which last November released a landmark  new report--the first of its kind--on the crisis of missing and  murdered indigenous women, collecting important data and insights. It  is a major step toward removing a significant barrier that has burdened  efforts to end the decades-long epidemic, but there is so much more we  need to do to keep Native women and girls safe and seek justice.   As important as it is to bring awareness to this devastating crisis,  more than awareness, we need action. Congress has to wake up to the  crisis affecting Native women and recognize the Federal Government's  responsibility and role in ending it, and that includes improving and  reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act--a critical law which for  years has worked to help communities decrease assaults against women  and girls and which Republicans let lapse earlier this year.  [[Page S2675]]    This law has long garnered bipartisan support. In fact, we were able  to come together just 6 years ago to pass an even stronger version of  the law that strengthened protections and resources for our Tribal  communities. I know there are champions for this issue on both sides of  the aisle, Members who have listened to Native voices in their own  States and understand why we have to equip Tribal communities with the  tools and resources they need to protect Tribal members and hold others  accountable when they cause harm or bring violence. There is no excuse  to not get this done. We have done it before; we can do it again.   Now that VAWA has passed the House, know that I am going to keep  working with my colleagues to push the Senate to get it over the finish  line. In the meantime, I and others will continue lifting up the  stories of Native women and girls, as well as Tribal leaders and  members.   As a partner to Washington State's Tribal communities here in the  Senate, I am going to keep fighting to strengthen Federal support for  Tribal priorities and listening to Native voices as well, as we all  work together to end the tragedy of this senseless epidemic.   I yield the floor.
