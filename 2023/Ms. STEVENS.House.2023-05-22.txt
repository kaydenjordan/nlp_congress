 Mr. Speaker, I rise because earlier today in Royal Oak,  Michigan, our Governor, Governor Gretchen Whitmer, alongside our  Attorney General, Dana Nessel, Lieutenant Governor Gilchrist, our State  house judiciary chair Kelly Breen, and a former Member of Congress,  Gabby Giffords, stood today as the Governor signed into law a suite of  bills that would allow families, healthcare providers, law enforcement,  and other stakeholders to petition courts to remove guns from those  judged to be an imminent threat to themselves or others.   Michigan now joins more than a dozen other States to implement red  flag laws, sometimes known as extreme risk protection orders.   Our State has been rocked by each gun death earlier this year: a mass  shooting at Michigan State, as well as at the end of 2021, a mass  shooting at Oxford High School.   Moms Demand Action, and so many others in our community, for gun  safety, the number one killer of children in the United States of  America. I am so pleased to see Michigan take this step.                            ____________________
