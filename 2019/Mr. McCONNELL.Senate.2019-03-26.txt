 Madam President, yesterday the Senate voted to advance  the nomination of Bridget Bade of Arizona, the latest of President  Trump's qualified judicial nominees. Today we will vote on her  confirmation as a judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.   Ms. Bade's nomination comes with the bipartisan support of our  colleagues on the Judiciary Committee and a ``well qualified'' rating  from the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary.   Given that 77 Senators voted yesterday to advance this nomination, it  is obviously clear to the vast majority of us that the President has  made yet another excellent choice to the Federal bench. I hope each of  my colleagues will join me in voting for Ms. Bade later today.
