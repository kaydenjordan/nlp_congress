 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in reluctant support of S. 3277, the Space  Frontier Act of 2019.   I say ``reluctant'' because the process that brought us to this point  is extremely disappointing. Many of the provisions of this bill have  not been seriously vetted by the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee. I doubt very much whether they were at all vetted by anyone  in the Senate. And this bill makes some potentially significant changes  to space policy in the United States.                                time  1145    This is no way to legislate.   However, there are some good things in the bill. I very much  appreciate that the end date for the International Space Station is  pushed back to 2030. Now, I don't know if that date is the proper one,  but I do know that the arbitrary decision made by the Trump  administration to end the International Space Station by 2024 was  wrong. As we move into the next Congress, this is something that I hope  to be looking into.   I am also glad to see commercial remote sensing language that will  help the industry grow, while still considering the government's  legitimate security interests.   In short, I will be voting for this bill, in part, because I support  the development of commercial space activities and want them to  flourish, while still protecting the public interest.   However, as the presumptive chair of the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee in the next Congress, I certainly will be  revisiting some of the other items in the bill. For instance, this bill  creates a $150 million office at NASA and doesn't specify where the  money is to come from within NASA, or provide any real specifics to how  it will be spent.   I would also note that NASA's vital education programs receive less  money than that, so this is a major new initiative and it is something  that requires review.   I could go on, but, unfortunately, it is clear that there is not  going to be time today for a thoughtful discussion of any concerns with  the bill or any opportunity to address them. That will have to wait  until we have a new Congress.   I plan to submit a longer statement in the Record which will  highlight some of my concerns. For now, it is enough to say that I  support NASA's mission and a robust U.S. space industry and, for that  reason, I support this bill, in spite of the awful process that got us  here.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further  requests for time. But I would like to say, on behalf of my retiring  chair, that it has been a challenge. I have learned a lot. I respect  and like him. I wish him well for his future, and I hope that he will  visit us now and then to see that we will have a little bit of a change  in the committee.   I hope that we will pass this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
