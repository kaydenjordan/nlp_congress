 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this Republican  green light to tax cheaters, billionaires, and giant corporations that  do not pay their fair share of taxes.   The average working person in our country pays a rate of about 25  percent. Billionaires pay under 5 percent. Every citizen and  corporation should take a pledge of allegiance to pay their fair share  of taxes. But Amazon, Chevron, AIG, and even Coca-Cola shirk their duty  to liberty. Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Charles Koch prosper under  liberty's flag but cheat on their taxes.  [[Page H93]]    In what world is it fair that those in the top brackets can cheat the  system while hardworking Americans pay their fair share every day?   I can assure you, staff in our offices have answered over a thousand  calls since 2020 because the IRS doesn't have enough agents to do the  job. Properly funding the IRS will help to reduce the deficit, average  Americans will get answers and help, and tax cheaters will finally pay  their fair share.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a laundry list of tax cheaters.        Amazon, Exxon Mobil, AT&T, Microsoft, Verizon, Chevron,       Bank of America, UPS, Nike, Coca Cola, Charter       Communications, AIG.        Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Michael Bloomberg,       Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Steve Ballmer, Elon Musk, Rob       Walton, Charles Koch.
