 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R.  7666, the Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being Act of 2022.   One month ago, a gunman fired on Robb Elementary School in Uvalde,  [[Page H5777]]  Texas, 38 miles from where I grew up. This despicable crime led to the  death of 19 innocent children and two teachers. As a father of six, I  am absolutely heartbroken.   As a Congressman who represents Uvalde, I am focusing on delivering  change. The change starts with addressing the serious lack of mental  health resources in our country.                                time  1430    In a 2022 report by Mental Health America, Texas was ranked as the  worst State for access to mental health care. In rural communities,  that gap is felt even more intensely.   It is in places like Uvalde that mental health clinicians are few and  far between, and parents have to drive more than 4 hours roundtrip for  access to inpatient care. Communities like Uvalde are desperately in  need of mental health resources now and well into the future.   That is why I am proud to support this bipartisan package that will  commit significant resources to mental health awareness, training, and  treatment.   It is time for Congress to address the solution to the mental health  crisis in America, and that starts with supporting H.R. 7666.
