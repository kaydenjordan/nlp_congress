 Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Supportive Services Expansion Act and  the Accelerating Small Business Growth Act, which I reintroduced today.   The unprecedented investments provided by the bipartisan  infrastructure law offers a major opportunity to leverage Federal  resources to help develop women-owned, minority-owned, and  disadvantaged businesses.   President Biden set an ambitious goal of increasing the share of  Federal contracts going to small, disadvantaged businesses by 50  percent by 2025, which would translate to an additional $100 billion  for these businesses.   Established in 1970, the Federal Highway Administration's  Disadvantaged  [[Page S5695]]  Business Enterprise Supportive Services Program already provides  training, assistance, and services to minority- and women-owned  businesses to help them develop into self-sufficient organizations that  viably compete for federally assisted highway project contracts.  Unfortunately, Congress has not allowed this program to keep up with  the needs of our underserved businesses.   The Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Supportive Services Expansion  Act would increase this program's annual funding cap for the first time  in 50 years from $10 million to $25 million. Additionally, the bill  would create similar programs at the Federal Aviation Administration  and the Federal Transit Administration.   Local, regional, and State agencies have also been leaders in  developing innovative programs to prioritize disadvantaged businesses,  invest in efforts to create equitable competition, and promote diverse  economic development initiatives.   The Accelerating Small Business Growth Act would create a new grant  program to help transportation agencies across our Nation carry out  these innovative programs to help underserved businesses grow and  achieve proficiency to compete on an equal basis for contracts and  subcontracts in federally funded transportation projects. Agencies that  receive funding through this grant program would be required to submit  reports to the Department of Transportation evaluating the  effectiveness of their activities, which would help inform future  Federal procurement policymaking.   I want to thank Representatives Pete Aguilar and Jimmy Gomez for  coleading these bills with me, and I hope our colleagues will join us  in support of this legislation to help minority-owned, women-owned, and  disadvantaged businesses compete for contracts to develop and build  Federal infrastructure projects funded by the bipartisan infrastructure  law.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Supportive Services Expansion Act and  the Accelerating Small Business Growth Act, which I reintroduced today.
