 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Comer and Ranking  Member Raskin for helping move this bill through committee. I rise in  strong support of H.R. 2379.   My legislation would designate the USPS facility at 616 East Main  Street in St. Charles, Illinois, as the Veterans of the Vietnam War  Memorial Post Office in recognition of Vietnam veterans and their  service to the people of the United States.   This formal renaming is but a small step to recognize the enormous  sacrifice made by the brave men and women who served our Nation in  Vietnam.   I humbly offer this legislation to honor every one of those soldiers,  sailors, coastguardsmen, airmen, and marines whose service helped  safeguard our Nation.   When visiting this post office, members of the community will be able  to reflect on the nearly 3 million Americans and more than 200,000  Illinoisans who served our country during the Vietnam war and the debt  we still owe them.   It is my hope that the Veterans of the Vietnam War Memorial Post  Office will serve as a beacon of recognition in the community, shining  a light on all the sacrifices that these veterans made for all of us.   To all of them, we once again say: Welcome home.
