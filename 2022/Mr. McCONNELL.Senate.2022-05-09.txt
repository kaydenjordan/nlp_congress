 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S2371]]     Madam President, 2 years ago, the Senate Democratic  leader rallied a crowd on the steps of the Supreme Court and threatened  Justices by name if they did not resolve an abortion case the way he  wanted. Here was the quote:         I want to tell you, Gorsuch; I want to tell you, Kavanaugh:       You have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price.       You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these       awful decisions.    This incitement triggered rare public rebukes from the Chief Justice  himself and even the liberal American Bar Association. But, apparently,  the radical left heard their marching orders loud and clear.   Since the precedent-setting leak of a draft opinion last week, the  left has set out to harass and intimidate sitting judges as they  consider a pending case. We have seen angry crowds assemble at  Justices' private family homes. Activists publish a map of their  addresses. Law enforcement has had to install a security fence around  the Supreme Court itself.   Trying--trying--to scare Federal judges into ruling a certain way is  far outside the bounds of First Amendment speech or protest; it is an  attempt to replace the rule of law with the rule of mobs.   It appears this may possibly be flatout illegal. There is a Federal  law on the books that criminalizes ``pickets or parades with the intent  of influencing any judge, juror, witness, or court officer'' at  locations--listen to this--that include a judge's ``residence.''   Last year, Attorney General Garland's Justice Department was quick to  treat the concerned parents of America like potential domestic  terrorists. But, curiously, I haven't heard any announcement about how  the DOJ may handle these intimidation tactics aimed directly at Federal  judges.   Washington Democrats have gone out of their way to fuel the  hysterical, potentially dangerous, climate. The President's statement  about the unprecedented leak didn't condemn it. His Press Secretary has  repeatedly appeared to endorse rallies at judge's private family  residences as long as they don't turn into outright violence.   The senior Senator from Massachusetts stood on the Supreme Court  steps and shouted:         We are gonna fight back.    Democrats are renewing their calls to break the Senate in order to  pack the Court. They want to destroy two institutions for the price of  one.   One liberal Georgetown law professor helpfully summarized their  mission as follows: He explained this past weekend that the key moral  difference between this pressure campaign and the January 6 riot is  that, in this case--now listen to this--``the mob is right.''   So what has generated this reckless outrage? What is the Armageddon  over which Democrats want to break the Senate, pack the Court, and  condone potentially illegal rallies outside judges' family homes? Here  is the case in question: whether the State of Mississippi can enact an  abortion law that would still be more liberal--more liberal--than laws  in Germany, France, and Switzerland.   This is the case that is driving these hysterics, the possibility  that abortion laws might begin to move away from China and North Korea  and closer to Germany, France, and Switzerland? That is what has  prompted the calls to destroy our institutions and surround Justices'  family homes. That is why a pro-life nonprofit in Wisconsin got a  Molotov cocktail through its window and activists called for  disruptions of Sunday worship.   Today's Democratic Party is profoundly out of step with the American  people on this issue. Their extreme position ignores modern science and  public opinion.   Leader Schumer wants the Senate to vote again on a Democratic bill  that would effectively legalize abortion-on-demand through all 9  months. Their bill is written to protect abortionists rather than  mothers. It would roll back health regulations. It would attack  America's conscience rights and religious freedoms. It would overturn  modest and overwhelmingly popular safeguards like waiting periods,  informed consent laws, and possibly even parental notification. And it  is written so that, in practice, it would allow elective abortion until  birth.   Democrats' extreme position is radical on a global scale and wildly  unpopular with the American people. Only 34 percent of Americans  believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases into the second  trimester. That drops to 19 percent in the third trimester, but that is  what the Democrats' bill would allow in practice.   Every Senate Democrat but two and every House Democrat except a  handful has put their name on this as cosponsors. That means 97 percent  of Washington Democrats support a position that only 19 percent of  Americans actually want. I will say that again. Ninety-seven percent of  Democrats in Congress are cosponsors of an outcome that has 19 percent  public support.   Notwithstanding inflation, energy insecurity, open borders, a violent  crimewave, and a war in Europe, Democrats want to spend this week  explaining their extremism. Some Democrats even want to try again to  break the Senate in order to ram this through. I have clearly stated I  will never, never support smashing the legislative filibuster on this  issue or any other. Yet Democrats want to wreck our institutions over  their fringe position that Americans do not share.   I can understand why my colleagues want to distract from their  governing record. Their policies have created a living nightmare for  working families. But Democrats' extreme and unpopular position on  abortion is not going to bail them out. It just gives Americans yet  another reminder that the radicals are running the show.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
