 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention  to a serious health crisis in America: the maternal mortality rate in  the country is worse than in the rest of the developed world.   In fact, the United States is the only industrialized nation where  the number of pregnancy-related deaths is on the rise. This is  particularly true for Black women, who are nearly four times more  likely to die from pregnancy complications than White women.   Additionally, The New York Times reported yesterday that Black  infants are now more than twice as likely to die as White infants, a  disparity which is larger now than it was in 1850.   Black Maternal Health Week started yesterday. Today, I stand before  Congress not only to raise awareness, but to encourage my colleagues to  take swift action and fund maternal healthcare clinics in 2019.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, no one in their right mind  should be supporting this cynical and hypocritical Republican balanced  budget amendment. This resolution has been rushed to the floor today  without a single committee hearing.   The don't-tax-but-spend Republicans just exploded the national debt.  They exploded this national debt by nearly $2 trillion with the tax  scam-tax cut bill that dished out a $5.5 trillion gift to big  multinational corporations and to the top 1 percent crowd: $5.5  trillion. Now they come back dumping, like a wheelbarrow full of horse  manure, a radical balanced budget amendment onto this House floor  today.   The Washington Post said that this is like Donald Trump proposing to  lead a campaign to make adultery illegal. I agree with that assessment.   After passing their $5.5 trillion tax cut, and after passage of the  omnibus spending bill that exploded the national debt, the don't-tax- but-spend Republicans are now shamelessly demanding that needy seniors  sacrifice their retirement security to pay for the shameful tax  giveaway to the greedy.   And that is not all. Just this week, the CBO released a report  forecasting annual deficits of $1 trillion or more every single year  that President Trump remains in office.   This Republican hypocrisy has got to stop.   Republican fiscal strategy has three goals: one, cut taxes for the  wealthy; two, keep up the charade that they are fiscally responsible;  and, three, and above all, they want to cut the social safety net. They  want to cut programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and food  stamps, all to pay for their handouts to those who already have plenty.   Enough is enough.   The American people cannot afford Republicans' fiscal hypocrisy any  longer.   Democrats will continue to fight for a better deal for working people  in America: policies that create good-paying jobs, reduce the deficit,  and grow the economy for everyone. Americans deserve a better deal.  They deserve better jobs, better wages, and a better future.
