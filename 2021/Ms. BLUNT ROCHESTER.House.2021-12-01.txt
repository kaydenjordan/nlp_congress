 Madam Speaker, tonight, I am honored to stand  before you to speak on the passage of one of the most transformational  pieces of legislation in a generation signed into law, the bipartisan  infrastructure bill.   In my State of Delaware, this bill will invest $1.2 billion for  highway repair, over $200 million for bridge repair, and over $100  million to expand internet access, and $300 million to expand access to  clean drinking water. But it is more than just concrete and fiber-optic  cables, it is about the faces and places that will benefit from this  bill.   In my State, I think of the students, I think of the farmers, I think  of the union workers whose lives will be improved and whose communities  will forever change. It is about recovering, rebuilding, and restoring  hope.   Madam Speaker, we have more work to do, but make no mistake--with the  bipartisan infrastructure law--we are now on the road to recovery and  on the road to building back better.                            ____________________
