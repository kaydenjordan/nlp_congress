 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  remarkable career of Mrs. Ophelia Gaines, who will retire as executive  director of Concerted Services on June 30, 2017.   Mrs. Gaines' career with Concerted Services, a nonprofit action group  that focuses on fighting poverty throughout 28 counties in southeast  Georgia, has spanned nearly 44 years.   Mrs. Gaines began her work with the company in 1973, traveling door  to door in low-income communities, educating families on how to enroll  in programs like Head Start, Energy Assistance, and Senior Nutrition.   Mrs. Gaines' altruistic career continued with her decision to teach  social work classes at both Georgia Southern University and Savannah  State University, enabling young people to carry on her work throughout  southeast Georgia.   I am proud to rise today to recognize Mrs. Gaines, and thank her for  all of her outstanding contributions to our local communities and to  the lives of our fellow Georgians.                            ____________________
