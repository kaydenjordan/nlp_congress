 Mr. Speaker, 343 firefighters, 70 law enforcement  officers, and 8 emergency medical technicians. Seventeen years ago our  Nation was changed forever. While the Twin Towers burned, thousands of  first responders rushed to save the lives of their fellow citizens,  knowing the dangers ahead; 421 first responders made the ultimate  sacrifice that day. Side by side, they climbed 110 flights of stairs,  in nearly 70 pounds of gear. It was the largest high-rise rescue  operation in history.   ``We climb because they climbed.''   In an inspiring, touching tribute this Saturday, hundreds of our  local first responders will take part in the annual Central New York  Memorial Stair Climb. Wearing the same 70 pounds of gear, they will  make the same climb at the Utica State Office Building to keep the  memory of our fallen heroes alive.   Mr. Speaker, in the face of the worst of humanity, our Nation saw the  best of humanity in those brave men and women. Let us never forget  their selfless sacrifice.                            ____________________
