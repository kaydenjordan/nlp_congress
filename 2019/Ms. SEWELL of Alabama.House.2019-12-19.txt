 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support  of this trade deal. I was honored that Speaker Pelosi asked me to join  the Democratic Trade Working Group.   We, the Gang of 8, along with you, Mr. Chairman, worked tirelessly  for 6 months, negotiating with Bob Lighthizer, the U.S. Ambassador on  trade. We took what was a very weak and unenforceable trade deal and  made it into a renegotiated trade agreement that will protect American  workers and businesses.   This bill we vote on today is a renegotiated USMCA. I am particularly  proud that the working group won two major concessions on enforcement.  First, we closed the panel-blocking loophole and created a strong  state-to-state mechanism for enforcement. Second, we created a first- of-its-kind rapid response mechanism to improve labor enforcement in  Mexico.   This deal is a win for the Steelworkers and Teamsters in my Alabama  district. It is a win for the automobile manufacturers and steel  industry in the State of Alabama. It is a win for Alabama farmers and  agriculture producers.   This renegotiated trade agreement is a much-improved North American  Free Trade Agreement, and it is because of that that I ask my fellow  colleagues to support it.   Madam Speaker, I, again, thank Chairman Neal, Speaker of the House  Nancy Pelosi, my fellow Gang of 8 working group members, as well as Bob  Lighthizer, and our especially hardworking staff. I thank, especially,  Katherine Tai and my own staffer, Rob Nuttall, for all of their hard  work on getting us there.   I do believe that this is a win for everyone, and I urge my  colleagues to support this new, renegotiated USMCA.
