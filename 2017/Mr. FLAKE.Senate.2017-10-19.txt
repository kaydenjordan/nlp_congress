 Mr. President, this amendment would set up a deficit- neutral reserve fund relating to making the American tax system simpler  and fairer for all Americans.   Not only do we need to do tax reform, but we need to do it urgently.  It has been more than 30 years since we have reformed the Tax Code in  any significant way. We have more preferences and loopholes and  deductions out there than we know what to do with. In fact, if we total  all of them together, there are more expenditures in the Tax Code, or  money avoiding coming to Washington--tax avoidance--than we spend on  our entire discretionary budget. It is about $1.26 trillion annually.   So we have to have a code where we lower the rates and broaden the  base. Broadening the base means going after some of these popular  loopholes and deductions and preferences that make the Tax Code a lot  bigger and scarier and more complicated than it should be.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). Who yields time in opposition?    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.
