 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for being so  eloquent on where we are today.   Let me read the headline of this legislation, H. Con. Res. 40,  expressing support for local law enforcement officers. Broadly  supported all across America.   Every day we are supporting our local law enforcement, but as well we  are supporting our Federal law enforcement that are right in my  district today holding a meeting, men and women who put their lives on  the line.   I don't know why we couldn't on this last day of National Police  Week, as we began the week, as I indicated, and repeat over and over  again, that I was there for this ceremony that I have gone to every  year, which has honored those who have fallen in battle.   They had everyone represented. Everyone was in brotherhood and  sisterhood. Everyone was embracing families and those in law  enforcement. No one asked for your Democratic ticket or your Republican  ticket. All they were grateful for is you had come to honor and  recognize the importance of the work that they do.   This could have been a place where we showed to the Nation the  reasoning of our hearts and our minds.   I offered an amendment to include Federal law enforcement. How dare  we ignore them on this day?   We cannot ignore January 6. We cannot ignore the Capitol Police,  along with those who came to help, who will always have the scars of  that horrific day.   Why? Because we have never seen in our modern-day eyes an attack on  the United States Capitol that was not in war.    Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to say, yes, I  support local law enforcement. Never have my lips ever said the words  that would take dollars away from those personnel, their salaries, and  all that they need to do.  [[Page H2438]]    I don't know why in a resolution that speaks about honor that we have  to mix not even apples and oranges but apples and stench. There is no  reason to attack anyone in this. Put a resolution about how much you  hate the folks on the other side of the aisle; we will debate that. I  don't hate them.   What we tried to do in committee is to say let us make this a  resolution, Federal, State and local folk, and let us not talk about  folk who are dismantling anything because I don't know Democrats who  stood outside of a DA's office and tried to dismantle them. They have  an independent decision, right, to make. They are elected by the  people. If they are not at the level that the people want, they are  gone.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to amend this from the floor. Let  this be an amendment that we can all vote for. This is my last word: I  support local and Federal law enforcement.    Mr. Speaker, I support Federal, State and local law  enforcement. I support those that are in my district right now.   I would offer to say, aren't we examples for young people?   Don't we want our children to raise up and support law enforcement  and see all of us standing together and not dividing?   Don't we want good policing, good police relationships?   None of that is a divide. It is a unity, and it represents the  Constitution of the United States of America.   I tell you that the officers that I engage with believe in it. I ask  my colleagues to decide to do something better than this legislation.                                time  1000
