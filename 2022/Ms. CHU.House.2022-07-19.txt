 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Respect  for Marriage Act to enshrine the right to marry the person you love  under Federal law by repealing the discriminatory Defense of Marriage  Act.   In the wake of the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade, the  doors have been swung wide open for unelected judges to further strip  protections from the American people.   This crucial bill reaffirms our commitment to a promise of equality  for all, erasing further discrimination still on the books against  same-sex marriage, and protecting the constitutional right to marriage  equality, including interracial marriage. We will not allow the clock  to be rolled back even further.    Mr. Speaker, it is imperative we pass the Respect for Marriage Act.
