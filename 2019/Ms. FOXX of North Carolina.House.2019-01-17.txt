 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  his leadership over the years on the issue of life.   Madam Speaker, in recognition of the anniversary of Roe v. Wade this  coming Tuesday, I want to bring the real impetus of the pro-life  movement to the forefront of civil discourse.   The pro-life movement fights to protect life, from conception until  natural death, and we stand ready to support mothers who face the  challenges of an unexpected pregnancy. We also know that abortion is  immoral and permitting it deeply wounds our society. The cause for life  deserves to be heard this week.   Lately, though, there have been nuanced attempts by the left to  hijack the meaning of pro-life and impose upon it a Big Government  agenda.   We can all agree that the illegal ending of a life through violence  is tragic and wrong. The reason the pro-life movement opposes Roe v.  Wade is because the U.S. Supreme Court case permits the legal killing  of our Nation's most vulnerable.   The pro-life movement is at the forefront of human dignity. We know  that upholding human dignity requires that people be able to meet their  needs for housing, education, and nutrition. However, the public  policies that lead to the optimal conditions for human flourishing are  worthy of their own debates, so let's leave aside the straw-man tactics  and have debates on those policies at the appropriate time.   This week, we are talking about the inalienable right to life, from  conception until natural death.   To all who are fighting to protect life, know that I am proud of you  and behind you 100 percent. As the 46th Annual March for Life takes  place in Washington this week, I am sure the country will need look no  further than the witnesses marching to the Supreme Court for an  accurate understanding of what we pro-lifers are all about.
