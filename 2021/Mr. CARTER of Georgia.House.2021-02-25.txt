 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor a great Georgian and a great American, William ``Will'' Howard  Ingram II of Richmond Hill, who tragically passed away at the age of  43.   Will lived a successful life and began his career in the military  after remarkably receiving appointments to all three of the United  States service academies. He was a 1999 graduate of West Point.   After he honorably served his country as an Army officer, Will went  on to earn a graduate degree from the University of Washington.  Following his Active Duty service, he went on to serve his country as  an Army civilian for over 15 years.   During that time, he served as the chief of master planning for the  Army's 3rd Infantry Division for several years before he took on  responsibility as the chief of operation and maintenance at Fort  Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield.   Among all of his many accomplishments, Will was most proud of his  son, Gabe.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all who  knew him, during this most difficult time.                       Recognizing Sheriff Clyde Smith     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  longest-serving public servant in Bryan County and a great American.  Longtime Bryan County Sheriff Clyde Smith recently retired after more  than 54 years in law enforcement.   Sheriff Smith's exceptional career was highlighted when he was  presented with the key to the city of Richmond Hill by Mayor Russ  Carpenter. The key to the city is the highest honor Richmond Hill can  give, and it was presented in recognition of Sheriff Smith's honest and  faithful service to the citizens of Richmond Hill and Bryan County.   Sheriff Smith began his career in law enforcement in Savannah,  Georgia, and he positively impacted every resident and business owner  there from the start. He is a man marked by his bravery and compassion,  and he is the epitome of a dedicated public servant.   I would like to express my appreciation for the work Sheriff Smith  did throughout his career, and I wish him the best as he begins his  retirement.                             Honoring Betty Miner     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor Betty Miner of Richmond Hill, who, sadly, passed away at the age  of 87.   Betty lived a remarkable life and touched countless lives. She was a  lifelong resident of Richmond Hill and became the first woman council  member for the city in 1971. Betty also served as mayor pro tem.   In addition to her work to lead and improve Richmond Hill, she served  on the DNR board for the State of Georgia, for which she was  instrumental in bringing the fisherman's co-op to Bryan County.   Through every position she had, she worked to better her community  and every life she touched.   My thoughts and prayers go out to her family, friends, and all who  knew her, during this most difficult time.                  Recognizing Ford Avenue Historic District     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Ford Avenue Historic District in an officially designated area in the  city of Richmond Hill.   After 2 years of planning, the Richmond Hill City Council approved an  amendment to an ordinance creating the city's first historic district  on January 5.   The Ford Avenue Historic District is at the heart of Richmond Hill's  history and contains primary locations and buildings Ford Motor Company  built between 1925 and 1947.   When Henry Ford came to Richmond Hill, the town was known as Ways  Station. Upon his arrival, the town grew and become known as Richmond  Hill. You can feel the history simply walking down the street.   Mr. Speaker, designating this remarkable historic district is just  another positive effort by the city to promote, protect, and remember  its roots. I am thankful for the Richmond Hill City Council's diligent  work on this and everything they do.                            ____________________
