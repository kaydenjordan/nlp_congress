 Mr. Speaker, waters of the United States, or WOTUS, has  been a thorn in the side of Americans, especially our farmers, since  its introduction. WOTUS is a rule issued under the Clean Water Act by  the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers designed to redefine the scope of  waters protected and regulated by the Federal Government.   WOTUS would grant the Federal Government regulatory power over  virtually any place where water flows in the United States; that  includes ditches, puddles, streams, or any manmade constructions, you  name it. If enacted, it would undermine the rights of States, local  governments and landowners, and create more red tape, preventing  economic growth and jobs, particularly in the agriculture industry. If  it sounds ridiculous, that is because it is.   WOTUS was flawed from the beginning. It has been held up in the  courts since 2015.   To ensure WOTUS never sees the light of day and completely eliminate  the potential of it becoming a reality, I introduced legislation to  repeal this harmful rule.   I look forward to working with President Trump and my colleagues on  this very important issue.                            ____________________
