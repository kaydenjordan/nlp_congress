 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this  resolution that requires every House Member and employee to complete  antiharassment, antidiscrimination training. The first commonsense step  is to make this training mandatory.   I introduced a bill a month ago and gathered over 100 cosponsors,  Democrats and Republicans, to make sexual harassment training mandatory  in the House, Senate, and support offices. I am glad the Senate has  required training with this resolution, and now the  [[Page H9497]]  House must do the same. When women are at the table, Mr. Chairman, I am  glad to say the conversation changes, and the voices in Congress of  women have changed the conversation here.   It is important that we must do all that we can to improve the  congressional workforce, reform our outdated processes, and I support  this legislation to address this issue, and I know that my Members of  Congress will do the same today.
