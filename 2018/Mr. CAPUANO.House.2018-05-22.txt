 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   There are some good things in this bill. I wanted to work with all of  you to enshrine the good things and get rid of the bad things. We all  did. We all offered it for years because Dodd-Frank is a good law, but  it needs amending. We all agree. The limits are on it. We all have  admitted that we just kind of picked them at the time. We were in a  hurry, in a rush. But the amnesia around this place, I guess, is  endemic.   Maybe it is hard for you today to look people in the eye and say:  Gee, maybe you can't afford that loan.   But, for me, the hardest thing was looking people in the eye and  saying: I am sorry you are losing your home. I am sorry you are losing  your job. I am sorry your kids can't go to college because the economy  just collapsed.   The numbers are the numbers. But didn't you get those phone calls?  Didn't you hear from any of your constituents?   And what was your answer? Oh, the regulatory system is terrible.   You didn't answer that. You tried to help, and you couldn't because  the economy had gone down the toilet.   If this bill passes, which it will--I know you wouldn't come to the  floor unless you had the votes. I know that. I can count. When people  ask you the next time we have an economic collapse, when they ask you  what happened, here is the only answer you are going to be able to give  them: I voted for this bill today.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, the details of this bill, getting rid of  HMDA requirements, do you not care about discrimination? Do you not  recognize that it is real and that it exists? But, apparently, you  don't care.   Do you not care that your constituents had their information sold out  from under them and then not protected? But now you are going to give  free credit monitoring only for people in the military--not for your  mother, not for your sister, not for your student children, just for  the military.   The bill has some good provisions in it. I am happy to work with you  on some of these.   This bill goes too far, and you are responsible.
