 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to celebrate and honor our  brave men and women in law enforcement who paid the ultimate price to  protect and serve our communities and preserve our American way of  life.   In our Nation's Capital, there is a 304-foot-long wall, the National  Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, that features the names of more than  22,000 officers who sacrificed themselves in the line of duty. Beyond  this magnificent architecture, the legacy of service, dedication, and  hard work remains etched in every American heart and  [[Page H2414]]  continues to inspire generations of police officers.   Throughout our Nation, our men and women in blue risk their lives to  fight crime, respond to emergencies, and keep our communities safe.   During National Police Week, I highlight courageous officers who have  gone above and beyond to serve others.   The Riverton Police Department recently recognized the Violent  Fugitive Apprehension and Suppression Team, VFAST, as Partner of the  Year. It deploys innovative investigative methods to apprehend violent  fugitives.                                time  1930    Officer Kevin Salmon, a combat veteran and a Purple Heart recipient,  received the inaugural Fraternal Order of Police officer wellness award  due to his pioneering work to promote the wellness, the mental and  physical health of his fellow officers.   The team at the Unified Police Department of Greater Salt Lake has  built a relationship of trust and confidence between law enforcement  officers and the Salt Lake community to help at-risk youth pursue life- changing academic and professional opportunities.   Detective Marisha Manzano is a beloved member of the Herriman police  force dedicated to quality education, welfare, and safety of students  in her role as a school resource officer at Copper Mountain Middle  School in Herriman, Utah.   The Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force established by  Saratoga Springs is at the forefront of the battle against human  traffickers and online predators.   It has been the honor of a lifetime to represent and champion the  extraordinary police forces in my district and throughout the country.  We began our Nation with certain promises--the promise of life,  liberty, and pursuit of happiness--and that can only happen in an  environment of safety. The fact that we have the most robust middle  class, the biggest dreamers, the most innovative States in the world  today is because we have a nation of safety.   I thank all those who have given their lives, given their efforts to  get up every single morning to go out and protect this Nation and come  back home to their family knowing they have done their job to make sure  we stay safe.   To all my friends in law enforcement, thank you for all you do and  happy National Police Week.
