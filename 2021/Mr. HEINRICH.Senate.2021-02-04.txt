 Mr. President, my friend from Wyoming and I disagree on  many things. We disagree on the impact of this policy in the immediate,  and we disagree on the speed of the energy transition to a zero-carbon  economy.   What we do not disagree about is that these communities we support-- we support their schools, and throughout this transition we should  support the people who have kept the lights on and made this country  the greatest energy country on the face of the Earth.   So I would support this amendment because it is about supporting the  schools in those communities.                          Vote on Amendment No. 653
