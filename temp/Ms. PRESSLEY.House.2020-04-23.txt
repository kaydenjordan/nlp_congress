 Madam Speaker, families are in crisis, food pantry  lines around the block, rent is due again in 8 days. The community  health centers and hospital workers in my district are desperate. This  is a crisis within a crisis, exacerbating every inequity that already  existed. This Chamber will determine how many more lives we are robbed  of. Now is not the time for a back-pass.   Our Nation is crying out. The people are crying out, and we must  answer their cries in the CARES package with a bill that puts the  people first. Now is not the time to rest. We took an oath. People are  counting on us. They deserve healthcare and economic housing justice.  We cannot continue to leave out our immigrant neighbors and minority- owned small businesses.
