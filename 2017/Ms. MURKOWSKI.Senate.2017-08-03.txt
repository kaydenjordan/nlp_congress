 Mr. President, we are considering the nomination of  Dan Brouillette to be the Deputy Secretary for the Department of  Energy. Mr. Brouillette has a long history of distinguished service to  our Nation. He is a veteran. He has served in the Department of Energy.  He has been the staff director for the House Energy and Commerce  Committee. More recently, he has held high-level posts in the private  sector--first, as vice president at Ford, currently as senior vice  president at USAA.   He has strong experience and thorough knowledge of the Department he  has chosen to return to. He understands the work that its thousands of  scientists undertake and the importance of maximizing their research  efforts, especially in a time of constrained Federal budgets.   He recognizes the importance of our 17 National Labs and the  Department's responsibility for environmental management, including the  cleanup of Cold War-era legacy sites. As second in command to Secretary  Perry, Mr. Brouillette will oversee programs critical to our Nation's  cyber security, energy innovation, and scientific discovery.   Based on his hearings before the Energy and Natural Resources  Committee, I am confident he is up for the challenge and ready for this  role. I would urge all of my colleagues to support the nomination of  Dan Brouillette to be the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Energy.   Mr. President, I yield all time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.   The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the  Brouillette nomination?    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Young). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session for the en bloc consideration of the  following nominations: Executive Calendar Nos. 101 and 102.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   The clerk will report the nominations en bloc.   The legislative clerk read the nominations of Neil Chatterjee, of  Kentucky, to be a Member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  for the term expiring June 30, 2021; and Robert F. Powelson, of  Pennsylvania, to be a Member of the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission for the term expiring June 30, 2020.   Thereupon, the Senate proceeded to consider the nominations en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  vote on the nominations en bloc with no intervening action or debate;  that if confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table en bloc; that the President be immediately notified  of the Senate's action; that no further motions be in order; that any  statements relating to the nominations be printed in the Record; and  that the Senate then resume legislative session.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the Chatterjee  and Powelson nominations en bloc?   The nominations were confirmed en bloc.    Mr. President, I want to take just a moment and thank  those who have worked so hard to make sure that the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission will have a functioning quorum--and more than  just having a functioning quorum, the quality of individuals we are  sending to the FERC as Commissioners is truly impressive to see.   Neil Chatterjee, whom, without doubt, almost all of us on this floor  know, has been working here in the Senate, working in the leader's  office for years, and has been an invaluable asset to me and my staff  on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He is extremely  knowledgeable, extremely committed and dedicated, and it has been a  real pleasure to work with him.   I don't know Mr. Powelson as well, but having had an opportunity to  advance his name before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee for  confirmation, too, I know that the expertise and the credentials he  will bring to the Commission are greatly appreciated.   I think we recognize that there is much we are anxious to see happen  throughout the country in a new administration where we are talking a  lot about infrastructure--when we are talking about our energy assets  and what we can do to help facilitate the build-out of an aging  infrastructure and the add-on of new infrastructure. But in order to  proceed with much of this, you have to have the FERC actually  operating, working to review the permits, working through the rate- making cases. It is substantive work, it is challenging work, and it is  work that has now been stacked up for months and months. So knowing  that the FERC will be able to commence its operations again with a  quorum is really good news today.   I think it is also important to note that the White House sent just  this week two additional names--those of Mr. Glick and Mr. McIntyre.  The Energy and Natural Resources Committee will be considering those in  early September when we return so that, hopefully, we can get a full  complement to this very important Commission.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Richard Glick and Kevin McIntyre have  been nominated by the President for positions on the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission. I understand they will be heard and marked up in  tandem in September and I have told the Democratic leader that they  will move as a pair across the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.

Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Around the world, women remain under-represented in       conflict prevention, conflict resolution, and post-conflict       peace building efforts.        (2) Women in conflict-affected regions have achieved       significant success in--        (A) moderating violent extremism;        (B) countering terrorism;        (C) resolving disputes through nonviolent mediation and       negotiation; and        (D) stabilizing societies by enhancing the effectiveness of       security services, peacekeeping efforts, institutions, and       decisionmaking processes.  [[Page S4890]]         (3) Research suggests that peace negotiations are more       likely to succeed and to result in durable peace agreements       when women participate in the peace process.

It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the meaningful participation of women in conflict       prevention and conflict resolution processes helps to promote       more inclusive and democratic societies and is critical to       the long-term stability of countries and regions;        (2) the political participation, and leadership of women in       fragile environments, particularly during democratic       transitions, is critical to sustaining lasting democratic       institutions; and        (3) the United States should be a global leader in       promoting the meaningful participation of women in conflict       prevention, management, and resolution, and post-conflict       relief and recovery efforts.       SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as ``The American Legion 100th       Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds that--  [[Page S4893]]         (1) on March 15, 1919, The American Legion was founded in       Paris, France, by members of the American Expeditionary Force       occupying Europe after World War I and concerned about the       welfare of their comrades and communities upon their return       to the United States;        (2) on September 16, 1919, Congress chartered The American       Legion, which quickly grew to become the largest veterans       service organization in the United States;        (3) The American Legion conferences in Washington, DC, in       1923 and 1924 crafted the first United States Flag Code,       which was adopted in schools, States, cities and counties       prior to being enacted in 1942, establishing the proper use,       display, and respect for the colors of the United States;        (4) during World War II, The American Legion developed and       presented to Congress its case for vastly improved support       for medically discharged, disabled veterans, which ultimately       became the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 (58 Stat.       284; chapter 268), better known as the G.I. Bill of Rights,       and was drafted by former American Legion National Commander       Harry W. Colmery in Washington's Mayflower Hotel;        (5) through the leadership and advocacy of The American       Legion, the G.I. Bill was enacted in June 1944, which led to       monumental changes in United States society, including the       democratization of higher education, home ownership for       average people in the United States, better VA hospitals,       business and farm loans for veterans, and the ability to       appeal conditions of military discharge;        (6) defying those who argued the G.I. Bill would break the       Treasury, according to various researchers, the G.I. Bill       provided a tremendous return on investment of $7 to the       United States economy for every $1 spent on the program,       triggering a half-century of prosperity in the United States;        (7) after Hurricane Hugo in 1989, The American Legion       established the National Emergency Fund to provide immediate       cash relief for veterans who have been affected by natural       disasters;        (8) American Legion National Emergency Fund grants after       Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, for instance, exceeded       $1,700,000;        (9) The American Legion fought to see the Veterans       Administration elevated to Cabinet-level status as the       Department of Veterans Affairs, ensuring support for veterans       would be set at the highest level of the Federal Government,       as a priority issue for the President;        (10) after a decades-long struggle to improve the       adjudication process for veterans disputing claims decisions,       The American Legion helped shape and introduce the Veterans       Reassurance Act to create a venue for judicial review of       veterans' appeals;        (11) building on these efforts, legislation was passed in       1988 to create the United States Court of Veterans Appeals,       today known as the United States Court of Appeals for       Veterans Claims;        (12) The American Legion created the American Legacy       Scholarship Fund for children of military members killed on       active duty on or after September 11, 2001;        (13) in 2016, The American Legion's National Executive       Committee amended the original scholarship criteria to       include children of veterans with 50 percent or greater VA       disability ratings;        (14) President George W. Bush signed into law the Post-9/11       Veterans Educational Assistance Act (title V of the       Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2008; 122 Stat. 2357), a       next-generation G.I. Bill strongly supported by The American       Legion and the most comprehensive educational benefits       package since the original G.I. Bill of Rights was enacted in       1944;        (15) in August 2018, The American Legion will begin its       centennial recognition at the 100th National Convention in       Minneapolis, Minnesota, the site of the first American Legion       National Convention; and        (16) in March 2019, the organization will celebrate its       100th birthday in Paris, France, and September 16, 2019, will       mark the 100th anniversary of The American Legion's Federal       charter.       SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.
