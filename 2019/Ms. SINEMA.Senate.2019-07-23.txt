 Mr. President, I am honored to rise to deliver my maiden  speech as the senior U.S. Senator from the great State of Arizona. I  was sworn in to this distinguished body just over 6 months ago. I am  incredibly honored and humbled to join only a dozen others who have had  the honor of representing the great State 48 in the U.S. Senate, and I  am filled with gratitude to the people of the State who have entrusted  me with this duty. In continuing the work of leaders who have held the  Senate seat, from Senators Barry Goldwater and Dennis DeConcini to,  most recently, Senators Jon Kyl and Jeff Flake, I have pledged to  uphold Arizona's proud tradition of putting country above party.   Most new Senators deliver their maiden speeches soon after being  sworn in. I have waited so I could use these 6 months to demonstrate to  Arizonans, in actions more than words, exactly how I intend to serve  our State in the Senate. I promised Arizona that I would do things  differently than have others in Washington.   Americans see a lot of chaos in this city. There is intense pressure  from all sides to spend time and energy on every scandal, every insult,  every tweet, and every partisan fight, and it is very easy to get  distracted. It is the simplest thing in the world to line up on either  side of a partisan battle. What is harder, though, is to ignore the  chaos and get out of our comfort zones to build coalitions and get  things done. I promised Arizona I would do the hard work, and that  approach has produced results.   In these first 6 months, two bills I have sponsored to improve  protections and services for veterans have passed the Senate and the  House, and they now await the President's signature to put them into  law. These new measures expand American Legion membership to veterans  across the country, protect veterans from scam artists, and help  veterans achieve the dream of home ownership. Few efforts better  illustrate my approach to service or are more worthy of our attention  than that of the Somers family.   As a Congresswoman, I shared the story of SGT Daniel Somers on the  floor of the U.S. House, and I will now share that story for the first  time on the floor of the Senate.   Sergeant Somers was an Arizona Army veteran who served two tours in  Iraq. He served on Task Force Lightning, an intelligence unit, and ran  more than 400 combat missions as a machine gunner in the turret of a  humvee. Part of his role required him to interrogate dozens of terror  suspects. His work was deemed classified.   Like many veterans, Sergeant Somers was haunted by the war when he  returned home. He suffered from flashbacks, nightmares, depression, and  other symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder--all made worse by a  traumatic brain injury. Sergeant Somers needed help.   He and his family did what all families who face similar challenges  are urged to do--they asked for help. Yet, when the VA's answer came,  it demonstrated exactly what happens when America's veterans are left  behind. The VA enrolled Sergeant Somers in group  [[Page S4990]]  therapy sessions--sessions he could not attend for fear of his  disclosing classified information. Despite repeated requests for  individualized counseling or some other reasonable accommodation to  allow Sergeant Somers to receive appropriate care for his PTSD, the VA  delayed in its providing him with suitable support and care.   Like many veterans, Sergeant Somers' isolation got worse when he  transitioned to civilian life. He tried to provide for his family, but  he was unable to work due to his disability. He struggled with the VA  bureaucracy. His disability appeal had been pending for more than 2  years without there having been any resolution, and he didn't get the  help he needed in time.   On June 10 of 2013, Sergeant Somers wrote a letter to his family.   He wrote:         I am not getting better. I am not going to get better. And       I will most certainly deteriorate further as time goes on.    He went on to write:         I am left with basically nothing. Too trapped in a war to       be at peace. Too damaged to be at war. Abandoned by those who       would take the easy route and a liability to those who stick       it out and thus deserve better. So you see, not only am I       better off dead, but the world is better without me in it.       This is what brought me to my actual final mission.    On that day, we lost SGT Daniel Somers to suicide.   Americans who return home from having served our Nation must always  have somewhere to turn for support. I am committed to ensuring that no  veteran feels trapped like Sergeant Somers did and that all of our  veterans have access to appropriate mental health care.   Sergeant Somers' story will sound too familiar to too many military  families. Perhaps less common is the astonishing bravery that had been  demonstrated by Sergeant Somers' parents, Howard and Jean, after their  son's death.    Howard and Jean are in the Senate's Gallery today, and I am so  honored to have them here as I share their son's story.   Howard and Jean were devastated by the loss of their son, and nobody  would have blamed them if they had turned inward to deal with their  grief, but they didn't. Howard and Jean faced the world and bravely  shared SGT Daniel Somers' story, and they have created a mission of  their own. Their mission is to ensure that Sergeant Somers' story  brings to light America's deadliest war--the 20 veterans we lose to  suicide in this country every day.   While I served in the U.S. House, I worked closely with Howard and  Jean to develop and pass into law the Daniel Somers Classified Veterans  Access to Care Act, which is legislation that ensures veterans who  serve in a classified capacity receive behavioral health services in an  appropriate care setting.   Now it is time to take the next innovative step in providing the  support our servicemembers and veterans have earned, for  servicemembers' loved ones are not always aware of the resources that  are available to them--resources that can prove to be critical when  those servicemembers encounter challenges during Active Duty or after  their separations from the military.   The Somers' family and I have worked over the past several months  with the Department of Defense on new legislation to create a network  of support for our military members. In May, I introduced the  bipartisan Sergeant Daniel Somers Network of Support Act, which was  cosponsored by my friend and colleague on the Veterans' Affairs  Committee, Republican Senator Thom Tillis. Our legislation requires  each new servicemember be asked for the names of loved ones whom he or  she considers to be part of his or her network of support. In return,  the Department of Defense and the Red Cross will provide information  about benefits and services that are available to military members.   By engaging loved ones and families from the beginning, the  Department of Defense can better prepare and equip our military  families and friends to better understand military life, to notice when  servicemembers are in need, and to help ensure that servicemembers get  the right kind of assistance or care. We must do everything possible to  empower family and friends, who are the first line of defense in our  preventing suicide amongst our veterans and servicemembers.   This commonsense solution could be a game-changer for the men and  women who have risked their lives to protect our freedoms, for their  isolation leads to tragedy. We have worked with Congressman Scott  Peters, of California, who has introduced companion legislation in the  U.S. House. In working as a team across party lines, we successfully  included our network of support legislation in the national defense  bill that was passed by both the Senate and the House over the past few  weeks.   I am proud of this accomplishment, but we have so much more to do.  When servicemembers transition from active service to veteran status,  they face old and confusing regulations that can be difficult to  navigate even for those who are able to care for themselves. We must  ensure that veterans who receive care from the VA also have a network  of support in place to help them thrive and prosper when they return to  civilian life. I have spoken directly with VA Secretary Robert Wilkie,  who expressed his support for extending the network of support to  veterans, and I look forward to working closely with him to get it  done.   As we continue this work, I urge my colleagues to join me in  expanding this critical program. We can help ensure together that all  veterans have networks to turn to so they never have to face their  challenges alone.   The story of Sergeant Somers and his parents, the failure of the VA  bureaucracy to provide the support this Arizona veteran needed, and the  resulting tragedy is not a story that dominated the national headlines.  It is not a political scandal, and it is not a partisan food fight to  which Members of Congress are pressured to respond. It is not what  reporters in the Capitol's hallways ask me about, and it is not what  people tweet to me on a daily or on even an hourly basis. You will  never see a push notification on your iPhone about legislation like  ours. Yet this is the kind of work that matters. It matters to Sergeant  Somers' parents, and it matters to veterans across my State. It matters  to military families and to loved ones, and it matters to Arizona. It  is exactly why, as Arizona's senior Senator, I will not spend my time  focusing on areas of disagreement, because expending energy on the  latest tweet, on the latest insult, and on petty politics simply  doesn't move the needle for everyday people like the Somers.   As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am fortunate to  serve with Republican Chairman Johnny Isakson and Ranking Member Jon  Tester--two Senators who demonstrate every day what can get done when  leaders put aside their differences and work toward common goals. Our  bipartisan legislation got this far thanks in part to support from  Senators Isakson and Tester, as well as from the leaders of the Armed  Services Committee, Chairman James Inhofe and Ranking Member Jack Reed.  However, in this effort and in so many others, I sorely miss the  leadership of the former Armed Services chairman and my personal hero,  John McCain.   So many of my colleagues in this body came to know and love Senator  John McCain for his military heroism and for his years of leadership in  the Senate. Back home in Arizona, Senator John McCain is also a hero  for what he represented in public service.   What Senator McCain said in his last speech in this very Chamber  shapes my service to Arizona every day. He said:         But make no mistake, my service here is the most important       job I have had in my life. And I am so grateful to the people       of Arizona for the privilege--for the honor--of serving here       and the opportunities it gives me to play a small role in the       history of the country I love.    He went on to say:         Merely preventing your political opponents from doing what       they want isn't the most inspiring work. There's greater       satisfaction in respecting our differences, but not letting       them prevent agreements that don't require abandonment of       core principles, agreements made in good faith that help       improve lives and protect the American people. . . . What a       great honor and extraordinary opportunity it is to serve in       this body.    Senator McCain talked of what is possible when the Senate works the  way it was meant to work. He stood for everything we stand for as  Arizonans: fighting for what you believe in, standing up for what is  right even if you stand alone, and serving a cause greater than one's  self.  [[Page S4991]]    He taught us to always assume the best in others, to seek compromise  instead of sowing division, and to always put country ahead of party.   One of Senator McCain's last acts in the Senate was to shepherd last  year's annual Defense bill into law--the same annual bill which, this  year, includes our Daniel Somers Network of Support Act. I hope we are  making Senator McCain proud with such important work.   With Senator McCain's example lighting the way, and with the trust of  the people of Arizona shaping my service, I recommit to ignoring  political games and focusing on upholding Arizona values to get things  done for the State and for the country I love.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
