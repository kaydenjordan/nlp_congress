 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it is an honor to speak today in support  of three historic, highly qualified nominees to serve 6 million Ohioans  in the Northern District of Ohio on the Federal bench. Each of these  nominees brings with them not only impressive legal credentials but  also diverse life experiences, empathy, and a deep commitment to  justice that will make them excellent district judges. It is why  Senator Portman and I together recommended these nominees to President  Biden. It is why each of them was voted out of the Senate Judiciary  Committee with bipartisan support. I urge my colleagues on the floor to  support them.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring the life of a lifelong champion for American workers across  the country, the founder and longtime president of the Pension Rights  Center, Karen Ferguson.    Karen came to Washington, DC, in the early 1970s to work with Ralph  Nader as a public interest lawyer, fighting for consumers and workers  against unchecked corporate power. As one of ``Nader's Raiders,'' she  found her calling. Recognizing the void of public advocacy for retirees  and pensioners, Karen founded the Pension Rights Center in 1976. This  marked the beginning of a crusade that lasted more than four decades,  on behalf of pensioners who so often did not have much of a voice in  their own government. Over the next 45 years, Karen personally assisted  thousands of workers who were denied the retirement benefits they  earned, and she advocated for retirement security for millions more.    As one of our country's leading experts on pension law and a  passionate advocate for workers and their families, Karen was a source  of strength and guidance to her allies in Congress for decades. She was  instrumental to the passage of a number of reforms that improved the  cause of retirement security, including the Retirement Equity Act of  1984, a critical law that provided benefits to millions of widows and  divorced women.    Most recently, Karen was a leader in the fight to protect and  restore multiemployer pension benefits for millions of union members  across the country, including 100,000 Ohioans. She worked directly with  my office to help draft the Butch Lewis Act and fought for years  alongside Mr. Lewis, his widow and leader in her own right, Rita Lewis,  and other workers, families, and small businesses, for its passage.  Because of their advocacy, we were finally able to pass the Butch Lewis  Emergency Pension Plan Relief Act into law as part of the American  Rescue Plan in 2021. We were successful in no small part due to the  unwavering support she provided. Now, more than a million Americans who  have worked hard all their lives and gave up raises at the bargaining  table in order to put that money toward retirement are no longer at  risk of losing the benefits they earned. And many American businesses-- often small, family-owned businesses--will be able to continue to  support their workers and grow and create more good, union jobs.    Karen Ferguson will be remembered for a lifetime of service on  behalf of workers and their families, and the compassion and skill she  brought to our efforts. Her legacy will continue through the millions  of past, current, and future workers and their families who will have a  more secure retirement thanks to her work.                            ____________________
