 Mr. Speaker, I stand with the New Jersey delegation. I  rise today to mark the passing of my predecessor and my friend,  Congressman Herb Klein. Herb only served one term in this institution,  but he was a giant for north Jersey.   Our communities are tight-knit, hardscrabble, fiercely loyal, and  Herb embodied those qualities. It was Herb who laid the groundwork for  what Passaic County is today. He helped build it.   Herb Klein was a brilliant lawyer and remarkable public servant and a  great human being. He was always accessible and always available.   Over the years, I cannot count the number of times I called on Herb  for his wisdom. I will miss his counsel, and I will miss his  friendship.   We send our love and admiration to Herb's family, Roger, and all the  kids and friends, in their time of mourning.   I ask the House to join me in a moment of silence in memory of Herb  Klein.                            ____________________
