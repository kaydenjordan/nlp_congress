 Madam Speaker, happy 100th anniversary  to the Reserve Organization of America, formerly known as the Reserve  Officers Association of the United States.   As the only organization solely dedicated to supporting the Reserve  components at all ranks of all services, the ROA is a professional  association that supports the rights and benefits of its members and  their families, promoting national security.   I know firsthand the effectiveness of ROA, having served with Colonel  Leonard Metz as Midland's chapter president.   Shortly after World War I, in 1922, General John J. Pershing helped  establish the ROA to ensure that America had a strong Reserve force to  reinforce peace through strength.   ROA membership is open to all Federally commissioned officers,  warrant officers, noncommissioned officers, enlisted, and their  families of all services, along with the Public Health Service and the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th and the global war on terrorism which comes to  America, sadly, from a safe haven in Afghanistan.   Long live Volodymyr Zelenskyy.                            ____________________
