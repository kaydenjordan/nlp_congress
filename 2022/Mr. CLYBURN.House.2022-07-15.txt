 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   On Monday, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m.  for legislative business, with votes postponed until 6:30 p.m.   On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning  hour and 12 p.m. for legislative business.   On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.   Next week, the House will begin our work to advance appropriations  bills to fund the government for fiscal year 2023 and consider H.R.  8294, a minibus package of Transportation and Housing and Urban  Development; Agriculture and Rural Development; Energy and Water  Development; Financial Services and General Government; Interior and  Environment; and Military Construction and Veterans Affairs.   The House will also consider Representative Kathy Manning's H.R.  8373, the Right to Contraception Act, which will protect in Federal  statute the rights enshrined in Griswold v. Connecticut and Eisenstadt  v. Baird.   American women deserve to be able to make decisions about their own  bodies and their own lives, including whether to become pregnant and  have children.   The House will consider bills under suspension of the rules. A  complete list of suspension bills will be announced by the close of  business today.   Additional legislative matters are possible.    I thank the gentleman for yielding. I assure you that we  will get to discuss and debate and hopefully pass all of these bills at  the appropriate time.   However, I am sure the gentleman is aware that Russia's war against  Ukraine is driving up prices all over the world--Putin's price hike.   Three weeks ago, the price of crude oil was trading at $115.25 per  barrel. It closed yesterday at $96.47 a barrel, a decrease of $18.78  per barrel, or a decrease of 16 percent in almost a month.   The average price for gasoline, a gallon of gas, last month was  $5.01. It is now $4.57. It decreased 44 cents, or a decrease of 8  percent, in a month. Funny how that works.   Cuts at the pump are half that of the price of crude, and we are  shocked to know that major oil companies are raking in record profits.   The House passed the Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act, which will help  ease inflation, which the gentleman voted against and quipped against.  This bill helps Americans save money at the gas pump by promoting  local, renewable energy production, and it also expands access to E15.   The House also passed the Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act  to prevent all corporations from prioritizing profits instead of  increasing supply. It empowers the FTC to crack down on oil companies  that excessively overcharge their consumers for gas just to boost their  bottom line.   The President has released historic amounts from our Strategic  Petroleum Reserve, a million gallons a day, and expanded access to  cheaper E15 gas across the Midwest, among other steps to bring down  energy prices.   The Biden administration has approved more drilling permits on public  lands in 2021 than the previous administration did each year during the  first 3 years in office, 2017, 2018, and 2019.   The Biden administration is also working with our allies and partners  around the world to implement a price cap on Russian oil so that we can  continue to inflict pain on Putin while minimizing the pain at the  pump.    I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I think the gentleman is well aware that the President has certain  authorities that he can use, and he is using them. The oil companies  have certain responsibilities, and the question is whether or not they  are living up to their responsibilities.   I know the gentleman is as aware as I am of all the permits out there  that are not being utilized. Of course, we are at the mercy of those  corporate decisions. Hopefully, they will be made in due course and in  such a way that would bring relief to the American people.   I suspect the consideration of all those bills that you are  discussing will be taken up by the leader at the time that he considers  to be appropriate. I, along with the gentleman, will continue to  consult, and hopefully, we can address all these issues in the very-- let's just say shortly.    Thank you for yielding.   As the gentleman knows, proxy voting has been utilized by both sides  of the aisle. I admit it can be a very cumbersome process here on the  floor, but we all utilize it. It is done because it serves a very  valuable purpose for this institution.   We have made great strides in mitigating the harm of the coronavirus  pandemic through vaccines and treatments, but as we both know, the  disease continues to spread in both of our home States.   We are hearing numbers that are very concerning. In just this week of  this session alone, I know of several Members who have tested positive  for COVID and are, therefore, isolating.   These Members can still participate in the process and represent  their constituents by using the proxy vote. Of course, having the proxy  vote and having 2-minute votes doesn't seem a pretty efficient process  to me. We are having a hard time getting it done during 5 minutes.   We just had several 5-minute votes, and I saw on my friend's side of  the aisle about 15 people still lined up after the time has expired.   Both of us are being disadvantaged and inconvenienced by this  process, but I think it is something that we have to do. I don't know  how we could be efficient in this operation with 2-minute voting.   I will pass that along to the leader and hope that he will keep in  mind that coronavirus is still here with us, as the gentleman knows.   We serve together on the coronavirus select subcommittee, and we are  confronted with issues that still concern the American people. I think  that we have to keep all of that in mind as we try to carry out the  people's business.                                time  1415
