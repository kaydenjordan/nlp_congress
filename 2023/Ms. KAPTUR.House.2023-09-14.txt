 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support strengthening the  American economy. How? To keep on task creating living-wage jobs for  America's workers to lift them into the middle class and to clamp down  on billionaires and tax cheats who don't pay their fair share of taxes  to balance our budget to keep our economy growing.   If you look at what the United Auto Workers are fighting for as we  are here on the floor today, they are fighting for what they have  worked for. They deserve decent wages.   The August jobs report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  reports 178,000 more jobs were added nationally.   This is a time of very high job growth in our country, and  unemployment is at a near-historic low. Employers in Ohio and across  our country have job openings and are hiring, but wages have to go up  now, and not only for billionaire owners and financiers. They are not  the only ones that should benefit, but the people doing the work--the  autoworkers, the waitresses, the tech workers, the people across our  country who work in supermarkets.   Madam Speaker, please heal your troubled, divided party. Bring us  together. Let's not stall out American progress. Let's grow the economy  and pay our bills through growth.                            ____________________
