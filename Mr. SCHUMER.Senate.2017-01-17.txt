Mr. President, we received sad news yesterday. We lost a  dear friend to many of us here in the Senate, a wonderful man, Tim  Mitchell. He had a long battle with brain cancer. He was a member of  the floor staff for many years. He did an amazingly outstanding job.   Every organization has what they call unsung heroes. On the  battlefield, they are the soldiers, our infantry men and women. In the  automobile plant, they are the assembly line workers. In the hospital,  they may be the nurses, the clerical workers, or the folks who clean up  the floors late at night. Those organizations can't go on without  [[Page S324]]  these people. They are the heart and soul of these organizations. They  do their work quietly but proudly.   If you had to pick someone who personified the unsung hero of this  body, it would be Tim. He did his job every day. When you talked to  him, you could see the pride and the knowledge he had in doing his job  and doing his job well. He will be sorely missed by every Member here  today, Democrat and Republican.   Let's take a moment to remember Tim and send our best wishes and  prayers to his family and his loved ones.   (Moment of silence.)   Thank you, Mr. President.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I wish to address a troubling report  about the President-elect's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human  Services that came out last night. We learned that Congressman Price  bought shares in a medical device manufacturing company just days  before introducing legislation in the House that would directly benefit  that company.   His legislation wasn't broad legislation. It didn't affect health  care in general. It specifically blocked a regulation on medical device  companies that do hip and knee implants, including the very business he  bought stock in. According to CNN, the company Representative Price  bought stock in was one of two companies that would have been hardest  hit by this new regulation--one of two--and he puts in legislation to  repeal it just after buying stock in it.   Again, this is not someone who has Johnson & Johnson stock and then  votes to cut Medicare. This is a narrow company that works on hip and  knee implants--narrow legislation that deals with undoing some  regulations on them. It is really troubling.   These revelations come on top of the report late last year by CQ and  the Wall Street Journal that Congressman Price had traded stocks in  dozens of health care companies valued at hundreds of thousands of  dollars during his time in the House as chair on the Budget Committee,  when he introduced, sponsored, or cosponsored several pieces of  legislation that impacted these companies.   Yesterday's report makes it clear that this isn't just a couple of  questionable trades but, rather, a clear and troubling pattern of  Congressman Price trading stock and using his office to benefit the  companies in which he was investing.   Our President-elect claims he wants to drain the swamp, but  Congressman Price has spent his career filling it up. I have asked the  Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate whether or not  Congressman Price violated the STOCK Act during his time in office  before his nomination moves forward in any way.   It may well be that this trade was illegal. This isn't a witch hunt.  These are serious and disquieting allegations. The American people  deserve to know if their potential Secretary of Health and Human  Services violated a law against insider trading in Congress.   The facts here are a narrow company with hip and knee implants and  legislation with hip and knee implants coming soon thereafter, after he  bought stock--whoa. These questions cry out for answers before--let me  underline ``before''--Nominee Price goes before the Senate Finance  Committee.   When the public faith in government is as low as it is today, when  politics and campaigns are saturated by money, as they are today, when  folks feel their representatives are beholden to special interests  before their constituents, reports like the one that just came out  about Congressman Price perpetuate that distrust. They add fuel to the  fire.   We need to get to the bottom of these allegations and get to the  bottom of them quickly. The only way to restore faith in our government  and in our most important democratic institutions is to insist upon  transparency and ethical behavior by those in positions of the highest  public trust. Until a congressional ethics investigation can be  completed, this report and his previous trades cast serious doubt on  whether Congressman Price is fit to hold the office of Secretary of  Health and Human Services.                            ____________________     Finally, Mr. President, I wish to turn to the CBO report  that just came out today. The Congressional Budget Office today  released a new report outlining the consequences of the Republican plan  to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Remember, the CBO is a nonpartisan  entity. The numbers don't lie. Try as they might, our Republican  colleagues can't discredit them.   The numbers are even worse than experts could have imagined.  Repealing the Affordable Care Act will mean tens of millions will lose  their health insurance and individuals will see their premiums double.  Let me repeat that. If the Republican bill passes--according to CBO,  which is nonpartisan--tens of millions will lose their health insurance  and individuals will see premiums double. Thirty-two million Americans  would lose their health insurance, 18 million within the first year of  repeal.    The report makes it crystal clear that the Republican effort to  repeal the Affordable Care Act will increase health care costs for  millions of Americans and kick millions more off their health  insurance. No wonder President-Elect Trump realizes repeal without  replace is the real disaster. No wonder he has admonished the Congress  not to do plain repeal.   Some Republicans have tried to dismiss the CBO report as meaningless.  I would remind my Republican friends of two points. First, this is the  CBO Director that Republicans handpicked. This is not some Democratic  operative. He is a person who knows numbers, who was chosen by our  Republican colleagues. You can't reject his findings.   Second, this is your repeal bill that the CBO is analyzing. They  didn't make up the scenario. They took the exact bill we had on the  floor and said: What are going to be the consequences? Devastating-- over 30 million losing coverage, premiums doubling. All the things that  our colleagues are complaining about with ACA are even worse under  their bill. Their complaints on ACA are incorrect. We have gained  numbers, and costs have gone down. The rate of costs have gone down-- much lower than they would be under this report.   I say to my colleagues, this is your repeal bill. The CBO didn't make  this up. It looked at the bill you sent to the President's desk, the  bill you say your repeal bill will be modeled on. It isn't meaningless.  It is your plan.   Now that repeal is real and not just a political exercise, the tide  is turning. The American people are becoming roused by the prospects of  dismantling health reform and leaving chaos in its wake. This is  exactly why Republican Members of Congress are getting an earful back  home from constituents who want them to turn back from their dangerous  plan to make America sick again. I urge my Republican colleagues to  listen to the growing outcry before it is too late.                            ____________________     One final issue: As the hearings continue this week on  the President-elect's Cabinet nominees, I want to make a few points. As  I have mentioned here on the floor several times, we Democrats want the  process to be as fair and transparent as possible, abiding by all the  ethics requirements demanded of nominees in the past. Yet the HELP  Committee today will hold a hearing on Education Secretary nominee  Betsy DeVos, who is worth $5 billion and owns an investment company  with untold financial entanglements, despite the fact that she doesn't  have a signed ethics agreement in place. When somebody has such wealth  and such complicated holdings, we have always made them sign an ethics  agreement that says ``Here is how I am going to divest so there is no  conflict of interest,'' so it is clear that the nominee is doing things  for their country, not for their financial holdings. We don't have it,  and we are rushing ahead with hearings in the HELP Committee. My dear  friend whom I have so much respect for, the chair, the Senator from  Tennessee, is just rushing forward, rushing forward. That is not a good  way to start. It is not a good way for my Republican colleagues or the  President-elect to start.  [[Page S325]]    Then we have Wilbur Ross. He is the nominee for Commerce. He is a  billionaire. We have a Cabinet loaded with billionaires, despite how  President-Elect Trump campaigned. Mr. Wilbur Ross is a billionaire with  vast and complicated holdings. He just delivered his paperwork  yesterday. His hearing is scheduled for tomorrow. The paperwork is very  complicated. When you have $1 billion, it is not just in U.S.  treasuries. But they are rushing forward. The committee needs some time  to review those documents before a hearing. I am hopeful we can move it  back.   Then there is the fact that tomorrow there are four hearings. We have  asked the majority to space out the hearing schedule so that Members  who sit on multiple committees can have time to prepare and attend all  the hearings. That is going to be very difficult for many Members  tomorrow.   We have tried to cooperate with my friend, the majority leader. These  are not good signs. They don't bode well.   You can see why the President-elect and Republicans are trying to  rush these nominees through. The President-elect promised to change the  way America operates, to oppose elites and the rigged system, to clean  the swamp, and to pay attention to working families. But now he is  rigging the Cabinet with billionaires and bankers. It is exactly the  opposite of what the President-elect campaigned on, so they are trying  to get it done as quickly as possible--the less scrutiny, the better.  They don't want these people exposed for who they are and what they  represent. Oh, no, that is not fair to the American people. They  deserve the chance to get a good look at these nominees.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
