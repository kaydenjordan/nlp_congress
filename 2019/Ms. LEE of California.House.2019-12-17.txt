 Madam Speaker, let me thank Chairwoman Lowey  for yielding, but also for her tremendous and tireless work, day and  night, on behalf of the American people, and also our ranking member,  Kay Granger, for her leadership.   I rise in strong support of this domestic and foreign assistance  appropriations bill. First, as a member of the Labor, Health and Human  Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee and also the  Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and  Related Agencies Subcommittee, I am really pleased to see such a  comprehensive bill that strongly invests in our rural and our urban  communities.   For example, there is $266 million for the new Ending HIV initiative.  This is new funding. We have an increase of $42 million to historically  Black colleges and universities and a $19 million increase to Hispanic- serving institutions. These institutions help improve the higher  education of our students of color; also, an increase in the Healthy  Food Financing Initiative and the College Hunger Initiative, which this  bill addresses.   It also includes $65 million for the Education Innovation Research  grants for computer science for young girls and students of color and  $20 million for Special Olympics education programs, which the  President's budget initially proposed to eliminate.    Madam Speaker, I also want to thank our chair  of the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee for  the increase for our international AIDS program and for the Global  Fund.                                time  1315
