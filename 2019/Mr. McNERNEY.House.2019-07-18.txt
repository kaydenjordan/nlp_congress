 Madam Speaker, the way we finance campaigns in this  country is a true threat to our democracy. This structure is a leading  cause of our Nation's political paralysis and voter apathy.   In the book ``Dark Money,'' Jane Mayer wrote: ``In 2006, only 2  percent of `outside' political spending came from `social welfare'  groups that hid their donors. In 2010, this number rose to 40 percent,  masking hundreds of millions of dollars.''   Since the 2010 Citizens United decision and related decisions, this  number is even greater today. The massive amount of money flowing into  our political system corrupts the political process and stymies  effectiveness.   That is why I introduced a proposed constitutional amendment to  reform our broken campaign finance system. My amendment would eliminate  political action committees and ``dark money.'' Funding for a candidate  or ballot measure would be limited to the use of a public financing  system or donations given directly to the campaign by individual  citizens. This would end much of the corruption in Washington.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do everything possible to help  limit corruption in Washington, including supporting this legislation.                            ____________________
