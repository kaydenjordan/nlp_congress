 Madam Speaker, I rise in observance of Gun Violence  Survivors' Week.   For all those who have lost their lives due to gun violence, there  are thousands more who experience trauma, loss, and suffering.   In a recent poll, 58 percent of American adults reported that they or  someone that they care for have experienced gun violence. That  statistic is shocking, and it is also shameful. No other wealthy  country faces a gun violence epidemic on this scale.   The House has passed strong bipartisan bills to reduce gun violence.  Majority Leader McConnell and the gun lobby continue to block this  legislation. The obstruction is outrageous. It fails to honor the  legacy of the survivors that we honor this week.   I know we can do better. We simply must do better.                            ____________________
