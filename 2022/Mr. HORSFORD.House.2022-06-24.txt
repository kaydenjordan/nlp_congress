 Mr. Speaker, today, June 24, 2022, marks 30 years to  the day that my father was shot and killed by senseless gun violence.  So, I stand here emotional as I prepare to cast a vote in favor of the  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, historic legislation that will reduce  crime and break the cycle of violence that so many people throughout  our country have unfortunately experienced.   One of the most important provisions in this bill is $2 billion in  funding for antiviolence programs, including $250 million for community  violence intervention from my Break the Cycle of Violence legislation.   Every day, 110 Americans are killed with guns, and over 200 are shot  and wounded. Amid the global pandemic, homicides by gun increased by 35  percent.   Today, gun violence remains the leading cause of premature death for  Black men, as well as the number two cause of premature death for  Latino men and Black women.    Today, I am casting my vote for my father; the 58  victims who lost their lives during the 1 October shooting in Las  Vegas; Sean'Jerrion Coleman, a constituent and a Las Vegas youth  leader; and so many other Americans who are victims and survivors of  gun violence.   I urge this body to pass the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.
