 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and  congratulate Lone Star Legal Aid on celebrating their 75th anniversary.  Founded in Houston in 1948, Lone Star Legal Aid has grown to become the  third largest legal aid provider in the United States, serving over 2  million across the Texas region.   Mr. Speaker, Lone Star Legal Aid holds a very special place in my  heart, because that is where I started. I went to law school to be a  legal aid lawyer. That is where I found my calling, fighting for the  poor and the most vulnerable back in the eighties.   Here we are 75 years later, and Lone Star is still there for  communities in their darkest and most challenging moments.   They played a vital role in desegregating public housing, improving  children's healthcare, championing environmental justice, fighting for  the poor, and helping those in their fight for public benefits. In  short, they help people pursue their legal access to justice.   Today, let's recognize Lone Star Legal Aid for 75 years. I thank them  for making a difference in people's lives.                            ____________________
