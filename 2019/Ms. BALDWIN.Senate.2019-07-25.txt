 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 100th  anniversary of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers  Local 158 from Green Bay, WI. The original charter of Local 158 was  filed on June 6, 1919.   IBEW Local 158 occupies a storied place in the history of organized  labor in northeast Wisconsin. Electrical workers in Green Bay began  organizing for better wages and working conditions as early as 1902. By  1919, the workers had a committed core of electrical workers and filed  the charter to establish a chapter of the IBEW on June 6 of that year.  On June 17, 1919, the Local held its first meeting at the home of  Brother August Verheyden. The Local increased its influence and  magnified its voice by joining other groups advocating for workers and  their families. In 1921, IBEW Local 158 joined the State Federation of  Labor, the Green Bay Labor Council, and the Green Bay Building Trades.   Construction of paper mills and powerplants in the Fox Valley created  steady employment for IBEW members. Their experience was especially  important when the call for skilled labor went out during World War II  to help build ships for the U.S. Navy. After the surprise attack on  Pearl Harbor, the Navy rapidly began building low-cost cargo ships  called Liberty Ships, as well as smaller torpedo patrol and submarine  chaser boats. Members of IBEW Local 158, along with their brethren from  Local 1012 at the Leathem D. Smith Shipbuilding Company in Sturgeon  Bay, stepped up to this challenge and contributed to the successful  U.S. war effort.   IBEW Local 158 continued its significant contributions to the Green  Bay economy and community through its work on Green Bay's City Hall,  which opened in 1957. That same year, the Local celebrated its  contribution to the completion of the Lake Michigan pipeline and the  new City Stadium, home of the Green Bay Packers.   In the early 1970s, Local 158 merged with three other Wisconsin IBEW  organizations: Local 751 in Manitowoc, Local 1012 in Sturgeon Bay, and  Local 1235 in Marinette, making Local 158 a stronger, more diverse and  financially sound Local in the Brotherhood.   In recent times, the skills and expertise of Local 158 members are on  display at nearby nuclear power stations, paper mills, shipyards, and  hospitals. In 2003, IBEW contributed to the significant renovations at  Lambeau Field, a landmark we in Wisconsin like to refer to as the ``8th  Wonder of the World.''   IBEW Local 158, however, is known for far more than its economic  achievements. Its members also deserve recognition for their  significant contributions to their community through generous  charitable initiatives. In addition, its advocacy on behalf of family  supporting wages has helped build the strong middle class Green Bay  enjoys today.   On this important day, marking 100 years of outstanding service to  its members, its union, and its community, I heartily congratulate IBEW  Local 158 on its successful advocacy on behalf of working families, and  I wish its members continued progress for the next 100 years.                            ____________________
