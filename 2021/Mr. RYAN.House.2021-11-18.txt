 Mr. Speaker, this is a wonderful place. I have to tell you,  our child tax credit is 1 year more than your child tax credit. We did  one this year; we are going to do one next year; and we are going to  keep going.   I love this place. Guys get wrapped around like a pretzel in this  place.   Let me be clear, I am against any tax cut for the wealthy. This is an  investment in working-class people whether they are White or Black or  Brown.   But when I listen to the other side, I hear somebody who if this was  a football game I would go back and say, I want a review, I want a  review of the play, and I want to pull up the C-SPAN video of all the  Republicans at the Rose Garden touting a big tax cut for the top 1  percent that blew a trillion-dollar hole in the economy.   This place is ridiculous.   Let's invest in the people. Let's not cut taxes for rich people.   And we have a new name for the GOP: the grand old phonies.
