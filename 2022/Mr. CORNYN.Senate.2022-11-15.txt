 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following Senators be permitted to speak prior to the vote on the  passage of S.J. Res. 63: I for 20 minutes; Senator Moran of Kansas for  5 minutes; Senator Paul of Kentucky for 15 minutes; Senator Marshall of  Kansas for 5 minutes; and Senator Wyden of Oregon for 10 minutes.    Madam President, I have the unwelcome task of saying  farewell to my right hand: my chief of staff, Beth Jafari. It is  literally impossible to separate my Senate career from Beth's influence  because she has been a leader on Team Cornyn for the last 20 years.   Back in 2003, I made what I now recognize as one of the best  employment decisions I have ever made. That is when I hired Beth to be  my legislative director. This Houston native had spent nearly a decade  working in the House of Representatives before she came to the Senate,  but she had had a short period of time wherein she practiced law and  recognized the satisfaction and reward of public service more than the  enhanced paycheck of the private practice of law.   To me, one of the great benefits is she knew Texas; she knew  Congress; she understood Washington and all of its strange ways. I was  confident then and am now that she was the perfect person for the job.   Beth quickly developed an expertise in both the processes and the  people of the U.S. Senate. She understood the ins and outs of every  policy area and which Members cared the most about what issues. She  built strong relationships with staff on both sides of the aisle and  earned a reputation as a trustworthy and honest broker, and she  empowered our own legislative team to notch up win after win for Texas.   When my first chief of staff left in 2007, I knew there was only one  person for that job, one person I could literally trust with that job.  Beth didn't seek that job in order to raise her own profile or impress  the DC power players. That has never been her MO. Instead, she saw an  opportunity to champion an incredible team and help us accomplish  important things for Texas. That is one of the first things you come to  know and appreciate about Beth: She loves Texas. She loves her sports  teams, especially her beloved Aggies. She loves the music, the hole-in- the-wall Tex-Mex joints, but most of all, she loves people.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S6682, November 15, 2022, in the third column, the  following appears: She loves her sports teams, especially her  beloved Texas Aggies.      The online Record has been corrected to read: She loves her  sports teams, especially her beloved Aggies.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Years ago, after a terrible tragedy in West, TX--that is the name of  the town, ``West, TX,'' not the region--a county commissioner said to  me: Being a Texan doesn't describe where you are from; it describes who  your family is.   That is so true. Beth has dealt with the nearly 30 million Texans as  if they were members of her extended family, and when they were in  need, she made sure our team sprang into action.  [[Page S6683]]    Unfortunately, there have been more--I should say too many--instances  where that was required. We have had storms, two of the biggest being  Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Ike. Both hit Beth's hometown of  Houston, devastating her parents' home, and the affected parts of our  State and region couldn't have hoped for a bigger champion in the Halls  of Congress than Beth Jafari. She was the offensive coordinator for the  entire Texas delegation in making sure we knew exactly what was needed,  what the plan should look like, and helping us deliver on that plan.  She was so personally involved in Hurricane Harvey that she rescued a  four-legged survivor by the name of Jackson.   Well, Texas has experienced natural disasters like most parts of the  country, whether they are tornadoes, wildfires, severe winter weather,  or some other natural disaster of all stripes, but that just scratches  the surface of the many challenges that our State has endured during  the past two decades while Beth has been my chief of staff and  legislative director.   We have had mass shootings that have brought heartbreak to cities  across Texas, including Fort Hood, Dallas, Sutherland Springs, Santa  Fe, El Paso, Odessa, and most recently in Uvalde. There was the West  Fertilizer plant explosion I alluded to a moment ago--and, of course,  the pandemic, and the ongoing border crisis. Beth has been a steady  hand guiding our efforts through all of it and more.   No matter how big or how small the problems are, she has worked to  ensure that Texans are heard and helped. In many cases, that meant  getting timely responses to Texans who just wanted more information  about what we were doing or people who wanted to share their ideas  about ways we might be of service. In others, it involved passing  legislation or working to mobilize Federal resources. And oftentimes,  it meant connecting constituents with Federal Agencies to help them  with everything from benefit programs to emergency passport renewals.   In my office, we refer to this important part of our job as casework  or constituent services, and Beth has been the biggest cheerleader for  my constituent services team from the very beginning. It is not  legislating, but it is one of the most important things we do to be of  service to our constituents.   I am proud of the fact that in 2020, our team received the very top  Constituent Services Award in Congress from the Congressional  Management Foundation for the assistance we have been able to provide  Texans needing help navigating the Federal bureaucracy.   Unlike some people working under the Capitol Dome, Beth has never  lost sight of why we are here: to serve the people we represent. While  discussing funding bills, foreign bills, defense bills, or you name it,  Beth would always bring us back home to the most important priority,  which is to answer the question: How does this affect Texas?   Focused, thoughtful, considerate, deliberate, rock steady, and a  Texan through and through--when you hear about such an accomplished  person, sometimes you might think that they would be an intimidating  personality or unapproachable, but you would be dead wrong about Beth.   When I was elected by my colleagues to serve as a Republican whip in  2012, I asked members of my predecessor staff, Senator Jon Kyl of  Arizona, if they would like to stay on board. In typical Beth fashion,  Beth didn't waste a moment welcoming them to the team. She called each  person and invited them to our annual Christmas party, which she was  hosting in her own home. She assured them that it would be the best way  to meet everybody, and it didn't matter that they weren't officially on  the payroll. But as far as Beth was concerned, they were already part  of the team. Beth has a special way of making everybody feel right at  home.   On any given day, you can find her making the rounds in the office,  talking to colleagues about their favorite college football team, or  discussing the latest drama on the reality show ``The Bachelorette''-- or, excuse me, ``The Bachelor,'' I guess it is. You can tell I am not a  frequent viewer.   She asks about spouses. She asks about significant others. She asks  about children, sick family members, home renovation projects, and  pets. And she makes sure everyone--from the most senior members of the  team to the most junior--feels seen, heard, and appreciated.   But it is not just the folks in the Cornyn office that Beth cares  about. She has been a part of the Senate community for two decades, and  she has built friendships all across the Capitol.   Each morning, you will see her catching up with the Capitol Police,  for example, in the Hart garage entrance, or she will make her way to  Cups for her first dose of caffeine and a quick conversation with Mr.  and Mrs. Chung. She will check in with other Senate chiefs--Republicans  and Democrats alike--as well as the chiefs for Members of the Texas  House delegation.   I have no doubt that come Monday, Beth is going to miss each of these  people and the countless friends she has made throughout the Capitol  Complex. They are certainly going to miss her.   If given the microphone, I know Beth would be quick to emphasize that  this is all part of a team effort, and she is not wrong. But that tells  you another exceptional quality about Beth, and that is her humility.  She helps lead the most productive team in the Senate, but she would  never dream of claiming credit for herself. Whenever there is an  accomplishment worth celebrating, you are sure to find Beth standing on  the sidelines, loudly applauding the work of others.   In a city that is full of people who are frequently all hat and no  cattle, Beth is the real deal. Her always calm, always friendly  attitude doesn't reflect just how challenging her job is. And her  humility provides absolutely no hint that she is one of the most  respected staffers on Capitol Hill.   Beth will be the first to tell you she couldn't have accomplished any  of this on her own. Of course, her parents have been among her biggest  supporters from day one, and I am honored that her mom, Nancy, is  looking down from the Gallery today. Someone else I know who is looking  down on her is her dad, Bob, who passed away earlier this year. And  there is Chris, and James, and Maj, and her other family members who  have supported her through the highs and lows of the past 20 years.   It is tough to sum up the impact Beth has had on me, on my wife  Sandy, on our team, on our institution, and in our State, but let me  share just a few numbers that may do the trick.   Over the last two decades, Beth has served alongside some 800 members  of Team Cornyn, and that is just full-time staff and doesn't include  interns and law clerks. She has counseled me through two decades of  service to Texas, three election campaigns, 4 years as chairman of the  National Republican Senatorial Committee, and 6 years as a Republican  whip.   She served in the Senate during four Presidential administrations and  witnessed the confirmation process for eight of the nine sitting  Justices on the Supreme Court of the United States. And she has been  part of the Senate longer than 81 Senators.   In a place where people are always coming and going, Beth has been a  wise and trustworthy partner, and this place just won't be the same  without her. I know I speak on behalf of our entire team--past and  present--when I say there is no one else like Beth Jafari.   She has sometimes been referred to as the glue that holds ``Cornyn  world'' together. If you think about the life of an elected official,  you have got, of course, your personal life, your family; you have got  your official duties; and then you have got your political  responsibilities, and Beth has literally been the glue that holds all  of that together in ``Cornyn world.''   I have never known a Senate without Beth, so this is going to be a  big transition for all of us, but I am excited for her about what the  future holds beyond the walls of the Capitol. I hope this new chapter  will afford Beth more time to sit on the beach with Jackson's leash in  one hand and a margarita in the other.   I hope it gives her more opportunities to cheer on her favorite  teams, whether that is the Aggies, the Houston Astros, her favorite  Olympic track and field contestants, or the national soccer team of  Mexico. Instead of just a television screen, maybe she could see more  of those in person.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S6683, November 15, 2022, in the third column, the  following appears: I hope it gives her more opportunities to cheer  on her favorite teams, whether that is the Texas Aggies      The online Record has been corrected to read: I hope it gives  her more opportunities to cheer on her favorite teams, whether  that is the Aggies    ========================= END NOTE =========================      I hope it frees up more time for her to spend with her nephew James,  who is very important to her and she to  [[Page S6684]]  him, and help hone her skills as the next Picasso. Yes, Beth is taking  up oil painting classes, and we will see how that all turns out. She  has actually threatened to paint a picture of me, and I said, Well, why  don't you wait a while until you get a few more lessons under your  belt.   And I sincerely hope it will bring Beth back to the halls of Hart,  where she has served our State so well for nearly two decades.   I often joke at times like these that Team Cornyn is like the Hotel  California: You can check out, but you can never leave.   So this isn't goodbye; it is a simply ``see you soon.'' But it is  also, ``You better not block my emails or texts or phone messages.''   On behalf of Team Cornyn and the entire Lone Star State, thank you,  Beth, for serving our State with such class. We are going to miss you.   I yield the floor.
