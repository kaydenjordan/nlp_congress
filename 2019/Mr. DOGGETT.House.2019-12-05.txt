 Voting rights guarantee all of our other rights. When  Americans are obstructed from freely participating in elections, our  democracy is imperiled.   This bill, six long years overdue, restores a key provision of the  Voting Rights Act that was wrongfully nullified by Republican-appointed  justices.   How troubling that a law that President Lyndon Johnson long ago  secured now is being obstructed, while our home State of Texas has  become ground zero for voter suppression. State Republicans have  aggressively, illegally purged voting rolls. They eliminated mobile  voting to quash especially student and senior voters. They enacted a  cumbersome voter ID law. And they horribly, illegally gerrymandered our  State.   Republicans split 100 voting precincts to create the district which I  serve today, creating one of the most crooked districts that weaken the  accessibility and accountability of Congress Members. A three-judge  Federal court with two Republican-appointed judges unanimously  condemned Texas redistricting as intentional racially discriminatory  intent in its work.   Fortunately, the Texas Civil Rights Project, MoveTexas, LULAC, and  other groups have challenged the suppression, but this bill is  essential to offer the protection that they, and our democracy,  deserve.   We need preclearance in Texas. We need preclearance to clear away all  the obstacles Republicans insist on imposing to ensure that our State  remains a voter nonparticipation State for democracy.   Madam Speaker, let's support H.R. 4.
