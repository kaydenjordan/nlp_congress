 Mr. Chair, I thank my friend from California (Mr. Takano)  and my colleagues, Representatives Esty, Langevin, Lieu, and Lujan for  cosponsoring this amendment.   Our amendment would provide $2.5 million to revive the Office of  Technology Assessment to provide Congress with unbiased, timely, and  nonpartisan reports on a wide range of issues in science and  technology.   This office is no less necessary today than when it was first started  in 1972, or when it was defunded in 1995. As technology continues to  advance at an increasingly rapid pace and our partisan divide seems to  grow deeper, Congress needs this now more than ever.   The OTA did important work in a number of areas, but I would like to  highlight just one of those areas in particular.   One of the last recommendations the OTA made was that the U.S. should  move rapidly to computerized health records and that standards should  be put in place to ensure what we now call interoperability.   Had we heeded this advice rather than defunding the OTA, we could  have saved hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money and saved  hundreds of thousands of American lives by ensuring accurate, up-to- date patient data that was accessible regardless of where the patient  turned up for care.   This also could have helped slow or prevent the opioid epidemic by  ensuring that patients would not be able to doctor shop to acquire  numerous opioid prescriptions.   While we cannot slow down the rapid pace of technology, we can give  our country back an important and proven tool.   So I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment to  restore this vital source of credible, nonpartisan scientific expertise  to the U.S. Congress.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 297, line 21, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $10,000,000) (increased by $10,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Foster) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment is a symbolic adjustment to  the NNSA budget intended to raise awareness about two areas of emerging  national security risk that I believe deserve more attention and  investment.   As the only Ph.D. physicist in Congress, I feel a special  responsibility to speak out on issues of national security, especially  when they concern emerging technological threats that Congress may not  be sufficiently aware of.   Any student of the history of warfare is well aware of the dangers of  fighting the last war, and for more than 70 years, nuclear weapons have  held center stage among threats to our national security and global  safety because of their unique capabilities to threaten the existence  of mankind. That threat remains, but I fear that the balance of our  defensive investments do not adequately reflect emerging threats.   We now appear to be in the process of deciding to spend over $1  trillion to upgrade our nuclear weapons despite the fact that our  existing systems are far more sufficient to deter any rational actor.  There is no adversary of ours who is not intimidated by our nuclear  arsenal but who will suddenly fall in line if we add just one more  upgrade or additional weapons manufacturing capability. Put simply,  another generation of nuclear weapons will not make us significantly  safer.   On the other hand, we live in a world where newly emerging and  potentially equally great threats loom: first, bioterror, driven by  recent breakthroughs in genetic engineering and off-the-shelf  biotechnology; and, second, lethal autonomous weapons systems driven by  recent breakthroughs in machine vision, facial recognition, and  artificial intelligence. These are small, inexpensive lethal drones and  similar devices that use machine vision and artificial intelligence to  target individuals or groups of humans, potentially without any human  involvement in the kill decision.   For those of my colleagues unfamiliar with these technologies,  perform an internet search for the term ``lethal autonomous weapons  systems,'' sometimes abbreviated ``LAWS''; or read the recent press  coverage of the ab initio synthesis of the horsepox virus, a close  variant of the smallpox virus that killed millions; then search for the  term ``biohacking.''   For more detailed information, I urge my colleagues to request a  classified or unclassified briefing on recent studies of these subjects  by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.   Both of these technologies pose unique threats to our national  security for two reasons:   The first is because of the small physical footprint of a terror  facility based on either of these technologies. Either a bioterror  laboratory or a small shop to produce and program small lethal drones  could easily fit in a basement or small apartment. There is no  radiological signature to detect them as there is with nuclear  material.   The second is because of the low cost and general availability of key  enabling technological components. The monetary investment necessary  for a capable terror facility is in the range of hundreds of thousands  of dollars, perhaps less.   The relevant technologies are already in wide use in industry.   Contrast this with the threats of nuclear proliferation, where the  multibillion-dollar investment to enrich and separate nuclear fissile  material pretty much limits nuclear weapons either to established  nation-states or perhaps terrorist organizations with access to fissile  material from poorly guarded facilities.   Anyone who is unconvinced that we need to take these emerging threats  seriously needs only to look at what happened in cybersecurity. One of  the painful lessons we have learned in recent years is that everything  evil that can be done with computer viruses has, in fact, been done. In  large part, this is because of the low barriers to entry and the  difficulty of attributing an attack. Both of these features are shared  fully by both bioterror and lethal autonomous weapons systems.   So if we are going to stay ahead of these threats, we need to be  strategic about our investments. It is time to reconsider the wisdom of  pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into Cold War weapons which  contribute negligibly to our national security and past time to  consider a much more rapid increase in investments in defensive  measures against lethal autonomous weapons systems and against  bioterror, because by the time they become a reality, it will be too  late to react.   As a leader in technology and innovation, the United States should  act now to circumvent any danger these technologies could pose.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment and to take the time to educate themselves about these  emerging threats.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster).   The amendment was agreed to.                  Amendment No. 52 Offered by Mr. Garamendi    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 52  printed in House Report 115-259.
