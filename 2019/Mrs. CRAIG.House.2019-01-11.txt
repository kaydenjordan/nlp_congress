 Madam Speaker, today, air traffic controllers in a  regional facility in Farmington continue to work without pay, while  support staff is furloughed. Adding insult to injury, in the last few  hours, they received regularly scheduled earnings statements that read  zero dollars and zero cents.   Earlier this week, I met with them in Burnsville and again in  Washington. I heard their stories.   Joe, a new father with a baby born 10 weeks early still in the NICU,  had his leave canceled because of the shutdown.   Jeremy, a father of three, may have to take out credit card debt just  to pay the bills.   And Kelly, a trainee with student loan debt, doesn't know how she is  going to make ends meet.   Each of them, on behalf of communities and passengers they may never  know, remains committed.   It is time to end the shutdown and stop playing politics with  people's lives.                            ____________________
