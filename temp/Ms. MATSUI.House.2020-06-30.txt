 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule for H.R.  2, the Moving Forward Act.   America cannot remain competitive in the 21st century without modern,  efficient infrastructure. Unfortunately, our roads, bridges, airports,  and schools are falling behind.   H.R. 2 makes transformational investments in our country's  infrastructure that will revitalize America's backbone while improving  safety, reducing pollution, and getting Americans back to work.   To address our crumbling roads, the bill provides $300 billion for  construction and maintenance of Federal highways and bridges. In  Sacramento, my hometown, this will mean money for more projects like  the new I Street Bridge that will help move people and goods safely and  effectively.   H.R. 2 also provides provisions to reinforce our commitment to  fighting the climate crisis. It provides more than $70 billion to  expand renewable energy sources and strengthen clean energy  infrastructure.   Additionally, the State of California and transportation authorities  in my district will benefit from this bill's funding to increase  walking, biking, and public transit options, all with the goal of  cleaning up our air and limiting human contributions to climate change.   H.R. 2 also accelerates the use of zero emission vehicles and ensures  we keep up with demand by installing necessary charging infrastructure  across the country.   In addition, to keep Americans connected to the internet, this bill  provides broadband payment support for low-income households and the  recently unemployed. The COVID-19 pandemic has required our schools to  fundamentally change the way they engage with students, and H.R. 2  ensures children have access to digital equipment and affordable  broadband options for remote learning.   For America to remain the global center of innovation and growth, we  must have 21st century infrastructure. This bill makes the forward- looking investments to help get us there.
