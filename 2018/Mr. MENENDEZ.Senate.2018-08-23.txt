 Madam President, I come to the floor because President  Trump, his administration, and this Republican Congress are engaged in  a heartless and deliberate plot to rip healthcare away from millions of  Americans, and it is only going to get worse.   It was a little over a year ago when Americans rose, made their  voices heard, and stopped Republicans from passing TrumpCare. Ever  since they were able to repeal the Affordable Care Act on the Senate  floor, this administration has pursued a cynical campaign to sabotage  the Affordable Care Act from behind closed doors. The Trump  administration slashed the open enrollment period, leaving Americans  with less time to get covered, and, to confuse consumers, they cut  advertising and outreach funding. They abruptly eliminated cost-sharing  payments, raising out-of-pocket expenses for many struggling families.   Earlier this summer, they rolled back consumer protections and gave  insurers permission to sell more junk health plans to consumers--plans  that leave people more vulnerable to massive medical bills that  bankrupt their families. They even intervened in a court case to have  protections for preexisting conditions struck down, jeopardizing  coverage for 3.8 million New Jerseyans who have a preexisting  condition.   Every act of sabotage has contributed to soaring healthcare premiums,  fewer choices for consumers, and millions of Americans losing their  healthcare coverage under this President's watch. Now we face President  Trump's greatest act of sabotage yet--the nomination of a judge to the  Supreme Court who has decried the constitutionality of the Affordable  Care Act at the very same time this administration is arguing in court  that protections for preexisting conditions are unconstitutional-- unconstitutional.   As a candidate and as President, Donald Trump repeatedly pledged to  [[Page S5881]]  protect people with preexisting conditions, saying on ``60 Minutes''  that he would ``take care of everybody.''   Before the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies could  discriminate against any American who had a preexisting condition. What  is that? That is some illness you acquired in your life. It is that  heart attack or the Parkinson's disease or the birth defect you had  when you were born that allowed an insurance company to discriminate  against you and either deny you healthcare coverage or make the cost so  exorbitant, it was impossible to afford. The Affordable Care Act I  helped write ultimately eliminated that discrimination and the ability  of insurance companies to do that.   In New Jersey alone, which has a little over 9 million people in the  State, 3.8 million New Jerseyans have a preexisting condition.   The President also said he replaced the Affordable Care Act with  ``something terrific.'' There is nothing terrific about breaking a  promise that threatens the lives and livelihoods of millions of  families.   I remember when President Trump promised to stand up for the so- called forgotten men. I guess he forgot about them when he signed a  Republican tax scam into law, handing trillion-dollar tax cuts to big  corporations at the expense of working families and New Jersey's middle  class, taking away or limiting significantly our State and local  property tax deduction. He definitely forgot about the forgotten when  he reversed his position on preexisting condition protections.   The administration's plot to derail the Affordable Care Act and the  nomination of Brett Kavanaugh has implications for every family in  America, no matter whether they are covered by an employer or by their  own insurance on the marketplace.   People remember what it was like before we passed the Affordable Care  Act. It wasn't so long ago that healthcare insurance companies could  pick and choose who got covered and drop their customers the moment  they got sick. Before the Affordable Care Act, women could be denied  coverage for maternity care. Women in many parts of the country  ultimately were discriminated against by being charged more than their  male counterparts in the same age group, in the same geography, simply  because they were women.   Today, women no longer are considered to have a preexisting condition  under the law simply because they are a woman.   Before the Affordable Care Act, babies born with heart deformities  could hit lifetime limits within days of being born. Today, families  don't have to worry about lifetime caps.   Before the Affordable Care Act, cancer survivors and Americans with  chronic conditions like diabetes or asthma could be charged exorbitant  premiums and priced out of coverage altogether. Today, those patients  are protected from discrimination.   This guaranteed coverage for preexisting conditions formed the very  heart of the Affordable Care Act. But if confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh  could drive a stake right through it. That is because this judge has a  long history of ruling against consumers and for big corporations, and  that doesn't bode well for the 133 million Americans who live with  preexisting conditions in this country. That includes those 3.8 million  people in New Jersey. For me, that is 3.8 million reasons to oppose  Kavanaugh's nomination, and that is before we even get to his hostile  views with respect to Roe v. Wade.   Make no mistake, the anti-choice, anti-Affordable Care Act, and anti- everyday American views of Judge Kavanaugh are not up for debate.  President Trump has been crystal clear about nominating only judges  opposed to Roe v. Wade and a woman's right to choose.   So when I read reports about Judge Kavanaugh telling my colleagues  here in the Senate that Roe v. Wade is ``settled law,'' I have to  chuckle because, let's be clear, his hollow words mean absolutely  nothing. The Supreme Court has the power to unsettle so-called settled  law whenever they make a ruling, and we have seen in the Court's recent  decisions, such as in the Janus case, where years of settled law all of  a sudden became unsettled.   I don't question Judge Kavanaugh's experience or his intelligence,  but I do question his history of partisanship and impartiality. I  question his ability to put aside his decades of work in Republican  politics. I question his connections to far-right groups that have  spent decades rolling back women's constitutional rights and rigging  our courts in favor of the rich and powerful.   The American people deserve a Supreme Court Justice who will defend  their rights and strive for a legal system in which workers, consumers,  patients, and families go to court on a level playing field at a time  when powerful special interests are too often holding all the cards.   Instead, they have been given a nominee groomed by rightwing  organizations like the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society  to do the bidding of their big corporate donors.   If confirmed, Donald Trump will have replaced the only swing vote on  the Supreme Court with a partisan who swings only to the far right, and  Brett Kavanaugh will be in a position to cast a deciding vote, should  the Trump administration's assault on the Affordable Care Act end up in  the Supreme Court. That is frightening, and it is frustrating,  especially because any one of my Republican colleagues has the power to  make a real difference. Any one of my colleagues in the majority could  demand we don't confirm a Supreme Court nominee until this  administration stops its assault on the rights of patients with  preexisting conditions. Republicans claim they support these  protections, but this is not a time for halfhearted statements. This is  a time for action. If Republicans truly believed in preventing  insurance companies from discriminating against patients who have  endured complicated pregnancies or survived cancer or have a chronic  disease, they would do something about it.   Instead, as the Trump administration carries out this campaign of  sabotage against the Affordable Care Act, my Republican colleagues are  engaged in a campaign of silence and complicity. When you have the  power to use your voice and your vote to protect millions of patients  and families across this Nation and you choose not to do so, you are  indeed complicit. It is sad and shameful that not a single Republican  in this body has put their foot down and stood up for the rights of  patients, stood up for all of those millions of Americans who have a  preexisting condition.   Failing to speak up means you are part of the problem. You are  destabilizing our insurance markets and kicking millions off of their  coverage. You are driving higher out-of-pocket costs for families and  skyrocketing healthcare premiums. You are leaving Americans who have  struggled with opioid addiction or endured a sexual assault vulnerable  to discrimination. You are enabling President Trump's worst instincts,  which is to do whatever he pleases whenever he pleases, with no regard  for the rule of law or the role of Congress or the havoc he is wreaking  on people's lives.   Most Americans can't believe we have to refight the healthcare  battles of the past. They want their leaders to work on building them a  brighter future.   There are so many ways we could be working to improve our healthcare  system and making a real difference in the lives of our constituents.  We could be passing legislation that ensures that women have access to  reproductive healthcare and the right to control their own bodies, no  matter which State they live in, like the Women's Health Protection  Act. We could be holding powerful drug companies accountable for price  gouging consumers and playing fast and loose with the rules by passing  commonsense bills like the CREATES Act and the SPIKE Act. We could be  pursuing reforms to reduce healthcare costs, not by reducing access to  care but by encouraging efficiency and becoming better at preventing  and managing costly chronic disease. We could be creating more  transparency so that patients headed to surgery can shop around before  going under the knife with a wish and a prayer that they don't wake up  to a massive medical bill. We could be pursuing solutions to reduce  risk in the private marketplace and lower premiums for younger  consumers, not by inflicting a punishing age tax but by letting  Americans 55 years and older buy into Medicare.  [[Page S5882]]    Before we make our healthcare system better, we have to stop  President Trump from making it worse. It is time we do the responsible  thing: Put the brake on Brett Kavanaugh's nomination. Tell the  President his nominee will not get a hearing until he drops his legal  assault on patients with preexisting conditions. Demand that the  administration stop playing games with American lives and stand up for  the right of every man, woman, and child across America to quality,  affordable healthcare. We have that opportunity in this Senate.   I don't hear any of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  raising their voice in the midst of an attack against the essence of  the protections under the Affordable Care Act that we supposedly all  collectively embraced, that the President heralded, but now the  President is directing the Justice Department to attack.   It is time to speak up. And if not, then one is complicit. If that  ultimate attack against the Affordable Care Act is successful, then for  130 million Americans across this country who will no longer have those  protections, I think they will remember on election day.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, last August, the world watched in horror  as Burma's military launched an ethnic cleansing campaign of rape,  arson, and mass murder against the Rohingya.   Despite the Burmese military's claims that their operations were in  response to attacks on police outposts by extremists, the evidence is  clear that the Burmese military had made extensive preparations to  carry out these operations. Their preparations included systematically  disarming Rohingya civilians, training and arming non-Rohingya  communities, and building up an unusually large military and security  presence in Rakhine, all in anticipation of attacks that included  extrajudicial executions, rape, expulsions, and mass burning of  Rohingya villages throughout Rakhine state.   The military's campaign of ethnic cleansing has forced more than  720,000 Rohingya--roughly 80 percent of the entire Rohingya population  in Burma--to flee for safety in Bangladesh, creating the world's worst  refugee crisis in recent history. The government and people of  Bangladesh have shown extraordinary generosity by providing safe harbor  to those fleeing violence in Burma and continuing to keep its border  open.   Bangladesh is at a tipping point. Already the world's most populous  country, there simply isn't enough space or capacity to house this new  population. Camp conditions for the Rohingya population are miserable.  Refugees are living in plastic and bamboo shelters dangerously perched  on the side of clay hills. Children have limited access to education.  While many would prefer not to rely on limited humanitarian aid, work  is tough to come by.   The day-to-day reality for the Rohingya people in Bangladesh is  bleak, and while many 1 day wish to return home to Burma, they  rightfully ask for their government to guarantee their safety and to  recognize their civil and political rights; yet so far, even these  basic demands are unmet.   Equally troubling, conditions for the Rohingya who stayed behind in  Burma remain perilous. Andrew Gilmour, UN Assistant Secretary-General  for Human Rights, recently declared that while the nature of their  persecution has changed, there persists a ``lower intensity campaign of  terror and forced starvation.''   Burmese officials continue to reject UN and other international  findings of ethnic cleansing, crimes against humanity, and,  potentially, genocide. In fact, the Burmese Government has relentlessly  blocked access to Rakhine state by many humanitarian groups,  independent media workers, and UN observers, in an attempt to prevent  the international community from assessing the very violations they  deny are happening. A New York Times journalist recently gained access  to Rakhine state and met Rohingya who described living in a constant  state of fear and repression. She also saw the burnt remnants of what  used to be Rohingya villages and visited repatriation centers that  appeared more like ``concentration camps.''   The horrific and ongoing human rights abuses committed against the  Rohingya demand a strong response from the United States and the  international community. I support the U.S. State Department's Bureau  of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, DRL, and other offices in  conducting fact-finding efforts analyzing over 1,000 interviews with  Rohingya civilians and documenting the scope and nature of the  atrocities committed. I urge Secretary Pompeo to publicly release the  entire report including any findings of crimes against humanity and  genocide.   Furthermore, I strongly urge this administration to lead the  international community in fully using all appropriate mechanisms to  secure accountability for the ethnic cleansing, mass atrocities, and  other potential grave crimes the Burmese military has committed against  the Rohingya. Accountability is essential if Burma is to continue on a  path of democratic reform and genuine national and ethnic  reconciliation.   This pathway for accountability includes calling for an  international, impartial, and independent investigation to gather  evidence on perpetrators, as well as working towards their eventual  prosecution. I sincerely hope that robust and legitimate investigations  will ensure that those who orchestrated and perpetrated these brutal  crimes are brought to justice and that all the people of Burma,  including the Rohingya, will one day be able to enjoy the fruits of an  inclusive and pluralistic democratic nation.                            ____________________
