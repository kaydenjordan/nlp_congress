 Mr. President, every woman in this country owes a debt of  gratitude to my friend, Congresswoman Patsy Takemoto Mink. Americans  probably know Patsy best for her fiery advocacy to pass title IX into  law. This landmark piece of gender equity legislation, which now bears  her name, has benefited millions of women and girls across our country.   But I would wager that very few people know about how Patsy changed  the course of history for women's equality and helped to enshrine the  right of women to control our own bodies in the Supreme Court.   Let me tell you a story. In 1970, the same year that Hawaii became  the first State in the country to decriminalize abortion, Patsy did  something no one had done before. She made women's rights a key issue  in a Supreme Court nomination when she testified against the nomination  of Judge G. Harrold Carswell.  [[Page S6478]]    In her testimony, Patsy brought up Judge Carswell's decision in the  case of Ida Phillips, a woman denied a factory job because she had  preschool-aged children. Of course, no such rule applied to fathers.   Judge Carswell, along with 10 of his colleagues on the Fifth Circuit  Court of Appeals, had refused to hear Ms. Phillips' case. Patsy told  the Senate Judiciary Committee: ``Judge Carswell demonstrated a total  lack of understanding of the concept of equality. . . . His vote  represented a vote against the right of women to be treated equally and  fairly under the law.''   When a Republican Senator tried to defend Judge Carswell by pointing  out that 10 other judges had also voted to refuse to hear the case,  Patsy responded: ``But the other nine are not up for appointment to the  Supreme Court.''   Patsy understood the critical role the Supreme Court plays in the  lives of every American. She pointed out to the committee that ``the  Supreme Court is the final guardian of our human rights. We must rely  totally upon its membership to sustain the basic values of our  society.''   Patsy's testimony marked a turning point in Judge Carswell's  nomination, which the Senate ultimately rejected. Her courageous action  paved the way for President Richard Nixon to appoint Justice Harry  Blackmun to the Court.   Then, 3 years later, Justice Blackmun wrote the landmark decision in  Roe v. Wade, recognizing a woman's constitutional right to control her  own body. Justice Blackmun, unlike Judge Carswell, understood the right  of women to be treated equally. Upon his retirement, he observed Roe  was, ``a step that had to be taken. . . . toward the full emancipation  of women.''   This story about Patsy is not very well known, but it underscores how  one person can make a difference and how one vote on the Supreme Court  can make a difference.   During his years on the Court, Justice Blackmun became a reliable  vote for racial and gender equality, and his decisions reflected an  understanding of how the Court's decisions impact the lives of millions  of Americans.   If Judge Carswell had been confirmed to the Supreme Court instead of  Justice Blackmun, Roe v. Wade would not exist as we know it, nor would  a host of civil rights protections for students and racial minorities.   Our Nation finds itself at a similar judicial crossroads today as we  debate whether Judge Amy Coney Barrett should replace Justice Ruth  Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court. The choice we face as Senators is  clear. It is the same choice Patsy Mink presented to the Senate 50  years ago. We can choose to protect equality for women, healthcare for  millions, and other basic values of our society, as Patsy put it, or we  can choose a Justice selected to do precisely the opposite: strike down  the Affordable Care Act, overturn Roe v. Wade, and continue to decide  cases like her conservative mentor, Justice Antonin Scalia. This is  neither an abstract nor a hypothetical choice.   President Trump repeatedly promised to appoint a Justice who would  eliminate the ACA and Roe v. Wade, and he took only 3 days after  Justice Ginsburg's death to pick Judge Barrett to fulfill this promise.  His selection was easy because Judge Barrett had already publicly  signaled that she opposed the Affordable Care Act and reproductive  rights.   Judge Barrett is on record criticizing Chief Justice Roberts for, as  she put it, ``push[ing] the Affordable Care Act beyond its plausible  meaning to save the statute'' in a case upholding the ACA in 2012.  Justice Scalia wrote the dissent in that case.   She also signed a newspaper ad committing to ``oppose abortion on  demand and defend the right to life from fertilization.'' The same ad  called for ``an end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. Wade.''   With Judge Barrett, President Trump and Senate Republicans know  exactly the kind of vote they are getting on the Supreme Court. That is  why they are rushing Judge Barrett onto the Court through this  hypocritical, illegitimate process.   In a little over 2 weeks, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments  in California v. Texas--a lawsuit where the Trump administration and 18  Republican State attorneys general are asking the Court to invalidate  the Affordable Care Act, like Justice Scalia voted to do in two earlier  cases.   My Republican colleagues know they can count on her to provide the  decisive fifth vote on the Supreme Court to strike down the ACA, to  help them win through the courts an outcome they tried and failed to  achieve 70 times--70 times--in Congress.   The consequences of Judge Barrett's vote to strike down the ACA would  be catastrophic. It would be catastrophic for the 20-plus million  Americans who obtain health coverage under the ACA and the 100 million- plus Americans who would lose the law's protections for people living  with preexisting conditions.   These are the types of real-world consequences Justice Ginsburg  placed at the core of her judicial philosophy and approach to the law,  which her conservative colleagues often ignored.   We saw this time and again in Justice Ginsburg's classic dissents in  cases like Shelby County v. Holder, Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire, and  Epic Systems v. Lewis. Judge Barrett sees things much differently.   When my Democratic colleagues and I pressed her about how she would  take the real-world impact of millions of people losing access to  healthcare into account, she said those are ``policy consequences'' for  Congress to address.   She also tried to parry our questions by using terms like  ``severability'' and testifying that protections for people with  preexisting conditions were not at issue in the Trump administration's  lawsuit. She ignored the fact that more than 100 million people with  preexisting conditions would be harmed if the lawsuit succeeds.   Not an issue? Give me a break.   My Republican colleagues hope that the American people will accept  these weak attempts to divert our attention, but they can't obscure the  real human costs of striking down the ACA. It is why my Democratic  colleagues and I have shared the stories of people Judge Barrett would  harm when she votes to strike down the ACA.   I want to share their stories again because their lives are what is  at stake in this nomination fight.   Jordan Ota, an elementary school teacher from Ewa Beach, has PNH--a  very rare blood condition. To treat it, she receives infusions of a  medication that costs around $500,000 per year without insurance. If  Judge Barrett strikes down the ACA, Jordan's insurance company could  put a lifetime cap on benefits, leaving her without coverage for her  lifesaving medication. Jordan's father Dean told me that ``without the  medicine, she will die.''   Kimberly Dickens from Raleigh, NC, couldn't afford health insurance  until the Affordable Care Act became law. Kimberly used her new  insurance to get a checkup and a mammogram that found her breast  cancer. With her health insurance, Kimberly was able to get a  mastectomy and has been cancer-free ever since. Kimberly said:         The ACA saved my life. . . . It scares me to think: If I       didn't have insurance, how far advanced would the cancer have       grown?    These powerful stories demonstrate the real-world danger of Amy  Barrett's judicial philosophy if she is confirmed to the Court. But  their healthcare is not the only fundamental right at risk for  Americans. We know this because Judge Barrett has also aligned herself  with the conservative wing of the Court, long led by her mentor,  Justice Scalia.   At her nomination ceremony, Judge Barrett announced that Justice  Scalia's ``judicial philosophy is mine too.'' Aligning herself so  closely with Justice Scalia has implications for a whole host of rights  and protections the Court has granted over the years.    Justice Scalia, for example, wrote dissents in the landmark cases  recognizing LGBTQ rights from Romer v. Evans to Lawrence v. Texas, and  United States v. Windsor. Most recently, he wrote a dissent in  Obergefell v. Hodges, sharply criticizing the majority for recognizing  a right to same-sex marriage that in his originalist view was not in  the Constitution.   Because Judge Barrett calls herself an originalist and shares Justice  Scalia's judicial philosophy, his decisions provide a preview of how  she would have ruled in those cases.   For example, although the Supreme Court has already affirmed marital  [[Page S6479]]  rights for LGBTQ Americans, Judge Barrett's radical views on precedent  put these rights at risk. Judge Barrett has argued that as part of her  duty, a Justice should ``enforce her best understanding of the  Constitution rather than a precedent she thinks clearly in conflict  with it.''   Clearly, Judge Barrett's confirmation would put Obergefell at risk,  and her would-be colleagues on the Court have taken notice.   During this nomination process, Justices Thomas and Alito--also  originalists--released an alarming statement in Davis v. Ermold, which  the Court declined to review. But these two Justices criticized  Obergefell for ``read[ing] a right to same-sex marriage into the 14th  Amendment, even though that right is found nowhere in the text.''   In effect, these two Justices invited a challenge to Obergefell by  calling it ``a problem that only [the Court] can fix.''   This type of signaling is a dangerous and increasingly common  practice among the Court's conservative wing. By making their views  known in this way, these Justices are inviting would-be litigants to  bring challenges to the Court so the Court can then use those  challenges to invalidate landmark precedent, which is what happened in  Janus v. AFSCME.   As a member of the Seventh Circuit, Judge Barrett has also  demonstrated a willingness to signal her views on precedent that could  have significant implications if she is confirmed to the Supreme Court.   One example came in Price v. City of Chicago, where Judge Barrett  joined a decision that upheld the so-called abortion clinic buffer zone  law. The decision made clear that her circuit court was forced to  uphold this law under the Supreme Court precedent, but it signaled a  strong disagreement with that precedent. The decision, which she  joined, criticized the precedent as ``incompatible'' with the First  Amendment and ``impos[ing] serious burdens.''   Judge Barrett's alignment with Justice Scalia, her radical views on  Supreme Court precedent, and her disregard for real-world impacts on  her decision making as a judge show how many rights and protections are  at risk: LGBTQ rights, voting rights, women's equality, healthcare--you  name it.   These rights didn't just materialize out of thin air. They came after  hard-fought battles and tremendous sacrifices from trailblazers like  Patsy Mink and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.   When Patsy called the Supreme Court ``the final guardian of our human  rights'' that ``sustains the basic values of our society,'' she deeply  understood what that meant--for women's equality, for civil rights, and  for so many other rights.   Republicans understand that clear majorities of Americans support the  ACA, a woman's right to choose, and the right for LGBTQ couples to  marry. Yet, because Republicans fear they are losing the election, they  are erasing Judge Barrett's nomination through a hypocritical and  illegitimate process to put her on the Court for life before voters can  make their voices fully heard.   But we have all seen the news coverage of thousands of voters  standing in line for hours on end in the cold and rain to make sure  their voices are heard and their votes are counted.   Clearly, the voters understand what is at stake. They are doing their  part. Now it is time for the Senate to do ours by rejecting Judge  Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court.   By doing so, we can stand up for what Patsy Mink called the ``basic  values of society'' and against Donald Trump and Senate Republicans'  assault on healthcare, a woman's right to control her own body, and  LGBTQ rights, among so many others.   This nomination fight is close to being over, but the broader fight  for the future of our Nation continues   I yield the floor.
