 My personal view is that he richly deserves       impeachment.        Unidentified Speaker. I'm here at an impeachment rally, and       we are ready to impeach the. . . .         That is a myth.        Unidentified Speaker. I hope someone burns down your whole       precinct with all y'all inside.        Mr. Velshi. It is not, generally speaking, unruly.         The effect of impeachment is to overturn the       popular will of the voters. We must not overturn an election       and remove a President from office except to defend our       system of government or our constitutional liberties against       the dire threat, and we must not do so without an       overwhelming consensus of the American people. There must       never be a narrowly voted impeachment or an impeachment       supported by one of our major political parties and opposed       by the other. Such an impeachment will produce the       divisiveness and bitterness in our politics for years to come       and will call into question the very legitimacy of our       political institutions.        The American people have heard the allegations against the       President, and they overwhelmingly oppose impeaching him.       They elected President Clinton. They still support him. We       have no right to overturn the considered judgment of the       American people.        Mr. Speaker, the case against the President has not been       made. There is far from sufficient evidence to support the       allegations, and the allegations, even if proven true, do not       rise to the level of impeachable offenses.        Mr. Speaker, this is clearly a partisan railroad job. The       same people who today tell us we must impeach the President       for lying under oath almost to a person voted last year to       re-elect a Speaker who had just admitted lying to Congress in       an official proceeding.        The American people are watching, and they will not forget.       You may have the votes, you may have the muscle, but you do       not have the legitimacy of a national consensus or of a       constitutional imperative. This partisan coup d'etat will go       down in infamy in the history of this Nation.        Thank you, Mr. Speaker.        I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Counsel SCHOEN. Thank you.
