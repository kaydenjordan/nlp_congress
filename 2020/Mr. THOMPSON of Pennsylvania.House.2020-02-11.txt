 Mr. Speaker, last week marked National  School Counselors Week.   School counselors play a valuable role in the lives of our Nation's  students. They help students navigate challenges, both academic and  personal, through all phases of education. But some counselors truly go  above and beyond.   Recently, I had the pleasure of joining the American School Counselor  Association for a meeting, where I met Laura Ross, the 2020 School  Counselor of the Year. Laura's co-workers have called her a true hero  and a champion for the work that she has done at Five Forks Middle  School.   School counselors like Laura have big responsibilities and even  greater opportunities to make a difference in the lives of young  people. When people choose to dedicate their careers to providing  support and guidance for these students, they are better equipped to  tackle personal and professional challenges and better prepared to  enter the workforce.   A successful career begins with a well-rounded view of what the  workforce entails. Effective counseling can assist learners in better  understanding their educational opportunities and career prospects,  while preventing students from taking on sizable debt.   H.R. 5092, the Counseling for Career Choice Act, seeks to ensure high  school students are made aware of their educational options and career  prospects prior to graduation. To do that, the bill would establish a  grant program for $40 million to invest in career counseling programs  for high school students.   It also invests in professional development opportunities for  counselors working with these students so counselors can do their jobs  to the best of their ability and stay up to date on workforce trends  and postsecondary opportunities. This includes 2- and 4-year degree  programs, but that also includes certificate programs, internships, and  apprenticeships.   Mr. Speaker, we all owe a debt of gratitude to our Nation's school  counselors. All year long, their service and support of our Nation's  young people is greatly appreciated.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the Butler County Community College on their recent  achievement. The college was recognized as the number one community  college in Pennsylvania.   This is quite an achievement, but Butler County Community College is  no stranger to success. For the fifth time since 2015, BCCC has been  recognized as the best of the best in the Commonwealth. This annual  accolade, presented by BestColleges.com, assesses academic quality,  affordability, and online competency to determine who provides the best  overall experience for students.   Butler County Community College is setting learners of all ages and  backgrounds up for success by providing an affordable education that  readies students for a 21st century workforce. Thanks to this model,  BCCC students are graduating with more opportunities and less debt.   I am proud of the educational excellence that Butler County Community  College has to offer for students in Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional  District and the surrounding area, and they are certainly well  deserving of this recognition.                            ____________________
