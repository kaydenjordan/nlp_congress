 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  rule for the Honoring our PACT Act, which includes the Camp Lejeune  Justice Act. This legislation would allow marines and their families  who were exposed to contaminated drinking water at Camp Lejeune over 34  years--34 years of neglect and denial--finally to pursue their long  overdue day in court.   Toxicity rates in Camp Lejeune's water were staggering. They ranged  from 240 to 3,400 times what is permitted by today's national safety  standards. This greatly increased the risk of cancers, adverse birth  outcomes, and other medical tragedies. And now many veterans and their  families are suffering from no legal recourse.   The Camp Lejeune Justice Act will correct an anomaly in North  Carolina law by providing a legal pathway for affected veterans and  their families to pursue fair compensation, which would already be  permitted had their exposure occurred anywhere else except the State of  North Carolina.   Today's effort is a culmination of the decades-long bipartisan  campaign to  [[Page H1193]]  provide servicemembers affected an opportunity for justice long  deferred. First by Congressman Brad Miller and Senator Burr, as well as  the late Congressman Walter Jones.   I am also grateful for the tireless advocacy of the affected marines  and their families, the sustained efforts of diverse groups of  supporters, and my congressional colleagues, including the bill's  sponsors, Congressmen Matt Cartwright and Greg Murphy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the rule for this Honoring our  PACT Act and with it the adoption of the Camp Lejeune Justice Act, a  critical step to honor the promises we have made to our veterans.
