 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2142) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 170 Manhattan Avenue in Buffalo, New York, as the  ``Indiana Hunt-Martin Post Office Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2142         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. INDIANA HUNT-MARTIN POST OFFICE BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 170 Manhattan Avenue in Buffalo, New York,       shall be known and designated as the ``Indiana Hunt-Martin       Post Office Building''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Indiana Hunt-Martin Post Office       Building''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2142, to designate the  facility of the United States Postal Service located at 170 Manhattan  Avenue in Buffalo, New York, as the Indiana Hunt-Martin Post Office  Building.   Mrs. Indiana Hunt-Martin was born on May 30, 1922, in Georgia. Her  family moved to western New York when she was in elementary school, and  she was one of only two Black students in her high school class.   She aspired to a business career but faced limited opportunities and  had to take jobs picking peaches and cleaning restrooms at a TNT  factory.   In 1944, Mrs. Hunt-Martin joined the newly formed Women's Army Corps.  The Women's Army Corps had more than 800 Black female soldiers serving  in the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, known as the Six  Triple Eight. The Six Triple Eight was the only all-African-American  Women's Army Corps.   Mrs. Hunt-Martin was one of the original 500 African-American female  soldiers who were chosen to sail across the Atlantic. The soldiers  feared they would not make it alive because they were being chased by a  German U-boat. Fortunately, they arrived safely in Liverpool, England.   In England, the soldiers were assigned to horrific conditions,  staying in dilapidated schools infested with rats and parasites.  Regardless of the conditions, the Six Triple Eight cleared a backlog of  more than 17 million pieces of mail and packages in only 3 months.   They were then relocated to Rouen and Paris, France, where they  continued adhering to their motto, ``No mail, low morale.''   In February 1946, the Six Triple Eight returned to a segregated  United States. The unit received honorable discharges when they were  disbanded but no recognition of their accomplishments.   Mrs. Hunt-Martin went on to have a distinguished career at the New  York Department of Labor, working there for 41 years and retiring in  1987.   She met her husband at the New York Department of Labor, with whom  she had a loving daughter, Janice Martin.   Throughout the years, Mrs. Hunt-Martin was an active life member of  several veterans organizations and mentored young African-American  women who chose to serve in the military.   She was inducted into the New York State Veterans Hall of Fame and  received several service medals.   Mrs. Hunt-Martin passed away peacefully on September 21, 2020, at the  age of 98.   I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in honoring this American  hero by naming the post office at 170 Manhattan Avenue as the Indiana  Hunt-Martin Post Office Building.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Higgins), the author of this important bill.    Madam Speaker, with no further speakers, I urge passage  of H.R. 2142, and I yield back the balance of my time.
