 Mr. President, I wish to recognize an  outstanding educator from the State of Maryland. John Ceschini has been  an extraordinary leader in the area of arts education. His work has, in  short, transformed this field and the lives of countless students.   For the last 4 years, Mr. Ceschini was the arts integration officer  for Prince George's County schools. During that time, he played an  integral role in the expansion of the arts integration program, which  is now the largest in the country.   Previously, Mr. Ceschini was the executive director of education in  the Maryland Schools Alliance. In 2011, he received the National Arts  Education Association's Distinguished Service Award, and in 2010, he  received the Innovator of the Year Award from the ``Daily Record'' for  his efforts to support and expand the arts integration initiative  across Maryland.   Mr. Ceschini served as principal of two elementary schools that  developed nationally recognized arts integration programs under his  leadership. One of those schools, Kensington Parkwood Elementary School  in Kensington, MD, was the 2007 recipient of the Creative Ticket  National Schools of Distinction Award. In 2006, the school received the  New and Emerging Art School Award from the International Network of  Schools for the Advancement of Arts Education. Before that, Mr.  Ceschini served as principal of Rockledge Elementary School in Bowie, a  Maryland Blue Ribbon school that received national recognition for its  arts program. In fact, Harvard University included Rockledge in its  ``Why Arts Survive'' research and named the program as one of eight  promising arts schools in the Nation.   Mr. Ceschini was one of four educators across the Nation who received  the BRAVO Network National Arts Education award for his commitment to  arts education. His other awards included the Washington Post  Outstanding Educational Leader Award, the Prince George's Arts Council  ABE Award for outstanding elementary arts program, the Prince George's  Chamber of Commerce Outstanding Administrator Award, and the Bowie  Outstanding Citizen Award.   Mr. Ceschini has been an advocate for arts education across the world  and has demonstrated how the arts can play an essential role in any  school curriculum. There can be no doubt that he is one of our  country's most effective leaders in arts education. Now, as he begins  his well-earned retirement, I call upon my colleagues to join me in  congratulating and expressing our appreciation to John Ceschini on his  outstanding service.                            ____________________
