 Madam Chair, I thank Chairman Neal for yielding me time.   Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3. I think this is one  of the most important issues facing America today. The American people  are hungering for a solution to this problem.    On January 11, 2017, President-elect Trump said, when referring to  the pharmaceutical companies, ``these guys are getting away with  murder.''   For too long, Big Pharma has cashed in because our government, the  largest purchaser of prescription drugs in the world, has been  prohibited from negotiating lower drug prices. Americans pay nearly  four times as much for prescription drugs as people in other countries.   H.R. 3 will finally give the United States Government the power to  negotiate lower prices. It will stop unjustified price hikes and put a  cap on Medicare part D beneficiary out-of-pocket costs.   The $500 billion in cost savings will be used to create historic  Medicare improvements, such as dental, vision, and hearing benefits.  This bill will also provide financial support for more Medicare  beneficiaries, will boost funding for scientific innovation, will  invest in community health centers, and will provide more money to  fight the opioid epidemic.   I thank Chairman Neal for also including a provision I wrote to help  protect seniors that will require Medicare prescription drug plans to  publicly disclose information about when beneficiaries are denied at  the pharmacy counter.                                time  2015    I want to thank Congressman Reed for helping in that legislation. I  am honored to cosponsor this historic piece of legislation.
