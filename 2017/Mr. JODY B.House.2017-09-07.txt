 HICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman  Frelinghuysen and Interior Subcommittee Chairman Calvert for their  efforts on this legislation, and I thank them for the opportunity to  speak today.   I am committed to pursuing a comprehensive all-of-the-above energy  strategy, and I would like to take this time to engage in a colloquy on  section 438 of this bill, pertaining to offshore wind development. As a  representative from a coastal area, I want to ensure that all offshore  energy development is pursued in a pragmatic manner.   Section 438 restricts funding for the Department of the Interior to  administer offshore wind leases within 24 nautical miles off the coast  of Maryland. This language hinders offshore wind development by  imposing unprecedented and burdensome requirements on three existing  leases.   Typically, offshore wind turbines are constructed roughly 12 nautical  miles from the coastline, which is generally out of sight from shore.  By doubling the setback, section 438 unreasonably restricts these  projects and sets a poor policy precedent for future development.   Furthermore, modifying the terms and conditions of the leases  violates the sanctity of the lease and creates considerable uncertainty  for companies pursuing any offshore wind project.   It is critical that we establish regulatory and contractual certainty  in all areas of natural resource development. America's offshore wind  industry is in its infancy, and the policies and precedents that we set  today will affect investment long into the future.   The language contained in section 438 is concerning for this reason,  and I look forward to working with the gentleman from Maryland in the  future to find a more appropriate solution.
