 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, we are in a climate crisis, and it is going to take  American leadership and ingenuity to solve it. But we think we can  create jobs and a lot of opportunity when we solve the climate crisis.  But what we are seeing right now are devastating health and economic  consequences of climate change here all across America, whether it is  wildfires out West, flooding in the midsection. We are approaching  hurricane season with great trepidation. Extreme heat.   We have got to act urgently, guided by the science, working in  concert with our allies across the globe to provide a livable climate  for all Americans, especially for future generations.   We have got to harness the technological innovation of the Moon Shot.  We have got to harness the creativity of our entrepreneurs, the  strength of our workers, and the moral force of this great Nation that  is working to establish justice for all. Because I believe that,  working together, we will be able to avert the worst impacts of this  climate emergency and build a stronger, healthier, fairer America.                                time  1945    But let's look at what is happening right now. People know this. The  last 7 years were the hottest on record. You don't have to tell that to  the folks out West right now. They are living through some of the  hottest days--the hottest, driest days.   This is a departure from the 20th century average temperature. It  just seems like these hotter days, the longer, hotter summers, are more  frequent. And the science tells us that is true.   Why is this happening? Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is at record  levels. People thought that, during the pandemic, greenhouse gases  would dip and that might provide some salvation from the worst impacts  of climate. But, see, these gases build up in the atmosphere. You don't  get a bonus for any year.   In fact, NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,  has said no, despite the pandemic, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is  at a record high.   This creates enormous costs on families and businesses here in  America but also all across the planet. It impacts the air we breathe.  It creates very severe health consequences. Think about the folks who  have to work outside in the extreme heat and more polluted air while  coming out of a pandemic.   Then, there is the cost, not just to the bottom line of the Federal  budget, but the cost to all of us. In fact, last year alone, we  suffered through about $100 billion, $96 billion, in damages from  weather and climate disasters. That is just 1 year.   This is an enormous wake-up call for our great country and people all  across the planet. We have waited too long to take ambitious action.  The time is now. The time is urgent.   We don't have any more time for half measures, so we intend now to  hammer out the most ambitious climate legislation that we have ever  seen in order to answer the moral call that we have to future  generations to make sure we give them a livable planet.   Mr. Speaker, we are joined tonight by a number of colleagues, who are  going to speak from the heart and speak with great intelligence to  provide a little science, a little know-how. I am really proud to stand  with them on the floor of the House tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, Congressman Casten, for bringing  his intellect and his passion for solving the climate crisis to this  Congress. It is needed now more than ever.    Mr. Speaker, hearing my colleague speak with  such  [[Page H2878]]  passion and such intellect really does give me hope that we have the  tools necessary to tackle the climate crisis. But I think we also need  to think about climate as a climate opportunity, and there are a few of  these.   Our newest colleague, Congresswoman Stansbury from New Mexico kind of  hit on it. And it goes back to--I want to thank Mr. Casten--last year  before the pandemic hit, Mr. Casten was kind enough to invite me to  Chicago where we heard from environmental justice leaders. I also had  the opportunity to travel to Detroit. I have listened to folks who are  demanding greater equity all across America.   Back home in Tampa, Florida, I see it; I understand that now the  climate crisis presents us with a generational opportunity to rebuild  our country and our infrastructure, so we are not leaving communities  behind and we are not leaving any American behind.   We can hammer out these investments that will help us rebuild the  economy. Mr. Casten knows these examples quite well.   Decades ago, unfortunately, the Federal Government put interstate  highways right through the center of many communities. The harms from  the pollution still linger today. In fact, Black Americans are exposed  to 21 percent more fine, particulate matter pollution than the average  American. I just don't think we can pass an infrastructure package that  ignores these injustices. We are going to have to create these new  opportunities in solving the climate crisis, creating good paying jobs,  but also lifting up Americans and American communities that have  carried the burden of pollution.    Mr. Speaker, I think that is one of the  reasons why President Biden's American Jobs Plan targets 40 percent of  the benefits of our clean energy and clean infrastructure investments  to disadvantaged communities. I think that is smart policy.   I think the gentleman is right. Right now, as we move into our clean  energy future, President Biden has the goal of really helping  communities that need revitalization. When you think about the hard  work in a coal mine or out in the field, we owe such a debt of  gratitude to our coal miners and the energy workers who have powered  America. They have made it what it is over the last century. They  ushered in the economic progress that we enjoy today.   But we now know, according to the science, that our overdependence on  coal and fossil fuels and fracked gas has led to a crisis that now  threatens our way of life. I wish it weren't so, but we have to now, at  this fork in the road, decide that our moral obligation to future  generations comes first.   With all of the opportunities that clean energy and greater and  stronger and healthier communities can provide, we have got to hammer  this out through the American Jobs Plan and make sure that we protect  our economy, we protect our national security, our health, our  beautiful natural resources from sea to shining sea, and the air that  we breathe.    But we have some choices to make. We can double down on the status  quo, even as these climate-fueled disasters claim more lives and they  hurt the pocketbooks of folks.   I think of my neighbors back home in Florida now, the so-called  Sunshine State. Boy, we have a lot of work to do to capture the power  of the sun through solar energy, but we are paying more now because we  have longer and hotter summers, it means AC bills are going up.   We have these intense flood events, so we are paying more for flood  insurance and stormwater costs. Meanwhile a lot of these energy  companies have kind of gotten off the hook over time.   What does the gentleman say about that?    Mr. Speaker, well, what has been so  fascinating is there are so many people in the room because they  understand the opportunities, the job-creating opportunities through  the American Jobs Plan.   Here we go. The American Jobs Plan will create 2.7 million new jobs.  So let's talk about some of those jobs. I think about some of our  colleagues who represent communities that have seen jobs go overseas  over time, our industrial base.   We know what President Biden has proposed will help revitalize those  communities; plug those abandoned coal mines; plug the abandoned wells;  just plain plug the leaks of methane gas that are so damaging to the  climate.   We think we can create millions and millions of jobs through a new  CCC, a Climate Conservation Corps. We can strengthen our communities at  home. I know we have got a lot of seawalls that need repair, a lot of  replanting of trees and mangroves to help protect us from these very  costly events. We know we need to modernize the electric grid across  America.   Representative Casten, that is going to create an enormous amount of  jobs in the Midwest because a lot of the renewable resources, your  solar power, wind power, it is largely in the Midwest. We have got to  build the modern electric grid.   Look at this horrendous catastrophe in Texas just a few months ago  because the electric grid there was not connected. It wasn't  modernized. It wasn't resilient. People lost their lives because of the  strange, climate-fueled winter storm in Texas.   We are going to create a lot of jobs just modernizing and making the  grid more resilient. And I haven't even gotten to the wind power,  offshore wind, wind in the Midwest.   This is our future. This is why I like to think of it not just in the  terms of a climate crisis, but a climate opportunity. And I think that  is why President Biden says that every time he hears people talk  climate, he hears jobs, jobs, jobs.    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Casten is right. You know,  listing off all the job opportunities, the transportation sector, he is  right.   And this is a global competitiveness issue. We have got to win this  race with China and the Europeans. They are building those electric  vehicles.   But how exciting was it to see the announcement from Ford and GM?   I can't wait to see this electrified F-150 truck, the Lightning.   This is an enormous opportunity, especially in the industrial Midwest  that has really seen a lot of job loss over the years to China. We are  going to get back on this, and the only way we can do it is through  making these targeted investments.   We want to build the electric vehicles that the world drives. We want  to make sure that that charging infrastructure goes coast to coast in  every community.   But it is going to take the focus of America. And the good news is,  all Americans--I don't care if you are a Democrat or Republican or  Independent, or what, they understand that clean energy is the future;  and that if we do it right, we can lift communities that need it; and  we can create millions and millions of jobs.   Now, I started with the science. And we heard from some outstanding  colleagues, and we are going to hear a lot more from them in the coming  weeks as we hammer out the American Jobs Plan.   But there was one witness at one of our early hearings, Dr.  Abdelhadi, who is an expert, who has been focused on climate for many  years, and I want to just remind what he said.   He said: The limited actions to address this climate crisis have  resulted in lost opportunity and have produced a challenge that is even  greater than it was even a few years ago. With political and society  will, and with strategic and scientifically informed action that  considers all of the dimensions of climate change, the dangerous  trajectory we are on can be altered, such that our generation's story  can be one of success and not failure.
