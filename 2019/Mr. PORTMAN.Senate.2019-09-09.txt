 Mr. President, I rise today to pay special  tribute to an exceptional officer of the U.S. Navy, CAPT Mike Vitali.  Captain Vitali currently serves as the senior military adviser for the  Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense Integration  and Defense Support for Civil Authorities and will be released from  Active Duty after more than 24 years of active military service on  October 1, 2019. As a native of Maple Heights, OH, it is my distinct  privilege to recognize his storied career.  [[Page S5358]]    CAPT Mike Vitali began his naval career as a midshipman in the Naval  Reserve Officer Training Corps at Purdue University in West Lafayette,  IN. Captain Vitali was commissioned as an ensign upon his graduation  from Purdue in 1994 and then went to the Pensacola, FL, where he earned  his naval flight officer wings of gold on August 16, 1996.   As a newly minted naval flight officer, Mike earned his initial  qualifications in the S-3B Viking at Sea Control Squadron Forty-One,  VS-41, and then joined the VS-35 Blue Wolves at Naval Air Station North  Island in San Diego, CA. Captain Vitali went on to complete two  deployments aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln in support of Operations  SOUTHERN WATCH and DESERT FOX in the skies over Iraq. In October 2000,  he returned to VS-41 as an instructor where he trained replacement  pilots and navigators in S-3B operations and tactics. As a result of  the Viking Sundown program, Captain Vitali led the fleet's transition  program and completed training in the P-3C Orion at Patrol Squadron  Thirty, VP-30, in Jacksonville, FL. He completed tours with the VP-16  War Eagles in Jacksonville and VP-4 Skinny Dragons in Kaneohe Bay, HI,  where he conducted antisubmarine, maritime interdiction, counterdrug,  and counterterrorism operations while deployed to Sicily, Djibouti, El  Salvador, the Philippines, and Okinawa.   From 2008-2010, he served at the U.S. Special Operations Command,  where he coordinated the update of SOCOMs memorandums of agreement with  the military departments. On May 25, 2012, he assumed command of the  VP-45 Pelicans in Jacksonville, FL, and successfully led the squadron  through a rigorous work-up cycle and SEVENTH Fleet Deployment to  Okinawa where the squadron supported 17 detachments and logged over  3,200 flight hours.   After command, Captain Vitali reported to the Navy Office of  Legislative Affairs, serving as Deputy Director of the Senate Liaison  Office, where he supported several of my colleagues and their staffs on  congressional delegations around the world. In May 2015, Captain Vitali  reported to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Legislative Affairs, serving as the Director of Senate Affairs advising  the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs on all  matters pertaining to the U.S. Senate, especially the confirmation  process. He was directly responsible for the Senate confirmation of 68  Presidentially appointed civilian positions within the Department of  Defense across two administrations to include the Secretary of Defense,  Deputy Secretary of Defense, three Service Secretaries, four Under  Secretaries to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, three Service  Under Secretaries, and numerous Assistant Secretaries of Defense. His  solid relationships and unmatched credibility with senior officials  were indispensable in maintaining a high level of support and dialogue  with Senators and their staffs.   Throughout his career, Captain Vitali has logged over 2,570 flight  hours and 267 carrier landings.   I ask that you join me, our colleagues, and CAPT Mike Vitali's family  and friends in saluting this distinguished officer's many contributions  and sacrifices in defense of our great Nation. It is fitting that the  Senate today publicly recognizes his service and wishes him, his wife  Tracy, and their children Gabrielle, Isabella, and Michael health,  happiness, and success in the years to come. Congratulations, Captain  Vitali, on completing an exceptional and exemplary career.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, today six police officers from the Dayton  Police Department were awarded our Nation's highest honor for law  enforcement. These were the six individuals who stood tall at 1 a.m. on  August 4, in Dayton, OH, standing up to a shooter, engaging him within  30 seconds of the tragedy beginning. Nine people had already died.  Another 27 were injured. By standing up to him and doing it so quickly  and responding so effectively, they saved so many lives.   They put their lives in danger because they were standing between the  shooter and innocent civilians who were out that evening, having a  celebration, enjoying themselves, not imagining this horror could be  committed. These six individuals were well trained. As Chief Rick Biehl  of the Dayton Police Department has told me--and he is a friend of  mine--the training worked, and he is right. It was more than just  training. It was instinct. It was heart. It was their willingness to  step up as soon as they saw the danger and run into the danger,  literally.   President Trump today awarded the highest honor to these individuals.  When he did so, he said: ``The light from these intrepid souls defies  the darkness and confronted the most sinister danger.''   Well said.   Sergeant William Knight and Officers Vincent Carter, David Denlinger,  Ryan Nabel, Brian Rolfes, and Jeremy Campbell deserve the gratitude of  all of us for stepping into the breach.   Tonight I will have the opportunity to be with them on this floor.  They are going to come see the world's greatest deliberative body. I  know that everyone in the Senate joins me in expressing our gratitude  to them for the work they do every single day to protect all of us and  for their extraordinary bravery that horrible night. We thank them, and  we say God bless them for what they do.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  now proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 116, S. 349.    I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported  substitute amendment be agreed to and that the bill, as amended, be  considered read the third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill, as amended.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 125, S. 1689.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Environment and Public Works be discharged from further  consideration of H.R. 831 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    I yield back my time.                            ____________________
