 Mr. President, I have the honor of remembering Mr.  Richard E. ``Dick'' Haines as he is laid to rest at the Western Montana  State Veterans Cemetery with full military honors on April 6, 2018.   Dick was born in Billings, MT, on September 28, 1936, and spent much  of his life in service to our great State. Dick graduated from Montana  State University in 1959 with a degree in mechanical engineering, while  also completing the Army's ROTC program. After serving in the U.S. Army  as an officer teaching marksmanship skills and shooting on Army rifle  teams, Dick began his engineering career. In 1962, he was offered an  engineering position with the U.S. Forest Service. During his career,  he served on the Kootenai, Kaniksu, Clearwater, Deer Lodge, and  Siskiyou Forests. His years of public service, however, did not stop  there. From 1999 through 2004, Dick served in the Montana State House  of Representatives, where he played a key role in the establishment of  the Western Montana State Veterans Cemetery. In addition, he served a  total of 8 years on the Missoula City Council and served for countless  years with many other local organizations.   When Dick wasn't serving his constituents or volunteering, he enjoyed  Montana's beautiful outdoor recreational activities, including hunting,  fishing, hiking and backpacking. His selfless public service and  commitment to volunteering will never be forgotten.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing  [[Page S1944]]  Darby Superintendent Loyd Rennaker for his 24 years of service to the  Darby School District.   After graduating from Darby himself, Loyd furthered his education at  the University of Montana Western. With degrees to teach high school  math and chemistry, Loyd first taught for 1 year in Malta before  returning to Darby. Since then, he has served the school district in a  number of roles, including as high school math and science teacher,  elementary school principal, high school principal, athletic director,  coach, and superintendent.   As superintendent, Loyd helped bring high-speed internet to the town  of Darby, providing more opportunity to students and teachers, as well  as the whole Darby community.   Loyd Rennaker is a wonderful example of Montana's rich heritage of  deep community ties. He has had a great career at Darby schools and has  loved teaching and watching students grow into successful citizens.  After 25 years of investing in the next generation, Loyd will retire  from the Darby School District in June.   Thank you, Loyd, for all your hard work and service.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing 14-year-old Aidan Veress for winning the Treasure State  Spelling Bee for the second year in a row. Aidan is no stranger to  success when it comes to spelling. He has competed in spelling bees  since the second grade and has won the Park County Spelling Bee 3 years  in a row.   When asked about his preparation for success, Aidan talks about his  love for reading. Beyond memorization of words, Aidan also studies  pronunciation, the definitions, and even the rules for various  languages. His advice for younger Montanans who wish to win spelling  bees is this: Read often, study by yourself and with friends, properly  enunciate, push yourself to grow your vocabulary, and stay calm.   Aidan dreams of going to college 1 day and perhaps even working in a  STEM field, but for right now, he is busy reading, hiking, camping,  traveling, playing basketball and video games, and making Montana  proud. This two-time State champ will represent Montana in the Scripps  National Spelling Bee in Washington, DC, this May.   Congratulations, Aidan, you make us Montana proud.                            ____________________
