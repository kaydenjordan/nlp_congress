 Madam Speaker, I rise today in response to my good friend  from Maryland who just spoke. As one of those 27 who voted with the  Democrats on that previous resolution, I stand in opposition today  because this is a sham.   You are using a commemorative coin bill on the floor of the House so  we cannot debate the merits of this constitutional question. That is a  shame. And just on that basis alone, I vote ``no.''   You are damn right we should, as Members of Congress, exercise our  constitutional authority, and we need to come back to this question and  debate honestly and openly. When we put our men and women in harm's  way, we should set aside our Democrat and Republican colors and say:  Let's stand as Americans.   So if you want to use this sham process to shame me, I will accept  that because I will do the right thing each and every day.    Vote ``no'' on these amendments. Vote ``no'' on this sham, and let's  have a real debate as Members of Congress do in our constitutional  responsibility.
