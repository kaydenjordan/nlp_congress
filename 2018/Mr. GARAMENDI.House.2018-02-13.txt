 Mr. Speaker, I was trying to add up the number of  times that we have been here on floor over the last decade to talk  about infrastructure. I suspect it is maybe 20 or 30 times that we have  talked about it, and this last weekend, guess what happened on Monday.  The President decides to talk about infrastructure. So here we are. On  Tuesday, we are going to pick up the issue of infrastructure.   Let me just take a quick tour. Since they don't allow movies or  slides here on the floor, we are going to run through these fast.  [[Page H1108]]    Some of you remember this. This was 1 year ago yesterday when the  Oroville Dam spillway gave way and we had the biggest waterfall in the  entire world. It came very close to wiping out 200,000 people--bad  maintenance problem.   Or maybe this one. This is not the bridge to nowhere. This is the  Interstate 5 bridge between Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia. It  collapsed, and I-5 didn't work.   Or maybe this one. Oh, I think you have heard about this. That would  be the water in Flint, Michigan. Still haven't solved the entire  problem, but maybe several thousand kids and families were drinking  contaminated water, water contaminated with lead.   And I didn't need to go all the way back to Flint, Michigan, to find  a problem. In my own State of California, many communities are facing  the same problem: either contaminated water or no water.   We have got an infrastructure problem: dams breaking, bridges  falling, water contaminated. Are you wondering why? Well, this is  illustrative.   You see, way, way back in 1973, we were spending somewhere about $10  billion a year on clean water and sanitation, drinking water. And over  the years, we have seen a decline. This is constant dollars, 2014  dollars. We have seen a decline in the purchasing power so that, in  2016, we were somewhere around $2 billion, so from 10 to 2.   Do you wonder why we have a problem? We are not spending the money on  it.   And so the American Society of Civil Engineers comes out with an  annual report card. Now, if your kids sent home this report card, you  might have a serious conversation with them.   So Donald Trump comes into office and, whoa, we have got an  infrastructure problem. And he comes up with a solution to address this  report card from the American Society of Civil Engineers: oh, aviation,  D; bridges, C-plus; dams, D; drinking water, D.   Let's go over here; rail is a B. That is good. But most of those are  private companies.   Ports, a C-plus; parks and recreation, D; schools, a D-plus; solid  waste, transit, D, D, D, all the way down. Yep, we have got a problem.  We have got a serious problem.   And so what does it mean if we were to solve the problem? Well, here,  let's solve that problem. We will turn this around. Well, the problem  is all of those D's that you saw.   So what if we were to spend $1--how about $1 billion--on  transportation infrastructure, the return to the economy is somewhere  around $3.54; or, for every $1 billion that we invest in transportation  and infrastructure, 21,671 jobs. A 6-year bill with at least $100  billion of annual funding supports 2.18 million American jobs.   Now, what is it that our esteemed President proposed? Well, here is  his infrastructure plan: He cuts more than $168 billion over the next  10 years from existing transportation and infrastructure programs. He  provides Wall Street with an opportunity to invest and slashes the  Federal investments and passes the buck to the cities and the counties  in the State. That is his infrastructure plan.   Oh, did I tell you he said he had $200 billion that he was going to  use to leverage $1.3 trillion of private money? Well, it doesn't really  work. And we are going to talk about that because what actually  happens, that $200 billion that is so beautiful, so awesome,  incredible--what is it?   Well, let's see. I have already said that, from the highway safety  programs, total, $122 billion; from the TIGER grants, which are very  popular, that go out to local entities to build specific transportation  programs like intermodal--train, bus, rail, highway stations--cuts that  by $5 billion; Amtrak, cuts that by $7.5 billion over the next 10  years; rural air service, cuts by $590 million; the Army Corps of  Engineers, cuts that by $10.1 billion over the next years.   These are real programs. So what is that $200 billion that the  President takes such pride in presenting to the American public? It is  money that is already spent on infrastructure projects. There is zero-- no, nada, no new money. He is simply taking money from those programs  that I just described and transferring it to a new set of programs  that, well, he will probably put T-R-U-M-P in gold across the top of it  and say: Look what we have done.   All you have done is to create administrative chaos. Not one nickel  of new money. It is the repurposing of existing dollars and  transferring it to new programs which, instead of 80 percent Federal  money to 20 percent local money, he flips it on its head, and now the  Federal Government will spend 20 percent and the local governments and  State governments will spend 80 percent.   Huh? How does that work? Where is the Federal investment? No new  money. And instead of the Federal Government being the big partner, the  Federal Government becomes the minor partner. What is that all about?   Well, unless you happen to be a Wall Street baron and you want to buy  Dulles Airport, in which case his program would pony up 80 percent of  the money and the private investor would put up 20 percent of the  money; and I guarantee air travelers, international and domestic, would  be thoroughly paying higher fees for the privilege of going to Dulles,  which is now a private airport. It doesn't make much sense.    Or maybe you want to travel on Interstate 5 from Mexico to Canada. He  would propose that we turn Interstate 5, all the way up the West Coast,  into a privately held toll road, of which, presumably, 80 percent would  be paid for by some loan or some grant from the Federal Government and  20 percent by some Wall Street investors.   Final point, and then I want to turn to my colleagues, as I said, we  have been here on the floor perhaps 20 or 30 times over the last  several years talking about infrastructure. I will tell you this: The  Democrats are proposing a better deal for America. We want to invest in  America, and we want it made in America.   Oh, by the way, in the President's proposal is the elimination of the  Buy America standards and the Davis-Bacon fair wage program.   So we have a better way of doing it, and we are going to spend a  little bit of tonight talking about how we might have a better real  deal for America, not some fake program that doesn't have any new  money.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the Congressman from North Carolina (Mr.  Price) to talk about infrastructure.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Price for the specific  details. I am glad that he brought up the environment issues. They  certainly need to be discussed.   And he is quite correct, the FAST Act, which is now just 2 years old,  significantly moved projects faster through the entire program--I  suppose we ought to say the FAST Act had some logic to it--and still  maintained the underlying strong desire to protect our environment.   Climate change: he couldn't be more correct about that, and the  specific programs that he mentioned that the President intends to cut.   If this was some sort of a--I don't know--State fair, and you had  somebody on the boardwalk with the shell game, that is what is being  played here. Programs that are working--he mentioned the TIGER program  and the funding programs that the States and local municipalities know  how to use and are now planning to put their own money in--the  President would terminate those and start a whole new series of  programs. New administrative, new chaos.   We have to make this point: all of us want infrastructure.   Here is the report card: Ds, Ds, Ds, one B, and a couple of Cs along  the way.   Just to maintain these programs at the present would be $2 trillion-- not building new, not adding to what we have, but $2 trillion--just to  maintain this.   What does the President offer us?   $200 billion. That is a B, not a T. $200 billion. The same money that  we are already spending. No new dollars. Somehow that would leverage  State, local, and private.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Price for bringing this to our attention.    I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, is the gentleman  saying that the President's budget is inconsistent with the President's  transportation plan? In the transportation plan he talks about new  starts, new programs, and so forth, but he is eliminating those in the  budget, transferring that money over to the new programs that I guess  he wants to call the Trump programs. Is that what is happening here?    I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Price for those comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne).    Mr. Speaker, I will attempt to answer the gentleman's  question. It doesn't make any sense. What the President proposes,  instead of the normal 80/20, sometimes a 75/25 split in which the  Federal Government is the major partner so that these transportation  systems are of national importance--the President is proposing across  for all kinds of projects, wherever they may be, on the Northeast  corridor, or on the West Coast, or anywhere in between, that he flip it  over and the Federal Government becomes the minority partner, at 20  percent; and the State, the county, the city, or in the case of New  York, the tri-borough----    The tri-State entity comes up, in this case, as the  gentleman said, 50 percent. But that is not good enough. He wants 20  percent Federal and 80 percent tri-State. It is a formula for a major  disaster for America's infrastructure, because it is not just tunnels  and Amtrak, it is water systems. It is repairing the Flint system,  repairing the Chowchilla water system in California; it is the flood  control. It goes on and on and on.   Unless, of course, you happen to be a Wall Street investor, and you  want to--well, let's say you want to build that tunnel. Well, the  Federal Government will give you 80 percent. You come up with 20  percent. And by the way, what is going to be the cost to the commuter?   So none of this makes much sense, except for one thing. Thankfully,  the President, after a year plus, has come forward with a plan. We will  work with that. We will take his bad plan, we will do a judo move on  it, we will flip it, and then we will build a definite program for  America. Let's call it a better deal for America, a better  infrastructure plan. What do you think? Can we do that, Mr. Payne?    I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.    I do need to move on to Mr. Cicilline here, but Mr.  Payne was asking about the water systems. Just look at real dollars,  2014 dollars, where the Federal investment has gone over the last 25  years, almost 30 years. So no wonder that we are not repairing and  rebuilding.   Mr. Speaker, let me turn to Mr. Cicilline who, together with his  teammates, the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Bustos) and the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries), developed a way of describing  what it is we need to do. Last week, Mr. Cicilline took on this issue  of transportation, infrastructure, generally, and made a proposal.  Could the gentleman share with us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, there are so many things we need to talk  about.   First of all, that $200 billion is simply repurposing existing  programs, and they are laid out here. The highway fund, $122 billion  reduced, transferred over to his new program, which is really, really  strange. He calls it $100 billion of innovation.   Who is going to determine what is innovative? Who is going to  determine what is going to be funded?   A whole new administrative and serious chaos is going to occur--TIGER  grants, gone, Amtrak. Mr. Payne was just talking about Amtrak and the  importance here in the Northeast corridor.   I am from California, but I have got to tell you, I care a great deal  about Amtrak because that is how I like to get from Washington to New  York City. That is the best way to do it. Airplanes are fine, but,  actually, Amtrak is just faster if you want to get downtown to  downtown.   But not to worry. He is going to privatize Reagan and Dulles. And you  think that is going to work out well for us? Oh, if you want to pay  more money, yes. Rural air service.   Army Corps of Engineers, extremely important to us on the West Coast,  in my district. I have quite possibly the highest flood potential of  any place outside of New Orleans, and we depend upon this, and yet they  are going to cut it by $10 billion.   It goes on and on and on. This is just the beginning of what is  proposed. It is a massive shell game. The money is under this shell.  No, the money is under that shell. It is the same money back and forth.   We need a real program, and I am so pleased that you and your  colleagues put together a real trillion-dollar program. It is solid. It  is foundational. And what an opportunity was missed in this wonderful  Christmas gift that the President gave to whom? The top 1 percent and  American corporations.   Ponder this for a moment: For every 1 percent reduction in the  Federal corporate tax rate, it is $100 billion.   Corporations and the Chamber of Commerce were saying from 35 take it  down to 25 percent. No. Our Republican colleagues and the President  went all the way to 21 percent. Let's see, 25, 21, 4--4 percentage  points. That is $400 billion over 10 years.   Think of the possibilities if, instead of that money flowing to  corporations who apparently are going to use that money for stock  buybacks and dividends, not for new investments--oh, excuse me. They  did say they had increased the wages. Do a careful study. Most of those  wage increases are in States and localities that have increased the  minimum wage.   So $400 billion right there. Could it have been used? Yes. Foreign  earnings? Mr. Delaney, 40 Democrats, 40 Republicans put on the floor a  proposal to repatriate those foreign earnings back here to the United  States, very low tax rate, far lower than what is in the tax bill if  that money was going into an infrastructure bank, into investments,  real investments in America.   Mr. Speaker, I know Mr. Cicilline has worked long and hard on this. I  would like to hear more. I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island.    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Cicilline seems to have prompted some  energy and excitement for Mr. Payne. It seems as though he wanted to  jump in and say a few more words. I yield to the gentleman from New  Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, there are so many things that we are  going to talk about over the next several months.   The President did a good thing by putting the infrastructure program  on the front burner. Now, obviously, from what I have said this last  hour and my colleagues, Mr. Cicilline, Mr. Payne, and Mr. Price, the  proposal doesn't fly. It is not a solid proposal that will solve the  problems of America in a way that is good for the people you just  talked about, the working men and women and the families of America.   But we can work together on this, the program that the Democrats have  put out, A Better Deal for America, an infrastructure plan that  includes all of the elements. We haven't talked about broadband and the  availability of broadband in rural areas, which I happen to represent,  high-speed internet, but that is also a problem in the urban areas.   We have a common interest in a good, solid infrastructure plan.  Unfortunately, we are looking at the deficit hawks returning. They  disappeared last November and December when the tax bill went through.  In fact, the President's budget contemplates a $1 trillion deficit each  and every year for the next 10 years.   So where's the money?   Well, $1.5 trillion wound up in the top 1 percent and for the  American corporations and the LLCs and golf courses, as you said. That  is money that could have been used for the infrastructure, building the  foundation for economic growth, educating, reeducating, teaching the  skills.   Now, the President mentioned that in his address on infrastructure,  and good. But where's the money? Show me the money.   Well, it is a shell game. It ends one program, starts a new one.  Administrative chaos will ensue. We need real, solid investment, and we  can do it. The proposals are there.   And we are going to talk about this every week, every day, every  community meeting. We are going to talk about the tax scam and where  the money went. We are going to talk about the wealthy getting  wealthier. We will talk about income inequality and the way in which it  invests, it actually creates more. And we are going to talk about the  great missed opportunities: education, highways, water systems,  sanitation systems, ports, multimodal. That is what we need to do.   Mr. Speaker, I am losing my voice, and I yield back the balance of my  time.                            ____________________
