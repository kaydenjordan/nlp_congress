 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 906) to improve the management of driftnet fishing.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 906         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Driftnet Modernization and       Bycatch Reduction Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITION.         Section 3(25) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation       and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1802(25)) is amended by       inserting ``, or with a mesh size of 14 inches or greater,''       after ``more''.       SEC. 3. FINDINGS AND POLICY.         (a) Findings.--Section 206(b) of the Magnuson-Stevens       Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1826(b))       is amended--        (1) in paragraph (6), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (2) in paragraph (7), by striking the period and inserting       ``; and''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(8) within the exclusive economic zone, large-scale       driftnet fishing that deploys nets with large mesh sizes       causes significant entanglement and mortality of living       marine resources, including myriad protected species, despite       limitations on the lengths of such nets.''.        (b) Policy.--Section 206(c) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery       Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1826(c)) is       amended--        (1) in paragraph (2), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (2) in paragraph (3), by striking the period and inserting       ``; and''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following--        ``(4) prioritize the phase out of large-scale driftnet       fishing in the exclusive economic zone and promote the       development and adoption of alternative fishing methods and       gear types that minimize the incidental catch of living       marine resources.''.       SEC. 4. TRANSITION PROGRAM.         Section 206 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation       and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1826) is amended by adding at       the end the following--        ``(i) Fishing Gear Transition Program.--        ``(1) In general.--During the 5-year period beginning on       the date of enactment of the Driftnet Modernization and       Bycatch Reduction Act, the Secretary shall conduct a       transition program to facilitate the phase-out of large-scale       driftnet fishing and adoption of alternative fishing       practices that minimize the incidental catch of living marine       resources, and shall award grants to eligible permit holders       who participate in the program.        ``(2) Permissible uses.--Any permit holder receiving a       grant under paragraph (1) may use such funds only for the       purpose of covering--        ``(A) any fee originally associated with a permit       authorizing participation in a large-scale driftnet fishery,       if such permit is surrendered for permanent revocation, and       such permit holder relinquishes any claim associated with the       permit;        ``(B) a forfeiture of fishing gear associated with a permit       described in subparagraph (A); or        ``(C) the purchase of alternative gear with minimal       incidental catch of living marine resources, if the fishery       participant is authorized to continue fishing using such       alternative gears.        ``(3) Certification.--The Secretary shall certify that,       with respect to each participant in the program under this       subsection, any permit authorizing participation in a large-      scale driftnet fishery has been permanently revoked and that       no new permits will be issued to authorize such fishing.''.       SEC. 5. EXCEPTION.         Section 307(1)(M) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery       Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1857(1)(M)) is       amended by inserting before the semicolon the following: ``,       unless such large-scale driftnet fishing--        ``(i) deploys, within the exclusive economic zone, a net       with a total length of less than two and one-half kilometers       and a mesh size of 14 inches or greater; and        ``(ii) is conducted within 5 years of the date of enactment       of the Driftnet Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act''.       SEC. 6. FEES.         (a) In General.--The North Pacific Fishery Management       Council may recommend, and the Secretary of Commerce may       approve, regulations necessary for the collection of fees       from charter vessel operators who guide recreational anglers       who harvest Pacific halibut in International Pacific Halibut       Commission regulatory areas 2C and 3A as those terms are       defined in part 300 of title 50, Code of Federal Regulations       (or any successor regulations).        (b) Use of Fees.--Any fees collected under this section       shall be available, without appropriation or fiscal year       limitation, for the purposes of--        (1) financing administrative costs of the Recreational       Quota Entity program;        (2) the purchase of halibut quota shares in International       Pacific Halibut Commission regulatory areas 2C and 3A by the       recreational quota entity authorized in part 679 of title 50,       Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulations);        (3) halibut conservation and research; and        (4) promotion of the halibut resource by the recreational       quota entity authorized in part 679 of title 50, Code of       Federal Regulations (or any successor regulations).    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud today to speak in favor of the Driftnet  Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act. This was sent to us by the  Senate on voice vote and sponsored by California Senator Dianne  Feinstein.   I applaud our colleagues in the Senate for sending us meaningful  bipartisan bills--for a change--that were overwhelmingly improved. I  hope my colleagues in the House will join me in this bipartisan effort  to conserve our oceans and wildlife.   I would also like to applaud the recreational fishing and  conservation community for their leadership on this bill.   Large-scale drift gillnets--or driftnets, as they are called--are  wasteful, and they are an outdated type of fishing gear. At 2  kilometers long, their purpose is to simply drift along through ocean  currents and catch whatever they may find in their long webbing.   The only large-scale driftnet fishery in the country today is the  West Coast swordfish fishery, where these driftnets are used to catch  swordfish and other commercially valuable species such as thresher,  mako shark, and opah.   But a 2-kilometer-long net in the ocean catches far more than these  target species. Driftnets are indiscriminate. They catch sea turtles,  bottlenose dolphins, and short-finned pilot whales.   During the committee hearing on this bill, my Republican colleague,  Garret Graves, joked that California is finally catching up with his  State of Louisiana because they ended driftnet fishing in 1995, to  which I say: Good for Louisiana. Elsewhere around the world,  [[Page H7116]]  driftnets have been banned due to the high rate of bycatch.   This important legislation would amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery  Conservation and Management Act to direct the Secretary of Commerce to  conduct a transition program to phase out the use of these large-scale  driftnets and to facilitate the adoption of alternative fishing gear.   This transition program is supported by key stakeholders. A majority  of active permit holders submitted their intent to participate in the  program, and a nonprofit has invested $1 million to help these  fishermen transition.   It is important to note that there really are great alternatives to  drift gillnets, like deep-set buoys, which have a lower bycatch rate  and can actually fetch higher market rates for fishermen.   This bill would also prohibit the use of large-scale driftnet fishing  by all U.S. vessels within the U.S. exclusive economic zone within 5  years.   Let's join the rest of the world and end the use of drift gillnets.  The Senate passed this bill in July, and I urge my colleagues in the  House to do the same now.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, for those folks who had the word ``diktat''  on their bingo card, you are a big winner today.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for that, but when he  describes this bill as extreme, overreaching, and draconian, he left  out the fact that 28 of the 31 fishermen in this particular fishery  have already agreed to participate in the transition program that this  bill provides. My hope is that the three holdouts will take advantage  of the transition assistance being offered and join the rest of their  peers.   Also, when my colleague mentions far-left Democrats driving this  bill, he forgets to mention the long list of Republicans in both the  House and Senate who are supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr.  Case).    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman has raised the issue of foreign fleets  using these drift gillnets a couple of times now. Let me briefly speak  to that, and I will close.   Of course, we need to do something about those bad practices by  foreign fleets, but in order to do that, in order to restrict the  importation of seafood that is caught through unsustainable practices  by foreign fleets, we have to hold our own fleets to this higher  standard of sustainability and bycatch reduction. That is what this  bill and other efforts in this area are all about.   Mr. Speaker, this is a solidly bipartisan bill. I urge my colleagues  to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 970) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to develop a  plan for the removal of the monument to Robert E. Lee at the Antietam  National Battlefield, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 970         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Robert E. Lee Statue Removal       Act''.       SEC. 2. REMOVAL AND DISPOSAL OF MONUMENT.         Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the       Director of the National Park Service, shall remove and       appropriately dispose of the Monument to General Robert E.       Lee at the Antietam National Battlefield.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material in the matter under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 970 introduced by my  friend, Representative Brown of Maryland, a member of the Committee on  Natural Resources and vice chair of the House Committee on Armed  Services.   Mr. Brown's bill directs the National Park Service to remove a statue  of Robert E. Lee from the Antietam National Battlefield in Maryland.  This 24-foot statue of General Lee was dedicated in 2003, 138 years  after the end of the Civil War. It was commissioned and placed by a  private citizen on private land that the National Park Service later  acquired in 2005.   As our Nation continues to wrestle and reckon with racial inequality  and injustice, it is past time that we take stock of these symbols that  we display and the stories that we tell about our past, present, and  future.   For example, the statue at issue here is not historically accurate  and it simply serves to glorify the ``Lost Cause'' narrative. It does  not belong on a national battlefield.   I thank Representative Brown for his hard work in bringing attention  to this issue, and I urge swift passage of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Brown).    Mr. Speaker, before I reserve after those beautiful  remarks, I include in the Record an email from the CBO.      From: David Hughes      Sent: Tuesday, December 1, 2020 2:51 PM      To: Lim, Sarah      Subject: Re: Suspension planning.         Hi Sarah: Good to hear from you. On a preliminary basis:        H.R. 970, Robert E. Lee Removal, Brown, D-MD; no direct       spending or revenue effects.        H.R. 5458, Rocky Mountain 1, Neguse, D-CO; no direct       spending or revenue effects.        H.R. 5459, Rocky Mountain 2, Neguse, D-CO; no direct       spending or revenue effects.        H.R. 7098, Saguaro Expansion, Grijalva, D-AZ; no direct       spending or revenue effects.        H.R. 7489, Long Bridge Act of 2020, Wittman, R-VA; no       revenue effects. Enacting H.R. 7489 would result in an       insignificant net decrease in direct spending over the 2021-      2030 period.            Best,                                                      David Hughes,                              Analyst, Congressional Budget Office.    Mr. Speaker, we were unable to get an official score,  but this email confirms on a preliminary basis that all of the  remaining bills have no spending effect. They also have no revenue  effect, with the exception of H.R. 7489, which has a net revenue  decrease.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, I simply thank my colleagues from Maryland  for the eloquence and moral clarity they have brought to this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this long  overdue and much-needed legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1240) to preserve United States fishing heritage through a  national program dedicated to training and assisting the next  generation of commercial fishermen, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1240         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Young Fishermen's       Development Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Sea grant institution.--The term ``Sea Grant       Institution'' means a sea grant college or sea grant       institute, as those terms are defined in section 203 of the       National Sea Grant College Program Act (33 U.S.C. 1122).        (2) Tribal organization.--The term ``Tribal organization''       has the meaning given the term ``tribal organization'' in       section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education       Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5304).        (3) Young fisherman.--The term ``young fisherman'' means an       individual who--        (A) desires to participate in the commercial fisheries of       the United States, including the Great Lakes fisheries;        (B) has worked as a captain, crew member, or deckhand on a       commercial fishing vessel for not more than 10 years of       cumulative service; or        (C) is a beginning commercial fisherman.       SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM.         The Secretary of Commerce, acting through the National Sea       Grant Office, shall establish a program to provide training,       education, outreach, and technical assistance initiatives for       young fishermen, to be known as the ``Young Fishermen's       Development Grant Program'' (referred to in this section as       the ``Program'').       SEC. 4. GRANTS.         (a) In General.--In carrying out the Program, the Secretary       shall make competitive grants to support new and established       local and regional training, education, outreach, and       technical assistance initiatives for young fishermen,       including programs, workshops, and services relating to--        (1) seamanship, navigation, electronics, and safety;        (2) vessel and engine care, maintenance, and repair;  [[Page H7120]]         (3) innovative conservation fishing gear engineering and       technology;        (4) sustainable fishing practices;        (5) entrepreneurship and good business practices;        (6) direct marketing, supply chain, and traceability;        (7) financial and risk management, including vessel,       permit, and quota purchasing;        (8) State and Federal legal requirements for specific       fisheries, including reporting, monitoring, licenses, and       regulations;        (9) State and Federal fisheries policy and management;        (10) mentoring, apprenticeships, or internships; and        (11) any other activities, opportunities, or programs, as       the Secretary determines appropriate.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill comes to us from Congressman   Don Young, but  it is called the Young Fisherman Development Act because it is all  about fostering the business skills and development of young people in  this industry. It is one of many reasons why I am proud to support this  bill, which passed out of the Natural Resources Committee by unanimous  consent.   I am grateful to our colleague from Alaska for sponsoring it. This  bipartisan bill to assist fishing communities builds on the example of  bipartisan ocean bills that we have passed in the House these past few  weeks, including the Sea Grant reauthorization. I am proud to have led  that effort and look forward to seeing it signed into law soon.   It is difficult for many young men and women to get started in the  commercial fishing industry these days. That was the case even before  the pandemic. Entry-level positions are challenging to find. For those  who are attempting to start up on their own, there are staggering  obstacles to overcome: boats, licenses, docking fees, and numerous  other expenses that pose a high cost of entry and lots of financial  risks.   To compound all of these difficulties, we have the pandemic, which  has forced so many restaurants to close, upending the entire  distribution system for seafood, severely impacting the industry and  further straining young fishermen and -women.   Like Congressman Young, I represent many fishing communities. I have  heard firsthand from those in my district and across the country about  the barriers the young entrants face when starting off in the  commercial fishing industry. Supporting this new generation will help  ensure that our country's rich coastal heritage and seafood economies  continue to thrive.   This bill fosters a new generation in the American commercial fishing  industry, doing several things by creating a national grant program  through NOAA Sea Grant to support training, education, and workforce  development. Under this program, universities, fishing associations,  Tribes, and others can compete for grant funding. They can use those  funds to train young commercial fishermen and -women in business  practices and sustainable fishing.   This program will help teach skills in navigation; electronics;  vessel and engine care; technology and engineering related to  conservation fishing gear; direct marketing, supply chain, and  traceability; financial and risk management; and much more.   It is a very important bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5040) to direct the Director of the Bureau of Land  Management to study the effects of drone incursions on wildfire  suppression, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5040         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Aerial Incursion       Repercussion Safety Act of 2020'' or the ``AIR Safety Act of       2020''.       SEC. 2. STUDY ON EFFECTS OF DRONE INCURSIONS ON WILDFIRE                     SUPPRESSION.         (a) Study Required.--The Director of the Bureau of Land       Management, in consultation with the Chief of the Forest       Service, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation       Administration, and the National Association of State       Foresters, shall conduct a study on the effects of drone       incursions on the suppression of wildfires with respect to       lands managed by the Department of the Interior or the       Department of Agriculture.        (b) Study Contents.--In conducting the study required under       subsection (a), the Director shall--        (1) determine, for each of the five most recently completed       calendar years, the number of occurrences in which a drone       incursion interfered with wildfire suppression and the effect       of each such occurrence on--        (A) the length of time required to achieve complete       suppression;        (B) the effectiveness of aerial firefighting responses; and        (C) the amounts expended by the Federal Government; and        (2) evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of various       actions to prevent drone incursions, including--        (A) temporary flight restrictions of the Federal Aviation       Administration; and        (B) the dissemination of education materials relating to       the effects of drone incursions on wildfire suppression.        (c) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Director shall submit to the       Committee on Natural Resources and the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural       Resources and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and       Transportation of the Senate a report on the findings of the       study required under subsection (a) and any recommendations       of the Director relating to such findings.        (d) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Drone.--The term ``drone'' means an unmanned aircraft       system, as defined in section 44801 of title 49, United       States Code, owned by a private individual or entity.        (2) Drone incursion.--The term ``drone incursion'' means       the operation of a drone within any airspace for which the       Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration has       issued a temporary flight restriction because of a wildfire.        (3) Wildfire suppression.--The term ``wildfire       suppression'' has the meaning given such term in section       46320(d) of title 49, United States Code.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5040. This is a bipartisan  bill introduced by my fellow committee member, Utah Congressman Curtis,  along with myself.   The Aerial Incursion Repercussion Safety Act, or the AIR Safety Act,  requires the Director of BLM, in consultation with the Chief of the  Forest Service, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the National  Association of State Foresters, to conduct a study on the effects of  drone incursion on wildfire suppression.   It is already a Federal crime to interfere with wildfire suppression  efforts on public lands. In addition, the FAA often implements  temporary flight restrictions, or TFRs, around wildfires to prevent  aircraft from getting involved and interfering with suppression  operations.   Despite these deterrents, private drone incursions near wildfires  continue to be documented as causes of delays in airborne firefighting  response that can pose threats to firefighting on the ground, undermine  ongoing suppression efforts, and allow wildfires to encroach on nearby  communities.   There have been many examples of this, but I specifically remember,  during the October 2017 firestorms in Sonoma County, in my district, we  received multiple reports of private drones interfering with  firefighting helicopters and air tankers, forcing them to stay grounded  for the safety of the Cal Fire pilots during the critical days when we  needed them in the air.   This bill would raise awareness of the impacts of drone incursions on  wildland fire suppression while examining ways to avoid future  incursions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                  Washington, DC, September 1, 2020.      Hon.

I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on       Agriculture. l acknowledge that your Committee will not       formally consider H.R. 5040 and agree that the inaction of       your Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any       future jurisdictional claim over the matters contained in the       bill that fall within your Committee's Rule X jurisdiction.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill. l appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to working with you as this       measure moves through the legislative process.

Grijalva,                                                              Chair,      House Natural Resources Committee.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                        Committee on Agriculture,                                   Washington, DC, December 1, 2020.      Hon. Raul M. Grijalva,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman. This letter confirms our mutual       understanding regarding H.R. 5040, the AIR Safety Incursion       Act of 2020. Thank you for collaborating with the Committee       on Agriculture on the matters within our jurisdiction.        The Committee on Agriculture will forego any further       consideration of this bill so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor for consideration. However,       by foregoing consideration at this time, we do not waive any       jurisdiction over any subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation. We request that our Committee be       consulted and involved as this bill moves forward so that we       may address any remaining issues in  [[Page H7122]]       our jurisdiction. The Committee on Agriculture also reserves       the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation and ask that you support any such       request.        We would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 5040, and request       that a copy of our letters on this matter be published in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration.            Sincerely,                                              Colin C. Peterson,                                                              Chair.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I request an ``aye'' vote, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5458) to modify the boundary of the Rocky Mountain National  Park, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5458         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Rocky Mountain National Park       Boundary Modification Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Map.--The term ``map'' means the map entitled ``Rocky       Mountain National Park Proposed Boundary Revision'', numbered       121/154,327, and dated June 2019.        (2) Non-federal land.--The term ``non-Federal land'' means       the approximately 40 acres of non-Federal land depicted as       ``TR 05-133'' on the map.        (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.       SEC. 3. ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK BOUNDARY MODIFICATION.         (a) Land Acquisition.--The Secretary may acquire, by       donation, the non-Federal land for inclusion in the Rocky       Mountain National Park.        (b) Boundary Modification.--On acquisition of the non-      Federal land under subsection (a), the Secretary shall--        (1) modify the boundary of the Rocky Mountain National Park       to include the acquisition; and        (2) administer the acquired land as part of the Rocky       Mountain National Park, in accordance with applicable laws.        (c) Availability of Map.--The map shall be on file and       available for public inspection in appropriate offices of the       National Park Service.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5458, the Rocky Mountain  National Park Boundary Modification Act, the first of two bills  introduced by my Colorado colleague, Representative   Joe Neguse.   This bill would modify the boundary of Colorado's Rocky Mountain  National Park to include approximately 40 acres of non-Federal land  that former U.S. astronaut Vance Brand hopes to donate to the park.   This 40-acre tract will provide enhanced protections for the park's  high-elevation ecosystems and would increase recreational access and  connectivity by providing a natural buffer between private lands and  three popular trails.   Rocky Mountain National Park is home to many of our Nation's most  treasured landscapes, and I commend Representative Neguse for his  efforts to expand and enhance protections for this park.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Neguse).                                time  1000     Mr. Speaker, I request an ``aye'' vote, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5459) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to correct  a land ownership error within the boundary of Rocky Mountain National  Park, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5459         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Rocky Mountain National Park       Ownership Correction Act''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Federal land.--The term ``Federal land'' means the       approximately 0.18 acres of land depicted as ``TR04-168-1''       on the map.        (2) Map.--The term ``map'' means the map entitled ``Rocky       Mountain National Park Proposed Forsyth Family Land       Exchange'', numbered 121/154,326, and dated June 2019.        (3) Non-federal land.--The term ``non-Federal land'' means       the approximately 0.18 acres of land depicted as ``TR04-169''       on the map.        (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior.       SEC. 3. ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK LAND EXCHANGE.         (a) Authorization of Exchange.--To correct a longstanding       land ownership error, if the owner of the non-Federal land       offers to convey to the Secretary all right, title, and       interest of the owner in and to the non-Federal land, the       Secretary shall convey to the owner of the non-Federal land,       subject to valid existing rights, all right, title, and       interest of the United States in and to the Federal land.        (b) Valuation.--The value of the Federal land and the non-      Federal land to be exchanged under this Act shall be       considered to be of equal value.        (c) Administration.--The non-Federal land acquired by the       Secretary under this section shall be administered by the       Secretary as part of Rocky Mountain National Park.        (d) Availability of Map.--The map shall be on file and       available for inspection in the appropriate offices of the       National Park Service.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5459, the Rocky Mountain  National Park Ownership Correction Act, introduced again by my  colleague,   Joe Neguse.   In the 1970s, a tiny 0.18-acre plot of land containing the Forsyth  family cabin was erroneously transferred to Rocky Mountain National  Park when the Park Service purchased land surrounding a private  inholding.   Since the error was discovered, the Park Service has been working  with the Forsyth family to correct the legal ownership and exchange  parcels, and the family is currently using its cabin through a special  use permit. This bill would permanently resolve this ownership issue  and ensure the intent of the original purchase is met by authorizing an  equal value land exchange between the Forsyth family and the Secretary  of the Interior.  [[Page H7124]]    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative Neguse for his efforts to  resolve this longstanding ownership issue, and I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7098) to expand the boundary of Saguaro National Park, to  study additional land for future adjustments to the boundary of the  park, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7098         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,    =========================== NOTE ===========================        December 10, 2020, on page H7124, the following appeared:  Mr.  Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 7098)  to expand the boundary ofSaguaro National Park, to study  additional land for future adjustments to the boundary of the  park, and for other purposes, as amended.

SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Saguaro National Park       Boundary Expansion and Study Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. BOUNDARY OF SAGUARO NATIONAL PARK.         Section 4 of the Saguaro National Park Establishment Act of       1994 (Public Law 103-364; 108 Stat. 3467) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)--        (A) by inserting ``(1)'' before ``The boundaries of the       park''; and        (B) by adding at the end the following:        ``(2)(A) The boundaries of the park are further modified to       include approximately 1,232 acres, as generally depicted on       the map titled `Saguaro National Park_ Proposed Boundary       Adjustment', numbered 151/80,045G, and dated October 2020.        ``(B) The map referred to in subparagraph (A) shall be on       file and available for inspection in the appropriate offices       of the National Park Service.'';        (2) by striking subsection (b)(2) and inserting the       following new paragraphs:        ``(2) The Secretary may, with the consent of the State of       Arizona and in accordance with Federal and State law, acquire       land or interests therein owned by the State of Arizona       within the boundary of the park.        ``(3) If the Secretary is unable to acquire the State land       under paragraph (2), the Secretary may enter into an       agreement with the State that would allow the National Park       Service to manage State land within the boundary of the       park.''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(d) Boundary Study.--        ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall conduct a study to       identify any lands outside the boundaries of the park that       may be appropriate for inclusion in the park.        ``(2) Criteria.--The study shall be conducted in accordance       with National Park Service criteria for boundary adjustment       studies.        ``(3) Report.--Not later than 3 years after the date funds       are made available for the study under this subsection, the       Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Natural Resources       of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy       and Natural Resources of the Senate a report on the findings,       conclusions, and recommendations of the study.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 7098, a bill introduced  by the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, Raul Grijalva from  Arizona.   This bill would modify the boundaries of Saguaro National Park and  authorize the Secretary of the Interior to acquire lands within these  new boundaries from willing sellers. The bill would also require the  Secretary to study future potential boundary expansions and land  acquisitions that would add to the park's natural, cultural, and  recreational resources.   Saguaro National Park is a true urban oasis, located in the Tucson  metropolitan area in Chairman Grijalva's hometown. This park provides  habitat for iconic species, including its namesake--the saguaro  cactus--and the desert tortoise, and it provides unparalleled  recreational resources, such as hiking and mountain biking trails.   The expansion authorized in this bill would add to those abundant  resources and provide an important linkage between the park and Pima  County's Sweetwater Preserve, expanding access to southern Arizona's  public lands.   There is broad local support for this expansion, which includes the  Pima County Administrator, the Tucson Mountain Homeowners Association,  and each individual owner of the land identified for inclusion in the  park.   This bill is not just a win for the residents of southern Arizona; it  is also a win for our national parks and public lands.   Expanding the future of conservation and access to public lands is a  hallmark of Chairman Grijalva's leadership, so I want to thank him for  that and for his hard work on this bill, and I urge its swift adoption  by the House.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote, and I yield the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7489) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to convey  to the Commonwealth of Virginia or the District of Columbia certain  Federal land under the administrative jurisdiction of the National Park  Service for the construction of rail and other infrastructure, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7489         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Long Bridge Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF CONVEYANCES.         (a) Conveyances Authorized.--On request of the Commonwealth       of Virginia or the District of Columbia, as applicable, the       Secretary of the Interior may, subject to any terms and       conditions that the Secretary determines to be necessary,       convey to the Commonwealth of Virginia or the District of       Columbia, as applicable, any Federal land or interest in       Federal land under the jurisdiction of the Secretary that is       identified by the Commonwealth of Virginia or the District of       Columbia, as applicable, as necessary for the Long Bridge       Project.        (b) Reversion.--If any portion of the Federal land or       interest in Federal land conveyed under subsection (a) is no       longer being used for railroad purposes or recreational use,       title to the portion of the Federal land or interest in the       portion of the Federal land shall revert to the Secretary, on       a determination by the Secretary that the portion of the       Federal land has been remediated and restored to a condition       determined to be satisfactory by the Secretary.        (c) Temporary Use.--The Secretary may allow the temporary       use of any Federal land under the jurisdiction of the       Secretary that is identified by the Commonwealth of Virginia       or the District of Columbia, as applicable, as necessary for       the construction of the Long Bridge Project, subject to any       terms and conditions determined to be necessary by the       Secretary.        (d) Recovery of Costs.--Notwithstanding any other provision       of law, the Secretary may recover from the Commonwealth of       Virginia or the District of Columbia, as applicable, all       costs incurred by the Secretary in providing or procuring       necessary services associated with a conveyance under       subsection (a) or use authorized under subsection (c).        (e) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Long bridge project.--The term ``Long Bridge Project''       means the project consisting of improvements to the Long       Bridge and related railroad infrastructure between Rossyln       (RO) Interlocking in Arlington, Virginia, and L'Enfant (LE)       Interlocking near 10th Street SW in the District of Columbia,       the purpose of which is to expand commuter and regional       passenger rail service and provide bicycle and pedestrian       access crossings over the Potomac River.        (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National       Park Service.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7489, the Long Bridge Act,  introduced by our colleague, Representative Wittman, from Virginia.   This bill is a simple piece of legislation, but it is important. It  authorizes the National Park Service to convey select parcels of land  to the Commonwealth of Virginia or the District of Columbia in order to  facilitate updates to the Long Bridge, a critical commuter and freight  rail corridor in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area.                                time  1015    The existing bridge, which is used by Amtrak, the Virginia Railway  Express, and CSX Transportation was built all the way back in 1904. It  has not been substantially upgraded since 1942.   The current project is a partnership between the U.S. Department of  Transportation, the Virginia Department of Rail and Transportation, and  the District of Columbia, and it will double capacity of the bridge by  constructing a second bridge alongside the existing structure.   Allowing the National Park Service to convey small tracts of land  will facilitate completion of this very important upgrade.   To be clear, we are not talking about land that includes historic  resources, open space, or park-like qualities.   The agency has final say in what can be transferred, and the bill  includes important safeguards to ensure that the land identified for  conveyance is used only for railroad purposes.   This project is a priority for this region, and I am happy to lend my  support to this commonsense, bipartisan solution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further witnesses, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
