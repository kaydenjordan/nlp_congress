 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:    Mr. President, when we encourage our students to be  active and play school sports, it's because we want to promote healthy  habits and team-building skills. Yet every year, more than 140,000  student athletes sustain a concussion--and that's just the reported  count. We can be sure that many more go unreported and untreated.   The benefits of competing in school sports are undermined if students  are staying out on the field after an injury--especially concussions.  And there is more evidence than ever about the detrimental long term  effects of concussions.   That's why I'm reintroducing the Protecting Student Athletes from  Concussions Act. My bill would direct States to develop concussion  safety plans for public schools that include a concussion safety  awareness component. Certain States like Illinois already have such  procedures in place, but it's high time we make this true for all  States. By equipping our schools and communities with evidence-based  guidance for responding to concussions; we can keep our students, and  their futures safe.   The bill would also require States to adopt a ``when in doubt, sit it  out'' policy. If there is even the possibility that a student athlete  has suffered a concussion, their health and safety ought to be the  number one priority. That means, if an athlete is suspected of having  sustained a concussion, they should sit out and not be allowed to  return to play the same day and, after that, only once evaluated and  cleared by a qualified health care professional.   Unfortunately, many student athletes return to play prematurely--to  the detriment of both their health and academic performance.   Let's be clear: a concussion is a traumatic brain injury that affects  brain function. It is, by no means, something we can simply shake or  walk off. The still-developing brains of students make them more  susceptible to injury, making concussions all the more dangerous.   A ``when in doubt, sit it out'' policy, endorsed by the American  College of Sports Medicine and the American Academy of Neurology, will  take the decision to return to the game out of the hands of a coach or  an injured athlete who may not want to look ``weak''  [[Page S7244]]  to their teammates. It will prevent students from experiencing  successive injuries by staying in the game when they are not fit. It  will give injured athletes the time to heal to help ensure that short  term symptoms do not become long term effects.   For school sports to be a safe option, we have to put the necessary,  common-sense procedures for preventing, detecting, responding to, and  treating concussions in place. This bill would help do that.   It's why my bill is endorsed by the American College of Sports  Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, the National Collegiate  Athletic Association, the National Football League, the National  Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, the National Hockey  League, the National Parent Teacher Association, the National  Association of Secondary School Principals, the Sports & Fitness  Industry Association, the Korey Stringer Institute, and Safe Kids World  Wide.   I hope my colleagues will join me in this common-sense, evidence- based approach to protecting student athletes. Thank you.                                  S. 3686         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

(4) Return to athletics.--If a student has sustained a       concussion (regardless of whether or not the concussion       occurred during school-sponsored activities, during school       hours, on school property, or during an athletic activity),       before such student resumes participation in school-sponsored       athletic activities, the school shall receive a written       release from a health care professional, that--        (A) states that the student is capable of resuming       participation in such activities; and        (B) may require the student to follow a plan designed to       aid the student in recovering and resuming participation in       such activities in a manner that--        (i) is coordinated, as appropriate, with periods of       cognitive and physical rest while symptoms of a concussion       persist; and        (ii) reintroduces cognitive and physical demands on such       student on a progressive basis only as such increases in       exertion do not cause the reemergence or worsening of       symptoms of a concussion.
