 Mr. President, today, I am voting against the  resolution to end the national emergency. Make no mistake: Our Nation  is facing a prolonged and worsening security and humanitarian crisis on  our southern border. Lethal drugs are flooding across the border at an  alarming rate. Just last year, enough fentanyl to kill 88 million  Americans was seized by border patrol agents between our ports of  entry. We are also witnessing unprecedented levels of illegal  immigration and are on track for the highest level of illegal  immigration in more than a decade. That means more human trafficking,  more forced labor, and more exploitation of people along the dangerous  journey to the United States. Failures by Congress to adequately  address our immigration and border security issues have only  exacerbated this crisis.   Here is just a sample of the data from our Federal authorities. The  total volume of illegal immigration is increasing. Illegal immigration  is on pace to exceed the highest level in more than 10 years. There has  been a 338 percent increase in family units from the Northern Triangle  apprehended thus far in fiscal year 2019 compared with same period in  fiscal year 2018. There was 54 percent increase in unaccompanied minors  apprehended thus far in fiscal year 2019 compared with same period in  fiscal year 2018.   Additionally, drug seizures are increasing between ports of entry. In  fiscal year 2018, U.S. Border Patrol intercepted 388 pounds of fentanyl  between our ports of entry. That is enough to kill 88 million  Americans; that is right, 88 million Americans. Fentanyl seizures  increased 73 percent between fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018.  Heroin seizures also increased 22 percent between fiscal year 2017 and  fiscal year 2018. Methamphetamine seizures increased 38 percent between  fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018.   As I have said repeatedly, even though the President is using the  authority given to him by Congress, I share my colleagues' concerns  that too much authority has been delegated to the executive branch. In  1976, Congress gave the President the authority to declare national  emergencies, so we shouldn't be surprised when he seeks to use it, just  as others have done. For this reason, I will continue working to pass  meaningful legislation, like the ARTICLE ONE Act, to reclaim  congressional power from the executive branch and improve congressional  oversight of the National Emergency Act. I encourage my colleagues to  join in this effort, which takes real action, as opposed to symbolic  show votes that don't address the root of the problem.    I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we are celebrating an important week in  our system of self-government. This week is known as Sunshine Week. For  the last 14 years, advocacy groups, good government watchdogs, and  media organizations have joined forces to observe the importance of  transparency and freedom of information. With transparency and freedom  of information, there is more accountability in government. As a long- time champion of an open, accessible government, I speak today in  support of those enduring principles.   Sunshine Week coincides each year with March 16. That is the day one  of the Nation's Founding Fathers and fourth President of the United  States was born. That person was James Madison, widely known as the  Father of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.   From his writings in the Federalist Papers, it might be said that he  was the architect who framed our system of checks and balances. Madison  believed all powers of the government are derived of, by, and for the  people. That is what brings me to the floor today.   The public has a right to know what their government is doing and how  their government is spending the taxpayers' dollars. What is more, the  American people owe a debt of gratitude to our fellow citizens who  bravely come forward, often at great professional risk, to report  wrongdoing in government. We ought to expect that out of government  employees or any fellow citizen who knows something is wrong.   I am here today to talk about a ray of sunlight coming from the  Defense Department. More specifically, I want to alert you about the  whistleblower hotline managed by the inspector general. Once in a  while, good news comes out of that Department.   I spend a lot of time on government oversight. Congressional  oversight is part of our constitutional assignment to protect the power  of the purse and to ensure that the laws we pass are faithfully  executed.   My sights are set quite often on the Pentagon when it comes to  oversight. The U.S. military is the strongest and mightiest in the  world. Our men and women in uniform put their lives on the line to  protect our sacred freedoms. Each of us should be fighting tooth and  nail to make sure that they have the resources they need. I am not,  however, talking about writing blank checks; I am talking about making  sure that defense dollars are spent wisely.   The Pentagon shoulders a strategic and vital mission for America but  is by no means infallible--not by a long shot. As with almost any  bureaucracy or corporate organization, its workplace culture dictates  that each individual should go along to get along, and that is not how  it should be. Institutional foot-dragging at the Pentagon, for example,  has hampered efforts to root out sexual misconduct. You read about it  too often. A systemic bookkeeping system has plagued the Department of  Defense for decades.   Nevertheless, I keep pressing the Pentagon to fix this fiscal mess.  Every  [[Page S1888]]  dollar lost to waste, fraud, and abuse is a dollar that could be put to  better use for our men and women in uniform for better housing, as just  one example.   I learned long ago that one of the best ways to expose wrongdoing is  by listening to whistleblowers. Whistleblowers are the ones who have  their noses and ears to the ground day in and day out. They are  patriots doing their job in reporting wrongdoing. These patriots know  the difference between right and wrong. So when their good conscience  compels them to come forward, we should hear them out, and we need to  encourage others to do the same.   Whistleblowers within the Defense Department help weed out improper  payments, procurements, fraud, and other unethical schemes and  misbehaviors that come at taxpayers' expense and the expense of  military preparedness.   As cofounder and cochairman of the Whistleblower Protection Caucus, I  lead efforts from Capitol Hill to strengthen protections and raise  awareness for what is often an uphill battle for whistleblowers. In the  rigid command of the U.S. military, the civilian workforce and  uniformed members of the military are trained to follow protocol and to  respect the chain of command. Instead of receiving a pat on the back  for exposing wrongdoing, too many of these whistleblowers face  retribution and reprisal. I often say they are treated like skunks at a  picnic.   That brings me to the DOD whistleblower hotline, a vital conduit for  whistleblower complaints. Once again, there is some good news about DOD  and whistleblowers and trying to improve things there in a November IG  report. It shows the huge backlog of tips has been reduced. You could  say that it is a glimmer of hope in an otherwise swamp of secrecy.   You see, the report also exposes the bad news. The playbook of  Federal authority--defend, delay, and deny--is alive and kicking. From  fiscal years 2013 to 2018, the Office of the Inspector General found  the number of reports tripled. It also showed the number of reprisal  complaints doubled.   The report found that 350 Defense Department officials, most of them  in the branches of the Armed Forces, retaliated against and sought to  intimidate 195 whistleblowers. I can't speak about 195 cases, but I  will bet, in many cases, many higher-ups in the chain of command would  be embarrassed, and that is why it wasn't reported, and that is why  these folks were retaliated against. This tells me also that higher-ups  who are accused of retaliating against whistleblowers are going  unpunished.   Consider, about 85 percent of the people who reported wrongdoing and  faced professional punishment or personal embarrassment are still  waiting for any remedy according to this inspector general report.   This sends a very unsubtle signal to whistleblowers: Blow the whistle  at your own risk. When the top dogs who dish out retribution go  unpunished, and some are even promoted, the message to the rank and  file is loud and clear: Blow the whistle at your own risk.   Nearly 2 years ago, I came to the floor of the Senate to sound the  alarm on this very subject. At that time I shared statistics from a  2016 IG report. It listed 406 hotline cases that had been open for more  than 2 years. Nobody is in a hurry to do anything about wrongdoing in  the Defense Department when things like that can accumulate. More than  half of those 406 cases--246 cases to be exact--had been open for more  than 1,000 days, and some had been lying around for 4 years. So back  when I gave that speech a couple of years ago, I noted that the IG's  office wasn't moving the needle, despite increases in personnel and  money in the IG's office. The workforce-to-workload ratio was  mismatched. Cases were adding up, and the corrosive workplace culture  within the IG was a festering sore. Allegations of tampering with  investigations and whitewashing cases were tarnishing the reputation of  the premier whistleblower oversight unit at the Pentagon. Congressional  watchdogs, like myself, should not have to watch the Pentagon watchdogs  to keep oversight on track.   As I said, there is some good news. Things seemed to turn the corner  when Acting Inspector General Fine recognized the antics of a  bureaucracy run amuck.   I am glad to see a ray of sunlight coming from the IG's office.  However, we still aren't out of the woods.   I want to thank those in the IG's office who are toiling to reduce  this hotline backlog; however, the DOD needs to step up and face the  music. DOD needs to own these failures in letting retaliators off the  hook.   Failing to hold these folks accountable is a huge slap in the face to  those in the Department who are performing their responsibilities every  day with dedication and excellence, being patriotic people, blowing the  whistle, and pointing out waste, fraud, and abuse.   It also happens to be a slap in the face of the taxpayers. It is  telling these patriotic whistleblowers: Thanks but no thanks. Feel free  to disclose your report, but we may press the mute button after  processing the claim.   Make no mistake about it--the hotline becomes meaningless if  whistleblowers lack confidence in the system. They will stop calling  and stop reporting waste, fraud, and abuse.   My advice to Inspector General Fine is this: Put some mustard on it,  and add some hot sauce while you are at it. Get down to the brass  tacks, and recommend disciplinary action against those who retaliate  against patriotic people pointing out waste, fraud, and abuse.   In closing, I would like to share a tip with the Department of  Defense. This U.S. Senator will continue shining the spotlight on  waste, fraud, and abuse at the Pentagon--and, of course, elsewhere--and  I will continue advocating for whistleblowers with every tool at my  disposal.   As an Iowa farmer, I know what a load of manure smells like. I am  also very aware of why farmers make hay when the sun shines, and that  is a very good lesson for good government. Sunshine helps hold  government accountable to the American people, and that is why we  celebrate Sunshine Week this week and every year now for, I think, 14  years--because Sunshine Week promotes openness and transparency in  government.   That is why the Congress passed the Physician Payments Sunshine Act  in 2010. This law establishes a mandatory national disclosure program  in which drug and medical device manufacturers report payments to  prescribers in teaching hospitals. However, it appears that some  parties may not be disclosing this information.   That is why, in addition to what I told you about overseeing things  in the Defense Department, it is necessary to call out HHS and CMS to  be forthcoming about whether opportunities exist for us to work  together to strengthen the law where all these things aren't being  reported as they should be. Sunshine is the best disinfectant.                                  Free Trade    Mr. President, lastly, I would like to talk about free trade for a  minute. I am calling on the administration to promptly remove the  section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and  Mexico. This will help clear the path for the United States-Mexico- Canadian Agreement to be ratified in all three countries. These tariffs  and their retaliation are having a negative impact on Americans. The  United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement is supposed to be a free-trade  agreement, but we don't have free trade with these tariffs in place.   As chairman of the Committee on Finance, I look forward to helping  the President with this important task. And a little bit of advice for  the President would come this way: I think he imposed tariffs on  Mexican and Canadian steel and aluminum because he didn't think they  were going to negotiate and said that is why he put the tariffs on.  Obviously they negotiated in good faith because the President said he  has a very good agreement. I happen to agree that he has a very good  agreement. So wouldn't you think, then, that the tariffs ought to come  off?   Somebody down at the White House recently told me: Well, you can't  conflate the tariffs on aluminum and steel with the USMCA agreement.  Well, don't tell me you can't conflate them when you conflate them when  you say to the other side: If you don't negotiate, we are going to put  these tariffs on.   I think there is a clear path to getting this done.  [[Page S1889]]    The President is concerned about the transshipment of steel from  China, through Canada, into the United States, which obviously wouldn't  be fair. They are concerned, as well, about surges in exports to the  United States.   I think he would find Prime Minister Trudeau very open to receiving  assurances that if the House of Commons in Canada moves ahead with  approval of it, these tariffs would go off. At the same time, I think  they will get assurances from the Canadian Government that they will  make sure transshipment from China, through Canada, to the United  States won't happen and that surges in exports won't happen as well.   If we can get the Canadian Government to approve this agreement, it  seems to me it is going to be a lot easier to get through the Congress  of the United States. And I think that just as soon as Mexico changes  some labor laws they promised they would change to make labor more fair  and less unfair to the American worker, I think the Mexican Senate will  approve this agreement. But time is a factor here because Canada has to  get this all done before they adjourn in June for their October  elections.   It seems to me that when the President says he has a good agreement-- and there is a certain amount of anxiety out there about all these  trade negotiations that are going on--we could get this thing settled  pretty fast and reduce that anxiety, and we could make sure we enhance  our economy more than the fine policies of this President, through  taxes and through deregulation, have already improved the economy and  keep it growing.   I would ask the President to consider moving this as fast as he can  and get off of this business of negotiating trade and tariffs for  quotas because that is not much better for the United States and not  much better even for the Canadians, and it isn't going to satisfy the  Canadians that they can move ahead before their election.   I yield the floor.
