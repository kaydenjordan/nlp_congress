 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed  in the Record the commitment letter for the Animal Generic Drug User  Fee Agreements of 2018.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:              Animal Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2018    agdufa reauthorization performance goals and procedures for fy's 2019                                 thru 2023         The goals and procedures of the Food and Drug       Administration (FDA or the Agency) as agreed to under the       ``Animal Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2018'' are       summarized as follows:                         application/submission goals         Beginning October 1, 2018, all applications and submissions       under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)       section 512(b) must be created using the eSubmitter tool and       submitted to the Agency through the FDA Center for Veterinary       Medicine (CVM) Electronic Submission System (ESS).      1. Original Abbreviated New Animal Drug Applications (ANADAs)           and Reactivations        Review and act on 90 percent of original ANADAs within 240       days after the submission date. An application is incomplete       if it would require additional data or information to enable       the Agency to complete a comprehensive review of the       application and reach a decision on the issue(s) presented in       the application. If the Agency determines that the       deficiencies are not substantial, the Agency will review and       act on 90 percent of reactivated applications within 120 days       after the reactivated ANADA submission date. This shorter       review time for reactivated ANADAs for which the deficiencies       are determined not to be substantial is not intended to       prevent the use of minor amendments during Agency review of       an application. If the Agency determines that the       deficiencies are substantial or new substantial information       is provided, the Agency will review and act on 90 percent of       reactivated applications within 240 days after the       reactivated ANADA submission date.      2. Administrative ANADAs        Review and act on 90 percent of administrative ANADAs       (ANADAs submitted after all scientific decisions have been       made in the generic investigational new animal drug (JINAD)       process, i.e., prior to the submission of the ANADA) within       60 days after the submission date. Paragraph IV certification       applications (FD&C Act section 512(n)(1)(H)(iv)) submitted as       administrative ANADAs will be excluded from the       administrative ANADA cohort.      3. Prior Approval Manufacturing Supplemental ANADAs and           Reactivations        Review and act on 90 percent of Prior Approval       manufacturing supplemental ANADAs within 180 days after the       submission date. A Prior Approval manufacturing supplemental       ANADA includes: one or more major manufacturing changes       according to 21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(ii) and in accordance with       Guidance for Industry 83 (Chemistry, Manufacturing, and       Controls Changes to an Approved NADA or ANADA); and, changes       submitted as ``Supplement-Changes Being Effected in 30 Days''       that require prior approval according to 21 CFR       514.8(b)(3)(v)(A). If a Prior Approval supplement does not       clearly identify any major manufacturing changes, the Prior       Approval supplement will be designated by the Agency as a       ``Supplement-Changes Being Effected'' with a 270 days review       goal (see ``Supplement-Changes Being Effected Manufacturing       Supplemental ANADAs and Reactivations'' below).        A submission is incomplete if it requires additional data       or information to enable the Agency to complete a       comprehensive review of the submission and reach a decision       on the issue(s) presented in the submission. If the Agency       determines that the deficiencies are not substantial for       manufacturing supplements requiring prior approval, the       Agency will allow the manufacturing supplements to be       resubmitted as ``Supplement-Changes Being Effected in 30       Days'' as described in 21 CFR 514.8(b)(3) and the drug made       with the change can be distributed 30 days after the       resubmission according to 21CFR 514.8(b)(3)(iv). The Agency       will review and act on 90 percent of these reactivated       manufacturing supplements within 270 days after the       resubmission date of a complete submission. If the Agency       determines that the deficiencies remain substantial or new       substantial information is provided, prior-approval is       required according to 21 CFR 514.8(b)(3)(v)(A). The Agency       will review and act on 90 percent of these reactivated       manufacturing supplements within 180 days after the re-      submission date of a complete submission.      4. Supplement--Changes Being Effected Manufacturing           Supplemental ANADAs and Reactivations        Review and act on 90 percent of ``Supplement--Changes Being       Effected'' manufacturing supplemental ANADAs and       reactivations submitted according to 21 CFR 514.8(b)(3)(vi)       and in accordance with Guidance for Industry 83 (Chemistry,       Manufacturing, and Controls Changes to an Approved NADA or       ANADA), including manufacturing changes not requiring prior       approval according to 21 CFR 514.8(b)(3)(iv), within 270 days       after the submission date.      5. Generic Investigational New Animal Drug (JINAD) Study           Submissions        Review and act on 90 percent of JINAD study submissions       within 180 days after the submission date. A submission is       incomplete if it would require additional data or information       to enable the Agency to complete a comprehensive review of       the study submission and reach a decision on the issue(s)       presented in the submission. If the Agency determines that       the deficiencies are not substantial, the Agency will review       and act on 90 percent of resubmitted JINAD study submissions       within 60 days after the receipt date of a complete study       submission. This shorter review time for resubmitted JINAD       study submissions is not intended to prevent the use of minor       amendments during Agency review of a study submission. If the       Agency determines that the deficiencies are substantial or       new substantial information is provided, the Agency will       review and act on 90 percent of resubmitted JINAD study       submissions within 180 days after the receipt date of a       complete study submission.      6. JINAD Protocols        Review and act on 90 percent of JINAD submissions       consisting of protocols without substantial data, that the       Agency and the sponsor consider to be an essential part of       the basis for making the decision to approve or not approve       an ANADA or supplemental ANADA, within 75 days after the       submission date. Allow comparability protocols as described       in 21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(v) to be submitted as protocols without       substantial data in a JINAD file. The Agency will review and       act on 90 percent of JINAD submissions consisting of       protocols without substantial data within 75 days after the       submission date of the protocol. For potentially more       complex comparability protocols, for example sterile       process validation protocols, the sponsor should discuss       and have Agency concurrence regarding the appropriate       filing strategy.        For the application/submission goals above, the term       ``review and act on'' means the issuance of either: (1) a       complete action letter that approves an original or       supplemental ANADA or notifies a sponsor that a JINAD       submission is complete; or (2) an ``incomplete letter'' that       sets forth in detail the specific deficiencies in an original       or supplemental ANADA or JINAD submission and, where       appropriate, the actions necessary to place such an original       or supplemental ANADA or JINAD submission in condition for       approval. Within 30 days of receipt of the application, FDA       shall refuse to file an original or supplemental ANADA, or       their reactivation, that is determined to be insufficient on       its face or otherwise of unacceptable quality for review upon       initial inspection as per 21 CFR 514.110. Thus, the agency       will refuse to file an application containing numbers or       types of errors, or flaws in the development plan, sufficient       to cause the quality of the entire submission to be       questioned to the extent that it cannot reasonably be       reviewed. Within 60 days of receipt of the submission, FDA       will refuse to review a JINAD submission that is determined       to be insufficient on its face or otherwise of unacceptable       quality upon initial inspection using criteria and procedures       similar to those found in 21 CFR 514.110. A decision to       refuse to file an application or to refuse to review a       submission as described above will result in the application       or submission not being entered into the cohort upon which       the relevant user fee goal is based. The agency will keep a       record of the numbers and types of such refusals and include       them in its annual performance report.        FDA may request minor amendments to original or       supplemental ANADAs and JINAD submissions during its review       of the application or submission. At its discretion, the       Agency may extend an internal due date (but not a user fee       goal) to allow for the complete review of an application or       submission for which a minor amendment is requested. If a       pending application is amended with significant changes, the       amended application may be considered resubmitted, thereby       effectively resetting the clock to the date FDA received the       amendment. The same policy applies for JINAD submissions.        Sponsors are not required to submit study protocols for       review. However, for each voluntarily submitted protocol for       a study that the Agency and the sponsor consider to be an       essential part of the basis for making the decision to       approve or not approve an original  [[Page S5577]]       or supplemental ANADA, the Agency will issue a complete       action letter providing comments resulting from a complete       review of the protocol. The complete action letter will be as       detailed as possible considering the quality and level of       detail of the protocol submission; will include a succinct       assessment of the protocol; and will state whether the Agency       agrees, disagrees, or lacks sufficient information to reach a       decision that the protocol design, execution plans, and data       analyses are adequate to achieve the objectives of the study.       If the Agency determines that a protocol is acceptable, this       represents an agreement that the data generated by the       protocol can be used to support a safety or effectiveness       decision regarding the subject new animal drug. Having agreed       to the design, execution, or analyses proposed in protocols       reviewed under this process, the Agency will not later alter       its perspectives on the design, execution, or analyses unless       the Agency issues a written order that a substantiated       scientific requirement essential to the assessment of the       study appeared after the Agency's protocol assessment, or       public (human or animal) health concerns unrecognized at the       time of protocol assessment under this process are evident.        The term ``submission date'' means the date the FDA Center       for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) Electronic Submission System       (ESS) receives an application or submission. Upon receipt of       an application or submission, the CVM ESS creates an       electronic receipt that contains the date of receipt and is       sent to the submitter.                         work queue review procedures         The Agency will review all submissions in accordance with       procedures for working within a queue. An application/      submission that is not reviewed within the applicable       Application/Submission Goal time frame will be reviewed with       the highest possible priority among those pending.                amending similar applications and submissions         The Agency and regulated industry agree that applications       and submissions to the Agency will be complete and of       sufficient quality to allow the Agency's complete and timely       review. The Agency will refuse to file poor quality and       incomplete applications and submissions rather than allowing       them to serve as ``placeholders'' in the review queue that       are subsequently amended to add the missing or inadequate       portions.        The Agency recognizes that there are circumstances in which       a controlled amendment process can make the review of       similar, pending submissions more efficient without       compromising the sponsor's responsibility for high quality       submissions. Thus, if the Agency requests an amendment to a       non-administrative original ANADA, manufacturing supplemental       ANADA, JINAD study submission, or a JINAD protocol submission       (a ``CVM-initiated amendment''), or issues an incomplete       letter for such an application or submission, a sponsor may       request to amend other, similar applications or submissions       it has pending with the Agency (``sponsor-initiated       amendment(s)'') in accordance with the following criteria:        1. The amended information for these similar applications       or submissions must be the same as in the CVM-initiated       amendment or incomplete letter; and        2. The amended information must not significantly change       the similar applications or submissions; and        3. The amended information for these similar applications       or submissions must be submitted no later than:        a. 120 days after the submission date for the similar       original ANADA, manufacturing supplemental ANADA; or        b. 100 days after the submission date for the similar JINAD       study submissions; or        c. 40 days after the submission date for the similar JINAD       protocol submissions.        If the Agency determines that the above criteria have been       met, it will not change the user fee goal for the similar       application or submission that has been amended by a sponsor-      initiated amendment. If the above criteria have not been met,       the Agency may consider the similar application or submission       resubmitted on the date of the sponsor-initiated amendment,       thereby resetting the clock to the date FDA received the       amendment.   multiple data submissions to the chemistry, manufacturing, and controls                             technical section         The Agency will continue to allow two-phased Chemistry,       Manufacturing, and Controls technical section submissions       under the JINAD process. Timely Foreign Pre-Approval       Inspections        1. The Agency and regulated industry are committed to       improving the review and business processes that will       facilitate the timely scheduling and conducting of pre-      approval inspections (PAIs). To improve the timeliness and       predictability of foreign PAIs, sponsors may voluntarily       submit 1) at the beginning of the calendar year, a list of       foreign manufacturing facilities that are specified in an       abbreviated application, supplemental abbreviated       application, or generic investigational file and may be       subject to foreign PAIs for the following fiscal year; and 2)       a notification 30 days prior to submitting an abbreviated       application, a supplemental abbreviated application, or       generic investigational file that informs the Agency that the       application includes a foreign manufacturing facility. Should       any changes to the annual list occur after its submission to       the Agency, the sponsor may provide the updated information       to the Agency.        2. The Agency will keep a record of the number of foreign       PAIs conducted for abbreviated applications, along with the       average time for completing the PAIs, and include this       information in its annual performance report. The time for       completing the PAI is understood to mean the time from the       inspection scheduling request through notification to the       Center of inspectional findings.                        timely meetings with industry         The Agency and the regulated industry agree that the use of       both formal meetings (e.g., presubmission conferences,       workshops) and informal communication by both parties is       critical to ensure high submission quality such that the       above performance goals can be achieved.                             workload adjustment         The workload adjustment will continue to be calculated per       CVM Program Policy and Procedures Manual 1243.3022, page 35,       except that, for purposes of calculating the workload       adjustment, it has been agreed to reset the base years to FY       2014-FY 2018. There will be no workload adjustment for FY       2019. Workload adjustments are one-time adjustments, and are       calculated annually.                            ____________________
