 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as you know, I have been coming to the  Senate floor pretty much every week for month after month to highlight  someone in my State whom we call the Alaskan of the Week. It is someone  who does something important, either for their community or the State  or the country, and oftentimes they don't get a lot of recognition. The  purpose of this is to say: Look at what these people are doing for  Alaska, for America, for their community.   My State is known for many things: its physical beauty, incredible  hunting and fishing, adventuresome spirit, size--you don't want me  going there. I have difficult conversations with my colleagues from  Texas on occasion about the different sizes of our respective States,  but I will not go into detail  [[Page S7149]]  here. These are all things we have in Alaskan space, but the thing that  really makes us a great place to live is our people--strong, resilient,  kind people all across our State who look out for each other, often in  harsh weather conditions.   We are a patriotic State. I know everybody here claims that, and that  is great. We all are.   Nowhere is the spirit of sacrifice and patriotism more apparent than  in our veterans across the State. In Alaska, in Missouri--the Presiding  Officer's State--we are all celebrating that, and we are going to  celebrate that this weekend, going home for Veterans Day.   In Alaska, we like to talk about our veterans. We also like to talk  about the fact that we have more veterans per capita than any other  State in the country. So it is a very patriotic place--full of service.   In every city, village, and every community across Alaska, you will  find proud veterans, many of them working tirelessly together to make  sure they get the help and support that our veterans need. A lot of  times that happens with the older vets--Vietnam-era vets. They come to  make sure the new vets get the help they need.   To all of them: I salute your service and your sacrifice. Thank you  so much for all you have done and continue to do for our country. Happy  Veterans Day to all of Alaska's veterans. I can't wait to get home to  celebrate in Fairbanks and Anchorage this weekend.   It is not just Veterans Day that is approaching in Alaska. This month  we are also celebrating Alaska Native Heritage Month, where there is  much to celebrate. Almost 20 percent of the population of our great  State is Alaska Natives. This is a group of people who, generation  after generation, have what I call a special patriotism.   What do I mean by that? Well, Alaska Natives serve at higher rates in  the military--just like the lower 48. Native Americans have higher  rates in the military than any other ethnic group in the country. This  has been going on for generations--World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the  Cold War, Iraq, and Afghanistan. When you think about it, it is  special.   Let's face it. In the forties, fifties, sixties, and seventies, even  sometimes, unfortunately, today, the Federal Government has not always  treated Alaska Natives well. Yet, generation after generation, they go  off to the front to fight for this country. It is truly a special kind  of patriotism and a unique tribute to the Alaska Native heritage we are  supporting and celebrating this month.   I thought it was fitting today to name as our Alaskan of the Week--to  make it a collective tribute for all Alaska Natives who have served  their country in the military, and it is thousands, to make them  collectively the Alaskans of the Week as we look to celebrate Veterans  Day.   Mr. President, here is a little bit of history. I know you know this,  but a lot of Americans don't. During World War II, Alaska was the only  State in the Union to be invaded and occupied by the Japanese, so we  had big military battles in the Aleutian Island chain of Alaska to  throw off the invaders of our American territory. Thousands of Alaska  Natives volunteered to protect their homeland and to defend their  country overseas. Across the State, whether they were in the Alaska  Territorial Guard, warriors overseas, code talkers who served with the  Marines and others--they were as old as 80 and as young as 12.   This is a great story. It shows the warrior ethic. Alaska Native  women, after the outbreak of World War II, originally enrolled in the  Alaska Territorial Guard before they realized that women weren't  allowed to enroll. In fact, the best sharpshooter in Alaska's  Territorial Guard was a woman named Laura Beltz Wright of Haycock, AK.   Here is how the late, great Jerome Trigg--an Alaska Native and a  marine--put it in 1968, at the height of the Vietnam war, when he was  testifying in front of the U.S. Congress on a very important piece of  legislation called the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. He was the  president of the Arctic Native Brotherhood and, as I mentioned, a proud  marine.   In front of a bunch of Senators, he stated as follows:         We have showed our patriotism as proudly as any Americans       on earth. We have answered the call of duty with pride in       serving [our country]. We answered the call in [World War] II       100 percent. Every man in every village--old and young--      volunteered with the Alaska National Guard.    Remember, this was in 1968 that he was testifying. Then he said:         I have never heard of an Alaska Native burning the draft       card or burning our nation's flag.    We are patriots. That service, as I mentioned, didn't end after World  War II. Alaska Natives have served in every conflict--the Korean war  and in droves during the Vietnam war.   I was honored to be in Southeast Alaska this past summer in a Native  village called Hoonah. It is a beautiful place. There was a documentary  I saw recently. It documented the classes in 1968 and 1969 in that  small Native village in a film called ``Hunting and Wartime.'' It was  about how almost every single male high school student in Hoonah--every  one--went to go fight in Vietnam. That is incredible. It is special  patriotism.   Let me tell you a quick, more up-to-date story. We had the Secretary  of Interior, Ryan Zinke--a combat vet, a Navy SEAL, a heroic man  himself--come to Alaska this summer. I asked him to meet with a bunch  of Alaska Native veterans, particularly our Vietnam veterans, who had  an issue that the Department of Interior has been working on for years.  I wanted him to hear about it firsthand.   It was a very touching meeting. Some in the room talked about what it  was like to be in their villages--places they had never left--when they  were 17 and 18 and 19. Then, a few days later, they were in a steamy  jungle, thousands and thousands of miles away, in Vietnam. Some talked  about what it was like coming back and not feeling that they had the  support of their country, others talked about the difficulty of  readjusting to life back in Alaska after their service in Vietnam and  some of the discrimination they received when they came back home, but  even though they went through this hardship, even though they went  through some of these very difficult times in the late sixties and  early seventies, not one of them said they had made a mistake in  serving their country. They were proud, patriotic warriors, and to this  day that is what they are.    Secretary Zinke said, after he left that meeting, he began it as  their Secretary of Interior, and he left as a brother in arms.   I am so honored to be able to serve these great Alaskans and to  celebrate them as our Alaskans of the Week, just like I know everybody  in America is going to be proud to go home and celebrate with their  veterans.   Once again, for our Alaska Native veterans, thank you for all you  have done for our country, and thank you for being our Alaskans of the  Week.
