 Mr. Speaker, let's not make America sick  again.   I am deeply disappointed my Republican colleagues are moving forward  with their plan to undo the historic progress we have made by expanding  health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, repealing it and leaving  millions of Americans with no coverage.   While repeal and replace was an abstract talking point for years, it  is clear that there is no plan for replacement, no plan. The new phrase  ``repeal and delay'' will, in effect, be repeal and chaos, with no plan  in place.   Repeal will have real-life, personal impact on 30 million Americans  who will stand to lose their health insurance. The options for the 129  million Americans with preexisting conditions who have newfound health  security would disappear. We would be returning to a time of lifetime  limits, annual caps for care, and consumers will be sold junk health  plans at high costs.   Not only will the newly insured suffer, repeal would destabilize the  individual health insurance market and send the healthcare system into  disarray. Let's don't make America sick again. Let's have no repeal  without a replacement.                            ____________________
