 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a great public  servant who passed away last night, former Member of Congress and  Nebraska Governor Charley Thone.   I think the Omaha World-Herald summed up his outlook well:         Official biographies list Thone's first name as Charles.       But Nebraskans knew him better as Charley, the unpretentious       farm boy who adopted ``Accentuate the Positive'' as his       personal theme song.    Governor Thone was born near Hartington, NE. He served our country in  the U.S. Army Infantry during World War II. While serving in the House  of Representatives, then-Congressman Thone fought on behalf of farmers  and ranchers as a member of the House Agriculture Committee. When  tragedy struck with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, he  served on the Warren Commission to investigate the death of our  President.   As Governor of Nebraska, his love of our State was always evident  during his time in office. He guided Nebraska during a tough farm  economy in the 1970s, but he always looked ahead and supported others.  Governor Thone led by example, and he empowered and encouraged others.  He was a mentor to a Nebraska woman named Kay Orr, who became his chief  of staff and then went on to be the first woman Governor of Nebraska.  Governor Orr, herself, has said she would not have been Governor had it  not been for the opportunities Governor Thone had given her along the  way.   The legacy of service and the mark Governor Thone left on Nebraska  will never be forgotten. The motto that he held so dear, ``accentuate  the positive,'' was a good one. It reminds us to find the good in every  person and every moment. His positivity made Nebraska a better place  both while he served and afterward as he worked in his community.  Governor Thone served the State of Nebraska with dignity. He was an  exemplary public servant and a dear friend to my father and to me.   I join all Nebraskans in praying for his wife, Ruth, and the entire  Thone family.   I thank the Presiding Officer.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
