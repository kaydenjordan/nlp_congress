 Mr. Speaker, the American Health Care Act, known as  TrumpCare, will cause 24 million more people to go without health  insurance over the next decade.   As an emergency physician, I know that everyone, even healthy young  people, are vulnerable to car accidents or diseases that require  critical care. Whether they have insurance or not, people get sick and  get injured.   I have never treated a patient who said they were uninsured because  they preferred to be uninsured. They simply couldn't afford it.   So what does 24 million more uninsured people mean?   It means more pain, suffering, and shorter life spans for people who  go without care.   It means more ER visits and a longer wait to see a doctor in the  emergency rooms for everyone.   It means financial ruin for young families or those ready to retire.   It means that hospitals and providers might lay off workers or even  go out of business due to rising uncompensated care. It means they will  charge more to make ends meet, which will raise premiums and out-of- pocket costs for everyone. Everyone will have to pay more.   I urge everyone to vote ``no.''                            ____________________
