 I thank the Senator from Mississippi for yielding to me.   Mr. President, I rise to highlight the work of some truly impressive  Nebraska high school students. In September, to celebrate Constitution  Day, my office offered a challenge to high schoolers in my State to  submit essays describing ``The Relationship Between the Declaration of  Independence and the U.S. Constitution.'' We received contributions  from across Nebraska from students in public, private, and home  schools.   Today, I am pleased to announce the three winners: Ingrid Williamsen  from Logan View Senior High School in the  [[Page S7856]]  First Congressional District; Patrick Collins from the AP U.S. History  Class at Mount Michael Benedictine in Elkhorn in the Second  Congressional District; and Kate Pipher from Nebraska Christian School  in Central City in the Third Congressional District.   The lessons these three Nebraska students can teach us are enduringly  relevant not only for other high schoolers but in this body today. I  would like to read briefly from each of their essays.   Ingrid Williamsen wrote:         The Constitution was put in place so that the rights and       liberties laid out in the Declaration of Independence could       be enforced. It puts limits on the government so that the       government cannot infringe on the rights of the people. It       gives the new government the power to guarantee the liberty       of all the people. Both functions are directly tied to the       Declaration.    In her essay, Kate Pipher wrote:         The Founding Fathers adopted a humble posture to both their       Creator and a great humanity. They understood they did not       possess the power to redefine the rights of man. Their role       was to defend, discover, and reveal those rights for the       citizens. The Constitution's goal is to protect the       inalienable rights of every individual Image-Bearer that the       Declaration of Independence lays out.    Finally, in his essay, Patrick Collins referenced Abraham Lincoln's  ``Fragment on the Constitution'' and declared that the Constitution is  ``the silver frame that protects the golden apple of the Declaration of  Independence. . . . Thus, the Constitution is indeed a structural  embodiment of those famous Truths which we held then and hold now to be  self-evident.''   I am grateful to have received so many great essays from students  across Nebraska. I thank all of them for their work. It is clear to me  that not only their classmates but Washington and this body can learn  some Schoolhouse Rock Civics from Nebraska high school kids.   I would like to congratulate Ingrid, Kate, and Patrick.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  their full essays.    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:      The Relationship Between the Declaration of Independence and the                                Constitution                   INGRID WILLIAMSON--LOGAN VIEW SENIOR HIGH         The Declaration of Independence and The Constitution are       very separate but closely related documents. They are quite       similar in many ways and work together to form the backbone       of the United States.        The Declaration of Independence was written to justify the       Colonies independence from Great Britain. It goes further and       sets forth the principals and ideas for a fair new       government. The Constitution outlines how the new government       would function and enforce the rights in the Declaration.        The Declaration of Independence was designed and drafted to       justify the Colonies breaking away from Great Brittan. The       Declaration made clear promises as to the liberties that       should be given to all men, that all men are created equal,       and that everyone has the right to life, liberty and the       pursuit of happiness. The Declaration set limits on the       government to ensure these rights are inevitable and never       taken away by the government.        The Constitution was put in place so that the rights and       liberties laid out in the Declaration of Independence could       be enforced. It is the document that sets forth how the new       government will function. It puts limits on the government so       that it cannot infringe upon the rights of the people. It       gives the new government the power to guarantee the liberty       of all the people. Both functions are directly tied to the       Declaration.        The Declaration of Independence will remain the same as it       is now, it cannot be changed. This makes it a purely       historical document. The Constitution is a living document       and has been and can be amended. This was by design and       allows both documents to better protect the natural rights of       all.        The relationship between the two documents, the Declaration       of Independence and the Constitution, is one that cannot be       broken. Without either of them, the history and future of the       United States would have a much different blueprint. They are       two of the most important and endearing documents in the       history of the United States. Chief Justice Warren Burger       once said, ``The Declaration of Independence was the promise,       The Constitution was the fulfillment''. The Declaration of       Independence would be an unfulfilled promise had the       Constitution not been put in place.                                   ____                         KATE PIPHER--NEBRASKA CHRISTIAN         The Declaration of Independence and The Constitution of the       United States of America share a substantial relationship       because they both outline basic truths for The American       People that have caused our country to thrive. To begin, the       Founding Fathers argue that all rights come from a Creator,       not a fallible government. Then they conclude that the       purpose of the American government is to secure these God-      given rights.        The Declaration of Independence recognizes there are Laws       of Nature that God established. These laws are principles for       what is just, right, and true. They state that all people       have equal standing and dignity before God. Because certain       truths are self-evident, citizens carry responsibility to       self-govern. They are accountable to more than a man-made       government, they are accountable to a Sovereign God.        The authors of both documents recognized they were       discovering, not defining the inalienable rights of humanity.       The right to Life, Liberty, and Happiness outlined first in       the Declaration of Independence and then again in the 5th       amendment to the Constitution are God-given. The Founding       Fathers adopted a humble posture to both their Creator and a       greater humanity. They understood they did not possess the       power to redefine the rights of man. Their role was to       defend, discover, and reveal those rights for the citizens.       The Constitution's goal is to protect the inalienable rights       of every individual Image-Bearer that the Declaration of       Independence lays out. This is the unique, profound outlook       that both documents portray.        It was no accident that the men who penned the Constitution       utilized many of the terms from the Declaration of       Independence. The Constitution is an attempt to mirror       natural law with a civil, written law. In an ideal world, the       natural law of God and the law of man would align exactly.       The Founding Fathers stressed that the bent of the human       heart is towards tyranny. The Declaration of Independence was       an announcement that the citizens of America would not live       under tyranny any longer and desired an alternative form of       government. The Constitution resulted as a document that       protected the young country from inevitable tyranny.        The authors of the Constitution perceived that in order to       preserve the truths laid out in the Declaration and to secure       the blessings of liberty for their children and following       generations, a written law was necessary. The Declaration of       Independence provided a mandate for government to preserve,       secure, and provide the rights our generous God bestowed upon       us. The Constitution fulfilled that mandate. The ``We the       People'' from the preamble are, in essence, the same citizens       who recognized their rights from their Creator in the       Declaration of Independence. Acting upon the desire to       preserve these rights, they crafted two humble documents that       cataclysmicly shaped the course of America's history.                                   ____      PATRICK COLLINS FROM MR. JOHN ROSHONE'S APUSH CLASS AT MOUNT MICHAEL                      BENEDICTINE IN ELKHORN, NEBRASKA         One of the most fitting metaphors attributed to Abraham       Lincoln is that of the Constitution as the silver frame that       protects the golden apple of the Declaration of Independence.       While it certainly is apt to say that the Constitution's       framework is meant to embody the political philosophy       presented in the Declaration of Independence, even more       important than this overarching idea is a more specific one.       Most Americans are familiar with the words ``we hold these       truths to be self-evident,'' but arguably more pertinent to       the relationship between the Constitution and the Declaration       is an idea only discovered through a more than cursory       examination of the Declaration's less celebrated portion: the       27 grievances listed against the king of England. These       grievances illustrate the ease with which the British       government simply disregarded the English ``constitution,''       wherein the rights of the people and powers of the government       were often vague, unwritten traditional understandings       subject to individual interpretation. The first Americans       knew from experience that any document or governmental       structure attempting to restrict the government and preserve       the people's rights would be woefully inadequate if not       written frankly and followed strictly. In that sense, the       Declaration is not simply about the need for independence but       even more about the ancillarity of a written Constitution in       preserving the desired freedom.        Understanding the importance of adhering to a strict       structure, it is eminently clear that any interpretation or       judicial decision that seeks to change the original meaning       of this structure is misguided. Attempting to push the       Constitution in a desired direction without actually changing       its words, while typically well-intentioned, betrays the       ideals expressed in the Declaration and fought for in the       Revolution and undermines the purpose of creating a written       Constitution in the first place, and yet so many still seek       to do so. Our cultural misunderstanding of this portion of       the reasoning behind American independence is so pervasive       that a large portion of American society truly believes that       the Supreme Court has the authority to create new laws and       amendments from the bench. If so many Americans continue to       treat our founding documents with such flippancy, we will not       even realize as our leaders begin to do the same and our       Constitution effectively morphs into the vaguely understood       one that the British had so long ago. We have forgotten so       thoroughly the grievances that necessitated independence that       we would not bat an eye if our own government were to violate       the same principles  [[Page S7857]]       of freedom today. Our Founding Fathers would cringe to see       our Constitution treated more and more like the one from       which they sought so furiously to gain independence at the       genesis of our nation. Thus, the Constitution is indeed a       structural embodiment of those famous truths which we held       then and hold now to be self-evident. However, the oft-      forgotten grievances in the Declaration render the need for a       government and a people that hold to the original meaning of       that Constitution equally self-evident to any who dare to dig       deeper.
