 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, tomorrow, the Senate will vote on a  resolution to terminate the President's emergency declaration--a  declaration that undermines our separation of powers in order to fund  the President's wall with American taxpayer dollars, despite Candidate  Trump's repeated promises that Mexico would pay for it.   The resolution could not be any simpler. All it says is this, one  single sentence: ``Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives  of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That, pursuant  to section 202 of the National Emergencies Act . . . the national  emergency declared by the finding of the President on February 15,  2019, in Proclamation 9844 . . . is hereby terminated.''   That is it in the entirety. There are no political games here. There  is no ``gotcha.'' There is no discussion as to whether we need a wall,  whether there is a crisis on the southern border. It simply says that  this is not an emergency.   The vote tomorrow boils down to something very simple for our  Republican friends: Do you believe in the Constitution and conservative  principles? There are all of these self-proclaimed conservatives. Well,  the No. 1 tenet of conservatism is that no one, particularly an  Executive, a President, should have too much power. That has been what  conservatives have stood for through the centuries, and all of a  sudden, because Donald Trump says he wants to declare an emergency, are  people going to succumb?   The Founding Fathers would be rolling in their graves. They would be  rolling in their graves for any President, let alone this one who we  know overreaches in terms of power and who we know has no understanding  of the exquisite and delicate balance that James Madison, George  Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and so many others created in the  Constitution and the Bill of Rights.   Do our Republican friends stand for conservative principles? Do they  stand for any principles at all, or do they just take a loyalty pledge  to President Trump and meekly do whatever he wants? It is that simple.   There are a lot of issues on which we disagree. There are lots of  times our Republican friends bow to President Trump, but there ought to  be an exception. And if there ever were an exception, it should be  this.   Many of my Republican colleagues rightly stood up and told the  President not to take this action. Leader McConnell himself said it was  a bad idea, a bad precedent, contravenes the power of the purse, a  dangerous step, an erosion of congressional authority. And they, our  Republican friends, were right. The President himself said he ``didn't  need to do this.'' That is not an emergency.   Are we going to say that anytime a President can't get his or her way  with Congress, they can declare an emergency and Congress will meekly  shrug its shoulders and walk by and bow in obeisance to any President,  Democratic or Republican? What a disgrace.   This is one of the true tests of our Republican colleagues--one of  the true tests--because it has always been the Democratic Party that  has been for a stronger Executive. Dwight Eisenhower was worried about  too much power going to the President, and so was Ronald Reagan. Where  are our Republican friends now? Has Donald Trump turned this Republican  Party and its conservative principles so inside out that we can't even  get four votes to declare that this isn't an emergency, that we can't  get 20 votes to say to the President that we will override this,  because this is far more important than any view on the wall or the  southern border, which we all know has been going on for a long time.  While the President thinks it is an emergency, Congress clearly didn't.  Even when Republicans controlled the House and Senate, they did nothing  about the wall.   I have talked to a lot of my Republican colleagues. They know what  this is all about. Everyone here knows the truth. The President did not  declare an emergency because there is one; he declared an emergency  because he lost in Congress and wanted to go around it. He has no  principles in terms of congressional balance of power. We know that. We  all know that. So to bow in obeisance to him when we all know what he  is doing is so wrong--a low moment for this Senate and its Republican  friends.   When it comes to the Constitution, you ought to stand up to fear and  do the right thing no matter who is in the White House. My Republican  friends know the right thing to do. They should not be afraid to do it.   Last I checked, we all took the same oath of office. What did it say?  ``Uphold the Constitution.''   There are different views on the Constitution, but I haven't heard  one constitutional scholar--left, right, or center--say that this  upholding the President on this emergency is the right thing to do in  terms of the Constitution. I hope my Republican friends will join us.   Now, it seems, from what I read in the press reports this morning,  that some Senators are in search of a fig leaf. They want to salve  their consciences. They know this is the wrong thing to do.   They came up with this idea that will change the emergency  declaration for future moments. Reports indicate that a group of  Republican Senators are pushing legislation that would ignore the  President's power grab but limit future emergency declarations--what  bunk, what a fig leaf. That will not pass.   To my friend, the Senator from Utah, who I know does have  constitutional qualms, he is squirming. His legislation will not pass.   Let me just read you what Leader Pelosi said a few minutes ago. This  is from her statement:         Republican Senators are proposing new legislation to allow       the President to violate the Constitution just this once in       order to give themselves cover. The House will not take up       this legislation to give President Trump a pass.    Do you hear me, my colleagues--my Republican colleagues? This will  not pass. This is not a salve. It is a very transparent fig leaf. If  you believe the President is doing the wrong thing, if you believe  there shouldn't be an emergency, you don't say: Well, in the Congress  we will introduce future legislation to change it, and, then, when the  President declares another emergency, we will do new legislation to  allow that too.   Come on. This fig leaf is so easily seen through, so easily blown  aside that it leaves the constitutional pretensions of my Republican  colleagues naked. The fig leaf is gone. Don't even think that it will  have anything to do with what we are doing.   I hope my colleagues will stand strong. What the Republicans want to  say with this fig leaf is, to paraphrase St. Augustine, ``Grant me the  courage to stand up to President Trump, but not yet.''   Next time and next time and next time they will say the same thing.   Let's do the right thing. Let's tell the President that he cannot use  his overreaching power to declare an emergency when he couldn't get  Congress to  [[Page S1810]]  do what he wanted, and let's not make a joke of this by saying that  there is some legislation that will not pass in the future that gives  me the OK to vote for this, to vote against this resolution. That fig  leaf makes a mockery of the whole Constitution and the whole process.
