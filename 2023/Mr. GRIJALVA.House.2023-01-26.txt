 Madam Speaker, today and tomorrow House Republicans are  bringing the Strategic Production Response Act to the floor, a bill  that forces the administration to open up even more public lands and  waters to drilling any time the President releases oils from the  reserve in order to lower consumer gas prices.   Now, what House Republicans are doing is effectively ending the  President's authority to lower consumer gas prices while handing over  our public lands and waters to Big Oil.   You might wonder why Republicans are pushing legislation that clearly  hurts the American people and consumers.   To put it plainly, they are simply crossing another item off the wish  list of Big Oil. It is a simple payback to the political campaign  donors. This legislation is not needed. It is fabricated. It is based  on a lie.   Time after time, year after year, the fossil fuel industry lobbies to  control and lock up more of our public lands and waters, and it often  comes at the expense of surrounding environmental justice communities.   I say it is built on a lie. There are 9,000 permits on public land  effectively for Big Oil to be able to drill, access, and extract. There  are 2,000 that are not being used. There are 2,000 permits on our  oceans and waters that at this point 75 percent of those permits are  not being used, which already affords them the opportunity to extract.   Frontline communities in this country carry a legacy of dumping  activities that have endangered both the health and the quality of life  of these communities.   Sadly, Big Oil has a well-documented and troubled history of  concentrating their polluting projects, such as pipelines and  refineries, in environmental justice communities, including communities  of color, poor communities, Tribal communities, communities without  political representation and a systemic discrimination in terms of the  burden they carry. All of this is documented. It is documented in  higher air pollution rates in those communities, water pollution and  contamination, premature death, higher incidence of cancer, and other  diseases that affect these communities more than any other.   Yet, Republicans, once again, stand ready to do Big Oil's bidding  this week. If Republicans actually are interested in helping American  families in the communities overburdened by oil industry pollution,  they would support the Environmental Justice For All Act.   We have been working on the Environmental Justice For All Act for  over 3 years. It was developed and shaped directly by EJ communities  during an extensive engagement process.   This Act has many components, but it's based on a simple principle:  All people have the right to clean air, clean water, and healthy local  environments. For too many across our Nation, these rights are not yet  realized.   The provisions in the Environmental Justice For All Act are about  credible, equitable access to parks and outdoor activities and  opportunities for underserved communities.   Federal agencies will be required to meaningfully, under NEPA, engage  any communities prior to any decision when proposing actions affecting  an EJ community and it strengthens Tribal consultation and input  opportunities.   The bill strengthens and restores civil rights protections for  communities long facing greater environmental hazards on the bases of  race, color, or national origin.    The bill brings transparency, coordination, and accountability from  Federal agencies when they carry out activities affecting frontline  communities.   I was proud to work with Representative McEachin, who left us far too  early, to develop the Environmental Justice For All Act. His legacy on  this issue, is his compassion that he brought to it, his strength that  he brought to it, they continue to be the legacy and the motivation to  secure environmental justice and work for this legislation.   I am proud to say that Representative Barbara Lee will now join as  co-lead on the Environmental Justice For All Act this session, and now  the legislation will be called the Donald McEachin Environmental  Justice For All Act.   We are talking about basic rights. We are not talking about anything  extravagant, anything that is not proven by fact. These communities  have been burdened time and time again by industry.   The legislation that we will be seeing today and tomorrow brought  forth by the Republicans opens the door once again to unchecked,  unmonitored and unprotected actions that will negatively continue to  affect these communities.   The environment, climate, the need for remediation, and the need for  involvement by all communities, and the resolution of the issues we  face around climate change requires that the environmental justice  community long left off the discussion, long-ignored in the history of  this Nation, in the siting of projects and activities that have hurt  those communities and those families, needs to be at the table.   If my Republican colleagues indeed want to reward Big Oil for their  support that they have given them, it is time that they include all  communities.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 21, and I urge all my colleagues  to oppose this big giveaway to Big Oil.   The bill before us today is yet another effort to open our public  lands and waters to major new oil and gas extraction. This is despite  the fact that oil companies already control huge amounts of our public  lands and waters, most of which they don't even use.   Right now, oil and gas companies have about 9,000 approved but unused  permits across 26 million acres of public land. Right now, offshore  they have 2,000 active leases covering 12 million acres, three-quarters  of which aren't being used.   This bill asks us to give them even more land--an area three times  the size of California, or more than 300 million additional acres. Big  Oil has more public land than they can use. They could expand  production today if they really wanted to. Instead, they lobby Congress  to open up even more lands to extraction, to lower environmental  standards, and to give them more taxpayer-funded subsidies. And in the  process, they lock out public land and public access from other  essential uses that would contribute to the American people and  contribute to the mitigation and remediation and the climate action  that is required around the issue of climate and the climate crisis.                                time  1245    To add insult to injury, this bill would actually make it harder to  help everyday Americans. It would prevent the President's ability to  keep down gas prices.   Last year, President Biden took decisive action, allowing releases  from the reserve to lower prices at the pump. Under this bill, if the  President needed to act again to keep prices low, he would first have  to pay off Big Oil by opening up our public lands.   This bill does not protect the American people, and it certainly  doesn't protect our climate or environment.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment No. 55 at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I believe I have made it very clear that this bill is deeply flawed  from the concept to execution. While I really do hesitate to improve a  bad bill, I think it is important that we acknowledge one of the bill's  starkest omissions.   My amendment would simply require that while developing the plan this  bill proposes, the relevant Secretaries also develop a plan to consult  with Tribal Governments. This is particularly important as the bill  could open up an additional 300 million acres of new oil and gas  extraction on public lands.   If we really intend to give away an area three times the size of  California to Big Oil, then we need to understand the impact it will  have on communities across the West starting with those who have  stewarded these lands since time immemorial.   It is essential that the Secretaries fully and meaningfully consult  with Tribal Governments to understand the impact this extractive  development would have on Tribal communities from damaging air and  water to destroying sacred sites.   For too long, Tribal Governments have been excluded from Federal  decisionmaking processes. We have seen  [[Page H379]]  the impact of that omission as homelands are degraded, sacred sites  destroyed, and Tribal communities are forced to bear the brunt of  pollution.   A no more important example is the example of uranium contamination  that continues and the cleanup of uranium contamination that continues  in around the Grand Canyon and Navajo Nation, and that has affected  that community and the Navajo people for generations. It is  unacceptable that we would turn a blind eye to these impacts.   Tribal Governments need to be at the table from the start helping to  shape decisions that impact their communities and their ancestral  lands.   This amendment would ensure that they do just that while helping to  uphold the Federal Government's trust responsibility.   This shouldn't be controversial. In fact, this should have been built  in from the start.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 56.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amendment that would  prevent this oil giveaway from further burdening communities of color,  low-income communities, Tribal, and indigenous communities.   Over the past several years our late colleague, Representative  McEachin and I traveled the country to hear from environmental justice  and frontline communities across this Nation about pollution and  climate impact. We heard the tales of water not fit to drink, air not  fit to breathe, and communities not safe to live in.   For too long we have allowed the vulnerable to bear the impacts of  development, leaving them to pay the costs that are incurred.                                time  1615    We must change that narrative by ensuring that these communities are  at the decisionmaking table and that their voices are clearly heard at  every level of government.   This was a legacy my dear friend and our late colleague dedicated his  life to, and that is why I am proud that we will be renaming the  Environmental Justice For All Act in his honor in the next several  weeks.   Unfortunately, the bill in front of us today would take us further  than ever from achieving environmental justice and attention to  frontline communities. There is no way to open up 300 million acres to  new extraction without massively impacting communities of color, low- income communities, and Tribal and indigenous communities.   These already-impacted communities would face additional pollution of  their air and water, additional impacts on their health and that of  their children.   My amendment seeks to avoid these unacceptable impacts, preventing  the Secretaries from leasing any land that would continue to increase  disproportionate burdens on already burdened communities.   We must stop putting pollution over people and put an end to the  cycles of exploitation that leave the most vulnerable facing avoidable  impacts.   Mr. Chair, I encourage all of my colleagues to support the  environmental justice amendment and to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 57.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would ensure that this Big  Oil giveaway doesn't prevent America from leading the world in clean  energy production.   Rather than tethering ourselves to the energies of the past, we need  to move forward with the energy of the future. The President knows  that; my Democratic colleagues know that; and the American people know  that. It is time we all embrace clean energy deployment.   Instead, the bill before us today would support Big Oil and only Big  Oil, pushing the public off their lands while locking up acres that  could be used for wind, solar, and other clean technologies.   This bill gives away public lands and waters to oil companies and gas  corporations at a time when we should be taking urgent action to  address the climate crisis and transition away from fossil fuels.   Public lands have huge renewable energy potential. Offshore wind  alone could produce more than 2,000 gigawatts, nearly double the  Nation's electricity use in 2021.   Rather than embrace this opportunity, H.R. 21 would require land  managers to open lands to oil and gas but wouldn't consider other  potential uses, including renewable energy.   My amendment would close this gap, requiring the Secretaries to  consider the impacts to renewable deployment before leasing new lands  to the fossil fuel industry.   The American people want affordable, reliable energy. They aren't  interested in seeing Big Oil protect their record profits and increase  their profits  [[Page H380]]  while boxing out and locking out developing technologies. It is time to  stop prioritizing polluters over people and commit to a clean, just  energy transition.   Our public lands and waters have an important role to play in  reducing emissions, protecting the climate, and supporting communities.  We need to make sure that they are available for renewable energy  production and not locked up with fossil fuel companies.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
