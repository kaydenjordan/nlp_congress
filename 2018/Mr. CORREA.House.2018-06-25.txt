 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Takano for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Walz, Mr. Valadao, and, of  course, Chairman Roe for their leadership on H.R. 299, the Blue Water  Navy Vietnam Veterans Act. This is a great example of how Democrats and  Republicans come together to do what is right for our country, as well  as our veterans.   Since the Vietnam war, veterans have reported numerous health  complications, including different forms of cancer related to the  exposure to Agent Orange.   While the Department of Veterans Affairs currently presumes that  veterans who served on the ground in Vietnam or in the Vietnamese river  system were exposed to Agent Orange, that presumption has not extended  to the blue water Navy veterans, that is, those veterans who served off  of the Vietnam coast.   This bill, thank God, corrects that decades-long mistake and expands  that presumption to those who served in the blue water Navy off of the  Vietnam coast and ensures equal treatment for all of our veterans.   Additionally, the bill expands the dates of presumption to those who  served along the Korean Demilitarized Zone and authorizes benefits for  children born with spina bifida due to a parent's exposure to Agent  Orange.   This bill, Mr. Speaker, is long overdue, and the benefits will  possibly change the lives of those veterans who served in the defense  of our country and in the defense of freedom of those around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 299.
