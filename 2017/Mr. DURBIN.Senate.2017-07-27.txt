 I thank my colleague from Vermont.   Mr. President, in my hand is one of the closely kept secrets in  Washington, DC. These eight pages have been so carefully guarded that  for 3 days, we have been on the floor of the U.S. Senate waiting for  this moment. Within the last hour, the Republicans finally released  their plan to change healthcare for every American. We have been  waiting a long time.   They have been meeting behind closed doors, in secret sessions,  writing what I have in my hand. You have to think to yourself, why  would they do it in secret? If this is something that will affect every  American, family, business, and individual and if they are proud of  what they have done, why did they wait so long? Well, when you read it,  you can understand it, because this measure proposed by the Republican  leadership makes things worse for American families when it comes to  health insurance.   It has a great name. I am sure somebody invested time thinking about  this one: The Health Care Freedom Act. It appears that for 16 million  Americans, they will be free of health insurance protection; 16 million  Americans will lose their health insurance protection because of this  Republican plan. Every other American buying health insurance will be  free to pay 20 percent more each year for the premiums on their health  insurance. You don't have to be a math major to figure out compound  interest at 20 percent a year. By the fourth year, you are knocking on  a 100-percent increase in your premiums. Your health insurance premiums  will double in about 4 years under the Republican plan.   Is that why they started this debate, so they could take health  insurance away from millions of Americans and raise the cost of health  insurance for others? Four Senators had a press conference this evening  at 5 p.m. I watched it carefully. I listened as my colleagues came to  the floor and those four Senators described this plan. They had seen  it, this so-called skinny repeal plan. One of the Senators said that  this plan was a ``fraud,'' it was a ``disaster,'' it would have a  disastrous impact on the premiums charged to people he represented in  his State, and it didn't achieve the goal of reforming and repairing  the Affordable Care Act. I will quickly add--because you will think,  well, we expect the Democrats to say that--this was a press conference  of four Republican Senators about 6 hours ago. They had read the  Republican plan and called it a ``fraud,'' a ``disaster,'' raising  premiums, and not really bringing reform to healthcare in America.   It will take only one of those four Senators to stand up and speak up  and vote no for the right thing to happen--for this proposal to go to  committee where it should have started and to be considered by the  experts first, so we know its real impact, and then to have an  amendment process where better ideas might be offered and debated and  added to this proposal--benefits voted out of committee. Then bring it  to the floor of the U.S. Senate for the same thing to happen.   Do you know who came up with the radical idea that we should go  through the committee process and both parties participate in writing  this reform? None other than Senator John McCain. He came to this floor  a couple of days ago. It was a historic moment. Everyone--both  political parties--was cheering this man whom we have served with and  love and respect. And he warned us. He warned us that if we didn't do  this together--Democrats and Republicans--the results would be  terrible.    Can you afford terrible results when it comes to healthcare for your  family, for you, for your baby? Of course, you can't. We have to do our  level best not to win the political debate but to win the confidence of  the American people that we understand how to make healthcare better  and more responsive in America.   I have been through a lot of measures, and I have voted on a lot of  things over the years. My proudest vote was for the Affordable Care  Act, because I knew we would extend the reach, protection, and peace of  mind of health insurance to millions of Americans.  [[Page S4405]]    I had an experience early in my life. I was newly married and had a  brand new baby girl with a serious health issue, and I had no health  insurance--none. I went to the local hospital here, waiting in the  charity ward, in the hopes that the doctor who walked through that door  would be the one who would save my baby's life. I thought to myself: I  will never let that happen again. I will have health insurance, no  matter what it takes, the rest of my life. I know the feeling, and some  others do too.   I don't want American families and individuals to go through this. I  want them to have the peace of mind and protection of good health  insurance. That is why this Republican proposal taking health insurance  away from 16 million Americans is such a travesty. That is why the  notion of raising health insurance costs beyond the reach of working  families is so wrong and so disgraceful, and that is why, with the help  of one more Republican Senator, we can send this measure back to a  committee where it can be seriously considered, worked on, improved,  and passed so that we can say to the American people: We did our job as  Senators. We did what John McCain challenged us to do--to come together  on a bipartisan basis and to make this a better bill.   I am glad my colleagues are here this evening. I am glad to see my  friend from the State of Wyoming who is here. We have worked on many  issues together. We disagree on this one, but I hope that he will  realize and the others will, too, that this secret that they have kept  from the American people is plain wrong. It is a secret that now it has  been outed. It has to be put to rest. Let's do this the right way.  Let's do it for the well-being and health of America families across  this Nation.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.    Mr. President, student loan borrowers currently carry  about $1.4 trillion in student loan debt. This breaks down to about 44  million borrowers holding student loan debt with an average balance of  $30,000. This crushing debt has pushed many borrowers to delay  important life decisions, including marriage, having children, or  buying homes. Despite that, some still choose careers in public service  to give back to their community and support our country.   However, the immense burden of student loan debt is not put on pause  while individuals choose to forgo other work opportunities to serve our  Nation in the military or public service. Recognizing this, the Federal  Government established two ways to alleviate some of this burden for  those who serve our country.   The Servicemember Civil Relief Act protects our servicemembers from  interest rates above 6 percent on all loans while they are on Active  Duty. This protection extends to both public and private student loans  taken out preservice.   Public service loan forgiveness encourages people to become public  servants by forgiving student loan debt after 10 years of public  service, including military service. Under this program; borrowers must  enroll in a qualifying repayment plan and make 10 years of payments  while working in public service before the loan is forgiven.  Additionally, borrowers with Perkins or Federal Family Education Loans  must consolidate their loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan.   However, the act of consolidating these loans carries an unintended  consequence for servicemembers. Currently, if a servicemember chooses  to consolidate his or her preservice loans to qualify for public  service loan forgiveness, those loans are no longer eligible for the 6  percent interest rate cap provided under the Servicemember Civil Relief  Act. The act of consolidating old debt for the purpose of enrolling  public service loan forgiveness is treated as creating a new loan under  current law, effectively forcing servicemembers to choose between the 6  percent interest rate cap while they are on Active Duty and enrolling  in a program that will forgive their loans after 10 years of service  and steady payments.   Requiring servicemembers to give up the interest rate cap while on  Active Duty for a chance to earn loan forgiveness in the future was  never the intention of Congress. Rather, in enacting the Public Service  Loan Forgiveness Program and the Servicemember Civil  [[Page S4417]]  Relief Act, Congress intended to support servicemembers burdened with  student loan debt. We owe it to our servicemen to fix this unintended  consequence.   This week, Senator Duckworth and I reintroduced the Servicemember  Student Loan Affordability Act. This bill would allow preservice  private or Federal student loan debt to be consolidated or refinanced  while retaining the 6 percent interest rate cap. This minor change to  the law will have a significant impact on servicemembers with student  loan debt by allowing them to get the benefits Congress intended for  them.   The bill is supported by the American Legion, the Association of  United States Navy, the National Guard Association of the United  States, the Retired Enlisted Association, the Paralyzed Veterans of  America, Veteran Education Success, The Institute of College Access and  Success, and the National Education Association.   I urge my colleagues to consider this simple solution to help  servicemembers. I hope they will join Senator Duckworth and myself and  support the Servicemember Student Loan Affordability Act.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1659         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Consumers from       Unreasonable Credit Rates Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds that--        (1) attempts have been made to prohibit usurious interest       rates in America since colonial times;        (2) at the Federal level, in 2006, Congress enacted a       Federal 36 percent annualized usury cap for servicemembers       and their families for covered credit products, as defined by       the Department of Defense, which curbed payday, car title,       and tax refund lending around military bases;        (3) notwithstanding such attempts to curb predatory       lending, high-cost lending persists in all 50 States due to       loopholes in State laws, safe harbor laws for specific forms       of credit, and the exportation of unregulated interest rates       permitted by preemption;        (4) due to the lack of a comprehensive Federal usury cap,       consumers annually pay approximately $14,000,000,000 on high-      cost overdraft loans, as much as approximately $7,000,000,000       on storefront and online payday loans, $3,800,000,000 on car       title loans, and additional amounts in unreported revenues on       high-cost online installment loans;        (5) cash-strapped consumers pay on average approximately       400 percent annual interest for payday loans, 300 percent       annual interest for car title loans, up to 17,000 percent or       higher for bank overdraft loans, and triple-digit rates for       online installment loans;        (6) a national maximum interest rate that includes all       forms of fees and closes all loopholes is necessary to       eliminate such predatory lending; and        (7) alternatives to predatory lending that encourage small       dollar loans with minimal  [[Page S4430]]       or no fees, installment payment schedules, and affordable       repayment periods should be encouraged.       SEC. 3. NATIONAL MAXIMUM INTEREST RATE.         Chapter 2 of the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1631 et       seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``SEC. 140B.
