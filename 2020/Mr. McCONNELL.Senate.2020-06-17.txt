 Madam President, on behalf of the entire Kentucky  delegation, all Kentuckians and the entire U.S. Congress, I must begin  this morning by expressing our deepest condolences to our colleague  Representative Andy Barr and his family.   His lovely wife Carol passed away suddenly and unexpectedly  yesterday. She was only 39 years old. She leaves behind her husband,  their two beautiful young daughters, Eleanor and Mary Clay, and an  entire community that knew her, admired her, and valued her many  contributions.   To meet Carol Barr was instantly to like her. Her warm personality  filled the room and uplifted everybody. Her faith, her love of family,  and her dedication to her community were totally evident. Through her  own career and her work with Andy, she poured her time and talents into  giving back to her neighbors in the Sixth District.   We are so very, very sorry for our colleague's loss. All of our  prayers go out to Andy, to their girls, and to the entire Barr and  Leavell families at this tremendously difficult hour.                            ____________________     Madam President, on an entirely different matter,  Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. Over the last several months, our  country has been shaken by the killings of more Black Americans at the  hands of law enforcement. The people of this country have called for  change.   The United States of America is not a fundamentally racist country.  We are the greatest Nation in world history built on the promise of  liberty and justice for all, but our founding promise was stained by  the sins of slavery and racial prejudice. Generations of Americans have  spent more than a century working to remediate that stain. We fought a  Civil War. Black Americans led a movement that won historic Supreme  Court wins and landmark Federal legislation. We have squeezed racist  lies out of mainstream society and relegated them to a pathetic fringe.   But the events of the last few weeks have reminded this country that  the stain is not totally gone. We have a lot more work to do. While the  far left has tried to exploit America's pain and anger to push insane  policies like defunding or disbanding all police or nonsense claims  like the assertion that enforcing laws is inherently racist, the rest  of the country has been busy uniting around some commonsense truths.   When Black Americans tell us they do not feel safe in their own  communities, we need to listen. When American citizens lack faith in  our justice system from start to finish, we need to respond. When the  equal protection of the laws feel to some Americans like a contingency  of demographics and not a universal fact of life, we need to act. That  is what this Senate Republican majority is doing today. We are acting.   Sadly, the junior Senator from South Carolina is no stranger to this  subject himself. Senator Scott has led the construction of a strong  proposal that will increase transparency, grow accountability, and  advance the cause of police reform without lashing out at the lion's  share of brave law enforcement officers who serve bravely and well.   Later today, he will introduce this new legislation, and it will be  the very next bill we consider here on the Senate floor. We will be  turning to this bill next week. Senator Scott's JUSTICE Act provides  solutions that are as sober, as serious, and as significant as this  watershed moment demands.   Faced with the fact that policing is primarily a local and State,  rather than a Federal, concern, our colleague has nevertheless found a  variety of levers that Congress can pull to advance and incentivize and  insist on the changes that we need to see. We need to encourage police  departments across America to implement practical reforms like ending  choke holds, training their officers to deescalate tense situations,  and having prior disciplinary records play a greater role in hiring.  His bill does that   We need to increase accountability so that bad officers are easy to  spot and good officers' good names stay clear. This bill does that. It  will get more body cameras on the streets, help ensure they are used  properly, and disseminate new best practices for discipline,  suspension, or dismissal when necessary. We also need more transparency  so communities have greater visibility into local law enforcement. This  bill does that too. We will require full reporting to the FBI when a  local officer has used force or discharged his or her weapon.   In a subject that has tragically become a major focus for my hometown  of Louisville, KY, we address no-knock warrants as well. We will  require new transparency and new reporting from State and local  authorities so surrounding communities and the Federal Government can  all better understand how, when, and why this practice is used.   These are just some of the major parts of our colleague's  legislation. The JUSTICE Act will also finally make lynching a Federal  crime. It will close the consent loophole by forbidding law enforcement  from taking advantage of people in their custody and more.   This legislation is a substantial effort to help our Nation make  major headway on substantial challenges. I am grateful to Senator Scott  for his leadership. I appreciate the contributions of Chairman Lindsey  Graham, Senators Capito, Cornyn, Lankford, and Sasse.   The Democratic-led House of Representatives is, of course, out of  town. They have had time to issue partisan attacks from long distance  but have yet to take up any police reform legislation in the weeks  since the deaths of Ms. Taylor and Mr. Floyd.   The action is in the Senate. The leadership is in the Senate. Now,  over the past several days, some of our Senate Democratic colleagues  have undertaken to attack this new legislation before they have even  read it and before it was even released--while it was still being  compiled, as a matter of fact. Let me make this perfectly clear. Senate  Republicans are interested in making a law. We want to enact needed  reforms. We want to make policing in America better.   We have just demonstrated on the CARES Act and, once again, on the  Great American Outdoors Act, that we can act together and achieve  bipartisan support. This is another one of those issues that needs to  be addressed--needs to be addressed now and can only be addressed in  the Senate if both sides are willing to work together.   Needless to say, if we are going to make law on this issue in the  Senate, it will have to be a bipartisan effort. I hope and expect that  there will be opportunities for amendments from both sides. I hope we  can step up, stand together, and work in good faith to turn this  impressive starting point into law for our country. We will have the  chance next week, so let's don't waste it.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on another matter. Every year in  Kentucky, nearly 350,000 people take to the great outdoors to go  hunting--more than a third of them on public lands. Over half a million  head to the Commonwealth's lakes and rivers to fish, and 1.3 million  enjoy the open space and the majesty of our wildlife looking for a  glimpse of the Bluegrass' native species. And 120,000 Kentuckians earn  their living keeping these vibrant traditions of outdoor recreation up  and running for everyone else. Public lands are an important part of  life across our State. From the Cumberland Gap to the Land Between the  Lakes, our parks, our refuges, and historic sites form the backbone of  local economies and welcome millions of visitors from across the  country and around the world.   If you ask any of my colleagues, you would hear similar stories about  the landmarks, wilderness, and history  [[Page S3027]]  that made their own States unique. America's hundreds of millions of  acres of public lands are the result of hundreds of years of  exploration and conservation. Today, the Senate will act to ensure this  inheritance will stand the test of time for generations of Americans  yet to come.   The Great American Outdoors Act will bring much needed resources to  the long-deferred maintenance and upkeep in parks and other public  lands all across our country. It will secure permanent support for the  Land and Water Conservation Fund and its mission of expanding access to  national treasures.   This major legislation is only before us because of the persistent  effort on the part of several of our colleagues. So one last time, I  thank Senator Gardner and Senator Daines for their outstanding  leadership, and Senators Portman, Manchin, Alexander, and Warner, among  other colleagues on both sides, for all their work to bring this  bipartisan project to completion.   I hope, following our action, the House will take it up and pass it  quickly. The President has already said he is eager to sign it. We  should not let this historic opportunity pass us by. I look forward to  passing this monumental legislation later today.                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
