 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service  of Wayne Lloyd Van Riper to this great country.   Wayne Van Riper is a veteran of World War II and is celebrating his  95th birthday on April 16. During his service in the U.S. Army from  1943 to 1945, his efforts were instrumental in providing support to the  293rd Combat Engineer Battalion, A Company.   Wayne was born in the State of Washington in 1924. After enlisting  after high school, Wayne served in George S. Patton's Third Army.  Entering Active Duty in 1943, Wayne served valiantly in England,  France, Germany, and was on his way to Japan, but Japan surrendered  before he arrived there in 1945.   After the war, Wayne attended Oregon State University, and purchased  a pear and apple orchard in Oregon. There he met the love of his life,  Wanda Johnson, and married her in August of 1948. They have a daughter,  Teresa Rae Lash, and a son, Kevin Wayne Van Riper. Later he retired and  moved to McCall, Idaho.   On behalf of the people of Idaho and America, I thank Wayne for his  military service and wish him all the best on his 95th birthday.                            ____________________
