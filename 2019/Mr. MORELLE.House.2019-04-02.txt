 Mr. Speaker, more than 4 million women in the United  States experience physical violence by a domestic partner every single  day. This staggering statistic underscores the great importance of the  Violence Against Women Act reauthorization.   This critical legislation, which I am proud to cosponsor, provides  the support and protections that victims of sexual assault and domestic  violence need and deserve.   In my community, we have many organizations, like the Willow Domestic  Violence Center, that provide lifesaving services to women in need and  rely on funding authorized by the Violence Against Women Act to  operate.   I am especially pleased that this reauthorization includes vital  provisions to keep guns out of the hands of those accused of stalking  or dating violence.   I look forward to the passage of this important legislation and will  continue working with my colleagues in the House to advance policies  that support and empower women and ensure a safer community for all  people.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from  California (Mr. Garamendi) for his eloquence and his leadership on this  critically important issue.   I rise to express my strong opposition to the Trump administration's  efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and pull the rug out from  millions of Americans who rely on the ACA for essential health  coverage.   Quality, affordable healthcare should be a right for every American,  and we should make it easier, not harder, for individuals and families  to get the insurance they deserve.   The House majority made a promise to always offer protections for  individuals with preexisting conditions and fight back against those  who seek to dismantle their fundamental protections.   That is why I am proud to cosponsor a resolution to reverse the  administration's cruel attempts to sabotage care for Americans in need,  and I thank Mr. Garamendi for his leadership with House Resolution  1884.   We will not allow people with preexisting conditions to go back to  the days where they were denied coverage when they needed it the most.  And I might also say, parenthetically--and I appreciate very much the  gentleman from California's leadership as the superintendent of  insurance in the State of the California--I had the privilege of  working on legislation in New York back in the early nineties as a new  member that introduced community rating in the State of New York and  offered protections for preexisting conditions.   Subsequent to that, I had an opportunity to serve as the chair of the  Insurance Committee in the New York State Assembly.   In that role, I was responsible for helping to implement the  Affordable Care Act in the State of New York.   Many of the protections in the Affordable Care Act were already part  of New York law. I am very, very proud of that; and continued to work  on that as majority leader of the State Assembly.   But the protections which we, I think, rely on in New York are not  available to all Americans, and to those plans which we are not able,  as a state, to regulate, self-regulated plans and other plans protected  by ERISA, don't have those protections.   So I think it is critically important as we continue to move forward  that we work tirelessly. And I will work with my colleagues to protect  and expand the Affordable Care Act, to lower costs and ensure  hardworking families everywhere in America have healthcare that they  can rely on.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend from  California.   You know you understand how it is for many of us who are blessed to  have either employer-offered health insurance or are in a situation  where you don't think as much about the costs or the issues that  involve health insurance. But what you find from talking to people, as  many people are not as privileged as I might be, and really faced  critical decisions about whether they could have medicine to treat  chronic illnesses or had to make the decision between that and rent.   Or for people who had--as I have said on this floor before, I,  unfortunately, lost my daughter to cancer, breast cancer, about a year  and-a-half ago.   Lauren had good health insurance, but during her illness, I often  thought about men and women in her circumstance, what challenges they  would face, even if they are able to defeat the illness, whether or not  those preexisting conditions would cause their insurance premiums to be  so high and so unattainable that the idea of having quality, affordable  healthcare would simply not be within their reach.                                time  1730    This affects millions of Americans. Whether it is women who plan on  beginning a family, starting a family; whether it is the elderly who  have chronic conditions--you mentioned hypertension; or whether you  have diabetes, there are a whole host of conditions. Most Americans  have some form of preexisting condition.   For us to allow the underwriting to be done with those preexisting  conditions in mind would simply put healthcare out of the reach of most  Americans, quality, affordable healthcare. That is why I think this is  so important.   I might also add that the Department of Justice is charged with  defending the laws duly enacted by this Congress and by the President  of the United States. That is the job of the Department of Justice. I  find it reprehensible that this Department of Justice under this  administration would take the view that they will join in a lawsuit  against a law fully enacted that is the law of the land of the United  States and seek to overturn it. It is virtually without precedent.   What is so troubling about it is that this will leave millions of  Americans without coverage and without health insurance at a time when  we should be doing everything we can to ensure that more Americans have  access to quality, affordable care.
