 Mr. Speaker, it is with profound sadness that I stand  before you to share the passing of a legendary news and sports  broadcaster, an accomplished musician, a father, friend, and son of  Hawaii, Robert Kaleimomi Kekaula, who unexpectedly passed away last  Saturday in Hawaii at 56 years of age.   In order to tell you about Robert, I must do so with great respect to  his chosen career path and success as the consummate communicator.   Where, when, and how quickly he acquired his excellent skills,  whether at his high school alma mater, the Kamehameha Schools, the  University of Hawaii, where he earned a bachelor's degree in  communications, or throughout his experience as a Native Hawaiian  growing up on Hawaii Island, I can't say.   Yet what I can say with certainty is that Robert held the powerful  ability of talking to people; not about people, but to people. And he  did it exceedingly well, with thousands, including myself, for 35 years  in the broadcast industry.   It is quite possible that his talents were not learned skills at all,  but, rather, God-given gifts that he so willingly shared with all of  us. I would be hard-pressed to find a living room or dining table in  Hawaii that did not at some point during that time welcome in Robert  Kekaula and his daily evening news and sports reports.   The reason, Robert connected with people. For him, people came first,  before the stories, before the news. He understood that the primary  role of the news, of the media was to improve people's lives. It was  not to be sensational. It was not to stoke conflict. It was to inform.   That sincerity, that genuine care, from a man with that unmistakable  baritone voice and dominant presence, made people comfortable to watch  him; moreover, comfortable to share the details of their lives with  him, and the audience who leaned in to listen and learn.   Described as a perfectionist, he held himself and others to three  requirements in the newsroom. What went out of his newsroom and into  the living rooms had to be correct, pertinent, and helpful to Hawaii.   He had a photographic memory for detail. He was a wordsmith. He had  the ear of key figures in Hawaii sports. He was proud of the local kids  who made it. He was all about Hawaii.   His reach into our homes did not stop with him, however, because  Robert made it a point to share his knowledge. As a mentor, he could  see in young journalists what others could not see.   He opened his door to those who otherwise had doors closed in their  faces. And just as folks welcomed him into their homes, Robert would  welcome aspiring broadcasters into his home of sports and news.   Many young men and women he mentored went on to become sports  anchors, as well as news reporters, and every single one of them was  better for having Robert in their lives.   His bright Aloha shirts became his mainstay. He became synonymous  with them. He was rarely seen without one. And on the national circuit,  the Daily Show with Trevor Noah shared a shot of Robert in his Aloha  shirt, and Noah commented: ``Even their newscasts are so chill.''   The brightness of Robert's shirts only mirrored the brightness of his  smile and the endless radiance of his Aloha spirit.   Within this skilled communicator and mentor lived a Native Hawaiian  who inspired others, including myself. To see Robert on the news and  the small screen gave way to other Native Hawaiians to believe they  could have a career on TV, too.   In public, he was just as approachable, and friends tell me he often  covered the tab for those he didn't know.   His legacy lives on through the people fortunate enough to learn from  him and work with him and in the music he composed, produced, and  performed alongside his daughter, Tiera, and through his family and  friends whom he loved dearly.   ``'A'ohe mea nana e ho'opuhili, he moho no ka la makani,'' ``there is  no one to interfere, for he is a messenger of a windy day,'' said in  admiration of a person who lets nothing stop him from carrying out the  task entrusted to him.   To me and to so many others, that is the essence of Robert, who  carried out the task as the consummate communicator with extreme love  for Hawaii and its people.   Mahalo, Robert Kaleimomi Kekaula, for your immeasurable contributions  to Hawaii. We are forever grateful, and you will be forever missed.                            ____________________
