 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the  Levin-Beyer-Smith-Van Drew amendment to H.R. 1941, the Coastal and  Marine Economies Protection Act. This amendment, which I'm proud to  cosponsor, would ensure that H.R. 1941 not only proscribes future oil  and gas leases of the Outer Continental Shelf in the Atlantic and  Pacific planning areas but also prohibits any seismic activities in the  Atlantic Ocean planning areas.   Seismic activities are performed to first test for the possibility of  oil and gas but in and of themselves, these activities pose countless  risks to marine life and, by extension, our fishing industries and the  health of our coastal ecosystems. Seismic airgun blasting in particular  can deafen or seriously maim marine wildlife which rely upon sonar  power for movement and can significantly affect local fish populations,  which in turn harms New Jersey's fisheries as well as the fishing  industry--a vital contributor to the economic well-being of my district  on the Jersey Shore.   I have continuously stated my strong opposition to offshore drilling  and have made it clear that the people of New Jersey do not want oil  rigs offshore, and we do not want our pristine beaches and waters at  risk from oil spills.   I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment to H.R. 1941 and  to support the underlying bill.
