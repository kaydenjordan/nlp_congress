 Mr. President, my amendment No. 3703 is pretty  straightforward. It would increase funding for the National Suicide  Prevention Lifeline by an additional $2.8 million.   It is a bipartisan amendment. It is fully offset. It is not adding  money to the budget. I think it will do a great deal to make sure that  anyone battling depression knows there is someone out there who is  listening. Our National Suicide Prevention Hotline, as you know,  supports the national network of local crisis centers. To date, they  have answered more than 10 million calls from people in distress, and  they estimate that over the next 4 years, they will take 12 million  calls. We underfund them. It is embarrassing how much we underfund  them.   Again, this will add an additional $2.8 million to their budget, and  it is fully offset.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
