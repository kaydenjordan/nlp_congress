 Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the most  immediate, but still underpublicized, crisis facing America today.   No country can afford unlimited immigration.   In 2018, 830,000 people were sworn in as new citizens, as they spent  years in America proving they were the moral citizens John Adams said  were necessary to keep our Republic.   Now record numbers of unvetted immigrants, including, we believe,  over 10,000 Haitians at the border, are flooding in our country. We  have been processing over 200,000 immigrants at the border each of the  last 2 months, many of which are turned around; but in July over  100,000 immigrants were let in. That is in comparison to 8,000  immigrants being let in a year earlier. It appears in August we will be  at another 90,000 people coming in.   Because of the flood of refugees, the Border Patrol must do paperwork  so that 224 miles of the Texan border is largely unguarded. People I  talk to in Border Patrol believe that the official number of 31,000  got-aways is probably understated.                                time  1100    It is hard not to conclude that this is happening by design.  Recently, the Biden administration extended temporary protective  status, causing drug cartels to inform people all around the world that  the border is open.   I should point out, by the way, when people talk about the Haitians,  these are not people who are coming here from Haiti. These are Spanish- speaking people who already were in places like Chile, for example.  They are not coming here because they have nowhere  [[Page H5102]]  else to go; they have somewhere else to go. They are coming here  because they received a message from the Biden administration that we  are not guarding our borders.   It is apparent they feel the over 800,000 legally vetted immigrants  are not enough. It is kind of amazing.   I don't know where the press is in this. The press ought to wake up.  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, other than her 1-day photo op, have  largely ignored the border. Wouldn't you think they would be getting  nothing but questions as far as what is going on, on the border? Why  aren't you down there? Why aren't you seeing what is going on? This  will destroy America. America must wake up.   Two weeks ago in the Education and Labor Committee, apparently in an  effort to further increase illegal immigration, all 28 Democrats voted  specifically to give Pell grants, which is free college, to illegal  immigrants--it is unbelievable--while the middle-class families in  America are forced to go tens of thousands of dollars in debt to get  their college.   We are specifically saying that if you come here illegally, we will  give you free college--unbelievable--in addition to promises of free  healthcare. It is no wonder that so many people are flooding across our  border.   By the way, I want to give our President something to think of. When  we appear so weak at the border, I think it tells other countries  around the world that we are weak, as well. I don't know what President  wants to be known as the weak President, but you don't think that other  countries like Iran, groups like the Taliban, Russia, are observing  this and taking the measure of what Joe Biden is as he lets people  flood across the border?   By the way, we are also finally at a point at which 90,000 Americans  are dying every year of illegal drug overdoses. My local law  enforcement, who have to deal with the families of the people who die  largely because of fentanyl coming across the southern border, wonder  why more isn't being done down there. But again, it seems to be, well,  middle-class Americans dying of drug overdoses, that is not the  priority. So we continue to allow floods coming across the border.   It has been well-publicized that illegal immigrants are coming into  America with COVID and other diseases, further causing me to wonder  about the sincerity of some of the things that President Biden has  said.   I do wonder whether or not the vaccine mandates at the very time that  tens of thousands of people are flooding across the border every month,  and I do have to wonder about this bizarre bill on Friday, which is  certainly going to get headlines as the majority of the House of  Representatives votes to legalize abortion until birth, is it an effort  to cause the press and even our supposedly conservative news outlets to  avert their eyes from the border, as they have to focus on vaccine  mandates and 8\1/2\-month abortions?   In any event, I am calling on America to wake up. I realize there is  not an election now, but you better make your voice heard, or we are  going to lose the border.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring an underreported  story up for the attention of the majority party, the Biden  administration, and our press corps.   People are debating masks and mandatory vaccines. I talked to a local  coroner, and they have recently found most of their COVID deaths are  already vaccinated people.   What if we found a cure? Israeli researchers recently found that  fenofibrate, also called TriCor, a long-used anticholesterol drug,  cured 14 of 15 elderly patients with comorbidities who were already on  oxygen with pneumonia in less than a week. The other one was cured  within 14 days. It also dramatically reduced the damage many COVID  patients suffer after the cure.   Wouldn't it be great if COVID could be cured for less than $20 a day?   Fenofibrate. That is two F's in fenofibrate. Google The Jerusalem  Post.   I beg the CDC or NIH to take action. The press should publicize this  and ask why the politicians aren't doing more to bring this to market  and curing COVID.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, due to an important meeting, I missed  the rollcall.
