 Madam Speaker, today, I rise in support  of H.R. 35, the Emmett Till Antilynching Act, a bill that will specify  lynching as a hate crime.   This bill corrects a longstanding omission from Federal civil rights  law. Historically, nearly 200 antilynching bills were filibustered out  of existence or just plain ignored.   Lynchings were violent and public acts of torture used for nearly a  century to enforce racial segregation.   This legislation is long overdue. Lynchings were wrong, immoral, and  inhumane.   This bill is named in honor of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African  American youth from Chicago who was lynched in my district in 1955  while visiting an uncle in Mississippi.   There is a memorial dedicated to Mr. Till in my district.  Unfortunately, it is the only memorial in America that has to be  bulletproof.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding an additional minute.   In years past, the signs have been stolen, thrown in the river,  replaced; shot, replaced again; shot again; defaced with acid; and had  ``KKK'' spray-painted on them.   The signs were placed near the spot where Mr. Till's body was pulled  from the Tallahatchie River in 1955.   The 14-year-old was tortured and killed by two White men after false  accusations that he flirted with a White woman.   His death became an important catalyst in the civil rights movement.   With the passage of this bill, we hope to heal the past and present  racial injustice. Our country is in need of reconciliation.   Lynching claimed the lives of an immeasurable number of African  Americans, yet the perpetrators were never held accountable.  Conversely, official inaction has left lasting scars on our  communities.   Today, I represent Mississippi's Second Congressional District, which  includes the area where Emmett Till was lynched. His murderers were  never held accountable for what they did.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Collins very  much for yielding.   This is kind of emotional for me, because I knew this young man's  mother before she died, a very wonderful lady who suffered an  unfortunate tragedy at the hands of some dastardly individuals.   But more importantly, we are a better country than what that deed  dictates.   I support Congressman Rush's bill. It is a bill that is long overdue.  But just as important, we have to commit ourselves to making this  country a better country.   In the little town of Glendora, where the fan that was attached to  young Emmett's body that sank in the Tallahatchie River was found,  there is  [[Page H1201]]  a little museum dedicated not only to Mr. Till, but to the atrocities  that have occurred in my district over time.   Madam Speaker, I compliment those individuals for putting the museum  together and also for dedicating themselves to letting the world know  what happened, but also recommitting ourselves to try not to let it  happen again.   So we must pass this legislation, Madam Speaker. We must pass it to  correct the inactions of those before us. The inaction of others does  not relieve one of the obligation to do what is right.                                time  1245
