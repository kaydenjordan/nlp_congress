 Madam Speaker, rural communities are the heartbeat of  America. These are hardworking, God-fearing people, and they deserve  access to basic healthcare. And quite frankly, if our Nation is going  to reap the blessings of our food supply and food security and our fuel  supply and energy independence, we have to work together to make sure  that we have that critical access to care, which means sustainable  rural communities and a robust supply of ag and energy.   Now, in 1969 in the wisdom of the Texas legislature, they created the  Texas Tech University Medical School that became the Texas Tech  University Health Sciences Center. And the mission was not only to  train up the next generation of healthcare professionals and develop  the next generation of healthcare innovations, it was to plug a gaping  hole in rural communities by providing excellent healthcare services to  these good people.   The Health Sciences Center has become Texas' center for innovation in  telehealth practices.   The Health Sciences Center has pioneered telehealth and paved the way  for over 100,000 rural west Texans to access vital healthcare services.   By understanding the needs of rural patients who are at increased  risk for physician shortages and have a higher mortality rate than  their urban counterparts, the Texas Tech University Health Sciences  Center was able to provide a blueprint for telehealth best practices  that have been essential to our country over the past 2 years.   In addition to protecting patients' physical health, the Health  Sciences Center has developed Telepsych, which connects patients,  including children, who are having serious mental health issues, to a  licensed professional. And unfortunately, with school closures as a  result of the pandemic--and I would say later as a result of union- controlled schools--this has become a much-needed and much more popular  service.   Thank you, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center for being a  beacon of hope for the health and future of our country and especially  rural America.   God bless, and go west Texas.                Wishing Elvin N. Howell a Happy 108th Birthday     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and wish  Elvin Howell a happy 108th birthday.   Mr. Howell grew up in Snyder, Texas, before hitchhiking to Abilene,  Texas, to attend Hardin-Simmons University, where he played football  and ran track.   After graduating from HSU, Howell moved to Kermit, Texas, with his  wife, Rena.   Following the attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II, Mr. Howell  heroically enlisted in the United States Navy and served as a commander  on a merchant marine ship guarding the United States from a foreign  invasion.   Mr. Howell returned to west Texas after the war to raise his family  and educate the next generation of west Texans as a teacher in Tulia,  Texas.   Mr. Howell credits his impressive longevity to spending time  outdoors, as when he celebrated his 103rd birthday ziplining in the  Palo Duro Canyon. What a man.   Elvin Howell has lived a full life of service to his family,  community, and his country. He is one of the 20 oldest living veterans  in the United States. Elvin is an inspiring coach, a caring educator,  and a true west Texan.   Elvin was married to his late wife, Rena, for 60 years. They have two  sons, John and Fred, and three grandchildren.   On behalf of my colleagues in this great Chamber, we want to wish Mr.  Howell a happy 108th birthday and many more to come.   God bless, and go west Texas.                            ____________________
