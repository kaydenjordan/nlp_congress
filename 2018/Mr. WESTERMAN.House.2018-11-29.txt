 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service of  Garland County Judge Rick Davis. Judge Davis is currently serving his  fourth and final term in my home county in central Arkansas.   Since becoming the county executive 8 years ago, Judge Davis has  worked hard to improve county roads, stabilize the water supply, and  improve the business environment of Garland County. He has excelled in  his role, bringing more than 30 years of private industry experience to  his job.   Before taking the helm of the county judge's office, Rick was chief  executive officer of Daveco Construction and, along with his wife,  Denise, raised registered Angus cattle on his farm. In fact, the Davis  family was named Garland County Farm Family of the Year in 2004. Rick  and Denise are important members of our community who have dedicated  their lives to service.   I congratulate Rick on a successful tenure as county judge and his  long-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
