 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th  anniversary of the founding of the United States Sergeants Major  Academy.   Fort Bliss is the home to the Sergeants Major Academy that trains our  military leaders to address our country's challenges. Since 1972, the  academy has expanded students' strategic level of thinking to become  capable to address large-scale combat operations.   At the end of the academy, leaders leave as agile, adaptive senior  leaders with the character, competence, and commitment to be effective  leaders.   I am proud that my office's veterans' caseworker, Sergeant Major  Benito Torres, graduated from the academy in 2009.   I commend the continuous education that the academy provides and  their dedication for our military to be ready for future challenges.  Please join me in recognizing the accomplishments of the last 50 years  of the United States Sergeants Major Academy and wish them continued  growth and success.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, it is incredible to stand here and listen  to our Republican colleagues talk about the risks and the dangers that  exist to the Supreme Court.   I want to know where they were when the risks and the dangers existed  for my community, El Paso, Texas, where 23 innocent people were  slaughtered by a white supremacist with an AK-47? Where were they then?  How about Uvalde? Where were they then? How about every other mass  shooting? Buffalo? You name it.   Last week, we brought to the floor legislation intended to protect  millions of Americans, especially and including children. The vast  majority of our Republican colleagues voted against those protections  for vulnerable people who don't have access to 24-hour, round-the-clock  U.S. Marshal protection. They don't have access to round-the-clock, 24/ 7 Capitol Police protection, which Supreme Court Justices have today.  Supreme Court Justices have far more protections than Members of  Congress do, but more importantly they have more than those innocent  lives that were taken in innumerable cities across America.   And as they rail about and clutch their pearls over the fact that it  took House Democrats some time to get this bill to the floor, the  reason it took that much time is because it was House Democrats that at  least wanted to get one itty-bitty concession out of this bill to  protect the staff of that institution, the United States Supreme Court.  But they refused.     Madam Speaker, I remind the American public why they  brought this bill to the floor, both in the Senate and here; it is a  talking point. It is not because it really does anything, it is simply  a talking point. It came as a result of a leaked decision on the  Justices' desire to take away women's reproductive care.   Guess who else doesn't get protections in America the way that they  would like to protect others? It is those healthcare providers and  patients and staff who are vulnerable every day, especially because of  the actions of the Supreme Court.
