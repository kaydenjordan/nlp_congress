 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  resilient linemen of Texas-25 for their outstanding work to  successfully provide power to Texas homes, businesses, and communities  during the catastrophic winter storms.   I and many others send our deep gratitude to the workers of the  [[Page H1588]]  Pedernales Electric Cooperative, Austin Energy, and other electric  providers in Texas-25 who worked tirelessly through a brutal winter  storm to meet the needs of Texans and across the State.   They put their lives in danger, working around the clock in subzero  temperatures and in harsh conditions to restore critical power as  quickly as possible.   Due to their fortitude and grit, lives were saved, animals were  saved, and communities were restored and on track to recovery.   You are our heroes, and on behalf of the 25th Congressional District  of Texas, we simply say thank you. In God we trust.                            ____________________
