 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of Joe Shuker, a  Federal worker in my district.   I met with Joe on Friday after he reached out, looking for help for  his colleagues, TSA agents who have been working for 3 weeks without  pay. Their jobs are stressful, and many of them live paycheck to  paycheck. Now they have the added stress of struggling to pay  mortgages, rent, childcare, or even to put food on the table. Many  can't afford to get gas to get to their jobs.   Joe has gone door to door to get people to donate food and diapers to  meet the most basic needs of his coworkers and their families. He told  me about a family with a 3-month-old baby. They can't afford baby  formula--baby formula.   This is unacceptable.   Holding Federal workers hostage and shutting down our government is a  failed tactic. The House has sent legislation to reopen the government  to the Senate three times. We have done our job. The Senate needs to do  its.                            ____________________
