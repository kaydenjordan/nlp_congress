 Mr. Speaker, I rise today at an unprecedented time.   First, I want to thank those frontline and essential workers, those  who are working each and every day on the retail lines, certainly those  who are working to keep our lights on.   But this HEROES Act will provide New Jersey the much-needed help it  deserves and needs, second in the Nation. Almost 10,000 people have  been impacted in a way that they will never forget.   But we know for workers this will take care of OSHA so they have a  safe workplace; for families so they have food and SNAP benefits  increase; for small businesses, emergency grants.   But most importantly, we, together, as a country, will get past this  if we work together.
