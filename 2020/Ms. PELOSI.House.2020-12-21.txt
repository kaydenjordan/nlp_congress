 Madam Speaker, I associate myself with your comments and  those of our Chaplain, Father Conroy, that it is appropriate to start  today with a prayer, and every day, but especially a day when we are  seeing over 300,000--and the number getting higher--Americans who are  dying from the coronavirus.   We have hope because there is a vaccine. We have hope because we have  a President who recognizes science and, again, the need for us to  distribute the vaccine in the most equitable, fair, and free way. By  that President, I mean one who will take office 1 month from now, Joe  Biden.   I do want to speak to the bill that will be on the floor shortly. It  is a good, bipartisan bill. As different from bills that had been  proposed on the Senate side by the Republican leader, it does things  that his bill never did, and that is that it addresses the food needs  of the American people. Maybe 15 million children are food insecure in  our country, and adults as well.   Millions of families are on the verge of eviction, and this  legislation addresses the rental needs and the short-term moratorium.  We can accept a short-term because we will have a new President during  the length of that moratorium to extend it further if necessary.   We also have in the legislation direct payments, which were not in  the Republican bill, to America's working families. I would like them  to have been bigger, but they are significant, and they will be going  out soon.   The President may insist on having his name on the check, but make no  mistake, those checks are from the American people. The American  people's name should be on that check, no individual, because that is  the source of the resources for those checks--taxpaying Americans.   In addition to that, the list goes on of some of the very positive  things that are on the bill--quite frankly, some of them did not come  to agreement until yesterday--whether we are talking about WRDA, the  Water Resources Development Act; a big jobs bill had bipartisan support  but some disagreement over language, but by the time  [[Page H7288]]  that was resolved, it pushed the bill from coming to the floor later.   We didn't have, at the start of the day, sick leave. That is in the  bill, almost $2 billion for sick leave.   It didn't have the EITC, the earned income tax credit, for working  poor people to have that boost, as well as the child tax credit. It did  not have the employment retention tax credit--bipartisan support on  WRDA and on that.   Then we came to agreement not only on the language, but where that  initiative would be placed in that. So many of these things need to be  precisely written and assembled in order for a bill to come to the  floor, which we anticipate will be pretty soon this morning.   One of the things, though, that is disappointing because, for a long  time now, House Democrats and the Senate have been saying we want to  crush the virus and put money in the pockets of the American people.  The title of our bill before was about honoring our heroes, our State  and local workers who are on the front line.   We talk about those on the front lines who are our heroes. They are  necessary in meeting and crushing this virus. We are talking about  healthcare workers in cities, counties, and States. We are talking  about first responders, police and fire, some who are the first on the  scene to help someone with the coronavirus.   We are talking about our teachers, our teachers, our teachers, who  are the custodians of our children for a large part of the day. We are  talking about our transportation, sanitation, and food workers and  those who make our lives possible.   I think it would be interesting to point out that, as enthusiastic as  we are about the PPP provisions in this bill, and we all support them  in a bipartisan way, it is important to note that small businesses--I  always say there is nothing more optimistic than starting a small  business, maybe getting married--but the optimism, the hope, and the  dream that people have is completely, shall we say, darkened by the  assault of this virus, and that is why we had to start by crushing the  virus.   We couldn't pass legislation until now because the administration  simply did not believe in testing, tracing, treatment, wearing masks,  sanitation, separation, and the rest--the scientific approach. It has  become clear to us now that they believed in herd immunity, a quackery  springing right from the Oval Office and not denied sufficiently by  some in the CDC and the rest.   Now we have a vaccine, and that gives us hope, a vaccine that springs  from science.   People say around here sometimes: I am faith oriented, so I don't  believe in science.   I say: Well, you can do both. Science is an answer to our prayers,  and our prayers have been answered with a vaccine.   In this legislation, we have a provision for it to be developed,  purchased, and distributed in a way, again, that is fair, equitable,  and free.   What we couldn't get ever--even with the previous legislation just on  top, testing, et cetera--was the adequate language to recognize that  this coronavirus has taken a horrible toll on our whole country, more  so among people of color. People of color have died from the  coronavirus.   A child who was Hispanic had eight times more of a chance of going to  the hospital with the coronavirus than a White child. If you are  African American, there is five times more of a chance of going to the  hospital because of the coronavirus. So now we have a vaccine we hope  will reach everyone as soon as possible.   One item that I am heartbroken about in this bill, though, is that,  while we make an attempt to crush the virus, we don't do it adequately  enough in terms of recognizing the toll on people of color; but we will  have to do that in the public sentiment of it, in the demand that we  make on Governors and others who are in charge of the distribution.   We put money in the pockets of the American people. We want to do  more, but, nonetheless, we are meeting the deadline of December 26 for  unemployment insurance, which was vital.   But the third thing, honoring our heroes, as I said earlier,  healthcare workers, our first responders, police and fire, sanitation,  transportation, food workers, teachers, teachers, teachers, we just  decided that, while they are on the front line, while they are risking  their lives to save lives--many of the healthcare workers, the police  and fire, et cetera, many of them have lost their jobs. Many of them  have already lost their lives. Many have lost their jobs.   So why is it that this Congress and this White House refuses to  recognize the value, the contribution, and the sacrifice of our, again,  heroes, our people on the front line?   It is interesting, I think, to note that, when we passed a number of  bills in a bipartisan way--and we will pass this one today--in the  course of that, with the CARES Act and the followup on the PPP bill and  this bill now, we are approaching $1 trillion that we are putting out  for PPP.                                time  0915    If that is what is needed and is spent effectively, that is a worthy  expenditure. Almost $1 trillion--well over $750,000. This bill alone,  over $300 billion. So we have PPP.   Now, in order for the private sector to function, in order for us to  live our lives, we need to have the public sector: public  transportation, public schools, public health, the list goes on.   So it is not about public/private. It is about people, people who are  doing their jobs, again, risking their lives to save lives and lose  their life and may lose their jobs. Many have lost their lives. Many  more, of course, have lost their jobs.   Madam Speaker, we have approaching $1 trillion for the PPP; small  business, which I support all the way; and $150 billion or $160 billion  for State and local government, which enables the private sector to  function, which enables us to crush the virus, which enables us to meet  the needs of people.   Madam Speaker, $150 billion to $160 billion versus well over $800  billion already. How could that be right? Except the Republicans insist  on saying: We don't want to give money to blue States where the  coronavirus is.   It is in red States, too. It knows no borders and it knows no party,  this vicious virus. But somehow, other Republicans have said to our  heroes, our healthcare workers, our teachers, our transportation, our  police and fire, and the rest--sanitation workers, so important; food,  food, food--you are not worthy of support because perhaps you are in a  blue State, predominantly, and, therefore, we undervalue your  contribution to our society, to our economy, and especially now, as we  try to minister to the needs of people in this coronavirus crisis.   How do you think these vaccines come into a State? They go from a lab  to your arm magically? No. They have to be received, distributed,  administered, and done so fairly, equitably, and free.   Who do you think is going to do those jobs if you don't respect the  role of State and local government in all of this? But don't think of  it as government. Think of it as people. Think of it as yourself  needing all of that.   So I would hope that, as we see the need for what we have done in  this nearly $900 billion legislation that we will vote on today, that  everyone understands it is a first step. It is the first step, as  President-elect Biden has said. It is the first step. And we will need  to do more to get more virus assistance to crush the virus, but also  more money to buy more vaccines.   We need to have the Defense Production Act in play to hasten the  manufacture of these vaccines, and we need to be able, as I said, to  get the job done, and that takes people.   People need to be respected. Their worth needs to be valued, and the  entities under whose auspices they work, public hospitals, all the  rest, and education, so important.   And yet, many of our teachers have lost their jobs. We need more  teachers because we need more space to separate, to, again, protect our  children.   We have always said, if we want the economy to open up and we want  our schools to open up, you must crush the virus, at least take the  precautions so that people are not in jeopardy if they go to work or  when they go to school.   Schools should be the safest places in America for our children, and  they can be if science is respected and the mask-wearing, distancing,  and the rest. But you need more space; you need better  [[Page H7289]]  ventilation, as  Bobby Scott tells us over and over; and we need more  teachers.   This is a big mistake. The Republicans said you can get a small  amount, not even approaching in any way, the PPP--again, no resentment  there; we support that. But the recognition that that is important  should also recognize that the sector of our economy that supports the  private sector be recognized.   So, on that score, you come to a situation where, how could it be  that we only have $160 billion for State and local, where we have  approaching $1 trillion dollars for PPP, not recognizing that the  private sector is connected to the public sector?   Now, one more point on that.   They said: You can have some money for State and local--we will  decide how it will be distributed--if you do surrender the rights of  workers.   In other words, just in case anybody doesn't know, there are  essential workers who are required to go to work. If they don't because  they are concerned about danger to their health and the health of their  families because the workplace is not safe, they cannot go on  unemployment insurance. And if they go to work and contract the virus,  they have no recourse, because that is the way the Republicans want it.   That is the way the Republicans want it: antiworker.   Madam Speaker, just for good measure, they have thrown in certain  aspects of the Civil Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act,  the Fair Labor Standards Act, OSHA--the list goes on--in section 42 of  their heinous liability bill of all of the actions that cannot be  taken.   And I asked one of the Republican Senators: What does preventing the  ADA, American with Disabilities Act, to honor its responsibility?   They said: Why not have the Chamber of Commerce call you and tell  you.   I said: Why don't you not waste my time or the Chambers' time about  why the ADA should not be enforced because of the virus?   This is coronavirus-centric. We said that we can find a compromise on  liability for the time of the virus and in a way that is fair to those  employers who want to protect their workers and to the workers. They  decided they would turn it into some massive, long-term, ever- encompassing liability--just so wrong to work with. That is not what  our system is about.   But, nonetheless, I still thought we could try to find a compromise.  We couldn't. They were absolute: Just call the Chamber of Commerce.  They will tell you why they can't meet the needs of their workers.    Madam Speaker, heading back to the money, nearly $1 trillion PPP.   $160 billion--and not even giving the States and localities the  flexibility to use the funds for both addressing the COVID needs, the  health needs, but also the revenue lost. Even the Republican Governors  wanted that flexibility, but they wouldn't give it to us then, and they  wouldn't give it to us now for fear that some blue State Governor or  city or mayor or county executive might take advantage of that.   We have never done enough for localities. That is a pitch we have  made. That is what we have in the Heroes Act. But there was no market  for that on the Republican side of the aisle.   So when we say it is a first step, that is basic. Let us thank God  Chuck Schumer was able to dismantle, in part, the Toomey resolution  that would tie the hands of a President to meet the needs of the  American people and our economy by exercising section 13(3) of the  Federal Reserve Board.   Madam Speaker, we got past that, which took a long time. I felt  Wednesday night we were finished. This monstrosity reared his head the  next morning. Leader Schumer effectively was able to fix it--it still  should not even have been initiated, but, nonetheless, fix it--in a way  that enabled us to go forward. And that is why it has taken this long  to get here in these last few days.   Madam Speaker, again, I look forward to Nita Lowey bringing the  legislation to the floor. As the chair of the Committee on  Appropriations, this will be her last bill on the floor. In fact, it is  the last bill for many of us here, but hers as chair of the Committee  on Appropriations. She and her staff--Shalanda and Chris and so many  others--and all of our chairs did such a remarkable job, and their  staffs deserve so much credit for all of this.   Again, we will do some good with this legislation, but we must  recognize that more needs to be done to crush the virus, to put more  money in the pockets of the American people--from the American people  to the American people--and, again, to fill in the gap that has been  purposefully left to honor our heroes with all that.   As we review policy and legislation and negotiation and all that,  just always have in our hearts every single one of the people who have  died from the coronavirus. It can be stopped. It can be crushed. But  that is a decision, it is a decision, and a decision to recognize where  it is hurting people the most.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to a strong bipartisan vote today on  this legislation, respecting it for what it does, not judging it for  what it does not, but recognizing that more needs to be done.   Again, with high praise for all of our chairs, and, again, special  recognition of Madam Chair Nita Lowey for her last bill on the floor,  again, I say congratulations to all the staff who worked so hard.   But it all comes back to families who lost their loved ones, those  millions and millions of people who were infected, some more seriously  than others. We don't know the after-effects it may have, but we do  know that we have hope.   We have a vaccine, and we have a President coming into office who  believes in science and cares about people and values the work that our  first responders and our healthcare workers, et cetera, do for us.   Madam Chair, prayerfully, as you and our chaplain began, prayerfully,  I close my remarks, assuring, for whatever it is worth, that many of us  who serve in this body and represent the American people have had a  death in the family, because so many people have lost their loved ones,  whom we have all lost.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for bringing this  important legislation to the floor. I thank her and Ranking Member Kay  Granger for bringing this in a very strong bipartisan way.   I spoke this morning at some length, so it is on the record as to my  attitude here. I salute the legislation that is here and urge passage,  but I do want to take a minute to thank the Madam Chair.   She has served in the Congress for a long time. We have sat side by  side over the years with Rosa DeLauro, Steny Hoyer, and Mr. Clyburn as  appropriators. I have seen her writings-based astute political  knowledge, her strategic thinking, her encyclopedic knowledge of the  legislation produce the results, understanding what the process will  bear and what the country needs first and foremost.    So, Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Lowey. I don't know how many more  times we will thank her, but hopefully, when the coronavirus goes away,  we can all join in embracing her great leadership and expressing  gratitude.   Mr. Speaker, I want to just again take a moment in recognition of the  other chairs who worked to make this legislation so, so effective with  direct payments through the employee retention tax credit, the  unemployment insurance, to name a few.   Congresswoman Velazquez with Small Business, under her leadership and  working in a bipartisan way, small businesses, which are the heart of  our economy, have received almost $1 trillion in these coronavirus  bills, almost $1 trillion. We support that, but I also would hope there  would be some commensurate recognition of the jobs of small business,  the jobs of State and local government. They have received only $160  billion in all of these bills, $160 billion.   Does that sound familiar? That is exactly the amount of money that  the Republicans put in the CARES bill to give to the wealthiest in our  country, yet for all the States and localities, and it was retroactive,  having nothing to do with coronavirus, $160 billion. They thought that  was commensurate with the responsibilities of our healthcare workers,  our State and local police and fire, first responders, transportation,  sanitation, food workers, our teachers, our teachers, our teachers.   So, yes, there is more work to do, and it will cost some money, but  it will protect jobs. Most importantly, it will meet the needs of the  American people to crush the virus and to do so in a way that brings us  all into the future in a very safe way.   I thank Congresswoman Velazquez for her extraordinary leadership in  that regard.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Maxine Waters for coming to the need of people,  renters, landlords, et cetera, with her important legislation--of  course, we want more, but for now, this will see us through--her  Community Development Financial Institutions legislation, her MDIs,  making all that available in the small business piece, available to so  many more people.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Scott from Virginia. Student loans,  childcare, I thank him for making it right.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Pallone for his leadership again and again.  Vaccines, the vaccine issue is so important, how it is delivered, how  it is produced, distributed. Going from vaccine to vaccination, from  lab to arm, so much is required, and much of it is in this bill.  Testing and tracing are still needed. We still need to provide a relief  fund that goes along with that. I thank him for the personal interest  he took in broadband.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. DeFazio on transportation and WRDA.  Yesterday morning, we didn't even have WRDA in the bill. That is why  this all has taken longer to do. So, I thank him for the important role  that he played. We all know about the airlines and the rest, but there  is so much more.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Peterson for his work on nutrition. People  are hungry in our country, and we had to fight for nutrition money, but  I thank him for his persistence.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. McGovern for his advocacy in the Congress  for children and hunger, as well as Rosa DeLauro. But Mr. McGovern has  gone on hunger strikes and the rest. He really values what is in this  bill on nutrition to feed the hungry in our country.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Maloney for saving our Postal Service.   Just a brief reference to say thank you. This has been a long,  difficult negotiation. These chairs, their members of the committees,  and their staffs have been invaluable. Shalanda and Chris, I thank them  so much for making all this happen.   Mr. Speaker, I reference the statement I made this morning about one  thing and another, about the attitude we have to this and the need for  us to recognize this as a first step and the need for us to address the  important contribution of our health workers, police and fire first  responders, sanitation, transportation, food workers, our teachers, our  teachers, our teachers.   If we are going to safely reenter the economy and our schools, we  must crush the virus.   I have hope to crush the virus. That is why we could support this  bill. It doesn't go all the way, but it takes us down the path, a first  step.   I have hope of crushing the virus, and I have hope because of the  election of Joe Biden as President of the United States, a President  who will follow science. He will follow science, and he will recognize  that we have to meet the needs of all the American people wherever they  live in our country, especially addressing Barbara Lee's concerns about  the communities of color that have been underserved in so much of what  we have done.   Mr. Speaker, I have great appreciation for Madam Chair Nita Lowey.
