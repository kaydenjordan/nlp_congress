 I am going to be very, very short.   The truth is that serving with Doug Jones has been a once-in-a- lifetime opportunity for me. This guy's last name shouldn't be Jones;  it should be ``Justice.'' He is somebody like nobody I  [[Page S7306]]  have ever seen, whose moral compass is so tuned into right that it has  just been an incredible pleasure for me to be able to serve with him  and to know him and to also wish him the best moving forward.   I don't think we have heard the last of Doug Jones. Doug is not the  kind of person who will shrink away. There will be another moment where  he can exhibit his ability of common sense, as he has done here in the  U.S. Senate for the last 3 years.   I am deeply going to miss his friendship and his ability to sort the  wheat from the chaff because he has been able to do that from day one  and continued today with his farewell speech.   I just want to say, God bless you, Doug Jones, and God bless your  family.   I yield the floor.
