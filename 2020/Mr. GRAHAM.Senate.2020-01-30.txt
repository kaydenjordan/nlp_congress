 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from South Carolina.    I send a question to the desk on behalf of myself,  Senators Cruz and Cornyn, for both parties.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senators Graham, Cornyn, and Cruz is for both  parties:         When DOJ Inspector General Horowitz testified before the       Judiciary Committee, he said their DOJ had a ``low       threshold'' to investigate the Trump campaign. At the       hearing, Sen. Feinstein said, ``your report concluded that       the FBI had an adequate predicate, reason, to open the       investigation on the Trump campaign ties to Russia. Could you       define the predicate?'' Horowitz replied, ``yeah, so the       predicate here was the information that the FBI got at the       end of July from the friendly foreign government.'' Why is       the legal standard for investigating Trump so much lower than       the standard for investigating Biden? And why was it ok to       get the information from a ``friendly foreign government?''    The House managers are first.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The inspector general's report found that the  investigation was properly predicated. That was the bottom-line  conclusion that this was not a politically motivated investigation.   The inspector general also found, though, there were serious flaws  with the FISA Court process. There were serious flaws on how the FISA  applications were written in the information that was used and  prescribed a whole series of remedies, which the FBI Director has now  said should be implemented. But they found it was properly predicated.  They found they did not have to ignore the evidence that had come to  their attention that the campaign for the President was having illicit  contacts, potentially; that it may be colluding or conspiring with a  foreign power. Indeed, it would have been derelict for them to ignore  it.   But the argument--the implicit argument here is, because there were  problems, albeit serious problems, on the FISA Court application  involving a single person, that somehow we should ignore the  President's conduct here; that somehow that justifies the President's  embrace of the Russian propaganda; that somehow that justifies the  President's distrust of the entire intelligence community; that somehow  that justifies his ignoring what his own Director of the FBI said,  which his lawyers ignore today, which is there is no evidence that  Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election. Because of a single FISA  application against a single person and the flaws in it, you should  ignore the evidence of the President's wrongdoing. Turn away from that.  Let's not look at whether the President conditioned military aid and a  White House meeting on help with an investigation. Let's look at flaws  in how the FBI conducted a FISA application. The one does not follow  from the other.   The reality is that what you must judge here is: Did the President  commit the conduct he is charged with?  [[Page S716]]  Did the President withhold military aid and a coveted meeting to secure  foreign interference in the election? And if he did, as we believe we  have shown, does that warrant his removal from office? That is the  issue before you, whether the FBI made one mistake or five mistakes  with the FISA application.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, let me  actually answer the question.   The inspector general said, in a response actually from Senator  Graham, when James Comey said he was vindicated by the inspector  general's report, the inspector general said: No one who touched this  was vindicated.   With regard to the FISA--you make so light, Manager Schiff, of what  the FBI did. It wasn't a FISA warrant. There was an order unsealed just  days ago saying the process was so tainted by the Federal Bureau of  Investigation--so tainted--that not only was the NSD misled, but so was  the FISA Court.   For those that don't know that are watching, the FISA Court--you  can't blame the court on this, by the way. You have to blame the  Federal Bureau of Investigations for allowing this to happen. That is  the court that issues warrants on people that are alleged to be spies.  There are no lawyers in those proceedings. There is no cross- examination. The court itself in its order said: We rely on the good  faith of the officers presenting the affidavits.   Are there two standards for investigations? That is an  understatement. But to belittle what took place in the FISA  proceedings--frankly, Manager Schiff, you know better than that.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Illinois.    Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on  behalf of myself and Senators Alexander, Cruz, Portman, Toomey,  Sullivan, and Murkowski to the counsel for the President.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Graham and the other Senators is for the  counsel for the President:         Assuming for argument's sake that Bolton were to testify in       the light most favorable to the allegations contained in the       Articles of Impeachment, isn't it true that the allegations       still would not rise to the level of an impeachable offense       and that, therefore, for this and other reasons, his       testimony would add nothing to this case?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for the  question.   Let me start by just making very clear that there was no quid pro  quo. There was no--and there is no evidence to show that. There was not  that sort of linkage that the House managers have suggested.   But let me answer the question directly, which I understand to be  assuming for the sake of argument that Ambassador Bolton would come and  testify the way the New York Times article alleges, the way his book  describes the conversation. Then it is correct that, even if that  happened, even if he gave that testimony, the Articles of Impeachment  still wouldn't rise to an impeachable offense. That is for at least two  reasons. Let me explain that.   The first is, on their face, the Articles of Impeachment, as they  have been laid out by the House managers, even if you take everything  that is alleged in them, they don't, as a matter of law, rise to the  level of an impeachable offense because even the House managers haven't  characterized them as involving a crime. So that is one level of the  answer, that an impeachable offense would require a crime.    Even going beyond that, a second level, the theory of abuse of power  that they have alleged--put aside whether or not it is a crime, the  thory of abuse of power that they have asserted is not something that  conforms with the constitutional standard of high crimes and  misdemeanors. It depends entirely on subjective intent, and it is  subjective intent alone.   As Professor Dershowitz explained, and as I have explained--and I  don't mean in the more radical portion of his explanation of his  theory, I mean just in terms of what is high crimes and misdemeanors.  He explained that something that is based entirely on subjective intent  is equivalent to maladministration. It is equivalent to exactly the  standard that the Framers rejected because it is completely malleable.  It doesn't define any real standard for an offense. It allows you to  take any conduct that on its face is perfectly permissible, and on the  basis of your projection of a disagreement with that conduct, a  disagreement with the reasons for it to attribute a bad motive, to try  to say there is a bad subjective motive for doing that and will make it  impeachable, that doesn't conform to the constitutional standard.   At the common law, they would call the reaction to a charge like this  a demurrer. You demur and simply say, even if everything you say is  true, that is not an impeachable offense under the law. And that is an  appropriate response here. Even if everything you allege is true, even  if John Bolton would say it is true, that is not an impeachable offense  under the constitutional standard because the way you have tried to  define the constitutional standard, this theory of abuse of power is  far too malleable. It goes purely to subjective intent. It can't be  relied upon.   The third level of my answer is this. We have demonstrated that there  is a legitimate public policy interest in both of the matters that were  raised on that telephone call: the 2016 election interference and the  Biden Burisma affair. Because there is a legitimate public policy  interest in both of those issues, even if it were true that there was  some connection, even if it were true that the President had suggested  or thought that, well, maybe I should hold up this aid until they do  something, that is perfectly permissible where there is that legitimate  public policy interest.   It is just the same as if there is an investigation going on. The  President wants a foreign country to provide some assistance. It is a  legitimate foreign policy interest to get that assistance. It is  legitimate to use the levers of foreign policy to secure that  assistance. So because there is a legitimate public policy interest in  both of those issues--and I think we have demonstrated that clearly--it  would be permissible for there to be that linkage.   But again, I will close where I began, which is there was no such  linkage here. I just want to make that clear. But taking for the sake  of argument the question as phrased, even if Ambassador Bolton would  testify to that,  [[Page S736]]  even if you assumed it were true, there is no impeachable offense  stated in the Articles of Impeachment.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The Senator from Illinois.
