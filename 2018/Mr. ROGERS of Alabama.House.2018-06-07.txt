 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Simpson and  Ranking Member Kaptur and all their subcommittee colleagues for, again,  putting together a strong Energy and Water appropriations bill this  year.   As the chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, I know how  crucial that bill is to our national defense.   The Atomic Energy Defense activities funded by this bill and  authorized by the NDAA are critical to our nuclear deterrent, and that  nuclear deterrent is not just the warheads and missiles over in DOD; it  is also the people, capabilities, and infrastructure in DOE. Together,  they comprise our nuclear deterrent.   My amendment would align a key aspect of this appropriations bill  related to DOE's nuclear weapons infrastructure with the fiscal year  2019 NDAA that the House passed 2 weeks ago by a bipartisan vote of  351-66.   My amendment provides $24 million in funding to the Material Staging  Facility project, which will enable huge security improvements,  operational efficiencies, and billions in long-term cost savings at the  Pantex plant in Texas.   This project was initiated in the fiscal year 2018 NDAA and fiscal  year 2018 omnibus appropriations bill, because Congress recognized its  importance.   My amendment would ensure that this project stays on track and align  with its fiscal year 2019 appropriation and with the fiscal year 2019  NDAA authorization.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting what they  have already supported in the NDAA and vote ``yes'' on my amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.
