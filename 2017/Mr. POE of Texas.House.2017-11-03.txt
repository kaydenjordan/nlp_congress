 Madam Speaker, Uzbekistan uber terrorist Saipov's  attack in New York City is another example why the United States should  end the diversity visa lottery. And I emphasize the word ``lottery.''   The program should have ended years ago. Under this 1990 program, the  State Department gives 50,000 visas each year to immigrants from  different parts of the world using a lottery system. Getting into the  United States is like playing bingo. It is a game of chance.   Our immigration system should be changed to accept the best and  brightest throughout the world. It is time to go to a merit-based visa  system. Grant visas to people who will benefit America. Stop the random  system that allowed Saipov to come in; a system that rolls the dice  where foreigners win and Americans lose.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
