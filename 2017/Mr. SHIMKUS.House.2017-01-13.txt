 Mr. Speaker, I am on the Energy and Commerce Committee  the healthcare bill came through. We can debate how many hearings, how  many questions, and all of that. The public has rendered judgment on  this healthcare law.   In 2010, Republicans took back control of the House over two issues:  ObamaCare and cap-and-trade. And then our base was saying to repeal  ObamaCare, all the way back to 2010.   In 2014, the Republicans took over the Senate. Our base is saying:  You have got the House. You have got the Senate. Repeal ObamaCare. It  is harmful. It is destructive--and I will tell you why in a minute.   So why should anybody not expect us, in 2016, when the public has  rendered judgment again in a national election that we have to repeal  ObamaCare?   So when I talk to my constituents and people talk to me, this is  going to happen, and we know there is going to be a replacement.   There are two different ideologies of how to provide care. We believe  in markets; you believe in centralized control. We believe in people  choosing the best plan for them in the private markets; and those who  need help and assistance to get in those markets, we are going to help  them get in those markets. But to have our Federal Government say that  you only have one of four choices--my constituents pay for health care  that they can't use because they can't pay the deductibles, so they are  forced to buy something that they can't use.   So this is timely. I am glad we are moving expeditiously, and we look  forward to the year ahead.
