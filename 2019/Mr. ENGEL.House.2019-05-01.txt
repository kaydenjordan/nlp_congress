 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 9.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 9, the Climate Action  Now Act.   I shouldn't need to persuade anyone in this Chamber that we  desperately need to take serious action on climate change. Just look at  the news. We are already seeing the consequences of our inaction:  natural disasters, famines, instability, human suffering.   The time for action to avoid the worst effects of climate change is  rapidly closing. We must demonstrate to the rest of the world and to  future generations that we are still committed to taking on this fight.   Climate change is a national security threat that transcends borders  and requires international coordination. That is why it is so critical  that we work shoulder to shoulder with our friends and partners around  the world.   The negotiation of the Paris Agreement was a defining moment for the  future of our planet. For the first time, the countries of the world  came together to face this global crisis.   At challenging times like these, the international community usually  looks to the United States for leadership. So when President Trump  announced his intention to withdraw from this landmark agreement, it  sent an unmistakable message that America is on the retreat. It is  really just shameful.   Every nation in the world has now signed on to the Paris Agreement.  If we withdraw, we will be the only country unwilling to step up to  this challenge.   We can--we must--do better.   The Climate Action Now Act keeps the United States in the Paris  climate accord, renewing our country's pledge to address climate change  head-on.   The Paris Agreement allows every country to determine its own  pollution reduction targets and to develop a public plan for how to  meet those targets. This bill follows that same model. It gives the  executive branch total flexibility to decide what approach we need to  follow and what kind of technology we need to use to reach our national  targets.   H.R. 9 gives us all an opportunity to show Americans that we hear  them, that we take their concerns seriously, and that we are addressing  this danger that is hurting their health and safety.   Mr. Chair, it is time for Congress to put our country back on the  right path to address the climate change crisis facing the world. I  strongly support passage of H.R. 9, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, my friend on the other side of the aisle just said that  all four witnesses at our April 2 hearing in the Foreign Affairs  Committee expressed agreement that President Obama should have  submitted the Paris accord to the Senate for ratification. I was there  and chaired the hearing. I didn't hear that.   Let me tell you that, first of all, we were proud to welcome a  distinguished panel of national security leaders, including former  military officials. They offered detailed descriptions of the risks  that climate change poses to our national security.   They talked about how climate change acts as a threat multiplier and  a source of international conflict, how it makes individuals more  vulnerable to recruitment by violent extremist organizations, how it is  increasing great power competition and tensions in places like the  Arctic, and how it is the driver of extreme weather and natural  disasters that require dangerous and expensive military responses.   More to my point, there was a fleeting question about whether any  witness disagreed with the statement that President Obama should have  submitted the Paris Agreement to the Senate for ratification. The only  response, I believe, came from one retired admiral, who simply said,  ``military, not political,'' meaning he is not the right guy to ask,  nor were any of the other witnesses, so they all sat in silence.   As my colleague should know, silence is not an assent, whether it is  at a congressional hearing or at a deposition or even in the exit row  of an overcrowded commercial airplane. A person must give a verbal  ``yes'' or ``no'' for their answer to be accepted and relied upon.   So I just want to clear the record, because what really happened is  one of my colleagues posed a question to the wrong person and got no  answer.   So when it comes to arguing that the Paris Agreement needed to be  submitted to the Senate for ratification, my colleagues are incorrect  as a matter of international law and incorrect as a matter of U.S. law.  The previous President had the authority to enter into the Paris  Agreement, derived from the Constitution, the Senate-approved United  Nations Framework on Climate Change, and domestic law.   We all know that the vast majority of international agreements  entered into by the U.S. are not approved by the Senate, and the Paris  Agreement is no different.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Castor), the author of this bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin), a valued member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I want to remind my colleagues that the United States was  once a global leader in pushing for climate action, but the current  administration has largely abandoned our efforts to mitigate the  effects of a warming world. As a result, our progress in reducing  pollution has dwindled and is now reversing itself.   The Environmental Protection Agency's latest data shows that  reductions in greenhouse gas pollution fell to just half a percent in  2017, and, according to the International Energy Agency, U.S. carbon  dioxide pollution actually rose by 3.1 percent in 2018.   Think about that for a minute. At a time when the world desperately  needs to decrease emissions, ours increased. In a year, where more  dirty coal plants closed than almost any other year in history, our  emissions increased. So this bill is absolutely important.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms.  Spanberger), a valued member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Chairman, let me say, the whole world--not just the  United States and not just China--needs to do more if we are to be  spared from the worst damage of climate change.   Under Paris, China committed to leveling off its carbon emissions no  later than 2030 and reducing its carbon intensity by 60 to 65 percent  from 2005 levels by 2030. And that is a big step towards  sustainability.   Meanwhile, global action on climate change has already spared public  and  [[Page H3367]]  private-sector investments and green innovation. China has created the  world's largest carbon market, pumped approximately three times as much  money into renewables as we have, and surpassed the United States in  terms of both the number of electric vehicles on the road and the  number of publicly available charging stations.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), the distinguished chairwoman.    Mr. Chairman, there is a lot of misinformation out there  about the Paris Agreement, including the idea that it will hurt the  U.S. economy. The Paris Agreement will cost little or nothing, and  allowing climate change to proceed would certainly be very expensive  indeed.   A raft of studies from environmental organizations, Citibank, and the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development all argue that a  failure to mitigate the effects of climate change could cost the U.S.  economy trillions of dollars. Citi found that investing in low-carbon  energy to address climate change would save the world $1.8 trillion  through 2040, but not acting will cost an additional $44 trillion by  2060.   Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time each side has  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).    Mr. Chair, it is now my pleasure to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Crist).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   When President Trump announced plans to withdraw the U.S. from the  Paris climate agreement in 2017, hundreds of businesses from all over  the country immediately responded that it was a mistake and that they  would redouble their own efforts to cut emissions.   In a separate declaration a few days later, a group called We Are  Still In said that, despite Trump, they continue to support climate  action. They argued that compliance with the Paris Agreement would open  markets and generate jobs.   Today, We Are Still In is comprised of over 3,500 leaders, including  Governors, mayors, universities, and over 1,800 companies working  together to uphold America's promise to meet the goals of the Paris  Agreement.   Included in the coalition are some of the country's most successful  companies, and I think you will recognize the names: Adobe, Amazon,  Apple, Belkin, Ben & Jerry's, Campbell's, Chobani, Citi, DuPont, eBay,  Gap, Google, The Hartford, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, Johnson & Johnson,  Levi Strauss, Lyft, Mars, McDonald's, MGM Resorts International,  Microsoft, and I can go on and on.   The Paris Agreement will not on its own solve our global warming  problems, but it does present business and investors with a historic  opportunity by signaling a new global consensus that the transition to  a clean energy economy is underway.   The argument that the Paris Agreement is somehow antibusiness or will  hurt our economy just doesn't hold water. So I encourage my friends on  the other side of the aisle to listen to American businesses and treat  climate change as both the threat and opportunity that it is.   Mr. Chair, it is my pleasure to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), our majority leader.   (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Matsui).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, in closing, let me say that I am very glad that the  Foreign Affairs Committee has jurisdiction over this bill.   I would also like to note for the Congressional Record that we have  three additional Members who intended to cosponsor H.R. 9,  Congresswoman Kaptur, Congresswoman Gabbard, and Congresswoman  Underwood.   Let me also say that I include in the Record 9 letters in support of  H.R. 9. Specifically, I have letters from a group of four dozen  environmental organizations led by Oxfam; the Sierra Club; the Union of  Concerned Scientists and others; the League of Conservation Voters; The  Wilderness Society; EDF Action, which is an advocacy partner of the  Environmental Defense Fund; BlueGreen Alliance, which is a coalition of  the Nation's largest labor unions and environmental groups; the United  Steelworkers; E2, which is a nonpartisan group of environmental  entrepreneurs from across the country; Ceres and its BICEP Network,  which is the Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy; the We  Are Still In coalition, which is made up of over 3,750 U.S. businesses,  cities, States, Tribes, colleges, universities, investors, faith  groups, cultural institutions, and healthcare organizations; the NAACP;  leading public health and medical organizations, including the American  Lung Association, the American Public Health Association, and the  Allergy & Asthma Network; and the American College of Physicians.                                                     April 29, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members       and supporters across the country, we urge you to support       H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act, to ensure the U.S. meets       its commitments under the Paris Agreement and to reinforce       our national resolve to address climate change.        The Paris Agreement is a global response to the greatest       environmental challenge of our time. It includes, for the       first time, specific commitments from all major countries and       a pathway for each country to strengthen its own domestic       climate actions in the years ahead. United States leadership       and  [[Page H3371]]       participation was crucial in bringing the world together to       act. But now, by threatening to exit the agreement, the Trump       administration risks isolating itself, undermining global       climate action, and weakening America's international       influence on a broad array of critical foreign policy issues.        Americans are experiencing climate change here and now in a       rising tide of extreme weather disasters, from hurricanes in       the southeast, to wildfires in the west, to flooding right       now in the country's heartland. It's no surprise that polls       consistently show that concern over the climate crisis is       rising across generational, geographic, and partisan lines.        Americans' personal experience is underscored by a raft of       new scientific reports. Last fall the Intergovernmental Panel       on Climate Change (IPCC) confirmed that climate change is       already happening, and ambitious action to curb carbon       pollution is needed starting now to stave off steadily       worsening impacts in the U.S. and across the globe. The last       four years have been the hottest on record since global       measurements began in 1880, according to the National Oceanic       and Atmospheric Administration and the National Aeronautics       and Space Administration. And the National Climate       Assessment--prepared by 13 federal agencies and released by       the Trump Administration last year--lays out the stark       reality of current climate impacts in all regions of the       nation and projects how much worse they could get.        Without significant global action, the National Climate       Assessment concludes: ``rising temperatures, sea level rise,       and changes in extreme events are expected to increasingly       disrupt and damage critical infrastructure and property,       labor productivity, and the vitality of our communities.''       ``[C]oastal economies and property are already at risk,''       especially communities disproportionately comprised of low-      income and minority Americans. In short, climate change is       already here in America and it's already harming Americans'       lives.        Despite these dire forecasts, we can still stave off the       worst effects of climate change. Congressional leadership is       more important than ever, and the Climate Action Now Act will       go a long way to ensure that the United States fulfills our       commitments under the Paris Agreement and stays on the path       to serious action on climate change.        This legislation demonstrates leadership and vision needed       to tackle the climate crisis. We urge you to support the       Climate Action Now Act to help make the future climate safe       for our children and grandchildren and honor America's       commitments to help confront this global challenge.

Re Support H.R. 9, Climate Action Now Act.       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: The League of Conservation Voters       (LCV) works to turn environmental values into national       priorities. Each year, LCV publishes the National       Environmental Scorecard, which details the voting records of       members of Congress on environmental legislation. The       Scorecard is distributed to LCV members, concerned voters       nationwide, and the media.        We write in strong support of H.R. 9, the Climate Action       Now Act. This important legislation honors America's       commitments to the Paris Climate Agreement, recognizes the       urgency of tackling climate change, and lays the groundwork       for further action.        Climate change is already having devastating impacts on       communities across the country and the world. More extreme       storms, record-breaking floods, and raging wildfires are       hurting our families and even taking people's lives. It is       unacceptable that these impacts and the burden of toxic       pollution hit lower income, communities of color, and       Indigenous peoples first and worst. Poll after poll shows       that an overwhelming majority of voters--across ideological       lines--want strong action on clean energy and climate       solutions.        H.R. 9 is a strong rebuke of the Trump Administration's       denial of the climate crisis, efforts to undermine progress,       and ill-conceived decision to become the only country in the       world to reject the landmark Paris Climate Agreement. In       response to this utter failure of leadership, governors,       mayors, universities, businesses, faith leaders, and       investors are stepping up to support climate action to meet       this agreement.        This momentum is only growing. Just this year, six new       governors have joined the U.S. Climate Alliance, bringing the       total to 23 states and territories committed to meeting the       Paris Climate Agreement's goals. New Mexico Governor Lujan       Grisham signed into law legislation that moves the state's       electricity to 100% carbon free by 2045. Governors Walz (MN),       Evers (WI), and Mills (ME) have all announced plans to move       their state to 100% clean energy. After passing both chambers       unanimously, Nevada Governor Sisolak signed into law       legislation moving the state to 50% renewable energy by 2030.       The Washington state legislature just passed a 100% clean       energy bill, the Maryland legislature passed a 50% clean       energy bill by 2030, and a comprehensive 100% clean energy       package has been introduced in Illinois.        After eight years of the Republican leadership in the U.S.       House taking us backwards in the fight against climate       change, we are thrilled to see this important first step in       the right direction and LCV urges you to SUPPORT H.R. 9. We       will strongly consider including votes on this bill in the       2019 Scorecard. If you need more information, please call my       office and ask to speak with a member of our government       relations team.            Sincerely,                                                    Gene Karpinski,      President.                                   ____                                           The Wilderness Society,                                                      April 2, 2019.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Chair, House Committee on Energy & Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Energy & Commerce, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone, Ranking Member Walden, and Members       of the House Committee on Energy & Commerce: On behalf of The       Wilderness Society's over one million members and supporters,       I write in support of H.R. 9, The Climate Action Now Act.       This legislation would take a necessary and welcome step to       reestablish the United States as a global leader and to       tackle climate change at the scale required to avert the       worst impacts of this crisis. The Wilderness Society urges       you to vote for H.R. 9 when it is marked up in committee       later this week.        Climate change represents the greatest threat facing our       public lands and the communities that depend on them, from       America's thawing Arctic to regions devastated by extreme       drought and wildfire. President Trump's decision to withdraw       the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change       was a misguided step back from the kind of leadership the       world expects of America. By deliberately undermining the       global agreement and reversing policies to address U.S.       emissions, President Trump has moved the United States and       the world in the wrong direction at precisely the moment we       need accelerated progress. H.R. 9 represents a much-needed       step to confront the climate crisis by taking steps to       prevent formal withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and       requiring the Administration to develop a plan to meet       national greenhouse gas targets.        The Wilderness Society believes that our 640 million acres       of public lands can and must play a prominent role in       addressing climate change in a comprehensive, sustainable and       equitable way. We have a significant opportunity to reduce       greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel energy development       on public lands, which currently accounts for more than 20%       of all U.S. emissions, and support responsibly-sited       renewable energy projects. We must also protect large,       connected landscapes, including our forests, deserts and       other wild places that can help species adapt, store carbon,       and provide natural infrastructure to safeguard communities       from intensifying storms and extreme weather events. H.R. 9       takes an important first step in establishing a framework       that allows for our public lands to be part of the climate       solution, and no longer a significant contributor to the       United States' carbon footprint.        The Wilderness Society looks forward to seeing passage of       this bill, without amendment, as a first step in solving the       climate crisis, and we welcome the opportunity to work with       Congress to make public lands part of our national solution       to climate change.            Sincerely,      Drew McConville,        Senior Managing Director of Government Relations, The       Wilderness Society.  [[Page H3372]]                                          ____                            [From EDF Action]                     H.R. 9: The Climate Action Now Act         The Climate Action Now Act is a much-needed step toward       reasserting American global leadership in the fight to solve       climate change.        This bill gives Congress the opportunity to take common       sense action against one of our country's most dangerous       threats.        We need immediate action to reduce climate pollution and       move our country toward 100% clean energy across the economy       by 2050.        Taking action on climate change is necessary to:        Protect our health and our kids' future,        Strengthen the U.S. economy through innovation and       investment,        Protect against trillions of dollars in damages,        Allow America to lead the next technological and energy       revolution.                         What is the Paris Agreement?         In 2015 in a historic breakthrough, virtually every country       in the world came together and committed to addressing       climate change by reducing emissions. The announcement, known       as Paris Agreement, allows each country to make its own plan       to fight pollution.        A recommitment to the goals of the Paris Agreement would       show the world that America takes its promise to cut       pollution seriously, encourage other nations to honor their       climate pledges as well, and give America a stronger voice in       ongoing climate negotiations.                       Americans support climate action         The Trump administration has surrendered American       leadership in the fight against climate change, isolating our       country, and ignoring two-thirds of Americans who support       climate action.        Recommitting to the Paris Agreement goals follows the lead       of the over 3,500 elected officials, and tribal, university,       businesses, and faith leaders, representing millions of       Americans, who have pledged to continue to support climate       action.                                   ____                                               BlueGreen Alliance,                                                     April 30, 2019.      Re BlueGreen Alliance Supports H.R. 9, Climate Action Now         Act.       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: As a coalition of the nation's largest       labor unions and environmental groups, collectively       representing millions of members and supporters, we write to       express the BlueGreen Alliance's support for H.R. 9, the       Climate Action Now Act.        The United States' adoption of the Paris Agreement was an       historic step to lead in the fight against global climate       change. The Trump Administration's stated intention to       withdraw from this agreement is a mistake with dire       consequences for the United States and the rest of the world.       The effects of climate change are already being felt in       communities across the country in the form of more frequent       and severe extreme weather events, wildfires, droughts, and       rising sea levels.        Removing the United States from the Agreement would be an       abdication of our nation's responsibility to the world and to       future generations to lead in the fight against climate       change. Our country can and should lead the world in driving       the significant economic growth and job creation that can       result from clean energy technologies and infrastructure       required to reduce climate change-driving pollution. The       Paris Agreement holds all countries accountable for their       emissions, and is a critical tool at our disposal to create a       level playing field for U.S.-based manufacturing in the race       against our global economic competitors to build the clean       technologies of the future.        America is currently meeting the challenge of making our       energy, transportation, and other systems cleaner and more       efficient. We have already begun putting millions of people       to work in jobs designing, manufacturing, and installing the       clean energy technology and infrastructure needed to reduce       the pollution that is driving climate change. At the same       time, we must ensure that the jobs we're building in new       clean technologies are quality, family-sustaining jobs.       Additionally, we must address the challenges of this       transition to ensure that no communities or workers are left       behind by making available the tools and resources for       workers to transition to new, good jobs and for communities       to diversify their local and regional economies and create       new opportunities.        Ultimately, we have everything we need to meet our       commitment made in the Paris Agreement. American innovation       has the potential to lead the world in solving our       environmental problems while creating good jobs for workers.        The Climate Action Now Act recognizes this reality and       would block President Trump's dangerous threat to remove the       United States from the Paris Agreement and require the       Administration to create a plan that demonstrates how the       U.S. will go about meeting our commitments for climate change       mitigation. By addressing climate change the right way--with       investments in infrastructure and job training, and       developing technologies of the future--our country can lead       the world in driving the significant economic growth and job       creation that comes from the design, manufacturing, and       installation of the clean energy economy. For these reasons,       BlueGreen Alliance urges Congress to swiftly pass this       legislation.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                               Michael Williams,                                      Interim Co-Executive Director,      BlueGreen Alliance.                                   ____                                              United Steelworkers,                                                      April 2, 2019.      Re United Steelworkers support H.R. 9, Climate Action Now           Act.       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 850,000 members of       the United Steelworkers (USW), we urge you to support the       Climate Action Now Act (H.R. 9). This simple and       straightforward legislation prevents the Trump Administration       from withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and requires a plan       for the United States to meet its emissions targets.        In our union's 1990 report titled Our Children's World, we       stated that, ``[Climate change] may be the single greatest       problem we face.'' The situation has become more urgent, and       for many years the United States has been a leader in       innovation and technology to combat this crisis.        The Paris Agreement is an ambitious, nonbinding, and       transparent achievement in the global fight against climate       change. The President's 2017 announcement of his intent to       withdraw was reckless and opposed by labor, environmental,       and business leaders. Withdrawal would be an inexcusable blow       to the U.S. economy, as the diplomatic and trade impacts       would be felt for years.        We applaud the House Democratic Leadership for introducing       H.R. 9 to reverse this Administration's decision. We urge all       members to support the Climate Action Now Act (H.R. 9).            Sincerely,                                                     Leo W. Gerard,      International President.                                   ____                                                         April 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: We are members of       the Leaders Circle of the largest coalition ever assembled       for climate action in the United States, and are among the       over 3,750 U.S. businesses, cities, states, tribes, colleges       and universities, investors, faith groups, cultural       institutions, and health care organizations who declared ``We       Are Still In'' the Paris Agreement and the fight against       climate change.        Since We Are Still In launched two years ago, more and more       American leaders have stepped forward to declare their       support for the global solution to climate change. Our 3,750       signatories come from all fifty states, represent half of the       U.S. population and over half of the U.S. economy.        In that time, the science around climate change has only       become increasingly clear. Last year, the Intergovernmental       Panel on Climate Change detailed the dire global consequences       of allowing global temperature increases to exceed 2.7 deg.       F/1.5 deg. C. Similarly, the National Climate Assessment       detailed that the impacts of climate change are already       impacting every place and walk of life in the United States.       Our future is at stake.        For these reasons, we endorse H.R. 9: Climate Action Now       Act, which advances our commitment to address climate change       and support the Paris Agreement, and hope that leaders from       both sides will choose to stand behind the legislation. It is       in America's best interest to improve our global leadership       and reputation on this issue by honoring our contribution to       the Paris Agreement.        For our part, we will continue our commitment to tackling       climate change by reducing our emissions and working together       for a broad transformation of the U.S. economy. We look       forward to welcoming strong, smart, national policies to       address the climate challenge while unleashing substantial       economic and public health benefits.            Sincerely,        Bishop Marc Andrus, The Episcopal Church; Richard Beam,       Chief Environmental Officer, Providence St Joseph Health;       Mayor Jim Brainard, City of Cannel, Indiana; Alison Brown,       President and CEO, Science Museum of Minnesota; President       Michael Crow, Arizona State University; President David       Finegold, Chatham University; President Dianne Harrison,       California State University--Northridge; Mayor Keith A James,       City of West Palm Beach, Florida; President Mark Mitsui,       Portland Community College; President Fawn Sharp, Quinault       Indian Nation.                                   ____                                        National Association for the                                   Advancement of Colored People,                                     Washington, DC, April 26, 2019.      Re NAACP Strong support for H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now           Act      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the NAACP, our nation's       oldest, largest and most widely-recognized grassroots-based       civil rights organization, I strongly urge you to support and       vote in favor of H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act. The       earth's climate is now changing faster than at any point in  [[Page H3373]]       the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of       human activities, and as the effects of climate change       intensify, so too will the stark differences in consequences       experienced by the privileged and the disadvantaged. Low-      income populations and in America people of color will suffer       more dire repercussions because of climate change.        From Hurricane Katrina in 2005, to the more recent flooding       in Houston due to Hurricane Harvey in 2017, as well as       numerous other weather-related catastrophes including heat       waves, hurricanes, cyclones, and floods we have witnessed the       inconceivable loss of life and property that can be caused by       more dangerous weather systems. The increased ferocity of       these storms is but one result of climate change, yet it       perhaps offers us the best insight into its disparate impact.       Low income Americans and racial and ethnic minorities have       fewer resources with which they can prepare for, defend       against, or use to clean up after a disaster.        While H.R. 9 does not offer the resources which are       necessary to defend against a crisis situation, it does make       it less likely that we will be faced with catastrophes on the       scale to which we are growing sadly increasingly accustomed.       Specifically, H.R. 9 would require that the United States       remain a partner in and part of the 2016 Paris agreement on       climate change. The United States was once a global leader in       pushing for climate action, but we have recently lost our       way. As a result, our progress and that of some other nations       in reducing emissions has dwindled and is now reversing       itself.        There is not time to waste: we need to take decisive action       to address this increasing problem while we still can. It is       not an understatement to say that our future depends upon it.       Please support and vote for H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now       Act, and urge your colleagues in the other body, as well, as       the President, to take the threat of climate change       seriously. Should you have any questions or comments, please       do not hesitate to contact me at my office.            Sincerely,                                                 Hilary O. Shelton,       Director, NAACP Washington Bureau and Senior Vice President       for Policy and Advocacy.                                   ____                                                     April 29, 2019.        Dear Representative: The undersigned public health and       medical organizations urge you to support H.R. 9, the Climate       Action Now Act. The bill would help ensure that the United       States adheres to the science-based targets in the Paris       Agreement and develops a plan to meet them, both essential       steps to protecting public health from the impacts of climate       change.        Climate change is a public health emergency. The science       clearly shows that communities across the nation are       experiencing the health impacts of climate change, including       enhanced conditions for ozone and particulate air pollution,       which cause asthma attacks, cardiovascular disease and       premature death; increased instances of extreme heat, severe       storms and other destabilizing weather patterns that disrupt       people's access to essential healthcare; increased spread of       vector-borne diseases; and longer and more intense allergy       seasons. These threats are no longer hypothetical, and       Americans across the country have experienced them firsthand.        Every American's health is at risk due to climate change,       but some populations are at greater risk, including infants,       children, seniors, pregnant women, low-income communities,       some communities of color, people with disabilities and many       people with chronic diseases. Evidence and experience shows       that these populations will disproportionately bear the       health impacts of climate change without concerted action to       both mitigate and adapt to climate change.        The science is also clear that limiting increase in global       temperatures to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius is       essential. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change       found dramatic differences in health impacts between 1.5 and       2 degrees, including in heat-related morbidity and mortality,       ozone-related mortality, and vector-borne diseases. The Paris       Agreement's goals are to keep the world well under 2 degrees       Celsius and to pursue efforts to further stay below 1.5       degrees.        H.R. 9 is an important step toward what must become a       comprehensive set of policies protect public health from the       worst impacts of climate change. The nation urgently needs to       implement strong, science-based measures to reduce the       emissions that cause climate change. The U.S. must also       invest in health adaptation strategies to help communities       address the varied health impacts they are already facing.        On behalf of the patients and communities we serve, we urge       you to vote YES on H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act.            Sincerely,        Allergy & Asthma Network, Alliance of Nurses for Healthy       Environments, American Lung Association, American Public       Health Association, Association of Schools and Programs of       Public Health, Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America,       Children's Environmental Health Network, Climate for Health,       Health Care Climate Council, Health Care Without Harm.

We have the ability to  work together to do it.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        May 1, 2019 on page H3373, the following appeared: I think that  it is very clear to say that this is a broad-based bill, and I do  hope that we will pass it.      The online version has been corrected to read:  I  think that it is very clear to say that this is a broad-based  bill, and I do hope that we will pass it.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      I thank the ranking member for his offer to work together. We have a  tradition of doing that on the Foreign Affairs Committee, and we will  do it again.   But climate change, global warming, is a factor. We can put our heads  in the sand like an ostrich and pretend it is not there, but it is  there and it is big; and if we don't do something about it soon, we are  all going to pay the price in the future.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote for this important bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the following letters  of support for H.R. 9.         Dear Members of Congress, Congress will soon vote on       legislation that would compel the Trump administration to       honor and plan for meeting the United States' commitment       under the Paris Agreement. We, the undersigned members of E2       (Environmental Entrepreneurs), strongly urge you to vote in       support of this bill to ensure that we continue to focus on       actions to protect our climate and grow our economy.        E2 is a national, nonpartisan group of business leaders who       advocate for smart policies that are good for the economy and       good for the environment. Our members have founded or funded       more than 2,500 companies, created more than 600,000 jobs,       and manage more than $100 billion in venture and private       equity capital.        As business leaders, investors and professionals from every       sector of the economy who live or do business in every state,       we understand the enormous economic promise that can arise if       the United States leads on this issue and stays a party to       the Paris Agreement.        Thanks in part to federal leadership, more than 3 million       Americans now work in clean energy and vehicles jobs. These       are residents of every state who go to work every day       installing solar panels on homes and commercial buildings,       manufacturing wind turbines, and making our homes, schools,       vehicles and offices more efficient. By honoring our       obligations in the Paris Agreement, America can continue to       drive demand for innovative technologies and industries that       grow our economy and create jobs.        Studies show that delivering on the Paris Agreement would       unlock at least $19 trillion in economic growth globally. The       international clean energy market is already worth an       astounding $1.4 trillion a year--and set to grow, with       America's share pegged at $200 billion annually. This       economic activity could fuel an additional $26 billion in GDP       growth in the United States alone by 2020, which would also       provide greater opportunities for U.S. businesses to lead in       emerging clean economy markets.        The Paris Agreement is good for American businesses and its       workers. Ensuring that we maintain our obligations under this       historic agreement is a chance to ensure America leads in       clean energy, agriculture, transportation, infrastructure,       technology and other sectors instead of falling behind our       overseas competitors.        We urge you to vote in favor of legislation that keeps the       United States in the Paris Agreement and creates a plan for       meeting our nation's commitments.

Re H.R. 9, The Climate Action Now Act         Dear Representative, on behalf of the Business for       Innovative Climate and Energy Policy (BICEP) network, a 51       company coalition of major American businesses representing       many sectors across the U.S. economy, I write to respectfully       request that you vote in support of H.R. 9, The Climate       Action Now Act, which would ensure that the United States       does not withdraw from the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. As       you know, H.R. 9 will be brought up for consideration the       week of April 29th.        As a network of major businesses based throughout the       United States and around the world, BICEP sees international       engagement and maintaining U.S. commitments under the Paris       Climate Agreement as critical to our continued economic       success. Climate change is a global problem and requires a       global solution. The United States cannot solve the climate       problem on its own, which is why a strong international       framework is required to assure that other countries also       meet their commitments, reduce their greenhouse gas       emissions, and do so in a transparent and verifiable manner.        Every nation in the world has signed on to the Paris       Agreement, which creates a structure for countries to submit       non-binding, voluntary targets for greenhouse gas emissions       reductions. Only one, the United States, has announced its       intent to withdraw. Since the development of this global       agreement, the understanding of the impacts of global warming       has only become more clear. The Intergovernmental Panel on       Climate Change--the world's foremost body of climate       scientists, has released it's 2018 IPCC 1.5 Report, which       details the consequences of allowing average global       temperature increases to exceed 2.7 F /1.5 C. Additionally,       the most recent U.S. National Climate Assessment report       projects the impacts that American industry and communities       will face (and are already facing) from climate change-      related impacts.        Days after the administration's June 2017 announcement of       its intent to withdraw the United States from the Paris       Agreement, many BICEP members joined other sectors of the       U.S. economy, including states, cities, universities, faith       groups, healthcare systems, and others to declare that ``We       Are Still In.'' The now 3,750+ signatories to We Are Still In       include members from all 50 states and represent $9.46       trillion of the American economy--demonstrating significant       real economy support for U.S. participation in the Paris       Climate Agreement.        Remaining in the Paris Climate Agreement is essential for       the U.S. to retain a seat at the table, contribute in a       positive manner to international negotiations, and reflect       the deep ambition among U.S. businesses to fight climate       change and protect from the worst economic impacts associated       with a warming world.        As companies across the United States, BICEP recognizes       that a zero-carbon economy is necessary to achieve long-term       climate goals and are taking steps in their own operations to       accelerate this transition. However, domestic and       international policy structures are critical to drive change       at the scale and speed necessary to reflect our latest       understanding of the science. Maintaining our participation       in the Paris Agreement is one such policy structure that the       U.S. should retain.        On behalf of the businesses in our BICEP network, I       respectfully request that you vote in support of H.R. 9, The       Climate Action Now Act when it comes up for a vote.        Thank you for your consideration of this request. I am       happy to connect further on this issue and answer any       questions you may have. Please do not hesitate to follow up.            Sincerely,                                                     Anne L. Kelly,      Vice President, Government Relations.                                   ____           American College of Physicians, Leading Internal             Medicine, Improving Lives,                                       Washington, DC, May 1, 2019.      Hon. Kathy Castor,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Rep. Castor: On behalf of the American College of       Physicians (ACP), I am writing to express our strong support       for the Climate Action Now Act (H.R. 9), which directs the       United States to uphold its commitment to the Paris Agreement       on Climate Change. We applaud your leadership in introducing       this legislation and urge its quick passage in the U.S. House       of Representatives today. ACP is deeply concerned about the       negative impact that climate change is having on public       health and patients, and that these effects will worsen       without immediate action. This is an important issue for the       medical community and patients, and we all need to be part of       finding a solution.        The American College of Physicians is the largest medical       specialty organization and the second largest physician group       in the United States. ACP members include 154,000 internal       medicine physicians (internists), related subspecialists, and       medical students. Internal medicine physicians are       specialists who apply scientific knowledge and clinical       expertise to the diagnosis, treatment, and compassionate care       of adults across the spectrum from health to complex illness.        Because physicians are on the front lines of patient care,       they are witnessing--here and now--the harmful health effects       that climate change can and does have on the human body.       These harmful effects include: higher rates of respiratory       and heat-related illness, increased prevalence of vector-      borne and waterborne diseases, food and water insecurity, and       malnutrition, as outlined in ACP's 2016 position paper,       ``Climate Change and Health,'' published in the Annals of       Internal Medicine. People who are elderly, sick, or poor are       especially vulnerable to these potential consequences. As       climate change worsens, an increase in global temperature and       frequency of heat waves will raise the risk of heat       exhaustion. Asthma  [[Page H3381]]       and other chronic lung conditions will be exacerbated by       increased particulate matter and ground-level ozone in the       atmosphere. Exposure to infectious disease from vectors such       as ticks and mosquitoes, which carry the harmful Zika virus,       has and will continue to escalate.        Physicians, both individually and collectively, are       encouraged to advocate for climate change adaptation and       mitigation policies and communicate about the health co-      benefits of addressing climate change in objective, simple       language to their community and policymakers. For its part,       the American College of Physicians is committed to working       with lawmakers, its international chapters and with other       professional membership and public health organizations       within the United States and globally to pursue the policies       recommended in its position paper. ACP is a founding member       of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health,       which brings together 22 medical associations representing       approximately 550,000 clinical practitioners. Just two days       ago on Monday of this week, I joined my colleagues from the       Consortium to educate members of Congress about how climate       change affects health and the need to take action now. In       addition, ACP was pleased to submit its perspective and       recommendations on climate change to the House Resources       Committee earlier this year.        Your legislation represents a vital step in the fight       against climate change, and in maintaining this nation's role       as a leader in combatting the harmful impact of climate       change. H.R. 9 prohibits the use of funds to advance the       withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement and       requires the President to develop and submit to the       appropriate congressional committees and make available to       the public a plan for the United States to meet its       nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement.        A global effort is required to reduce anthropogenic       greenhouse gas emissions and address the health impact of       climate change. The United States must commit to taking both       a leadership and collaborative role in developing,       implementing, and ensuring the success of such a global       effort and in reducing its own contributions to greenhouse       gas emissions. For this reason, ACP remains strongly opposed       to the United States' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement.       Climate change adaptation strategies must be established, and       mitigation measures, like switching to clean, renewable       energy and promoting active transportation, must be adopted.        ACP looks forward to continuing to work with you in your       leadership role on this critical issue. We stand ready to       serve as a resource for you and other lawmakers in helping to       communicate the harmful impacts of climate change on the       public's health.            Sincerely,                                        Robert M. McLean, MD, FACP,                                                         President.
