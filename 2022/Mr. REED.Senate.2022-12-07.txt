 Mr. President, we have a longstanding adult literacy crisis  that affects the quality of life for individuals and families and holds  our economy back. It is time for a major expansion of adult education.  Today, I am proud to introduce bipartisan legislation--the Adult  Education Workforce Opportunity and Reskilling for Knowledge and  Success Act, or the Adult Education WORKS Act--with my colleague  Senator Young.   Adult education provides numeracy, literacy, digital literacy,  English language skills, work readiness, soft skills, high school  equivalency, and numerous wraparound services to millions of adult  learners nationwide--all essential skills. They can be the difference  between earning a family-sustaining wage and struggling to make ends  meet. A study commissioned by the Barbara Bush Foundation estimated  that getting all U.S. adults to the equivalent of a sixth grade reading  level would generate an additional $2.2 trillion in annual income for  the country. Without the opportunities provided through adult education  programs, many adults will be left on the sidelines.   According to recent National Center for Education Statistics, NCES,  data, 43 million adults are low-skilled in literacy and 62.7 million  adults are low-skilled in numeracy. Building a sustainable economy that  truly works for everyone is going to require helping these individuals  acquire the basic skills they need to succeed. Unfortunately, we are  reaching only a fraction of these individuals today. According to the  Department of Education, at current funding levels, adult education  programs only serve about 1.1 million people, and an estimated one- third of local adult education providers have waiting lists.   The Adult Education WORKS Act provides a roadmap for addressing this  crisis. It calls for increased resources, doubling funding for adult  education by 2026. At the same time, it makes significant improvements  to the adult education system. It calls for a new emphasis on digital  and information literacy, which are critical for success in the  workplace and in navigating everyday life. It enhances the role of  adult education providers, with a special focus on public libraries and  community-based organizations, throughout the workforce development  system, ensuring coordination and efficient use of resources. It  invests in the professionalization of the adult education field,  strengthening State certification policies, encouraging full-time  staffing models, and expanding professional development opportunities  and career pathways for adult educators. It provides support for  college and career navigators in public libraries and community-based  organizations to support adult learners where they live. Finally, it  invests in innovation and accountability through pilot projects that  test new approaches to measuring program performance and learner  outcomes.   In developing this legislation, Senator Young and I worked closely  with key stakeholders working on the frontlines in the adult education  community. I am pleased to count the American Library Association, the  Center for Law and Social Policy, the Coalition on Adult Basic  Education, the National Coalition for Literacy, ProLiteracy, and TESOL  among the supporters of this legislation.   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and work with us  to ensure it is part of any legislation to reauthorize the Workforce  Innovation and Opportunity Act.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we have a longstanding adult literacy crisis  that affects the quality of life for individuals and families and holds  our economy back.
