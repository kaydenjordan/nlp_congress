 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Neal for his leadership in  crafting such a big part of this bold package. It has been almost 1  year since our lives were turned upside down. In that time, we have  lost loved ones, friends, and neighbors; and millions more families are  out of options.   We cannot afford to leave anyone behind. That is why this plan  extends critical lifelines, so that families can meet their basic needs  of putting food  [[Page H845]]  on the table and paying their rent while we finally get this pandemic  under control. I don't know what fantasy la-la land my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle live in, but families are hurting in this  country, and this bill will help them.   Mr. Speaker, you cannot stand up here and say you support the working  class and families when you plan on voting ``no'' to helping them.   I am proud that this package includes many good things that help  deliver on behalf of families that are in need. But I am especially  proud that this package includes a bill that I introduced with  Congresswoman McBath from Georgia, which will provide those on  unemployment benefits with a guaranteed subsidy for healthcare so they  don't lose their coverage in the middle of the worst pandemic that our  country has seen in 100 years.   I am also pleased that this package includes an expansion and an  improvement of the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit that I have long  championed. These robust resources will help us meet the moment. This  rescue plan will keep families and children from falling into poverty.    Mr. Speaker, this is not the time for small thinking. My  Republican colleagues don't get that. They oppose this bill, despite  the fact that it is wildly popular even among Republicans. Their  opposition, I think, is simply because it is a Democratic bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for the American  Rescue Plan so that all families can see better days ahead.                                time  0040
