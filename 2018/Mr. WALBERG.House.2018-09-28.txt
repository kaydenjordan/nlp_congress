 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this  bipartisan package to address the opioid crisis devastating our  communities.   This legislation includes two provisions authored by myself and my  good friend from Michigan, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.   One will help safely dispose of unused drugs and prevent their  diversion into the community. The other, Jessie's Law, honors the  memory of Jessie Grubb and will help prevent future overdose tragedies  under medical care.   Mr. Speaker, this critical legislation will help save and rebuild  lives. I urge its passage today, and I look forward to its quickly  advancing to the President's desk.
