 Mr. Speaker, all of us--all of us--believe what happened  to George Floyd was horrible, and justice must be served.   Bad cops that do bad things must be held accountable. I have listened  to Blacks who have been discriminated against, and I believe  discrimination is real.   Congressman Hastings yesterday, in the Rules Committee, shared with  us things that had happened to him, things that happened to people he  knew, and it was horrible. We can't let those types of things continue  in our society.   But I also know that the vast majority of law enforcement officers  are good people, good people doing good things, helping people in the  community, and protecting our communities.   That is why I think it is really important that we address the  problems we are having in our Nation in a bipartisan fashion, because  this is so important. America needs to heal.   Unfortunately, the bill before us today, part of the rule and the  policing bill, was not negotiated with Republicans. So there are  portions of the bill that I support, that other Republicans support,  and that I believe President Trump would support and sign into law. But  there are other portions of the bill that I cannot vote for, nor can  other Republicans.   The reason is because I have spoken to a wide variety of law  enforcement officers and police chiefs. They have all said that there  are portions of this bill that would undermine their ability to do  their job in protecting our communities.   I would like to read a portion of a letter that we received from the  National Association of Police Organizations that oppose the underlying  bill, H.R. 7120, in this rule. It says:         Our most significant concerns include amending section 242       of title 18, United States Code, to lower the standard for       mens rea, and the practical elimination of qualified immunity       for law enforcement officers. Combined, these two provisions       take away any legal protections for officers while making it       easier to prosecute them for mistakes on the job, not just       criminal acts. With the change to qualified immunity, an       officer can go to prison for an unintentional act that       unknowingly broke an unknown law. We believe in holding       officers accountable for their actions, but the consequence       of this would be making criminals out of decent cops       enforcing the laws in good faith.    This organization represents 241,000 sworn law enforcement officers.   The other law enforcement officers I have spoken to, and chiefs, said  they have problems with other portions of the bill. Specifically, the  banning, outright banning, on chokeholds and carotid holds.    In Arizona, it is used as a last resort, a lethal force, and that is  what is in the Senate bill. But in this bill, it outright bans it. The  police officers have said: Don't take that option off the table because  if you take that option off the table, we will be forced to shoot  someone, which I believe is the opposite of what we want to do.   Also, eliminating no-knock warrants, the officers want you to know  that no-knock warrants have to go through a court, that they have to go  through a judge, and that, often, they are used when going after drug  cartels that are heavily armed and you need the element of surprise. So  banning them would possibly hurt law enforcement officers, and the  drugs would be taken away.   They also were concerned about the outright banning in this bill of  law enforcement agencies getting surplus military equipment at little  or no cost. They say they don't use this equipment to ride down the  roads, you know, like showing military force. In Arizona, they often  use this equipment when there are flash floods, and they need to rescue  people or need to clear roads.   So, it is disappointing that we can't have a bipartisan bill in front  of us today. I hope we can. They didn't talk to Republicans on the  bill, that I am aware of, and the Democrats in the Judiciary Committee  voted down all of our amendments.    Particularly, I had an amendment that said if a city  allows an autonomous zone, like what is happening in Seattle, they  can't get law enforcement grants from the Federal Government. It seems  common sense. They voted it down.   I had another amendment that said if a city wants to defund,  dismantle, disband police, they shouldn't get Federal law enforcement  grants. That is just wrong.   So I call on all Members, all Members on both sides, to speak out  against the violence that is happening in our streets, the violence,  the tearing down of statues, statues of Ulysses Grant, who was with the  Union, statues of religious figures. This is wrong. Stop the  dismantling, defunding calls for police. Stop the looting. It is not  peaceful protest when that happens.   Let's work on a bipartisan bill and get something real done.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Black lives matter. My two grandsons, who are Black, their lives  matter. I don't want anything bad to happen to them.   My life matters. White lives matter. Hispanic lives matter. Asian  lives matter. Native American lives matter. Quite frankly, all lives  matter. Police officers' lives matter, too.   What happened to George Floyd was terrible, and bad cops or cops that  do bad things have to be held accountable. But we have to recognize  that the vast majority of law enforcement officers are good, honest  people trying to help our community and protect our community.   We can't throw the baby out with the bathwater, as the saying goes.  We need a bipartisan bill because you guys know, I know you are  passionate, I know you believe in this, but you also know that this  bill that you are pushing through without negotiating with Republicans  on is not going to go anywhere.   So, if you actually want something done, you have to negotiate with  Republicans because, after all, they have a majority in the Senate, and  we have a Republican President.    I ask that we work on a bill that not only holds police officers that  do bad things accountable, but that does not undermine law enforcement  so that they can do what they need to do to protect our society.   I have talked to numerous law enforcement officers and police chiefs  in my district. All of them, every single one of them, said there are  portions of this Democrat bill that would undermine their ability to  protect us in our communities.   Now, there are other parts of this bill that I support, that  Republicans support, that the President could sign. So why don't we try  to unite on the things that we can agree on?   It has been said before that in Judiciary Committee none of the  Republican amendments were--you voted them all down. Democrats voted  them all down. And then Senator Scott said that he offered 20  amendments to the Democrats in the Senate, and they rejected them.   So, if we really want to get something done--and we should get  something done--let's try to work together instead of pushing through a  bill that you haven't reached out to Republicans to negotiate on.   I also am very dismayed by what is happening around our country. I  know people are upset, and I applaud the people who are peaceful in  their protests.    Madam Speaker, I ask all Members, both Republican and  Democrat, to call on the people who are violent out in our streets,  people who are looting, people who are tearing down statues, people who  are setting up autonomous zones--in the one in Seattle they killed  somebody there--please, let's try to heal our country together.
