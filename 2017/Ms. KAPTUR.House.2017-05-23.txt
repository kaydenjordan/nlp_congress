 Mr. Speaker, budgets are about values. And President  Trump's budget breaks his promises to the American people. His 2018  budget is a disgrace.   The plan cuts people's access to basic necessities and retards decent  standards of living. The American people want to create jobs, raise  wages, invest in education, protect their pensions, and give people a  chance at a better future.   What does the Trump budget do for the heartland that voted for him?  Great Lakes clean up? Zeroed out. Social Security Disability insurance?  Slashed. Medicaid? Slashed. Public education? Slashed.   We have seen this supply side economic shell game before. It ends  with a massive tax cut for millionaires and billionaires, while leaving  Americans living on the brink paycheck to paycheck, leaving them  behind.   Let's recap. The Trump budget hurts working families, it weakens  Social Security and Medicaid, it hurts students seeking to better  themselves, it hurts seniors trying to pay for their medicine and  insurance and who depend on programs like Meals on Wheels.   I would encourage every heartland family with an elderly parent, an  indebted graduate, or a trusting toddler to look at this budget and  match it against the promises they heard versus what is being  delivered. What a shame for our country.                            ____________________
