 Mr. Speaker, as we face a challenge even greater than  the Great Depression, it is imperative that we pass the HEROES Act  today and then continue to fight.   Next, I hope we tailor a specific plan to rescue America's 500,000  neighborhood restaurants and their 11 million workers. Without action  soon, 80 percent of them will go out of business this year, causing not  just more economic loss and unemployment but irreparable damage to  every community and every neighborhood in America.
