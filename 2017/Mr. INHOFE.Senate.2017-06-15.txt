 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized  for such time as I may consume as in morning business.    Mr. President, first of all, let me say that I am really  glad the junior Senator from Georgia has taken this on. This is  something that some of us who have been around a little bit longer have  gone through before.   I think everyone realizes that what was attempted to be done by  President Obama was a single-payer system. Ultimately, that is what  liberals want. I remember back in the 1990s what was referred to at  that time as Hillary healthcare during the Clinton administration. I  remember so well the efforts that were taking place.   Sometimes I go back to my State of Oklahoma just to be around logical  people, and they will ask the question: If this system is not working  in Canada, is not working in Sweden, and is not working in Great  Britain, why do they think it will work here? Liberal individuals will  never tell you this, but what they are really thinking is this: It  would work if I were running the show.   So we are going through a similar thing again, and I am so happy we  have leaders, as the occupier of the Chair,  [[Page S3543]]  and we have more doctors right now in the Senate. This is the time to  make these changes and really accomplish things. But that is not why I  am here.
