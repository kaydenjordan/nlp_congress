 Mr. Speaker, a lot has been said in the last 48 hours  on this floor with regard to the Ukraine-Russian conflict; however, I  think there are some things that should be added that maybe can be  talked about a little bit more as we try to find the end here. And I  hope the Biden administration does not give up at all on trying to  negotiate some sort of peace.   First of all, I am going to address Russia. Russia has a very low  birthrate now of 1.5. In addition to that, people right now are leaving  Russia. I was on the San Diego border about 8 months ago, and at that  time just in that region--one of 10 regions along the Mexican border-- the second biggest nationality to cross was Russian. It was recently  reported that in the 6-month period ending January, 8,600 Russians  entered this country. I would bet because of the war Russian  immigration has only increased.   With regard to Ukraine, its birthrate is even lower. Of approximately  180 countries of size in the world, Ukraine has the second-lowest  birthrate to South Korea at 1.1 percent. It has recently been reported  the United States will accept up to 100,000 Ukrainians in our country.  While it is certainly the intent that they return, we all know that  many of them don't.                            ____________________
