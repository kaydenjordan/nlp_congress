 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  month of May as Mental Health Month for the 70th consecutive year.   Unfortunately, throughout our history in the United States, many  mental health conditions have been overlooked and often met with  rejection, shame, and more. But mental health conditions truly touch us  all. Between family members and friends, we all are either affected  ourselves or we know someone with a mental health condition.   Currently, 46.6 million adults in the U.S. have a mental health  condition. Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the U.S., and  90 percent of those who die by suicide have an underlying mental  illness revealed by psychological autopsy.   Less than half of adults in the U.S. are receiving adequate treatment  for mental health.   During the month of May, I encourage everyone to get a mental health  checkup and to remember that your mental health is as important as your  physical health.   Please know, you are not alone, and it is okay to open up and share  what you are going through.                            ____________________
