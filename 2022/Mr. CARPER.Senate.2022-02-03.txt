 Mr. President, we just had a vote, and the vote--Mr.  President, would you mind repeating the margin on that vote. Do you  have that handy?    Fifty-four to thirty-three. In baseball, we are hoping  there is going to be a settlement in the baseball dispute right now  between labor and management. But, in baseball, you have some games  that go extra innings, but at the end of the game, somebody wins and  somebody loses. I like to say the team that wins gets a ``w.''   Well, we just had a ``w'' in favor of, in support of, the nomination  of Leonard Stark to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal  Circuit--not just a win for him, for his family; not just a win for  Delaware, where he is from; not just a win for the colleges and  universities he has gone to, the places that he has worked, that he has  practiced law, served as a judge; but this is a win for our country.  This is a win for our country. I am honored today to rise in support of  his nomination to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals.   The Presiding Officer from time to time will see me on the floor  passing out what we call palm cards--he has probably passed out a few  of his own--to our colleagues asking them to join him--join me--in  cosponsoring legislation, supporting amendments, supporting bills on  the floor.   For the last day or two, I have been passing out palm cards to our  Republican colleagues, asking them to support the nomination of Leonard  Stark to serve on this court. As grateful as I am for all the Democrats  and at least one or two Independents who voted for him, I want to also  express my thanks--our thanks--to the Republicans who crossed the aisle  and saw fit to support his nomination.   I am not sure how much our colleagues here in the Senate know about  the U.S. Court of Appeals. I would be the first to admit that I had to  do some homework on it myself. But this court is best known--may be  best known for its decisions on patent law. That is right--patent law.  In fact, it is the only appellate court, I am told, other than the U.S.  Supreme Court that will hear and consider patent case appeals.   But despite my needing to do a little homework on the U.S. Court of  Appeals for the Federal Circuit, I do know a great deal about Judge  Leonard Stark. In fact, I have known him for probably half of his  life--for half of his life. I have admired him for every one of those  years.   He has been nominated by our President to serve in this critical role  in this important court. I have had the chance to follow his  nomination, along with Senator Coons of Delaware, through the Judiciary  Committee process, and I am confident that Judge Stark's judicial  experience and his expertise, particularly--particularly--in  [[Page S509]]  the complex legal arena of patent law, make him a perfect fit--a  perfect fit--for this particular judgeship.   I know a lot about Judge Stark for a couple of reasons. One, we are  from Delaware. Delaware is a little State. I like to say--people ask me  sometimes--we have a million people who live there. They say: Have you  met everybody in the State of Delaware? Probably not every one of them,  but I met Judge Stark early in his life. I was impressed by him as a  young man, and that respect and really appreciation have only grown  over the years.   For the last 12 years, Judge Stark has served as a judge on the  Delaware Federal district court. It is a court with four judgeships. He  has had one of those seats for about 12 years now. Prior to that, he  had a distinguished academic and professional career in the State of  Delaware.   Judge Stark is a fellow University of Delaware graduate. We are the  Fighting Blue Hens at UD. Len, as he is known to his friends and his  colleagues and his professors, double-majored as an undergraduate in  political science and economics while simultaneously working toward his  master's degree.    Let me just say that again. Judge Stark double-majored--this is  before he was a judge--as an undergraduate in political science and  economics while simultaneously working toward his master's degree. My  sister would say we call that showing off, but he was just showing up  and just excelling every step of the way.   During college, Len proved himself to be an exceptional student and  person, earning a full scholarship as a Eugene du Pont Memorial  distinguished scholar.   Let me just mention something that Judge Stark and I have in common  from our time at the University of Delaware. We both met an individual  who would change our lives--a distinguished, beloved professor of  political science named Jim Soles, a legendary political science  professor.   I don't know if at the Presiding Officer's alma mater the students  had an opportunity to vote for outstanding professor. Dr. Soles won  that honor at the University of Delaware so many times, I think they  retired the honor. He was just beloved and respected by so many  students and parents and faculty members.   Fortunately for Leonard Stark and fortunately for me, Jim Soles took  us both under his wing and helped get us on the right path and led me  to the Senate and leads Judge Stark to the Senate floor today for this  vote on cloture on his nomination.   Jim Soles was a personal hero to a whole lot of us in Delaware and  particularly at the University of Delaware. His mentorship involved a  lifelong friendship--one that Judge Stark and I still cherish to this  day.   I had been a naval flight officer in the Vietnam war, moved from  California to Delaware at the end of the war, and ended up working on  an MBA. My first year in Delaware, I met a guy who was running for the  Democratic nomination, our only congressional seat. It was Jim Soles. I  was in Delaware for like a year, and I ended up going from knowing  nobody to being the treasurer of a fellow running for the U.S. House of  Representatives. Our Congressman at the time was Pete du Pont, a good  man, and Jim Soles ran against him. I got involved in that campaign,  and later on, I would meet Judge Stark. We bonded right away because of  our affection and respect for Dr. Soles.   But I think it was 12 years ago--12 years ago--Judge Stark was  confirmed, I think unanimously, by this body to serve on Delaware's  Federal district court, and I called him to congratulate him. Sure  enough, guess who he was having dinner with. He was having dinner with  Jim Soles near the campus of the University of Delaware in Newark.   Jim got to tell Judge Stark how proud he was upon his confirmation to  the Delaware district court, but, sadly, not too long after that, we  lost our dear friend Dr. Jim Soles.   While he will not be able to have dinner with us tonight or with Jim  tonight, I want Judge Stark to know, when I call him later this  afternoon or this evening, that Jim Soles is smiling down on him and  that Jim would have been so proud to see his nomination once again  advancing on the floor of the U.S. Senate.   Mr. President, let me tell a couple of things about Judge Stark, if I  could.   Not long after his graduation from the University of Delaware--again,  where he did a double major as an undergraduate simultaneously while  pursuing an advanced degree, a master's degree--he went off and studied  at Oxford, and he authored numerous academic and scholarly  publications, including a book on British politics, which he wrote in  his spare time between classes at Oxford.   After Oxford, Judge Stark went on to earn his law degree at Yale Law  School, where he served as senior editor of the Yale Law Journal.   After graduation, Judge Stark clerked for legendary Delaware Judge  Walter Stapleton, who served for years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for  the Third Circuit.   Judge Stark then began his career in public service as an assistant  U.S. attorney for the State of Delaware, where from 2002 to 2007, he  handled a wide variety of cases, from criminal cases to Federal cases,  to civil matters and others.   Before his current position as a district judge, Judge Stark served  as magistrate judge on the U.S. District Court of Delaware. It was this  role that prepared him--I think quite well--to serve as a district  court judge.   In 2010, President Obama nominated Judge Stark to fill the vacancy on  the Delaware district court, and the Senate confirmed Judge Stark  unanimously--unanimously.   In the years since then, Judge Stark has served Delaware and our  Nation with integrity and with distinction. Only 4 years after serving  as a district judge, in 2014, Judge Stark was appointed the position of  chief judge of the Delaware district court, which position he held  until June of this year.   During his 14 years on the bench in Delaware, Judge Stark has  presided over--get this--over 6,000 civil and criminal cases, including  over 2,400 patent cases, and 93 trials, including 63 patent trials.   Patent law is of particular importance to the Federal Circuit, and  Judge Stark's experience and expertise in these matters make him  uniquely qualified for this particular judgeship. In fact, the  Judiciary Committee of this Senate received a letter in support of  Judge Stark's nomination from the Federal Circuit Bar Association that  highlighted the breadth of Judge Stark's experience. The letter states  that Judge Stark--their language, not mine--is ``uniquely well-suited''  to a position on the Federal Circuit.   And the letter went on to highlight his ``integrity, [his] his  professional competence, and [his] judicial temperament.''   The Judiciary Committee also received a letter of support from the  American Bar Association, which once again rated Judge Stark  unanimously--they rated him ``well qualified''--well qualified.   At every stage of his life, Judge Stark has performed at the highest  level. That level of success and work ethic is impressive for any  field. But when it happens on the Federal bench, that is for the  benefit of our Constitution and the American people.   Finally, I might add, Judge Stark is known as a consensus builder who  works to find principled compromises--something the Presiding Officer  and I do every day or at least attempt to. In fact, of Judge Stark's  approximately 2,100 written opinions--2,100 written opinions--only 2  percent of them have ever been reversed or affirmed with criticism,  only 2 percent.   That is part of the reason why he was approved in January by a strong  bipartisan majority in the Judiciary Committee. He has the heart of a  servant and the temperament to be an outstanding judge on the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.   From his studies that took him from Newark, DE, across the pond, to  Oxford, England, and back to Yale, Judge Stark has a stellar record of  academic achievement. And from his service to the American people as an  assistant U.S. attorney and for the last 12 years on the Delaware  District Court, Judge Stark earned the respect and the admiration of  the legal community in Delaware and across our Nation.   I want to close with this. As the Presiding Officer knows, I was  privileged to serve as Governor of Delaware for 8 years, just before I  came here to serve  [[Page S510]]  in the U.S. Senate. And I never imagined when I was running for the  position of Governor how important the Governor's role in Delaware is  in terms of nominating judges to the Court of Chancery and the Delaware  Supreme Court and superior court and family court, and on and on--a lot  of courts and some with national and even international respect and  roles.   One of my great regrets is that I never had the opportunity to  nominate Judge Stark, young Leonard Stark. He did not apply. I know he  was old enough but not by much. But I would have been very, very proud  as Governor to have nominated him to serve in any one of the courts in  Delaware.   Delaware is a little place that has about a million people, about 100  miles from north to south and about 50 miles from east to west. And it  is not possible to know everybody, but you can know a lot of people.  And I have been privileged to not only just know Leonard Stark but also  to know his family and to know that one of the reasons why he  succeeded--I would say one of the reasons I succeeded is that we picked  the right parents, not a lot of wealth or fortune or fame but just  people with really good values and just good people. And I just want to  say to them, thank you for bringing him into the world and raising him  with wonderful values.   I want to thank his wife and children for sharing their husband and  their dad with the people of Delaware for all these years and for your  willingness to let us give him a chance to serve in this new position.   From his service to the American public as assistant U.S. attorney  for the last 12 years on the Delaware district court, Leonard Stark has  earned the respect and the admiration of the legal community in  Delaware and across our country.   I again want to thank our colleagues today for voting to take his  nomination to go forward to the next step, and I think we will have an  opportunity to vote next week on the actual confirmation. But I am  pleased with the outcome of today's vote on cloture.   We have a State song--I know we have a State song in Maryland. I  won't sing it here today, but the State song--the very first State,  Delaware, the first State to ratify the Constitution--includes a line  that goes something like this:         The sun is shining over our beloved Delaware.    And so today, indeed, the Sun is shining over Delaware.   We had a National Prayer Breakfast in the Capitol this morning in the  auditorium in the Visitor Center, where the speaker was Brian  Stephenson, famed attorney, defender, author. He was here, and he was  our keynote speaker for the Prayer Breakfast. The cochair for the  Prayer Breakfast was Senator Christopher Coons of Delaware.   The President of the United States spoke at the Prayer Breakfast  today, Joe Biden, a Delawarean. And Lisa Blunt Rochester, our  Congresswoman, and I had the privilege to be there and be part of that  family.   It has been a good day for Delaware. I know with the vote to move  this nomination to the next step, it is another good day for Delaware  for this reason. It was also a very good day for our country and for  all who have worked hard to make this day possible and this step  possible. I just want to say a heartfelt thank you.   With that, I yield the floor to another fellow who has a Delaware  connection. When he came for orientation a few years ago, he was nice  enough to share with me that--I told him that the most popular Senate  initials in the U.S. Senate were the letters ``TC.'' There were more  ``TCs'' than any set of initials in the Senate, and when Ted Cruz  joined us, we had another one as well.   He shared with me that his grandmother was from Wilmington, DE--1 of  17 children, if I am not mistaken, and that gave us a common bond right  from the get-go. I am happy to yield to my friend from Texas for his  comments today.    Mr. President, I have 3 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They  [[Page S527]]  have the approval of the Majority and Minority Leaders.
