 Mr. Speaker, this weekend I was  grateful to lead a congressional delegation to Jerusalem, where we met  yesterday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Knesset Foreign  Affairs Chairman Avi Dichter, while we attended the opening of the U.S.  Embassy in Jerusalem, ably coordinated by Ambassador David Friedman  with Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.   Sadly, some threaten Israel's legitimacy, but the opening of the U.S.  Embassy in Jerusalem, with the courage of President Donald Trump,  provides validity to the State of Israel and their inherent right to  determine their own capital.   America's bond with Israel is unique. And its strength is the  foundation of American leadership in the Middle East for peace. By  moving the embassy to Jerusalem and promoting Israel's permanency, the  world is safer for American families. And I appreciate the opportunity  to have been there for this historic achievement with President Trump  fulfilling his promises.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Best wishes for a speedy recovery for the Congressman from Maryland,  Anthony Brown.                            ____________________
