 Madam Speaker, I want the Haitian community in  America and in the United States to know that we have not forgotten  them.   Haiti has been a strong ally of the United States that,  unfortunately, has been caught in the quagmire of destructive poverty  and, of course, governments that sometimes have not worked. Recently,  they experienced a horrific earthquake; 800,000 people homeless.   So now that we see Haitians by the thousands coming to our border, we  have an obligation not to deport them. We have an obligation to provide  the potential review that comes about by having the number of  immigration personnel to determine their status. We have an obligation  for humanitarian relief.   I know our borders are closed; I recognize that. But I also know that  there is opportunity for asylum through credible fear, and there is  also an opportunity to deal with whether or not these individuals have  family members.   Let me simply say, Madam Speaker, the question we have now is sending  these Haitians to a country that is so impoverished and violent is not  the right way to go. Let's work together to do it right.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I am delighted to be representing the  Congressional Black Caucus as the Special Order chair.   I want to thank our chairwoman, Joyce Beatty, for her leadership on  ensuring that the message of the Congressional Black Caucus--Our Power,  Our Message--is reflected on the floor of this House and to the  American people, to our constituents, the millions and millions of  Americans that the 57 members of the Congressional Black Caucus  represent.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of this Special  Order.  [[Page H4547]]     Madam Speaker, it is clear that we will be dealing  with Build Back Better for the time of this week and into next week, so  the Congressional Black Caucus will come very briefly this week to  discuss and let our constituents and Americans know that any distorted  representation of the $3.5 trillion, as not being able to afford it or  that it is too extensive, is really a misrepresentation.   First of all, we support, as the Congressional Black Caucus, Build  Back Better enthusiastically. It is a $3.5 trillion package over 10  years for a country that is nearing 350 million people, a country that  has not seen infrastructure investment, climate investment, investment  to deal with electric cars, investment to deal with the new economy,  the care economy--we have not seen this for decades, or at least we  have not seen this as we have moved into the 21st century.   The Build Back Better plan makes the transformative investments that  we need to continue our growing economy, lower costs for working  families, and position the United States as a global leader in the  innovation and jobs of the future.   The $3.5 trillion gross investment will build on the successes of the  American Rescue Plan and set our Nation on a path of fiscal  responsibility and broadly shared prosperity for generations to come.   Almost 4 years ago, in 2017, the Houston area and most of the  Southern region, all the way to Florida, including some of our  Commonwealths, experienced Hurricane Harvey.   This is my district, where the water looked like an extended ocean-- $155 billion worth of damage, so much damage that we are continuing to  work with it. Why? Because we did not have the infrastructure. We did  not have the bayous that were constructed in a way that would hold the  water. So much damage, so much loss, so much pain.   So a combination of the INVEST Act and Build Back Better is a must.  They must walk hand-in-hand. One without the other does not answer the  call of the American people. It does not reflect the Lincolnesque  attitude that we all are in this together.   Let me read a quote from President Lincoln, who reminds us so much  whenever we speak of the idea of what America is. Abraham Lincoln, in  1862, as he was seeing the divide coming into this Nation, offered  these words: ``The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the  stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must  rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew and  act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our  country.''   As we move forward with Build Back Better and the INVEST Act, the  $3.5 trillion and the $1 trillion, there is no time to isolate  ourselves as one or I or me. This is a time when we stand with America  as we, working to ensure that this magnificent contribution to the  infrastructure--to some of the worst infrastructure problems, from dams  to highways to the electric grid--can also stand alongside childcare  and the care economy.   For example, in the State of Texas, this bill would help the local  economy. It would send more than $400 million in Texas to support the  expansion of an electric vehicle charging network, with up to $2.5  billion more available through grants.   Texas would also receive $3 billion to improve pipes and the delivery  of clean drinking water so needed in our State, in urban and rural  communities.   And Texas would benefit from the bill's $3.5 billion investment in  weatherizing energy grids across the country. Millions of Texans who  sat shivering in their dark living rooms during the last winter's  freeze will undoubtedly welcome that improvement. We lost over 150  people in that short span in February when we saw temperatures in Texas  that we had never imagined. People literally froze in their beds. One  comes to mind that is so emotional: An 11-year-old boy froze in his bed  in February 2021.   Critically, the bill would provide at least $100 million for  broadband access in a State where 14 percent of households don't have  an internet subscription, and 4 percent of Texans have no broadband  infrastructure at all.   My view is that we cannot simply go for one versus the other. Let me  just tell you about the Build Back Better $3.5 trillion bill.   It will provide childcare to help our workforce and contribute to the  economy where that is needed. Therefore, the plan supports families in  need of childcare, providing access to safe, reliable, high-quality  childcare, delivered by well-trained childcare providers.   As it relates to education, we will be productive and having our  children have high-quality education. That is why this plan makes  necessary investments to increase quality education by 4 years for all  students at no cost to hardworking parents. The plan will provide 2  years of free pre-K and 2 years of free community college. We are  investing in people.    In regard to healthcare, too many Americans are forced to choose  between medical care and putting food on the table. The plan expands  access to quality, affordable healthcare by strengthening the Medicare,  Medicaid, and Affordable Care marketplace programs that millions of  Americans rely on. But now more could be added, in addition to  providing dental, hearing, and vision benefits. That is when we go it  together. Not I's and me's, but we, us together.   Paid leave that can help us get on our feet when we are having issues  with family and healthcare.   Tackling the climate crisis. We have seen the ravages of hurricanes.  We have seen Hurricane Ida--devastation that is unspeakable,  electricity that people do not have, a million people without  electricity. The climate crisis and climate change are here. It is  crucial that we begin to invest in a plan that empowers comprehensive  action to build an equitable, clean energy economy with historic  investments to transform and modernize the electricity sector. It is  imperative that we do that.   We must take a moment to pause and to recognize that any positive  steps on climate will be because of us, because of the most powerful  lawmaking body in the Nation, taking a moment to pause and  realistically confronting it, providing the research dollars, working  with universities, such as the University of Houston Energy Institute  and Texas Southern University, looking at ways to provide the best  approach to a green approach and climate response as well as providing  the necessary research on new kinds of energy. That is what we need to  do.   Just for a moment, may I step back to the point about healthcare. We  know it all too well in Houston. We were the poster child in Texas for  the most uninsured persons when the Affordable Care Act was  implemented. Six million people, 25 percent of the State of Texas, were  uninsured. We still do not have access to healthcare as we should.   Then to add this horrific burden and insult to the women of Texas, to  write the most heinous bill that would, in fact, disallow a woman's  access to healthcare, this horrible bill that would have a bounty  hunter that would seek to follow you in the midst of you getting good  healthcare. I think this is clearly an unfortunate set of circumstances  that we should correct.   Healthcare, your own personal decision with your provider, your  faith, and your family, choices that no one wants to make, yet this  State law was put in place to create a vigilante community to attack  women and those that might help them provide access to healthcare. That  is what it is, access to healthcare, a decision that no one offers to  make lightly. But here we are, a vigilante being enticed by $10,000-- gossip, spying, standing outside dorm rooms, watching Uber cars,  standing in front of doctors' offices, standing in front of  organizations like Planned Parenthood that deal with healthcare for  women, and just plain providing a sense of intimidation and fear.   That brings me to the legislation that we hope that we will see  passing, H.R. 5226, Preventing Vigilante Stalking that Stops Women's  Access to Healthcare and Abortion Rights Act of 2021. I hope my  colleagues will join me in a simple bill that simply says you don't  have the right to stalk a woman who is seeking healthcare. It may be  that she is going for a mammogram. You don't know. But by creating this  [[Page H4548]]  atmosphere of money being given to a whole industry of people, ne'er- do-wells and others, some with good intentions in their mind but  seeking to make profit on someone else's pain, that is unacceptable. I  hope my colleagues will join me in that legislation.   Healthcare is a right, and we should give that to families, to women,  to men, to children, and to seniors. That is what building America back  better will do.   Affordable housing, helping homeless persons, tax cuts for families  and workers, I am so grateful. And I want everybody to know how  Democrats worked so hard for the child tax credit--excuse me, let me  correct that--the child tax cut. In fact, as I hear it, my  constituents, your constituents, their constituents, are receiving  those child tax cuts right now. Many people are making ends meet,  helping their children get into school.   That is what Democrats do, and that is what this bill is going to  do--research, development, and innovation on good, forward-thinking  infrastructure.   Working with HBCUs, helping them be historically relevant but also  helping them to be stronger in terms of their infrastructure. I support  that and thank one of our colleagues, Congresswoman Alma Adams, who has  been a leader on making sure our HBCUs are front and center, are  surviving. These are our historic colleges founded in the 1800s.                                time  2000    Immigration, of course, is a very important issue, and I might say,  another issue that we worked on in the Judiciary Committee with our  allotment of $107 billion, and that is, of course, community violence  intervention. We put in $2.5 billion on community violence  intervention. And that of course was $107 billion, $107.5 billion in  Judiciary. Part of that, of course, was to deal with the issue of  community violence intervention.   So you can see there is no time to waste. There is no time to delay.  There is only time to work hard on getting this legislation passed. We  must do it as an INVEST Act, we must do it as a budget reconciliation,  or the Build Back Better Act of 2021, the better name. We must do it  together.   The Congressional Black Caucus stands to be able to say, ``No more  Hurricane Harveys,'' but more, work with communities, rebuilding  streets, historic preservation, and making a difference. That is what  historic infrastructure investment can do, and that is what we in the  Congressional Black Caucus stand for.   I look forward to us continuing our discussion. Madam Speaker, I take  the opportunity at this point in the name of unity, reconciliation, a  new pathway for transformational government, passing of the INVEST Act,  passing of the Build Back Better Act, and making sure that we have  voting rights, that we give women the right to choose, that we pass  H.R. 40, the commission to study slavery and develop reparation  proposals. A long agenda. I know that we can do this in the spirit of  unity.   Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Congressional Black Caucus, I yield  back the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary,  on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, and the Congressional Black  Caucus, I am pleased to co-anchor this Congressional Black Caucus  Special Order with my colleague, the distinguished gentleman from New  York, Congressman Ritchie Torres.   I thank the Chair of the CBC, Congresswoman Beatty of Ohio, for  organizing this Special Order to discuss the reasons why the CBC strong  supports the Build Back Better Agenda conceived and advanced by  President Biden and House Democrats to support visionary and  transformative investments in the health, well-being, and financial  security of America's workers and families.   Over the next hour, several of our colleagues will share their  perspectives on why it is essential that we ``go big'' in building back  better to our nation and all of its people have the opportunities and  resources to compete and win in the changing global economy of the 21st  century.   Madam Speaker, it is often said that the federal budget is an  expression of the nation's values and the investments made to Build  America Back Better are a clear declaration of congressional Democrats'  commitment to ensuring that our government, our economy, and our  systems work For The People.   Madam Speaker, these long-overdue investments in America's future  will be felt in every corner of the country and across every sector of  American life, building on the success of the American Rescue Plan,  accommodating historic infrastructure investments in the legislative  pipeline, and addressing longstanding deficits in our communities by  ending an era of chronic underinvestment so we can emerge from our  current crises a stronger, more equitable nation.   Should our friends across the aisle join us in this endeavor, it  would send a powerful signal to the American people if our colleagues  across the aisle would join us in this effort because nothing would  better show them that their elected representatives can set  partisanship aside and put America first.   And that bipartisan achievement would portend success for similar  initiatives in the area of strengthening the infrastructure of  democracy in which every American has a vital interest, national and  homeland security, and criminal justice and immigration reform.   I would urge my Republican colleagues to heed the words of Republican  Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia who said colorfully several  months ago:         At this point in time in this nation, we need to go big. We       need to quit counting the egg-sucking legs on the cows and       count the cows and just move. And move forward and move right       now.    The same sentiment was expressed more eloquently by Abraham Lincoln  in 1862 when he memorably wrote:         The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy       present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we       must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must       think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and       then we shall save our country.    Madam Speaker, the bipartisan action we took in February 2021 when we  passed the American Rescue Plan was a giant step in the right  direction, but it was a targeted response to the immediate and urgent  public health and economic crises; it was not a long-term solution to  many of the pressing challenges facing our nation that have built up  over decades of disinvestment in our nation and its people in every  region and sector of the country.   We simply can no longer afford the costs of neglect and inaction; the  time to act is now.   The Build Back Better Plan makes the transformative investments that  we need to continue growing our economy, lower costs for working  families, and position the United States as a global leader in  innovation and the jobs of the future.   This $3.5 trillion gross investment will build on the successes of  the American Rescue Plan and set our nation on a path of fiscal  responsibility and broadly shared prosperity for generations to come.   The Build Back Better Plan will provide resources to improve our  education, health, and child care systems, invest in clean energy and  sustainability, address the housing crisis, and more; all while setting  America up to compete and win in the decades ahead.   The Build Back Better Plan is paid for by ensuring that the wealthy  and big corporations are paying their fair share and Americans making  less than $400,000 a year will not see their taxes increase by a penny.   Let me repeat that: No American making less than $400,000 a year will  not see their taxes increase by a penny.   In sum, Madam Speaker, the investments made by the Build Back Better  Plan will expand opportunity for all and build an economy powered by  shared prosperity and inclusive growth.   No one is better prepared or more experienced to lead the American  renaissance that will be produced by the investments made by the Build  Back Better Plan than President Biden, the architect of the American  Rescue Plan and who as Vice-President during the Obama Administration  oversaw the implementation of the Recovery Act, which saved millions of  jobs and rescued our economy from the Great Recession the nation  inherited from a previous Republican administration.   And let us not forget that President Obama also placed his confidence  in his vice-president to oversee the rescue of the automotive industry,  which he did so well that the American car industry fully recovered its  status as the world leader.   Madam Speaker, let me briefly highlight some of the key investments  made by the Build Back Better Plan:                                  EDUCATION    The Plan will provide two years of free pre-K and two years of free  community college to ensure every student has the tools, resources, and  opportunity to succeed in life.   It will also invest in our teachers and institutions that serve  minority students and provide funding to give school buildings long- overdue infrastructure updates.   Children lead happier, healthier, and more productive lives when they  have had access to high-quality education and that is why the  [[Page H4549]]  Build Back Better Plan makes necessary investments to increase quality  education by four years for all students at no cost to hardworking  families.                                 HEALTH CARE    The Build Back Better Plan expands access to quality, affordable  health care by strengthening the Medicare, Medicaid, and Affordable  Care Act (ACA) Marketplace programs that millions of Americans already  rely on.   It includes a major new expansion of Medicare benefits, adding a  dental, hearing, and vision benefit to the program for the very first  time.   It strengthens the ACA by extending the enhanced Marketplace  subsidies that were included in the American Rescue Plan.   It also provides an affordable coverage option for the more than two  million Americans living in states that have not expanded Medicaid  under the ACA and do not earn enough to qualify for Marketplace  subsidies.   The Build Back Better Plan's investment in home- and community-based  services will increase access to critical services and create new and  better-paying jobs for care providers.   When the Build Back Better Plan is fully implemented soon gone will  be the terrible old days when too many Americans are forced to choose  between medical care and putting food on the table or affording other  necessities.                                  CHILD CARE    The Build Back Better Plan supports families in need of child care by  providing access to safe, reliable, and high-quality care delivered by  a well-trained child care workforce.   This is important because our nation is strongest when everyone can  join the workforce and contribute to the economy.   That is why this investment is vital to so many millions of-- especially women--who are often forced to choose between working to  support their family or caring for their family.                                  PAID LEAVE    Madam Speaker, the United States is the richest nation in the world  but one of the few modern democracies that lacks a paid leave program.   The Build Back Better Plan remedies this shameful failing by creating  a national, comprehensive paid family and medical leave program,  providing direct support to workers and families.   This crucial investment will allow workers to take the time they need  to bond with a new child, care for their own serious illness, or care  for a seriously ill loved one without risking needed income or  employment.                              AFFORDABLE HOUSING    In the area of housing, the Build Back Better Plan makes investments  to ensure that Americans have access to safe and affordable housing by  providing resources to increase housing vouchers and funding for tribal  housing.   It also supports investments in programs that will help address our  nation's housing crisis by increasing the supply of affordable homes  for those in need and investing in historically underserved communities  and those that have been previously left behind.                           TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE    The Build Back Better Plan will spur and empower comprehensive action  to build an equitable clean energy economy with historic investments to  transform and modernize the electricity sector, lower energy costs for  Americans, improve air quality and public health, create good-paying  jobs, and strengthen U.S. competitiveness--all while putting our  country on the pathway to 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2035.   The Build Back Better Plan extends and expands clean energy tax  credits and supports clean electricity performance payments so  utilities can accelerate progress toward a clean electric grid at no  added cost to consumers.   The Build Back Better Plan invests in clean energy, efficiency,  electrification, and climate justice through grants, consumer rebates,  and federal procurement of clean power and sustainable materials, and  by incentivizing private sector development and investment.   Another exciting aspect of the Build Back Better Plan, Madam Speaker,  is that it will drive economic opportunities, environmental  conservation, and climate resilience--especially in underserved and  disadvantaged communities--including through a new Civilian Climate  Corps.             RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND INNOVATION INFRASTRUCTURE    Madam Speaker, advances in science, technology, and manufacturing are  creating the industries and jobs of the future, and we must ensure that  they are created here.   That is why the Build Back Better Plan invests in America's ingenuity  and competitiveness by revitalizing state-of-the-art laboratory  facilities and research across the nation, including at historically  black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and other minority-serving  institutions (MSIs), through new regional innovation hubs, and through  federal science agencies.   The Build Back Better Plan will reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing by  supporting supply chain resilience and modernization, Manufacturing USA  institutes, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, and facilities and  research at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, all of  which will strengthen America's competitiveness in the global economy.                                 IMMIGRATION    Madam Speaker, as virtually every respected study has concluded,  providing a pathway to lawful permanent resident (LPR) status for  Dreamers, recipients of Temporary Protected Status (TPS), farmworkers,  and essential workers will be a boon for our economy.   This Plan allows for investments to provide a pathway to LPR status  for these immigrant communities.   Madam Speaker, immigrants eligible for such protection are an  integral part of Texas's social fabric.   Texas is home to 386,300 immigrants who are eligible for protection,  112,000 of whom reside in Harris County.   These individuals live with 845,300 family members and among those  family members, 178,700 are U.S.-born citizen children.   These persons in Texas who are eligible for protection under the bill  arrived in the United States at the average age of 8 and on average  have lived in the United States since 1996.   They own 43,500 homes in Texas and pay $340,500,000 in annual  mortgage payments and contribute $2,234,800,000 in federal taxes and  $1,265,200,000 in state and local taxes each year.   Annually, these households generate $10,519,000,000 in spending power  in Texas and help power the national economy.                      TAX CUTS FOR FAMILIES AND WORKERS    The expansion of the Child Tax Credit (CTC) enacted in the American  Rescue Plan has already benefitted nearly 66 million children, put  money in the pockets of millions of hard-working parents and guardians,  and is expected to help cut child poverty by more than half.   The Build Back Better Plan not only extends this meaningful tax cut,  but it also extends the expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and  the expanded Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, which help families  make ends meet and put food on the table, reduce child poverty, and  lessen the burden on hard-working Americans so they can provide a  better future for America's children.                      REINING IN PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS    The Build Back Better Plan also achieves savings from following  through on President Biden's call to give Medicare the power to  negotiate lower prescription drug prices, saving money for patients as  well as the federal government.   Madam Speaker, we have before us a once in a century opportunity to  make gigantic progress in making ours a more perfect union, and to do  it in a single bound with enactment of the Build Back Better Plan, the  most transformative legislation passed by this Congress since the Great  Society and the New Deal.
