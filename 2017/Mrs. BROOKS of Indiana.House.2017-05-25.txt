 Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of  H.R. 1973, Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act.   Since my time as U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Indiana, I  have been committed to battling child exploitation and abuse.   Last year, I was shocked, along with much of the country, when The  Indianapolis Star published an investigative piece that exposed  troubling allegations of sexual abuse at USA Gymnastics programs across  the country.   According to their report, over the last 20 years, at least 368 young  people, most Olympic hopefuls, were the victims of sexual abuse at the  hands they trusted--coaches, trainers, doctors, and other adults  associated with USA Gymnastics. They reported the abuse to USA  Gymnastics, but, unfortunately, USA Gymnastics failed, in many cases,  to report those allegations of abuse to law enforcement authorities.   The article shed light on their stories and inspired the legislation  that is before us today. According to more than 5,600 pages of USA  Gymnastics records, released by The Indy Star, some of the 54 coaches,  who had been accused of sexual abuse by young athletes in their care,  weren't banned from gymnastics until years after their history of abuse  had been reported to and kept in complaint files by USA Gymnastics.   One USA Gymnastics doctor already referenced, Dr. Nassar, stands  accused of having abused young women and girls for more than 20 years.  More than 100 women have come forward today to share their stories of  abuse at his hands.   I understand how challenging it is to share painful stories of sexual  abuse, and I am proud of these brave gymnasts who shared their stories:  stories that never should have happened, and stories that went  inexcusably unanswered.   Their stories demand our action and our attention, not only to  provide victims with the justice denied to them for so long but also to  protect future generations of Olympic hopefuls.   I want to acknowledge the work of Senator Feinstein of California,  who is leading this bill in the Senate, and my colleagues in the  bipartisan Women's Caucus, specifically Representative Frankel of  Florida. I want to commend the chair and the ranking member of the  Judiciary Committee, and other members of the committee, for taking the  lead in protecting young victims from sexual abuse. Our legislation is  an important step forward toward protecting these young athletes.   It addresses that dangerous silence that, as The Indy Star  investigative piece showed, plagued USA Gymnastics and other governing  bodies of our Olympic sports--a silence that led to more girls being  abused, hurt, and harmful coaches, and others, who faced little or no  repercussions for their heinous actions.   The abuse should have been, first and foremost, prevented. The system  utterly failed when the abuse was not detected and not promptly  reported. The U.S. Olympic Committee failed and must do better, and I  commend them for their work now in working to do better.                                time  0930    Our bill makes sure that national governing bodies entrusted with the  health and well-being of athletes and future Olympians promptly report  allegations of sexual abuse and other abuse to law enforcement  authorities and implement much stronger policies and procedures to  prevent this from happening again.   Most importantly, I want to applaud the victims who shared their  story to protect others. I really thank them for their courage and for  changing the lives of not only young athletes today, but those in the  future.   I urge passage of the bill, and at this time, I thank the chairman  and, again, the ranking member for their leadership.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of  H.R. 1973--Protecting Young Victims From Sexual Abuse Act.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        May 25, 2017, on page H4578, the following appeared: Mr. Chair,  I rise today in strong support of      The online version has been corrected to read: Mrs. BROOKS of  Indiana.
