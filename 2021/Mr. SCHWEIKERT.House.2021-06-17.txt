 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Gohmert for yielding  to me.   For anyone who is not particularly familiar, we have sort of  mechanisms. Last night, we were running late, and once we hit 10  o'clock, we were shut off. And trying to do 21 boards in 8 minutes, I  apologize to those who have to try to take our words down.   But I wanted to just touch on a couple of things. One really quickly,  we were just blessed to have Secretary Yellen in front of Ways and  Means. I have tremendous respect for and have built a relationship with  her when she was Federal Reserve Chair.   I want us all to pay attention to a promise that the Secretary and  the President have made, and that is the new spending initiatives will  be covered by the new taxes, the new revenues. I assume that is an  honorable way to do it. We will fight over what the spending priorities  are, and none of these games where we are going to do 15 years of tax  hikes to cover 10 years of spending because, let's be honest, that is a  complete fraud on the American people.   But the best math that is coming out from a number of groups right  now is the tax hikes that are being proposed, the revenues, are only  going to cover maybe, if you are being optimistic, Mr. Speaker, on the  receipts, 50 percent of the new spending.   Yesterday, I think it is Penn Wharton that put out their model, I  guess last week, that the capital gains tax itself loses $33 billion  over the first 10 years. So, it is not scored to 15 years; it is 10.   But, Mr. Speaker, if you do what is called the basis, which is how  much is subject to the capital gains tax even though the perversity of  it is that a huge portion of that is actually inflation we are going to  tax, it would raise, in their model, $133 billion. The administration,  the Democrats, have said this will be 330. So, they are only hitting  about one-third of the revenues that have been promised from the  capital gains tax.   I really want to help the Democrats keep their promise that their new  $4 trillion proposed spending will be covered by their new receipts,  their new revenues. They have a really interesting math problem. Either  they are going to have to cut their spending substantially in half or  dramatically raise taxes on the American people.   We asked Secretary Yellen: Should we expect a value-added tax? Is a  VAT in our future?   The math is really ugly--we are going to talk about that in a second  here--to cover all these new spending initiatives plus just the  demographic curve that is already about to crush us, debtwise.   The answer was an interesting one. It is: Well, that is not part of  our current proposal.   For everyone who is interested in tax policy--and I accept that maybe  some of us are a little bit on the geek side--I am fascinated with the  tax on Medicare financing. Keep an ear out because the only way I think  the left is going to get these types of revenues is to actually go to  completely new revenue-raising, new tax regimes.   Let's talk about what I consider is the greatest fragility of our  Nation's future. It turns out it is not Republican or Democrat policy.  It is demographics.   What is the fastest growing demographic in the United States? It is  getting old. We are graying very, very fast. It is baby boomers.   When you look at this chart--and we did this last night, but we did  it sort of caffeinated, very fast--take the next 30 years. This is  without all the new spending that has been proposed this year by the  new administration. This is our baseline, $101 trillion of debt in 30  years at today's dollars. This is inflation-adjusted dollars, 67  percent.    Functionally, $68 trillion of debt is just Medicare. Only about $3  trillion is the rest of government, so it is Medicare, then Social  Security.   If you believe, Mr. Speaker, like I do, that we have an absolute  moral obligation to keep our promises to those folks who have paid into  Social Security and Medicare, then what are we going to do to keep that  promise?   The reality of it is that this is what buries us as a country. It is  our demographics and the promises that are dramatically unfunded.  Remember, Mr. Speaker, it is only maybe 4 years or so that the Medicare  trust fund--which is only part A, which is the hospital portion--that  trust fund is gone.   Part B is actually seeing a doctor. Part C is managed care. That has  its own little, in some ways, financial benefits. And D is drugs. Parts  B and D are 100 percent out of the general fund. They don't have trust  funds.   This is absolutely critical. This will drive all government policy.  If you are someone who wants money for education, if you are someone  who wants money for the environment or our military, then the fact of  the matter is it is Medicare that consumes us.  [[Page H2917]]    One of my great frustrations is when you look at the math of how much  is spending, Mr. Speaker, and then the financing of that spending, you  get a sense that, as Republicans, we have this bad habit. We will go  and say: Well, we will balance the budget through waste and fraud.   Democrats will go and say: Well, we are going to balance it by  nationalizing healthcare, Medicare for All.   None of those are real. We are not telling the truth.   Let's walk through just a couple of things that are in my craw right  now. This is just one portion of the left's bill called H.R. 3. From a  conceptual standpoint, it is an honest debate of what are we going to  do about prescription drug costs.   The methodology, though, Mr. Speaker, if you actually read the  research, in a decade, it is killing people and costing more because we  are on the cusp of a time of miracles.   This is really important to get our heads around. We have all heard  about this concept of mRNA. We have talked about it for 20-plus years.  Years ago, I used to come to this mike and talk about this concept of  bio-foundry.   Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is, we can take a snippet of your  DNA and a snippet of your cancer, your disease, or your virus, and it  would take weeks. And for the CAR-T therapy for cancer, it was $350,000  just to get you your shot, but it was curing people. We just moved up  10 years in technology.   That is one of the amazing things Operation Warp Speed. It is  actually one of the few positive things I can say that came out of this  pandemic is it is here.   Look up Tesla and mRNA, Mr. Speaker. You find out that all sorts of  very disruptive companies are investing in these little bio-foundries.   We are on the edge of curing HIV, sickle cell anemia. We now have a  cure for hemophilia. And we are also going to cure all sorts of  cancers. There are some amazing things happening. The problem is they  are expensive, Mr. Speaker. But they cure you.   H.R. 3 does something that I think is fairly dark and fairly  sinister, and we need our brothers and sisters on the Democrat side to  be honest with constituents, and that is something called reference  pricing. If a quality year is bought through a drug, but it costs more  than, in this case, $37,000 in Great Britain, Mr. Speaker, you don't  get it.   H.R. 3 does this where they take a basket of some of these countries  and say that we are going to use their cap. So, you are prepared to  turn to your constituent and say: Oh, that drug is $40,000. Yes, it  gives you that quality year, but it is over our cap, so we are not  going to provide you that pharmaceutical.   By doing that, we just destroyed small, disruptive bio-foundry pharma  that is curing people. We are going to subject our population to say  that the misery you have today is the misery you are going to have  tomorrow, Mr. Speaker, because we are going to shut down the  disruption. We are going to protect--here is the sinister thing that  healthcare economists talk about. The Democrats' H.R. 3 actually  protects Big Pharma because the industry now becomes you just adjust  your current patent, and that is how you make a living, Mr. Speaker.   But the ones that nip their heels that cure things, it is like the  hepatitis C we cure now. Those cures don't come because we have just  wiped out the income stream.   We need to rethink. If Republicans and Democrats have a common goal  that we need to look at pharmaceutical costs, then destroying the  pipeline that cures people and that ends the misery is really dark.    Mr. Speaker, we Republicans have our sins. How many of us will get  behind a microphone and talk about price transparency? Price  transparency is a really good thing, but it has almost no real effect  on the price of healthcare. The best academic studies we have been able  to find in our office is 0.1 to 0.7 percent.   My point is really simple here. The ACA, ObamaCare, was a financing  bill. It was who got subsidized and who had to pay. Our Republican  alternative was a financing bill. It was who had to pay and who got  subsidized. Medicare for All is a financing bill.   When are we going to have the really tougher discussion of what we  pay? Let's disrupt the price of healthcare through technology.   How many of us went to Blockbuster Video last weekend? We don't  because now we hit a button called Netflix and all sorts of other  things. We allow disruption to happen in other parts of our healthcare,  but we have built so many regulatory barriers and so many licensing  barriers, crazy things that would disrupt healthcare.   One of my grand proposals--and this one needs to be Republicans and  Democrats coming together--that $68 trillion over the next 30 years in  just Medicare spending, that is a substantial driver for U.S. sovereign  debt. Thirty-one percent of it is just diabetes.   It turns out, Mr. Speaker, if you and I can have a revolution in  ending the misery of diabetes, it is also the single biggest initiative  you can have to U.S. sovereign debt.   It is time Republicans and Democrats come together and do an  Operation Warp Speed on diabetes. Yes, there is really neat research  that is on the cusp of almost curatives for type 1, the autoimmune  pancreatic cells. But the political side is going to be really tough  for all of us because we are going to have to talk about type 2, which  has a substantial lifestyle component in it. It needs a discussion of  what we do in nutrition support as a country and what we do in our farm  bill as a country.   Mr. Speaker, if we care about people, if we really are going to come  here and give speeches about how minority communities and my Native  American communities from Arizona had such horrible outcomes during  COVID, are you willing to look at the comorbidities that were there  before COVID? It is diabetes.                                time  1230    And it turns out, spending money on this management curative--and I  really want curative--turns out to be one of the most powerful things  you and I could ever do for U.S. sovereign debt going forward. It is 31  percent of just Medicare spending, and the numbers we are still working  on for Medicaid and other things.   So part of my other proposal is there are things we could do almost  overnight that have incredible impacts on the cost of healthcare in  this country; and here is one that I beg of us to start getting in our  lexicon.   Sixteen percent of the healthcare spending this year, over half a  trillion dollars, just this year, will be people not taking their meds  or taking them incorrectly. You have hypertension, you don't take your  meds, you have a stroke. You have high cholesterol, you don't take your  meds--and those things are cheap and inexpensive. Grandma is forgetful,  or we get busy in our lives.   And it turns out there are things where the pill top talks to your  phone. It talks to you. There are other ones where it dispenses the  pharmaceuticals to you.   It turns out the technology of getting people to take their  pharmaceuticals properly, if we would understand its impact, that is 16  percent of U.S. healthcare spending is just not taking our  pharmaceuticals properly. That is a half a trillion dollars.   Think about what you could do with a half a trillion dollars a year-- not over 10, not over 15; a year--and how much less misery you would  have in this country by people having strokes, getting sick.   This is not a revolution of trying to crush pharma or go after drug  prices. It is actually taking a look and using this crazy thing we  call, oh, yeah, math, and a calculator, and also technology.   And, yes, it doesn't work necessarily in our political lexicon. It is  a little harder to campaign on, but it happens to be factual.   The other thing I am going to beg of us--and Congressman Gohmert, I  appreciate him yielding to me. So I promise I will only do one or two  more boards.   I need us to think revolutionary. Before the pandemic, a Democratic  colleague,   Mike Thompson, from California, a good guy, has worked  with me on telemedicine. It was a piece of legislation that  substantially was going to go nowhere because there were lots and lots  and lots and lots of lobbyists who hated it because it disrupts the  money.   But when the pandemic hit, our telemedicine bill became law. It  expires  [[Page H2918]]  when they declare the pandemic over. The expansion of reimbursement and  access to telemedicine goes away. We need to fix that.   But we also now need to understand what is telemedicine. Telemedicine  is the thing you can wear on your wrist; the thing you can wear on your  chest; the thing you blow into.   The technology is here to crash the price of healthcare. And all the  skeptics who attacked telemedicine before the pandemic, oh Grandma's  not going to be able to use; they don't know how to work FaceTime; no  one is going to want to make a phone call to a doctor or a healthcare  professional.   Turns out they were wrong. We have the last 18 months of proof. The  satisfaction rates are off the chart. A, we need to continue it, but we  need to expand the definition.   And then the other things the pandemic has brought us is things we  never thought of.   How about a little home kit?   These are available today. Actually, you can get them sent to your  house in a day. Blow into it. It tells you if you have COVID-19.   Well, if that exists for COVID, what would happen if I turned to you  and said, turns out we have the technology today where you can have a  medical lab in your medicine cabinet. You blow into it, it tells you if  you even have cancer cells or a virus or bacteria. It exists today.   We, as a body, need to legalize the disruptive technologies that  allow us to disrupt the price of healthcare if we are going to save  Medicare, save the country from the crushing debt. And, yes, we are  going to annoy a lot of incumbent investors and a lot of incumbent  businesses, but it is the right and moral thing to do.   We have a society that has become a country of oligopolies, and  Congress has become a protection racket. We protect incumbents; not  incumbent elected officials, incumbent business models.   Yet the disruption of the technology that is here today crushes the  misery of so many of our brothers and sisters out there who have  chronic conditions, that get sick.   We can crash the price of healthcare. We can make us healthier as a  society. We can take on, in that same breath, the crushing debt that is  here. And it is demographic. It is coming. No matter how many speeches  we give pretending we have a way around it, the only way around it is  we have got to change the actual price of healthcare.   I beg of us, we need to think differently because this place, often  our policy sets, sort of sounds like it is still the 1990s.    Oh, I would love to yield.    I have actually been blessed to spend lots of time  with Professor Laffer and, actually, a couple of other folks who also  have Nobel Prizes in economics. They tolerate me.   Gilder, I consider a personal friend, if you really want to geek out.   First off, you have a conceptual problem and the left doesn't--we  have got to work with them to first admit we tax income. Property taxes  are really the only things we tax wealth. We tax your real estate  wealth.   So the leaked IRS data, which is a real problem if you want  confidence in a tax system that, once again, the IRS is back to being  weaponized. If you want to tax wealth, that is a different tax system,  and there are all sorts of games you can play with that.   You could take your wealth and say, all right, here is what I am  going to do. I am not going to take an income. I am going to borrow  from it.   So how do you tax it?   You have to conceptualize very, very different.   We also--we actually have the math, even though it may not happen in  the fiscal year you want it to. The ultrawealthy give away most of  their wealth. That has been a tradition in this country, particularly  for about a century and a half.   A tax system to work--and the gentleman and I have actually had a  side conversation about this. You have to find what is the most--or the  least disruptive tax that maximizes revenue, but also maximizes  economic expansion. So we are already seeing some data that the  Democrats' proposal on capital gains tax, actually, without changing  the basis, actually raises substantially less revenues.   Now how is that possible?   It is because you stop engaging in those economic activities.   So somewhere there is a sweet spot that maximizes revenues, but also  then maximizes economic activity. And I have an absolute fixation that  2018, 2019 were miracle years economically for the working poor in this  country. It is 2 years where, actually, income inequality genuinely  shrank; the broad based nature of the working poor getting dramatically  less poor.   That shouldn't be a partisan fight. It should be the bipartisan goal.   And the rich got richer, but not as fast as the poor got less poor.  And that is back to, in a weird way, a long answer to your question.   We need to have an honest debate of what maximizes revenues while  minimizing economic damage. And right now, just throwing out numbers,  and then throwing out fake--and I am being a little brutal on that-- fake models from the administration saying we are going to raise $4  trillion, we are going to cover all of our new spending, when all of  the other models--and very soon joint tax will score it and we will see  what the reality is.   But everyone it is scoring right now, the Dems are only getting about  half the revenues. And we have already seen the first analysis of the  corporate tax hike. It unemploys 1 million Americans in the first 24  months.    That didn't lose their jobs. And the harder part of  the scoring is--and this was one of the miracles of 2018 and 2019--the  Democrats repeatedly attacked the tax reforms from the end of 2017 and  the regulatory reforms.   But there were so many people working, and there was such vitality in  the economy that Medicare part A, the trust fund, grew in years. Social  Security grew in years because there were so many people paying their  payroll tax.   They didn't really pay income tax because they were part of the  population that had been removed from having to pay income tax because  we changed--but it turns out, if you actually, truly believe we have a  societal obligation to keep our promises, to keep Social Security, to  keep Medicare vibrant, it turns out you need an incredibly vibrant  economy for people to be working. You can do that also by a rational  tax policy instead of a punishing one.    I am sorry; it is a long answer, but it actually  has----
