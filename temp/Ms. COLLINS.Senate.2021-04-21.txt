 Mr. President. I rise today to commemorate the 250th  anniversary of the Town of Vassalboro, ME. Vassalboro was built with a  spirit of determination and resiliency that still guides the community  today, and this is a time to celebrate the generations of hard-working  and caring people who have made it such a wonderful place to live,  work, and raise families.   The year of Vassalboro's incorporation, 1771, was but one milestone  in a long journey of progress. For thousands of years, the land along  the great Kennebec River was the home of the Abenaki Tribe, who hunted,  fished, and tilled the fertile soil. The reverence the Abenaki had for  the natural beauty and resources of the region is upheld by the people  of Vassalboro today.   Vassalboro's roots run deep into American history. It originally was  part of the lands granted to the Pilgrims of the Plymouth Colony in the  1600s. Later, the town became home to a large settlement of Quakers and  a center of the movement to abolish slavery. The Society of Friends  continues to have a positive presence in the town today. The statue of  the Union soldier in Monument Park stands in silent tribute to the many  patriots who have stepped forward to serve the cause of freedom.   With the mighty Kennebec River providing power, Vassalboro was home  to many lumber, grain, and textile mills. Built in 1850, the Olde Mill  on Main Street was one of the largest mills in New England and world  famous for the quality of the cashmere it produced. The wealth produced  by hard work and determination was invested in schools and churches to  create a true community.   Today, visitors and residents alike enjoy Vassalboro's quiet parks,  beautiful historic buildings, and exciting outdoor recreation  opportunities. The energy and planning that are going into the town's  250th anniversary celebration demonstrate the pride townspeople have in  their town.   Mr. President, Vassalboro's 250th anniversary is not merely about the  passing of time, it is about human accomplishment. We celebrate the  people who, for longer than America has been a nation, have pulled  together, cared for one another, and built a great community. Thanks to  those who came before, Vassalboro, ME, has a wonderful history. Thanks  to those there today, it has a bright future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce two bipartisan bills  that would help improve Americans' retirement security. Together, these  bills would make it easier for more small employers to offer retirement  plans and encourage employees to save more for their retirement.  [[Page S2126]]    There are many reasons why American households struggle to save for  retirement, including the shift away from employer-based ``defined  benefit'' plans and rising health care and long-term care costs. Longer  life spans increase the risk of outliving retirement savings. The  economic and health impacts of the COVID-19 crisis may also pose a  threat to retirement security.   Increasing access to employer-sponsored retirement plans is one way  to help improve the financial security of many Americans. According to  the Georgetown University Center for Retirement Initiatives, nationwide  only about 54 percent of private sector workers had access to a  retirement plan through their employer in 2020. In Maine, the  percentage is a bit higher; approximately 59 percent of private sector  employees had access to a retirement plan at work. But that still  leaves more than 200,000 employees without access to a plan.   In December 2019, provisions from my bipartisan Retirement Security  Act were signed into law as part of the Setting Every Community Up for  Retirement Enhancement or ``SECURE'' Act. These provisions will help to  expand access to employer-provided retirement plans by reducing their  cost and complexity, especially for small businesses. This law  represents an important step forward, but more is needed.   Congress established SIMPLE (Savings Incentive Match Plan for  Employees) retirement plans in 1996 to encourage small businesses to  provide their employees with retirement plans. These plans are less  costly and easier to navigate than traditional 401(k) plans and provide  an alternative approach for employers to help their employees save for  retirement.   The SIMPLE Plan Modernization Act, which I am introducing today with  my colleague, Senator Mark Warner, would provide greater flexibility  and access to employees and employers seeking to save for retirement by  using SIMPLE plans.   This legislation would expand access to SIMPLE plans by increasing  the contribution limit for most small businesses. In addition, the bill  includes incentives to encourage small businesses to move from a SIMPLE  plan to a 401(k) plan when they are able to make this change.   Like many Americans, spouses of active duty service members often  face challenges when it comes to saving for retirement. Military  spouses also face one hurdle that many others do not: frequent moves  and changes in employment.   According to the Department of Defense, about one-third of military  service members experience a permanent change of station move every  year. When a service member moves, their spouse usually relocates with  them. The military spouse may face periods of unemployment, where they  are not able to participate in an employer-sponsored retirement plan.  When they do find a new job, they often work part-time, despite seeking  full-time work, or are only able to spend a few years with their  employer before moving again. These factors often preclude them from  being eligible to receive employer contributions to their retirement  plan or from being fully vested in their plan.   The second bill I am introducing today focuses on helping to address  this need by providing a tax credit to small employers who provide  military spouses with accelerated eligibility for retirement plan  participation, employer contributions, and vesting.   In particular, the Military Spouses Retirement Security Act, which I  am introducing with my colleague Senator Maggie Hassan, would make  small employers--those with up to 100 employees--eligible for a tax  credit of up to $500 per year per military spouse. The credit would be  available for three years per military spouse. The amount of the credit  would be equal to $200 per military spouse, plus 100 percent of all  employer contributions for that spouse, up to $300.   To receive the tax credit, small employers must make a military  spouse immediately eligible for retirement plan participation within  two months of hire. Upon plan eligibility, a military spouse must be  eligible for any matching or non-elective contribution available to a  similarly situated employee with at least two years of service, and  must be 100 percent immediately vested in all employer contributions.   In light of the positive effects these bills would have on  strengthening retirement security for millions of Americans, I urge my  colleagues to support the SIMPLE Plan Modernization Act and the  Military Spouses Retirement Security Act.   Thank you, Mr. President.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Portman):   S. 1287.
