 Madam President, last week the Congress passed and  tomorrow the President will sign into law the American Rescue Plan Act  of 2021, which includes $10 billion to respond to COVID-19  internationally. While this is a tiny fraction of the $1.9 trillion in  the Rescue Plan, it is critically necessary. As long as the virus  continues to spread and mutate into more transmissible and deadlier  variants in other countries, it will remain a threat to Americans.   Within that amount, $580 million is included to support the U.N.  Global Humanitarian Response Plan for COVID-19 through U.S. voluntary  contributions to international organizations, including the World  Health Organization, the World Food Programme, UNICEF, the U.N. High  Commissioner for Refugees, and other international organizations.   UNICEF offers critical operations and technical assistance to  ministries of health and education around the world as countries  continue to adapt their health and education activities to meet COVID- 19 protocols. UNICEF also focuses on strengthening risk communication  and community engagement to ensure that women, children, and their  families know how to prevent COVID-19; providing supplies to  communities and educational and health facilities to support the  prevention and treatment of COVID-19, including WASH supplies and  personal protective equipment; and ensuring that children and women  have continued access to basic healthcare, education, child protection,  and gender-based violence services, including ensuring access to  immunizations, prenatal and postnatal care, and HIV care in an  environment safe from infection by the virus.   It is obvious that UNICEF has a critical role to play in the  international COVID-19 response. The same can be said of the World Food  Programme, UNHCR, and WHO. I am pleased that Congress was able to  provide additional funding for these and other international  organizations to support their lifesaving work.
