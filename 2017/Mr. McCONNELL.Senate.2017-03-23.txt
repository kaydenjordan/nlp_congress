 Mr. President, I would like to start by taking a  moment to offer sincere condolences to our friends in the United  Kingdom who lost loved ones in yesterday's horrific terror attack. Our  prayers are with those who were severely injured, as well, and we wish  them a swift and full recovery.   This act of terror occurred on the  1-year anniversary of the devastating attack in Brussels, and as Prime  Minister May pointed out, the location of the attack seems to be no  coincidence. ``The terrorist chose to strike at the heart of the [the  UK's] capital city,'' Prime Minister May said yesterday, ``where people  of all nationalities, religions and cultures come together to celebrate  the values of liberty, democracy and freedom of speech.''   I know I speak on behalf of my colleagues when I say that our  thoughts are also with those who were in Parliament at the time of the  attack, serving their country much in the same way that we do in this  Chamber every day.   Of course, I want to also acknowledge the law enforcement personnel  and first responders who courageously put their lives on the line for  their fellow citizens. We know that the capable security services of  the British, working in cooperation with our own, will continue to  investigate whether this was a radicalized individual actor or a  terrorist connected to an ISIL external operation.   Our friends face difficult days ahead as they begin to heal from this  senseless act, but as they do so, we want them to know that the United  States stands with them as a friend, as a cherished ally and as a  united partner against terror.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on the business before the Senate  today, recently a Washington Post article noted that Congress has  undertaken the ``most ambitious regulatory rollback since Reagan.''  Already, we passed 10 resolutions under the Congressional Review Act to  end Obama administration regulations that slow economic growth,  threaten jobs, and hold our country back. As one study estimates, our  action to overturn these regulations could save Americans nearly $4  billion and more than 4 million hours of paperwork.   This week, we have continued our regulatory relief efforts, and today  we will have an opportunity to send another to the President's desk.  This resolution would overturn a costly and confusing Federal  communications rule. The regulation in question makes the internet an  uneven playing field, increases complexity, discourages competition,  innovation, and infrastructure investment. President Obama's own legal  mentor has expressed serious doubts about the rule's constitutionality  under the First Amendment.   Senator Flake has long been a leader on tackling this issue. Last  year he voiced his worries about the regulations in a letter to the FCC  and held a hearing regarding the legality of such regulations. Now he  has sponsored a CRA resolution that will allow us to overturn the  regulations and protect consumers. As Senator Flake has pointed out:         The FCC's midnight regulation does nothing to protect       consumer privacy. It is unnecessary, confusing and adds yet       another innovation-stifling regulation to the internet.    That is why he proposed this CRA resolution, which he has explained  ``empowers consumers to make informed choices on if and how their data  can be shared.''   I thank my friend from Arizona for taking on this important issue and  putting forth legislation to address it. I look forward to the Senate  passing it soon.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week Supreme Court nominee Judge  [[Page S1942]]  Neil Gorsuch came before the Senate Judiciary Committee for his  confirmation hearing. Senators from both sides had the opportunity to  ask him questions. Both they and the American people were able to learn  more about Judge Gorsuch, about the type of jurist he has been and will  continue to be, about his character and temperament, and about his  aptitude to serve on the Supreme Court.   His answers reflected what we have all come to find about the judge  over the past several weeks. He has sterling credentials and a  reputation as a fair and impartial jurist. He is also known to be a  gifted writer, who is smart, kind, humble, and independent.   As I mentioned yesterday, his impressive testimony has caught the  attention of publications, news outlets, and commentators from across  the country and across the political spectrum. In a panel discussion  just yesterday, an MSNBC commentator noted Judge Gorsuch's ``masterful  performance''--one that he called a ``tour de force.''   Another panelist and NBC correspondent had a complimentary view of  the nominee, as well, noting that ``in terms of character, in terms of  professionalism, [and in terms of] integrity, there wasn't, I would  argue, anything, or hardly anything there to criticize Gorsuch on.''   The Wall Street Journal noted that Gorsuch ``stressed his  independence'' throughout the hearing. The Detroit news echoed these  observations and has urged the Senate to confirm him. It editorialized  that ``[a]fter two days of often hostile hearings, Supreme Court  nominee Neil Gorsuch is proving himself an even-tempered, deeply  knowledgeable nominee who should be confirmed by the Senate.''   The paper also noted that Judge Gorsuch is ``[eminently] qualified''  and that he ``is coming across in the hearings as the very image of a  thoughtful jurist. He displayed an impressive depth of knowledge, and  admirable patience. And he's carefully followed past practice of  judicial nominees in refusing to say how he'd rule on specific  issues.''   His independence is really without question at this point. The  American Bar Association, which awarded Judge Gorsuch its highest  rating of unanimously ``well qualified,'' recently submitted testimony  to the Judiciary Committee. Here is what the Bar Association had to say  about Judge Gorsuch's independence:         Our evaluation process provided an excellent opportunity to       gain a glimpse at whether Judge Gorsuch is a judge who       ascribes to the concept of an independent judiciary. Based on       the writings, interviews, and analyses we scrutinized to       reach our rating, we discerned that Judge Gorsuch believes       strongly in the independence of the judicial branch of       government, and we predict that he will be a strong but       respectful voice in protecting it.    The ABA went on:         As one interviewee noted with alacrity, ``Judge Gorsuch has       `grit,' which he gets from being a multi-generation       Westerner.'' Another stated, ``He is dedicated to the       constitutional doctrine of separation of powers and to the       independence of the judiciary.'' Yet another observed, ``In       addition to his outstanding academic credentials and       brilliant mind, Judge Gorsuch's demeanor and written opinions       during his tenure on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals       demonstrate that he believes unwaveringly in the rule of law       and judicial independence. In my opinion, he is exceptionally       well qualified to serve as a justice of the Supreme Court of       the United States.'' We agree.    I certainly agree with that. This is from the American Bar  Association, an organization that the Democratic leader and former  Democratic chairman of the Judiciary Committee have deemed the gold  standard for evaluating nominees. In addition, the assistant Democratic  leader acknowledged yesterday that Judge Gorsuch is ``very gifted'' and  ``has a great background and service as judge.''   But despite the Judge's outstanding performance, his exceptional  background, and the extensive support he has received from people of  all political leanings, we know that some Senate Democrats will  continue trying to come up with any reason to delay the confirmation  process. It is not the first time we have seen our friends across the  aisle engage in obstructionist tactics. In fact, we just saw a historic  level of obstruction when it came to confirming the President's  Cabinet.   We know that our colleagues are under a great deal of pressure from  the far left. We know some of these groups are calling for them to  ``resist.'' We know that even more than 4 months after the election,  some on the far left simply refuse to accept the outcome of last year's  election.   Well, it is past time to move on from that mindset and return to the  serious business of governing. One way we can do so is by confirming  Judge Gorsuch as the next Supreme Court Justice without delay. He is a  proven jurist. He is an outstanding intellect. He has earned the  respect and admiration of so many--Democrats, Independents, and  Republicans alike. He is also unquestionably independent.   Today we will hear even more praise for Judge Gorsuch as witnesses  come before the Judiciary Committee. I urge my colleagues to show him  the fair consideration he deserves and, ultimately, to come together in  supporting his nomination in the days ahead.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today marks the seventh anniversary of  ObamaCare becoming law. In the years since, millions of Americans lost  their plans and their doctors. They saw the cost of their premiums and  deductibles soar. They watched their choices disappear as insurers were  forced out of the marketplace. Former President Bill Clinton called  ObamaCare the ``craziest thing in the world.'' He was right. It was a  direct attack on the middle class. These failed policies are affecting  real people every day. Americans expected the law to deliver on its  promises, but instead they have paid more and received less. ObamaCare  has been a flawed system from the start. Over the past 7 years, things  have gotten progressively worse.    Our Nation cannot continue on this trajectory as ObamaCare continues  to unravel at every level, leaving Americans to pick up the pieces. On  this seventh anniversary of ObamaCare's enactment, Americans deserve a  better way forward. Thankfully, we finally have a Congress and a  President who are committed to delivering much needed reform.   The legislation currently before the House will help bring relief. It  will repeal and replace ObamaCare, which is exactly what we promised  the American people we would do. Instead of forcing Americans to buy  something they may not want, like ObamaCare does, this bill gives  Americans the freedom to choose what type of coverage is right for  them.   I look forward to the House passing that bill soon, and we look  forward to taking it up in the Senate, where there will be a robust  amendment process. Then, I look forward to collaborating with my  colleagues to pass it. It is important, however, to remember that this  bill is only one part of a three-pronged strategy to bring relief. The  administration is already working to fix the damage 7 years of  ObamaCare has done to the health markets across the country, and we  will continue to consider further legislation in Congress to bring more  competition and reform.   It is time to move on from 7 years of ObamaCare's broken promises and  unyielding attacks on the middle class. The status quo is not an  option. So let's work together to get this done.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 12:15  p.m. today there be 10 minutes of debate, equally divided in the usual  form, remaining on S.J. Res. 34; further, that following the use or  yielding back of that time, the joint resolution be read a third time  and the Senate vote on the resolution with no intervening action or  debate; finally, notwithstanding rule XXII, following disposition of  the joint resolution, the Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture  on Executive Calendar No. 20, David Friedman to be Ambassador to  Israel.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, for the information of Senators, we  will have the cloture vote on this treaty on Monday night at 5:30 p.m.
