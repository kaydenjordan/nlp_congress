 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  providing me the opportunity to say some kind words about Danny Weiss.   I want to recognize Danny as a true model of a public servant. From  Riverdale, New York, he wasted no time coming to Washington and leaving  an impressive mark right here. For almost 28 years, he has provided  invaluable service to the House of Representatives.   As we have heard, we know firsthand that Danny has been very  effective in the House of Representatives because of his mastery of  complicated issues that we face as Members of Congress. As chief of  staff--first to Leader Pelosi and now to Speaker Pelosi--Danny has  given wise counsel to me and my staff and, as we have heard, to many  other Members on issues that arise from time to time that need special  attention that Danny always provided.   I would be remiss if I didn't note Danny's exemplary service to the  Education and Labor Committee, under George Miller. Sitting here a few  minutes ago, Danny asked me not to embarrass him--nice try.   We talked to George, and George informed me that early on he was on  the fence about hiring Danny, but over an Italian dinner with Danny's  mother, Cora Weiss, George was informed rather emphatically that her  son, Danny, would be a great hire and one of the best decisions that he  ever made. George believes that mother knows best, and the rest is  history. Thanks to Danny's mom, we have all been blessed with his  decades of public service to the House of Representatives.  [[Page H2675]]    Congratulations, Danny, on your years of service, and good luck in  your future endeavors.
