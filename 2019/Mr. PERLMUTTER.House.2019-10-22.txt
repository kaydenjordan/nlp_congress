 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 646 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 646         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 2513) to ensure that persons who form       corporations or limited liability companies in the United       States disclose the beneficial owners of those corporations       or limited liability companies, in order to prevent       wrongdoers from exploiting United States corporations and       limited liability companies for criminal gain, to assist law       enforcement in detecting, preventing, and punishing       terrorism, money laundering, and other misconduct involving       United States corporations and limited liability companies,       and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall       be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration       of the bill are waived.

The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill, as amended, and on any further amendment thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I  yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Woodall), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, the Rules Committee met last night and  reported a structured rule, House Resolution 646, providing for  consideration of H.R. 2513, the Corporate Transparency Act. The rule  self-executes Chairwoman Waters' manager's amendment and makes in order  five amendments. The rule provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided  and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Financial Services, and provides for one motion to  recommit.  [[Page H8308]]    Madam Speaker, I am pleased we are here today to provide for  consideration of this important, bipartisan legislation to help law  enforcement do their job and protect our national security. The lack of  transparency in parts of our financial system has created an  environment in which criminals, who should be shut out of the financial  system, can use anonymous shell companies to launder money, finance  terrorism, and engage in other illicit activities.   I want to applaud the work of Subcommittee on Investor Protection,  Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney for  her work over the last decade to understand these problems and develop  the solution we have in front of us this week.   The Corporate Transparency Act would require corporations and limited  liability companies to disclose their true beneficial owners to the  Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, at the time a company  is formed and in annual corporate filings thereafter. This beneficial  ownership information will be available to law enforcement so they can  learn who controls or financially benefits from the company and end the  current shell game used by bad actors.   There are many examples of how individuals have used shell companies  to hide their activities. For instance, there is one involving Viktor  Bout, otherwise known as the Merchant of Death, who used shell  companies to hide his illicit weapons trafficking. In another example,  a former Russian citizen moved $1.4 billion from Russia into 236  different U.S. bank accounts through the use of anonymous shell  companies.   This bill will be a game changer for law enforcement investigating  bad actors, and it will ensure criminals can no longer hide behind  these shell companies. It would also bring the United States in line  with other developed countries that already require beneficial  ownership disclosure.                                time  1230    The rule will amend the bill to also include my friend, Congressman  Emanuel Cleaver's H.R. 2514, known as the COUNTER Act, which would  modernize and improve the Bank Secrecy Act.   This bill passed the Financial Services Committee unanimously in May.  Specifically, it would expand communication about anti-money laundering  data within financial institutions and safeguard privacy by creating a  civil liberties and privacy officer within each financial regulator.  Additionally, this legislation increases penalties for bad actors and  reduces barriers to innovation.   For years, Congress has proposed reforms to the Bank Secrecy Act, but  this is the first major legislation to receive broad bipartisan  support. This bill strikes a careful balance between security and  privacy and will be a big step forward to strengthen anti-money  laundering tools.   Together, this combined legislation will create a more secure and  transparent financial system. I urge all my colleagues to support the  rule and the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I just want to remind my friend that we are dealing with a serious  law enforcement issue here, something that the chairwoman, who will  speak, has been dealing with for years, working with law enforcement  across the country and has full-throated support from virtually every  law enforcement agency in this country to deal with these phony  companies. These are phony companies similar to the company that was  created by Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were friends of Rudy  Giuliani, created to upset elections and elsewhere, who were arrested  as they were leaving the country 2 weeks ago.   That is the purpose, it is to get bad actors who are using shell  companies to really contort U.S. law, to park money in buildings where  they have gotten bribes and they have taken them from their country and  parked them in, you know, big townhouses in New York City or L.A. or  Denver, Colorado. This is serious stuff that we are dealing with.   And I would remind my friend, as he spoke about the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Davidson), he is going to get to debate an amendment he  proposed. We have five amendments that are going to be considered by  the full House. That is after any amendment was allowed in committee to  be, you know, voted up or down. And we have a big committee with a lot  of Democrats and a lot of Republicans. And there are many Republicans  supporting this bill, because they understand how important this is to,  you know, get dirty money out of these shell companies.   David Petraeus, a former general, former head of the CIA, and Sheldon  Whitehouse wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post dated March 8, 2019,  where they said, ``Russian President Vladimir Putin and other  authoritarian rulers have worked assiduously to weaponize corruption as  an instrument of foreign policy, using money in opaque and illicit ways  to gain influence over other countries, subvert the rule of law and  otherwise remake foreign governments in their own kleptocratic image.''   And I want to thank the chairwoman for working so hard on this bill  and gaining so much support from Democrats, Republicans, law  enforcement, and different organizations all across the country to stop  this kind of stuff that could really undermine our democracy.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York  (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   To my friends Mrs. Lesko and Mr. Woodall from the Rules Committee,  first, I remind my friend from Arizona that we are actually working on  legislation that is bipartisan in nature and something that is  tremendously serious that has to be addressed.   Again, I would quote from the CNBC article of October 17, where it  talked about these two cronies of Rudy Giuliani: ``Parnas and Fruman  face other charges in the indictment, which alleges they created a  shell company and then used it to donate to political committees,  including a pro-Trump super-PAC, while concealing that they were the  ones making the donations.''   So here we have, on the political side, the reason for this  particular bill.   There is a 36-story skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan at 650 Fifth  Avenue, and I am reciting from an op-ed in The Washington Post, dated  September 20, 2019: ``It is home to a Nike flagship store and  previously housed the corporate offices of Starwood Hotels & Resorts.  It was also secretly owned by the Iranian Government for almost 20  years. By running its ownership stake in the building through an  anonymous front company, the Iranian regime took advantage of the fact  that firms in the United States are not legally required to disclose  who ultimately profits from and controls them.''   It goes on to say: ``The story of 650 Fifth Avenue is not anomalous.  The United States has become one of the world's leading destinations  for hiding and legitimizing stolen wealth.''   The purpose of this legislation, bipartisan in nature, is something  that is very serious, and I appreciate the gentlewoman for having been  so persevering to get this done, working with law enforcement, working  with Republicans throughout.   In fact, one of the major cosponsors, or somebody with whom Mrs.  Maloney worked, was Mr. Luetkemeyer, a senior member of the Republican  Party on the Financial Services Committee, to come up with language  that was acceptable not only to him but 11 or 10 other Republicans on  the committee.   I would remind my friend Mr. Woodall that, in connection with civil  [[Page H8313]]  liberties that he was just talking about, Mr. Davidson raised his  concern. He has on a number of occasions, and I have been there working  with him on that subject. But he was defeated.   This bill contains many civil rights and privacy components. It  protects the privacy of any beneficial ownership. It ensures that law  enforcement agencies requesting beneficial ownership information from  the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network have an existing investigatory  basis for its requests so that there is already something going on.                                time  1300    There is an audit trail to make sure that that information is not  being disclosed improperly, and there are penalties against the  agencies if, in fact, there are improper disclosures.   Now, I would also say--and I would remind my friend, and we talked  about this last night at Rules--that when people get together and they  operate under a corporation or a limited liability company, they are  drawing on law to say: We want to operate this group, and we want to  have protection from liability. We are going to operate as a  corporation. We want the State to protect us--State of Colorado, State  of Arizona--to protect us against us being personally liable,  individually liable.   All we are asking is stuff that you would put down on a normal bank  account, which is the names of the individuals, their date of birth,  their address, and identifying numbers; and, if they are from another  country, we demand their passport numbers.   This is not terribly intrusive. This is just basic information to  make sure that we don't have bad actors and scoundrels and people who  would like to undermine our Nation having phony bank accounts or shell  companies owning skyscrapers in New York. So this is serious stuff.   I have shared with the chairwoman concerns over time, and she has  actually worked--not actually. She has worked with me to address  concerns that I particularly have in saying that, before anybody is  penalized for not disclosing information, they had to do it willfully  or knowingly, and that negligence is not a basis for any kind of an  action and that there are waivers if somebody had just made a mistake.   So I just want to, again, thank the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.  Carolyn B. Maloney) for working with Democrats and Republicans and all  sorts of groups across the country to come up with something that  balances the need for real national security and law enforcement  measures with privacy.   We have allowed five amendments. Mr. Davidson, who, I am sure, will  address some of his concerns when he brings up one of his amendments,  is going to be entitled to speak. And if people don't like the bill,  they can vote against it.   My guess is it is going to get a strong bipartisan vote. I hope it  does so that we can send it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I was going to say to my friend: That  sounded like that was your closing. Should we just take it as that?    Madam Speaker, I don't have any other speakers.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume to close.   I always enjoy debating with my friend from Georgia on these rules  matters, and, quite frankly, he has heaped a lot of praise on this  particular piece of legislation, which it deserves. It has gone through  the crucible of a lot of meetings and compromise and work with a lot of  different groups.   So I want to thank my colleagues for joining me here today to speak  on the rule and the Corporate Transparency Act of 2019.   Law enforcement needs to have the tools necessary to shed light on  the true beneficial owners of shell companies in order to do their jobs  and root out illicit financial activity. They need to be able to find  out if Russians, Iranians, North Koreans, ISIS, al-Qaida, or criminal  cartels may be engaging in questionable activity, and this legislation  will help law enforcement do exactly that. It will also make the first  major reforms to the Bank Secrecy Act and our anti-money laundering  laws since 2001.   These issues enjoy broad support from the law enforcement community,  like the Fraternal Order of Police and the National District Attorneys  Association, as well as human rights groups, anti-human trafficking  organizations, banks and credit unions of all sizes, and many more.   These are bipartisan issues we have been working on in the Financial  Services Committee, and I urge all my colleagues to vote for the bill.  I encourage a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Woodall is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 646         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2 Upon adoption of this resolution, the Committees on       the Judiciary, Way and Means, Financial Services, Oversight       and Reform, and Foreign Affairs and the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence shall suspend pursuing matters       referred to by the Speaker in her announcement of September       24, 2019, until such time as a bill implementing the United       States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement becomes law.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time,  and I move the previous question on the resolution.
