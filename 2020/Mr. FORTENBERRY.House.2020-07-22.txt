 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for the  time, and perhaps we can continue that discussion in another venue  because today I am rising in support of this act.   Mr. Speaker, a while back I was at the Library of Congress and I met  the famous filmmaker, Ken Burns and he taught me something. He spoke to  us about the creation of the National Park System last century and how  it represented a singular defining moment for America; our sense of  vastness, openness, and endless opportunity, and regenerated for us an  understanding of an American ethos, this great ideal of conservation,  caring for what we have and transferring it into the future.   Mr. Speaker, our National Park sites are majestic places, great  sources of national pride, and a living heritage for all Americans. But  here is the problem: We have a backlog of maintenance, but we fix it  today.   Along with providing certainty for the future of the Land and Water  Conservation Fund, this all is a great boost to communities eager for  innovation and conservation ideals.
