 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it is an honor to be here on the Senate  floor tonight to talk about a topic, and it is an honor to have you in  the Chair as I do so.   I rise late this afternoon to discuss a piece of legislation that  will be before the Senate perhaps for a good portion of this week and  maybe even into the next. It is the most comprehensive toxic exposure  package the Senate has ever considered in our Nation's history.   Since September 11, 2001, up to 3.5 million deployed servicemembers  have potentially encountered toxic exposures from burn pits. During a  deployment to a war zone, military personnel are often exposed to toxic  hazards, many of which have been associated with chronic health issues.   Not really as an aside but unrelated to this piece of legislation, a  cause I now undertake and have been pursuing since this topic arose is  to make sure that in the future, there are no burn pits that our  service men and women encounter in their service to our Nation. While  we are preparing to take care of those who have experienced burn pits  in the past, let there be no more burn pit experiences.   Until almost 2010, the U.S. military kept burn pits on bases for the  disposal of chemicals, plastics, medical waste, and other substances  that were just burned with jet fuel, creating toxic substances, toxic  smoke.   Currently, the VA can provide service-connected disability claims  related to burn pit exposures; however, due to lack of evidence,  scientific data, and information from the Department of Defense, at  least 70 percent of the claims are denied.    Over the past 2 years, nearly every veterans service organization has  testified before the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs and  emphasized the importance of fixing the process the VA uses to provide  healthcare and benefits to toxic-exposed veterans. Jon Tester, the  Senator from Montana, the chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs  Committee, and I have worked in a bipartisan fashion with these  veterans organizations, with veterans, with advocates, with the VA, and  with our Senate colleagues on and off of the committee to craft a  comprehensive bill to deliver all generations of toxic-exposed veterans  long-overdue healthcare and benefits.   Three weeks ago, Senator Tester and I announced the Sergeant First  Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive  Toxics Act of 2022. It has many priorities, but among those, this  historic legislation will, one, expand VA healthcare eligibility; two,  improve the VA's presumption process; three, bolster the VA's toxic  exposure training and resources; four, strengthen toxic exposure  research; and five, set up VA and veterans for success.   Last week over Memorial Day, our country paused to remember and honor  those who served our Nation. My expectation--my guess is that almost  every Member of the U.S. Senate in some fashion over the weekend spent  time with veterans, paying respect, giving them honor.   One Kansas veteran, when I was in Wichita, told me that he and his  dad  [[Page S2778]]  both served in the U.S. Navy and that both had an experience with  exposure to hazardous and toxic materials. He said he didn't believe  that either one of them suffered any major health issues from their  exposure. It caused me to think that this is a veteran who is not  necessarily going to care about this legislation, but what he said was  that it was a concern that there would not be any help from the VA if  they did, and they lived in fear and uncertainty.   The veteran who didn't think he or she had any negative consequences  from exposure to toxic substances still worried about ``What would  happen if I did? What would happen if my health deteriorates'' and  worried that the VA would not be there for them or their families.   After hearing the news of our comprehensive toxic exposure bill, this  veteran said:         You have now changed that for thousands of veterans and       their families.    The uncertainty, the fear is diminished and maybe gone.   It is time to advance this legislation and bring us one step closer  to connecting all generations of toxic-exposed veterans with the care  they need and deserve and to provide veterans with certainty and  support.   I honor, I thank, I have great gratitude for every generation of  veterans, and in my family's lifetime, those who served in Iraq and  Afghanistan are among the most significant to us. But Vietnam is a part  of my life as a 16-year-old boy, a junior in high school. In fact, if  you were a senior in my high school--my high school of 71 kids in my  class, so I know them all--if you were just a year older than me, you  served in Vietnam. And I saw how they were treated when they returned  from their service, and they were treated terribly by fellow American  citizens.   As a 16-year-old kid, I told myself, I am going to do everything I  can to honor and respect those who serve, see if I can compensate for  the circumstances these people--many of whom I knew personally--can I  compensate for what they are experiencing today in the early 1970s and  the midseventies?   I never expected to be a Member of the U.S. Senate. Nothing in my  life would suggest that that would be the case--the grace of God, the  kindness of Kansans. But upon my arrival in Congress, in the House and  now the Senate, it became important for me to do something more than  just honor and respect veterans, to do something more than saying  ``thank you,'' to do the things that I can do as a Member of a  legislative body to make certain that the Department of Veterans  Affairs does its job but most importantly, that I as a Member of  Congress do mine.   It is important for us to pay respect, but it is also perhaps even  more important for us to make certain those who serve our Nation  receive the care and benefits that they are entitled to and that they  deserve. It is beyond just saying ``thank you''; it is saying ``thank  you'' by action.   It is time to advance this legislation and bring us one step closer  to connecting all generations to the circumstances that war brought to  them and their families. And I hope that after Memorial Day, we brought  back with us as we return this Monday--Memorial Day being a week ago  today--that we brought back with us a sense of what their sacrifice  means and commit to living our lives and doing our jobs worthy of their  sacrifice.   Decade after decade, service men and women have deployed to countries  around the globe in defense of freedom, and we have seen just within  the last year that there is no moment in which everyone is safe. There  is no moment in which we may not have to ask people to continue to  serve, to serve longer, or to begin their service in defense of freedom  in the United States and freedom around the world.   Unfortunately, throughout history, many of them were exposed to  harmful toxins during that service that resulted in life-altering  health conditions.   Too many veterans--far too many veterans--face too many battles when  they return home and are seeking the care and benefits they desperately  need. Our veterans deserve better, and they are tired of waiting for  solutions.   This week, this body--the U.S. Senate--will discuss the Sergeant  First Class Heath Robinson Act at great length, and I look forward to  speaking more about this historic legislation on the Senate floor and  with my colleagues so that we can deliver to all generations of toxic- exposed veterans the relief, the assistance, and maybe, yes, just the  lack of fear, the lack of uncertainty that they deserve.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
