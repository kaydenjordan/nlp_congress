 Mr. Speaker, America has lost a statesman, noble war hero,  and service-minded Kansan who never forgot where he came from. Senator  Bob Dole died peacefully at the age of 98, having left his district,  State, and this country better for the many contributions he made over  79 years of public life.   I was blessed to spend some time with Senator Dole a few weeks ago.  His love for Kansas and its people were on full display in his excited  curiosity about our plans for the Big First District.   He was a thoughtful, committed, and energetic champion for our Nation  and our way of life in rural Kansas. He always treated others with  respect and kindness, especially his fellow veterans, as he attended  nearly every Honor Flight that came to Washington, D.C. He was a fierce  advocate for his political views, but he was equally committed to  cross-aisle friendship and comradery.   I left our time together inspired and commissioned, as Senator Dole  made it clear we must never forget where we come from. He knew deep  down that the heartbeat of our Nation lies in places like his hometown  of Russell, Kansas. His legacy will echo into the future, and his  patriotic spirit serves as a benchmark for anyone who believes that our  brightest days are yet to come.   I thank Senator Dole for working tirelessly to make our world a  better place. May he rest in peace.   Mr. Speaker, my prayers and gratitude for Senator Bob Dole go out to  his family.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Dakota (Mr.  Johnson) for all of his work in getting this legislation put together  and bringing it to the floor this morning. It is not a silver bullet,  but it potentially can help our cattle markets.   I grew up on a family farm and preconditioning feed yard. I spent  thousands of hours riding pens and doctoring sick cattle in the Big  First District of Kansas, which is the largest beef-producing district  in the country. The Big First is home to cow-calf operations, feed  yards, and packing plants of all sizes.   In my district and across the country, cattle producers face  challenging market dynamics, including historically wide gaps between  wholesale beef prices and fed cattle prices, packing capacity and  regulation, and more.   I have talked to hundreds of cattle producers in Kansas, ranging from  small cow-calf operations to some of the country's largest feed yards.  Overwhelmingly, I have heard that we need to increase price discovery  in the cash market, make sure that producers benefit when they provide  a superior product, refuse to let the government in the free market,  and acknowledge regional differences in the industry.   The Cattle Contract Library Act is a simple step toward addressing  some of today's concerns with more fairness, transparency, and healthy  competition in the cattle market. I am committed to working with the  gentleman from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), my colleagues in the House,  and others across Kansas and the country in addressing any concerns  with the program and the cattle market before reauthorization of the  program at this time next year.   The Cattle Contract Library Act will help ensure that all market  participants are both paying and receiving a fair price for their  goods. It sends a clear message to ranchers, farmers, and livestock  producers across the country that their voices are being heard in  Washington. I urge my colleagues to support it.
