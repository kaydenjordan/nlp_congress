 Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about an issue that  is extremely important for my Orange County community.   This week, my district braced for extreme high tides that presented  another flood risk to Newport Beach. City workers raised sand berms on  the Balboa Peninsula and handed out sandbags to residents, hoping to  avoid another flood like the one we experienced last July.   One Newport Beach resident this week said, ``I have lived here for 10  years. I have never seen the bay so high or the ocean so high this  early and before high tide.'' This risk of flood in our communities is  real.   This week, Lieutenant General Spellmon from the Army Corps said that  erosion in our community was not unique. I agree that this is an issue  all around California, but the difference is Orange County's problem  was brought on by the Federal, man-made projects that permanently  stopped natural sand flow onto our beaches.   The Army Corps created this issue, and it is their job to ensure the  final stages of sand replenishment are made a priority. The safety of  our communities is at risk, and we are one natural disaster away from  devastating damage.   Mr. Speaker, I will continue to work with local stakeholders to call  on the Army Corps to fix the problem they made.                            ____________________
