 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the gentleman from Oklahoma, the  distinguished chairman, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, with less than a week from default, we have been rushed  back to Washington because Republicans decided they wanted to waste  months playing games with the debt limit.   They said if Democrats and President Biden didn't give House  Republicans everything they wanted, they were prepared to push the  entire economy off a cliff, causing catastrophic, lasting, irreparable  damage to America.   Even though the GOP voted three times to prevent default when Donald  Trump was President, even though 97 percent of the debt was accumulated  before President Biden took office and over a quarter of the debt was  accumulated under Donald Trump, even though Republicans had no problem  adding trillions to the debt with their giveaways to Big Oil and to  Wall Street CEOs and lavish tax cuts for the very rich, now they choose  to play Russian roulette with our economy.                                time  1445    Frankly, we should not be here. We should have taken care of this  months ago, but once again, Republicans are demonstrating that they  cannot govern.   Let's rewind to the end of 2017. The last time Republicans held the  majority, they left our government with the longest shutdown in  American history.   Here we are today, dealing with a totally manufactured crisis that  jeopardizes the full faith and credit of the United States.   Both then and now, Democrats have had to be the adults in the room to  come in and clean up Republicans' self-made mess. Every time  Republicans are in charge, Mr. Speaker, they screw things up.   Mr. Speaker, I thank President Biden, Shalanda Young, Steve  Ricchetti, Louisa Terrell, Ashley Jones, Alicia Molt-West, and the  White House team, as well as Leader Jeffries and his staff, for their  leadership throughout these negotiations. I am sure it wasn't easy  working with our Republican colleagues. I saw reports that White House  staff was holed up in a stuffy room late at night and early in the  morning, arguing for hours on end with Republicans.   All I can say as a longstanding member of the Rules Committee:  Welcome to the club.   Mr. Speaker, because of their efforts, this bill is a lot less awful  than it could have been.   That said, I have some very real, very serious reservations about  this bill. There are better ways to deal with our deficit than to  further burden our Nation's most vulnerable.   We can make sure the wealthy and well connected pay their fair share.   Let's close the tax loopholes that millionaires and billionaires and  corporations exploit. This bill does the opposite. It cuts IRS funding  that would have kept big corporations and the top 1 percent in check.  We have some of the wealthiest corporations on the entire planet, and  they pay little to no taxes. They should at least pay the rate their  lowest paying workers pay.   What about the military budget? ``60 Minutes'' covered a story a  couple of weekends ago where a former Pentagon official talked about  the insane price gouging taking place at the Pentagon. He told us that  the Pentagon overpays for almost everything--in one example, the  Pentagon paid $10,000 for a $300 oil switch--but we are hearing from  the Republicans that we can't find any savings in the bloated Pentagon  budget.   Really? Instead, they say, let's continue to take from the most  vulnerable in our country. Give me a break.   I know my Republican friends claim that investing less in military  expenditures would somehow undercut our national security. Yes, we want  a defense budget that ensures we are second to none, but to put  everything in perspective here, we spend more on our national defense  than the next 10 countries combined, including China and Russia.  Defense spending accounts for nearly half of discretionary spending.   Our national security is so much more than bullets and bombs. It is  healthcare. It is education and food. It is a clean environment. It is  good jobs and safe neighborhoods. It includes adequate support for our  veterans, our seniors, and for our children--all the things that  strengthen our communities.   Honestly, Mr. Speaker, thank God for Joe Biden. He secured expanded  food benefits for some of the most vulnerable individuals, like  veterans, kids emerging from the foster care system, and the unhoused.   It is clear the President entered these negotiations trying to  protect as many people as possible from the GOP's war on the poor, but  at the end of the day, we should not be making tradeoffs between which  vulnerable population gets to eat.   I have a hard time understanding why we are kicking up to 700,000  older adults off of SNAP. It is just cruel. Food and hunger should not  be a partisan issue. It is a human issue, but Republicans don't care  who they hurt.   We have over 30 million people in this country who do not know where  their next meal will come from. The current SNAP benefit, on average,  is $6 per person per day. That is $2 per meal. The majority of people  on SNAP who can work do work, and we also know that work requirements  do not work.   In a February 2021 report titled: ``The Effects of Changing SNAP Work  Requirement on the Health and Employment Outcomes of Able-Bodied Adults  without Dependents,'' exactly what we are talking about here today, it  was reported that losing SNAP made people less healthy and had no  significant change in employment status. Again, work requirements do  not work.   By the way, if my Republican colleagues don't believe me, they could  have held a hearing. They could have held a hearing in the Agriculture  Committee or in the Nutrition, Foreign Agriculture, and Horticulture  Subcommittee.   They didn't hold a single hearing on this issue, not one. They have  no clue  [[Page H2673]]  who this will adversely impact, and I don't even think they care. You  would think that we want to go into this knowing exactly how this  legislation would affect our constituents, but they didn't even have  time for a hearing.   Here is the kicker, Mr. Speaker. You are going to love this. Many of  the people in this Chamber who are trying to take food away from  struggling Americans are the same people who had their PPP loans  forgiven. Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle received  hundreds of thousands of dollars--some, millions--in taxpayer dollars  that were used to forgive some of their loans.   They had no problem with that. They just shrugged that off, but they  say we cannot afford to help make sure that families can put food on  their tables. It is ridiculous.   I also have issues with the antienvironmental language in the deal.  The bill slashes key NEPA protections, approves the Mountain Valley  Pipeline, and doesn't include transmission reform.   Look, we all knew there would have to be compromise. No side was  going to get everything they wanted out of this deal, but Republicans  have used this manufactured crisis to force policy changes that are so  unpopular that they could not possibly get them through regular order.    For some on the far, far right--and there are a lot of them over  there--this bill isn't mean enough. Let that sink in, everybody.   By weaponizing the debt ceiling, Republicans are establishing a  precedent that will haunt us forever, that one party can use the full  faith and credit of the United States as a hostage to pass their widely  unpopular ideas that they could not get done through the normal  legislative process. It is a lousy, lousy way to govern.   Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by saying that in this Republican-led  Congress, it has become unfashionable to worry about the poor and the  vulnerable, to believe in the principle that we should bring everyone  along, that we must meet the needs of the many, not just of the few.   Mr. Speaker, our goal should be to elevate people, not demean them.  The policies being advocated and forced upon us by my Republican  friends do not reflect my values. It is sad that, for them, solving  problems and uplifting all people apparently is not their mission.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a report by The  Balance titled: ``President Trump's Impact on the National Debt.''                     [From the balance, Jan. 26, 2022]               President Trump's Impact on the National Debt                            (By Kimberly Amadeo)         The national debt increased by almost 36% during Trump's       tenure.        Republican candidate Donald Trump promised during the 2016       presidential campaign that he would eliminate the nation's       debt in eight years.        Instead, his budget estimates showed that he would actually       add at least $8.3 trillion, increasing the U.S. debt to $28.5       trillion by 2025. But the national debt reached that figure       much sooner. The national debt stood at $19.9 trillion when       President Trump took office in January 2017, and it reached a       high of $27 trillion in October 2020.        The national debt reached another high of $28 trillion less       than two months after President Trump left office. In       December 2021, Congress then increased the debt limit by $2.5       trillion, to almost $31.4 trillion, as debt rose again under       President Joe Biden.                     How Did the National Debt Increase?         At first it seemed that Trump was lowering the debt. It       fell $102 billion in the first six months after he took       office. The debt was $19.9 trillion on Jan. 20, the day Trump       was inaugurated. It was $19.8 trillion on July 30, thanks to       the federal debt ceiling.        Trump signed a bill increasing the debt ceiling on Sept. 8,       2017. The debt exceeded $20 trillion for the first time in       U.S. history later that day. Trump signed a bill on Feb. 9,       2018, suspending the debt ceiling until March 1, 2019. The       total national debt was at $22 trillion by February 2019.       Trump again suspended the debt ceiling in July 2019 until       after the 2020 presidential election.        The debt hit a record $27 trillion on Oct. 1, 2020 before       reaching further peaks in 2021 that caused Congress to act       again to raise the debt limit in December.        Trump oversaw the fastest increase in the debt of any       president, almost 36% from 2017 to 2020.  [[Page H2674]]                     Did President Trump Reduce the National Debt?         Trump promised two strategies to reduce U.S. debt before       taking office: He would increase growth by 4% to 6%, and he       would eliminate wasteful federal spending                              Increasing Growth         Trump promised while on the campaign trail to grow the       economy by 4% to 6% annually to increase tax revenues. Once       in office, he lowered his growth estimates to between 2% and       3%. These more realistic projections are within the 2% to 3%       healthy growth rate.        President Trump also promised to achieve between 2% and 4%       growth with tax cuts. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act cut the       corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. The top       individual income tax rate dropped to 37%. The TCJA doubled       the standard deduction and eliminated personal exemptions.       The corporate cuts are permanent, but the individual changes       expire at the end of 2025.        According to the Laffer curve, tax cuts only stimulate the       economy enough to make up for lost revenue when the rates are       above 50%. It worked during the Reagan administration because       the highest tax rate was 70% at that time.                    Eliminating Wasteful Federal Spending         Trump's second strategy was to eliminate waste and       redundancy in federal spending. He demonstrated this cost-      consciousness during his campaign when he used his Twitter       account and rallies instead of expensive television ads.        Trump was right that there is waste in federal spending.       The problem isn't finding it. The problem is in cutting it.       Each program has a constituency that lobbies Congress.       Eliminating these benefits may lose voters and contributors.       Congressional representatives may agree to cut spending in       someone else's district, but they resist doing so on their       own.        More than two-thirds of government spending goes to       mandatory obligations made by previous acts of Congress.       Social Security benefits cost $1.2 trillion in Fiscal Year       2021. Medicare cost $722 billion, and Medicaid cost $448       billion. The interest on the debt was $378 billion.        Military spending must also be cut to lower the debt       because it's such a large portion of the budget. But Trump       increased military spending in Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 to $933       billion. That includes three components:        $636 billion base budget for the Department of Defense        $69 billion in overseas contingency operations for DoD to       fight the Islamic State group        $229 billion to fund the other agencies that protect our       nation, including the Department of Veterans Affairs ($105       billion), Homeland Security ($50 billion), the State       Department ($44 billion), the National Nuclear Security       Administration in the Department of Energy ($20 billion), and       the FBI and Cybersecurity for the eDepartment of Justice ($10       billion)        Only $595 billion was left to pay for everything else       budgeted for FY 2021 after mandatory and military spending.       That includes agencies that process Social Security and other       benefits. It also includes the necessary functions performed       by the Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue       Service. We'd have to eliminate it all to make a dent in the       $966 billion deficit.        You can't reduce the deficit or debt without major cuts to       defense and mandated benefits programs. Cutting waste isn't       enough.         Did Trump's Business Debt Affect His Approach to U.S. Debt?         Trump said in an interview with CNBC during his 2016       campaign that he would ``borrow, knowing that if the economy       crashed, you could make a deal.'' But sovereign debt is       different from personal debt. It can't be handled the same       way.        A 2016 Fortune magazine analysis revealed Trump's business       was $1.11 billion in debt. That includes $846 million owed on       five properties. These include Trump Tower, 40 Wall Street,       and 1290 Avenue of the Americas in New York. It also includes       the Trump Hotel in Washington, D.C., and 555 California       Street in San Francisco. But the income generated by these       properties easily pays their annual interest payment. Trump's       debt is reasonable in the business world.        The U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio was 129% at the end of 2020.       That's the $27.8 trillion U.S. debt as of December 2020,       divided by the $21.5 trillion nominal GDP at the end of the       second quarter this year.        The World Bank compares countries based on their total       debt-to-gross domestic product ratio. It considers a country       to be in trouble if that ratio is greater than 77%.        The high U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio didn't discourage       investors. America is one of the safest economies in the       world and its currency is the world's reserve currency.       Investors purchase U.S. Treasurys in a flight to safety even       during a U.S. economic crisis. That's one reason why interest       rates plunged to historical lows in March 2020 after the       coronavirus outbreak. Those falling interest rates meant that       America's debt could increase, but interest payments remain       stable.        The U.S. also has a massive fixed pension expense and       health insurance costs. A business can renege on these       benefits, ask for bankruptcy, and weather the resulting       lawsuits, but a president and Congress can't cut back those       costs without losing their jobs at the next election. As       such, Trump's experience in handling business debt did not       transfer to managing the U.S. debt.                      How the National Debt Affects You         The national debt doesn't affect you directly until it       reaches the tipping point. It slows economic growth once the       debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 77% for an extended period of time.       Every percentage point of debt above this level costs the       country 0.017 percentage points in economic growth, according       to a World Bank analysis.        The first sign of trouble is when interest rates start to       rise significantly. Investors need a higher return to offset       the greater perceived risk. They start to doubt that the debt       can be paid off.        The second sign is that the U.S. dollar loses value. You       will notice that as inflation rises, imported goods cost       more. Gas and grocery prices rise. Travel to other countries       also becomes much more expensive.        The cost of providing benefits and paying the interest on       the debt will skyrocket as interest rates and inflation rise.       That leaves less money for other services. The government       will be forced to cut services or raise taxes at that point.       This will further slow economic growth. Continued deficit       spending will no longer work at that point.    Mr. Speaker, talk about spending. The national debt  increased by almost 36 percent from 2017 to 2020 during Trump's tenure.   I wish the gentleman from Texas was on the floor screaming then as he  is now. He has no problem with spending trillions of dollars on tax  cuts for rich people and taxpayer subsidies for Big Oil companies, but  when it comes to providing people the basics to be able to put food on  the table, he has a problem. We just don't share the same values.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Ruiz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez), a member of the  Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am honored to yield 2 minutes to the  very distinguished gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Mr. Speaker, I would just remind the gentleman that  under the new standards in this bill, 700,000 older Americans,  vulnerable Americans, will lose their food benefits. If that is his  idea of protecting the vulnerable, we don't want your help.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Cohen).                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Tennessee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the last time I checked, the Republican  Conference hasn't provided us with a budget.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Landsman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Ohio.    Mr. Speaker, if we want to talk about messes, let me  just remind everybody that the last time my Republican friends were in  charge, they left us with the longest government shutdown in U.S.  history.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The gentleman is absolutely right that COVID did add to the deficit,  but he neglected to mention the multitrillion-dollar tax cut for the  rich that was unpaid for.   Mr. Speaker, I think there is a difference between Democrats and  Republicans. I think that Democrats have proven that we can govern and  that Republicans have proven they cannot.   We have seen the great things that government is capable of doing.   In the last Congress, with Democrats in charge of the House, we  invested to rebuild our neglected infrastructure: airports, roads,  bridges, and ports in all of our communities. We will see the benefits  of that infrastructure bill for years and years to come. We brought  manufacturing back to the United States. We passed the CHIPS and  Science Act to drive innovation and create good-paying jobs. We made  the largest investment in climate, protecting our water and our air. We  strengthened our supply chains and set up new programs to support  minority businesses. We lifted a record number of kids out of poverty  in this country. We ensured that our veterans get the healthcare they  earned.   It is possible for us to deliver for the American people, though I  haven't seen much of it this year. Instead, Republicans spent a week in  January trying to elect a Speaker. Republicans spent the last 5 months  trying to destroy everything that we built over the last 2 years. They  have only enacted three laws in 5 months, and those laws don't do much.   The bill we are debating today may become their fourth law. It will  be their biggest legislative accomplishment of the year. Think about  that. The biggest accomplishment will be ending a crisis that they  created.   We have wasted time going back and forth on how to pay our bills. The  fact that we have had to bend and contort ourselves to get this done,  to prevent our economy from falling off a cliff because Republicans  wanted to play games, is unconscionable and doesn't bode well for the  future.   Finally, let me say, I plead with my colleagues on the Republican  side to stop this assault against the poor. Every concession in this  bill, every demand that Republicans made in this bill, hurts somebody.  It hurts the most vulnerable in our country. Going after SNAP for older  people, a measly $6 a day benefit, shame on you for doing that.   We are here to help people. We are here to uplift people. We are not  here to demean people. We are not here to try to punish people.   Quite frankly, the narrative that the Republicans have been utilizing  in this whole debate doesn't reflect the reality. Talk to the people in  your district who are struggling. Let them tell you how difficult it is  to make ends meet and how maddening it is to not know whether you can  put food on the table.   We can do so much better, but you have to stop this assault against  the poor, against the vulnerable in this country.   We need to do better, and I urge all my colleagues, as we move  forward in the coming months, to keep that in mind. We are here to  bring everybody forward, not just a select few. We are here to  represent everybody, not just the rich and powerful and well-connected  and people who give to our campaigns.   Again, the contrast here is that we have Members of Congress who  accepted government-subsidized loan forgiveness for PPP who are the  ones out here demanding that we nickel and dime programs like SNAP and  TANF. It is disgusting, quite frankly, that we are even having this  debate. We should be able to do so much better.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
