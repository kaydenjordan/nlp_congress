 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous materials on the subject of my Special Order hour.    Madam Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today  to open our first Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour of this  year, during Black History Month, utilizing to the fullest extent  possible: Our Power, Our Message.   I would like to thank the Congressional Black Caucus members for  having the confidence to elect me to be chairwoman during the 117th  Congress. I stand on the shoulders of greatness as I acknowledge the  past members and chairs for their tremendous leadership.   For the next 60 minutes, we have an opportunity to speak directly to  the American people about the issues of great importance to the  Congressional Black Caucus and the millions of constituents we  represent.   Tonight's Special Order hour topic will serve as part of a rollout of  our policy agenda and celebrate our 50th anniversary in the context of  the many critical issues facing the Black community.   The Congressional Black Caucus kicked off Black History Month, Madam  Speaker, with the powerful Travon Free film ``Two Distant Strangers,''  a moving story about a young Black man caught in a George Floyd type of  nightmare with his local police department.   During tomorrow's CBC meeting to be held at 12 p.m., the ``Living  Black History'' vignette, featuring all 58 members of the CBC, will be  unveiled to the public via Facebook, TheGrio, and my YouTube page.   We are also hosting a virtual film screening of director Lee Daniels'  film, ``The United State vs. Billie Holiday,'' tomorrow evening.   In that spirit, later this week, I will be introducing the Black  History is American History Act to close out our Black History Month.   This year marks the 50th anniversary of the CBC with the largest CBC  group ever, 58 members who represent the diversity, hope, and promise  of this great Nation. It has been stated before, and it certainly bears  repeating, the CBC is commonly referred to as the conscience of the  Congress and over the decades has forcefully advocated on policies that  our Nation cares about, ranging from economic justice and reparations,  healthcare, voting rights, consumer protection, education, and fair  policing to far beyond.   The killing of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and George Floyd drew  America closer to another watershed moment last year, amid a pandemic  that has disrupted life as we knew it, triggering an intergenerational  cross-class collective of people demanding change, which led to the  passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a bill that is the  first-ever bold, comprehensive approach to hold police accountable,  change the culture of law enforcement, empower our communities, and  build trust between law enforcement and our communities by addressing  systemic racism and biases to help save lives.   I also wear another hat, and that is as chairwoman of the Diversity  and Inclusion Subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee.  Though it may speak for itself, I appreciate that kind of  transformative change which we seek in the spirit of policy,  legislation, and regulation that will, hopefully, result in building a  record that we can use as we promote diversity and inclusion in our  democracy. As CBC founder member Bill Clay noted, we have no permanent  friends or enemies, just permanent interests.   The CBC's priorities will allow us, in many instances, to work with  the Biden administration to deliver relief to our constituents who have  been so devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic and to work on long-term  plans for recovery. To that end, we are so pleased that we will  announce our domestic policy team tomorrow, as we have met with  Ambassador Susan Rice, who is head of the Biden domestic policy team.   It is so important that I end by saying the Congressional Black  Caucus is committed to dramatically reversing these alarming trends by  working with our community leaders, allies, and colleagues in Congress  to pass critical legislation and by working with the Biden-Harris  administration to encourage responsible executive branch policies and  actions using Our Power, Our Message.   Now, I am honored to announce our CBC anchors for tonight:  Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, a scholar, a strategist, an orator, a  woman who has sponsored legislation and helped craft much of the  changes that we will be talking about through the 117th Congress; and I  am equally as proud to say that the Special Order hour will be co- chaired by her coanchor, Congressman Ritchie Torres, a freshman, a  member of the Financial Services Committee, a giant in public housing  legislation. Tonight, you will hear from them.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
