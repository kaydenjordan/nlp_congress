 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am here to react to the President's  selection of Andrew Wheeler to be the proposed No. 2 at the EPA. This  is a selection that continues the Trump administration's essentially  complete subservience to the fossil fuel industry in the entire  environmental arena.   I have described Scott Pruitt, Rick Perry, and Ryan Zinke, who is  over at Interior, as the three stooges of the fossil fuel industry, and  I reiterate that today.   Scott Pruitt, in addition to being one of those stooges, also has  some of the most extraordinary displays of unethical and self-serving  political acts of anybody I have ever seen. I can only imagine what  this floor would look like if an Obama appointee had engaged in those  kinds of behaviors. In all of those seats, we would have had  Republicans shouting and jumping up and down in their being infuriated  by that misconduct. Yet, because it is Pruitt, because it is Trump, and  because the fossil fuel industry is getting everything it wants out of  this guy, the silence is deafening. But that doesn't change the  underlying fact that the American people are owed folks in high office  who take their public duty seriously. There is very little chance that  Mr. Wheeler is going to take his public duties seriously as No. 2 at  the EPA. It is not like it is with the No. 1 at the EPA, where there is  a stopgap who is going to defend us.   This is a very dangerous duo. Scott Pruitt is a complete flunky of  the fossil fuel industry--largely disgraced but still hanging on there  and his only claim to fame being that he will do anything the fossil  fuel industry tells him to do. That is why he is hanging on. Now coal  lobbyist Wheeler is coming on to be his No. 2. That is a dangerous  combination to lead our Environmental Protection Agency.   There was an interesting series of photographs that actually got the  photographer fired in this administration for having released these  photographs. There was a little meeting over at the Energy Department  with Secretary Perry and Bob Murray, who is the head of Murray Energy.  He is a coal baron, and he, obviously, has one interest in mind, which  is to sell more coal, burn more coal, and to heck with the rest of you,  more or less.   This was Mr. Murray as he arrived at the Department of Energy, up in  the Secretary's conference room. The bald gentleman is Mr. Murray. The  man whose head is obscured behind him in this torrid hug is our Energy  Secretary. So you knew things were going to go well for Mr. Murray at  this meeting after that nice, cozy reception that he got.   Then the photographer went on and took this picture, which is of  Murray Energy Corporation's recommendations to the Honorable Richard  Perry as to what he should do about the environment. I will spend some  more time on that memo in just a moment. After long delays, we were  actually able to get our hands on it. They delayed and they fiddled and  they faddled and wouldn't confirm that they had it. When the photograph  showed that they had it, they said: OK. We will give it to you when we  give our FOIA requests.   Great. Thanks a bunch. So much for congressional oversight.   I hope that if the now majority is ever in the minority in the  Senate, that it doesn't get treated this way--being told to line up  with the FOIA folks as they are not interested in responding to  oversight requests for memos, but that is what we got.   Here is another photograph from that meeting. Here is Mr. Murray  telling the Energy Secretary what to do. There is the Energy  Secretary--fresh out of his nice hug--being told what to do. Here is  Mr. Wheeler, the guy who is going to be the No. 2 at the EPA. He was  right in the room where the Murray directions to the Trump  administration were being discussed and delivered.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this document be printed  in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.   Here is the action plan. It reads: ``Dear Secretary Perry, enclosed  is an Action Plan for achieving reliable and low cost electricity in  America and to assist in the survival of our country's coal industry.''   What are the recommendations?   Page 1: ``SUSPEND THE COAL-FIRED POWERPLANT EFFLUENT LIMITATION  GUIDELINES.''   Yes. Why would we want limitations on the effluent that a coal-fired  powerplant can emit? Why on Earth would anybody want that? No. To  suspend those is one of the recommendations.   The second is to withdraw and suspend the so-called endangerment  finding.   The endangerment finding is the fact-based finding at the EPA that  shows that, in addition to it being a matter of law pursuant to  Massachusetts v. EPA, carbon dioxide is a pollutant in the air. This is  the Agency's finding that it is actually a dangerous pollutant in the  air. That is why it is called the endangerment finding. So they want to  knock that out so they can knock out regulation of more coal-powered  powerplant effluents, including carbon dioxide.    Then they want to eliminate the tax credit for wind and solar. Here  is an industry that gets, according to the International Monetary Fund,  $700 billion a year in effective subsidies in the United States of  America alone, and their goal is to knock out the little production tax  credit that wind and solar get? That is what he asked for.   ``WITHDRAW FROM THE . . . PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD.'' Well, we all know  he was obeyed on that.   Here's a particularly good one: ``END . . . OZONE REGULATIONS.'' Let  me state what Rhode Island's experience in this is. The midwestern  powerplants burn coal and other fossil fuels. They run the exhaust out  of smoke stacks. Many of them have raised enormously high smoke stacks  to get all that stuff way up into the air, so it is then carried by  prevailing winds out of their State--out of their State. As it bakes in  the heat as it travels through the air, it becomes ozone. That ozone  lands in Rhode Island.   Ladies and gentlemen, children go to the hospital because of asthma  complications from ozone in Rhode Island. We have had periods when, on  a bright and sunny day, the talk radio, your drive-time radio,  announces to Rhode Islanders that today is a bad air day in the State  of Rhode Island, and the elderly and babies and any people with  breathing difficulty should stay indoors. You are not welcome out-of- doors because of ozone levels.   This guy wants to end ozone regulation. I think not. This guy was his  lobbyist in trying to do that. That is what has become of the EPA.   What else? ``OVERTURN THE . . . CROSS-STATE AIR POLLUTION RULE.''  Rhode Island doesn't create much air pollution. The EPA protects Rhode  Island from other States' air pollution with--guess what--the cross- state air pollution rule. He wants to overturn it.   Finally, ``CUT THE STAFF OF THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION  [[Page S2093]]  AGENCY IN AT LEAST HALF.'' Well, they are doing a pretty good job of  destroying the Environmental Protection Agency as an agency that does  environmental protection, but I have to say, cutting the Agency in half  and firing half of it--that seems a bit much.   They also want Justices of the Supreme Court who rule in favor of  coal. They want to replace all the members of the Federal Regulatory  Energy Commission, the members of the Tennessee Valley Authority board,  and the members of the National Labor Relations Board. There is a bunch  in there to make sure that coal safety regulations are undone.   That is what we are dealing with. We are dealing with an agency that  has been taken over by the fossil fuel industry, and it has gotten so  bad that I want to conclude with this editorial, which I ask unanimous  consent to have printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.   This is an editorial from, of all places, the Charleston, WV,  Gazette-Mail. I think the body can take notice that West Virginia is  more or less the heart of coal country.   Here is what the Charleston, WV, Gazette-Mail said about where things  are at EPA right now. The title is ``Editorial: With self-serving  Pruitt at EPA, Trump is building a swamp.''   Here are some selections:         Donald Trump campaign crowds loved to chant, ``Drain the       Swamp!'' But if ever there was a political swamp creature,       it's Scott Pruitt, the man Trump picked to head the U.S.       Environmental Protection Agency.    The Charleston Gazette-Mail continues:         Pruitt has been a shill for fossil fuel industries since       his days as attorney general in Oklahoma, so maybe he saw       this--  all his self-aggrandizing expenditures--       as his just desserts. But of all the Trump administration       flunkies who have used taxpayer money for their personal       benefit, Pruitt may be the worst.    That is the word from Charleston, WV.   Some of the examples:         [Pruitt] used a loophole in the Safe Drinking Water Act       that's supposed to let the EPA hire experts quickly in a       [drinking water] emergency . . . [to] give tax taxpayer-      funded raises to political lackeys.        [He] took first-class, charter, and military flights that       cost taxpayers $163,000.        He . . . tripled the size of his security detail.        He had the EPA spend $25,000--    I think we actually know that is up to $43,000 now--       to build a soundproof communications booth in his office.    There is nothing more that the EPA Administrator needs than a cone- of-silence soundproof booth in his office--as if he is running the CIA  or something.   They conclude:         There are many reasons why Scott Pruitt shouldn't be       leading the EPA, primarily that he doesn't seem to believe in       science and is more interested in helping big business than,       you know, protecting the environment. But his obvious belief       that taxpayer money and resources are given to him for his       personal benefit is a big reason, as well.    I thank the newspaper in West Virginia for acknowledging that some  conduct is so disgraceful that it goes too far.   When that is the No. 1 person in the EPA, we have no business  confirming this person as the No. 2 person for the EPA.   With that, I see colleagues who, I assume, want to speak in favor of  this nominee, and I will yield the floor to them.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                      Murray Energy Corporation,                                St. Clairsville, OH, March 28, 2017.      Hon. J. Richard Perry,      Secretary, Department of Energy,      Washington, DC.        Dear Secretary Perry: Enclosed is an Action Plan for       achieving reliable and low cost electricity in America and to       assist in the survival of our Country's coal industry, which       is essential to power grid reliability and low cost       electricity.        We are available to assist you in any way that you request.            Sincerely,                                               Robert E. Murray,                                                 Chairman, President      & Chief Executive Officer.                                   ____     Action Plan for Reliable and Low Cost Electricity in America and To           Assist in the Survival of our Country's Coal Industry   Suspend the coal-fired power plant effluent limitation guidelines (ELG)      and coal combustion residuals (CCR) rules of the united states                      environmental protection agency         The compliance deadlines for both regulations must be       suspended. The illegal ELG rule needs to be rescinded. The       CCR regulation need to be rewritten delegating the authority       to the states in light of the new legislation passed in       December.   Implement emergency actions relative to the security and resiliency of                          the electric power grids         The Department of Energy (``DOE'') must issue an emergency       directive to have an immediate study done of the security and       resiliency of our electric power grids. DOE will direct that       no power plants having an available fuel supply of at least       forty-five (45) days be closed during the study period, or a       minimum of two (2) years.                ``Endangerment finding'' for greenhouse gases         There must be a withdrawal and suspension of the       implementation of the so-called ``endangerment finding'' for       greenhouse gases.         EPA's ``endangerment finding'' under the Clean Air Act       serves as the foundation for the agency's far reaching       regulation of the economy in the form of emission limitations       for greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide. The high       degree of uncertainty in the range of data relied upon by EPA       combined with the enormous regulatory costs without       concomitant benefits merit revisiting the ``endangerment       findings''.        According to EPA's finding, the ``root cause'' of recently       observed climate change is ``likely'' the increase in       anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. EPA relied upon       computer-based climate model simulations and a ``synthesis''       of major findings from scientific assessment reports with a       significant range of uncertainty related to temperatures over       25 years. The climate model failures are well documented in       their inability to emulate real-world climate behavior.       Models that are unable to simulate known climate behavior       cannot provide reliable projections of future climate       behavior. As for the scientific assessments underlying the       ``synthesis'' of findings used by EPA, many were not peer       reviewed, and there are multiple instances where portions of       peer reviewed literature germane to the ``endangerment       finding'' were omitted, ignored or unfairly dismissed.    Eliminate the thirty (30) percent production tax credit for windmills                 and solar panels in electricity generation         Electricity generated by windmills and solar panels costs       twenty-six (26) cents per kilowatt hour with a four (4) cent       per kilowatt hour subsidy from the American taxpayers. These       energy sources are unreliable and only available if the wind       blows or the sun shines. Coal-fired electricity costs only       four (4) cents per kilowatt hour. Low cost electricity is a       staple of life, and we must have a level playing field in       electric power generation without the government picking       winners and losers by subsidizing wind and solar power.     Withdraw from the illegal united nations COP 21 Paris climate accord         The United Nation's COP 21 Paris Climate Control Accord, to       which Barrack Obama has already committed one (1) billion       dollars of America's money, is an attempt by the rest of the       world to obtain funding from our Country. It is an illegal       treaty never approved by Congress, and it will have no effect       on the environment.      end the electric utility maximum achievable technology and ozone                                regulations         We have won these issues in the United States Supreme       Court, and these rules must be completely overturned.           Fund the development of certain clean coal technologies         The Federal government must support the development of some       Clean Coal Technologies, including: ultra super critical       combustion; high efficiency, low emission coal firing;       combined cycle coal combustion; and others. It should not       fund so-called carbon capture and sequestration (``CCS''), as       it does not work, practically or economically. Democrats and       some Republicans use CCS as a political cover to insincerely       show that they are proposing something for coal. But, carbon       capture and sequestration is a pseudonym for ``no coal''.        Overhaul the bloated and politicalized mine safety and health               administration of the U.S. Department of Labor         This Federal agency, over the past eight (8) years, has not       been focused on the coal miner safety, but on politics,       bureaucracy, waste, and violation quotas. While coal mine       employment has been cut in half, the Federal Mine Safety and       Health Administration has continued to hire inspectors every       year. But, the government has nowhere to put them. Murray       Energy Corporation received an average of 532 Federal       inspectors per month in 2016.        We must send a Company manager with every one of these       inspectors, taking us away from our employee safety       inspections and safety training.    cut the staff of the U.S. environmental protection agency in at least                                    half         Tens of thousands of government bureaucrats have issued       over 82,000 pages of regulations under Obama, many of them       regarding coal mining and utilization. The Obama EPA, alone,       wrote over 25,000 pages of rules,  [[Page S2094]]       thirty-eight (38) times the words in our Holy Bible.         overturn the recently enacted cross-state air pollution rule         This regulation particularly punishes states in which coal       mining takes place to the benefit of other wealthier east       coast states.    revise the arbitrary coal mine dust regulation of the mine safety and              health administration of the department of labor         This regulation provides no health benefit to our coal       miners, and threatens the destruction of thousands of coal       mining jobs.    obtain legislation to fund both the retiree medical care and pensions        for all of america's united mine workers of america (UMWA)--                     represented, retired coal miners         For four (4) years, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell       has refused to address this issue. Some say that this is       because the UMWA wrongly opposed him in his recent election.       This must be taken care of. And the legislation enacted must       address not just those recently orphaned through company       bankruptcies and mine closures, but the medical benefits and       pensions that were promised to all retired miners by the       Federal government itself.      overturn the mine safety and health administration, department of                     labor, pattern of violations rule         This rule is a punitive action of the Mine Safety and       Health Administration under its Director for the past eight       (8) years, the former Safety Director of a labor union.     appoint justices to the supreme court of the united states who will             follow our united states constitution and our laws         We must offset the liberal appointees who want to redefine       our Constitution and our law.     members of the federal energy regulatory commission must be replaced         The current Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has a       record of favoring actions of the Obama Administration. That       has systematically devalued base load generation as a result       of the Obama ``war on coal''. These actions have put the       future security and reliability of America's electric power       grid at risk. Immediate action needs to be taken to require       organized power markets to value fuel security, fuel       diversity, and ancillary services that only base load       generating assets, especially coal plants, can provide.    members of the tennessee valley authority board of directors must be                                  replaced         The Board of Directors of this government agency has       followed the mandates of the Obama Administration, rather       than assure reliable, low cost electricity for the Tennessee       Valley Authority's rate payers, whom they are mandated to       serve in this manner.     replace the members of the national labor relations board (``nlrb'')         Eliminate the antiemployer bias of the NLRB by appointing       members and staff, particularly in the General Counsel's       office, who will fairly consider the employer's position and       needs and not automatically accede to the unions or unionized       employees in every matter considered.    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:              [From the Charleston Gazette-Mail, Apr. 5, 2018]   Editorial: With Self-Serving Pruitt at EPA, Trump Is Building a Swamp         Donald Trump campaign crowds loved to chant, ``Drain the       swamp!'' But if ever there was a political swamp creature,       it's Scott Pruitt, the man Trump picked to head the U.S.       Environmental Protection Agency. Pruitt has been in the news       most recently for his cozy relationship with the lobbyist for       a Canadian pipeline company. The company, Enbridge Inc.,       received a high recommendation from Pruitt's EPA for an oil       pipeline expansion project.        Enbridge's lobbyist was the firm of Williams & Jensen. The       wife of the firm's chairman owns a pricey condominium in       Washington, D.C., and was letting Pruitt live there for $50 a       night, sometimes joined by his daughter, and Pruitt only had       to pay for the nights he stayed there. That is an       unbelievably sweet deal, and while there's no direct evidence       of a mutual back-scratching, it sure looks that way. On some       level, this is no surprise. Pruitt has been a shill for       fossil fuel industries since his days as attorney general in       Oklahoma, so maybe he saw this as his just desserts. But of       all the Trump administration flunkies who have used taxpayer       money for their personal benefit, Pruitt may be the worst.        Despite the White House telling him not to give large       raises to two employees who followed him from Oklahoma,       Pruitt did it anyway. He used a loophole in the Safe Drinking       Water Act that's supposed to let the EPA hire experts quickly       in an emergency, not give taxpayer-funded raises to political       lackeys. One of those lackeys helped Pruitt find a new place       to live, once the EPA administrator had to leave his       sweetheart condo deal behind. Using publicly funded employees       for such private business is another misuse of taxpayer-      funded resources.        During his first year in office, Pruitt took first-class,       charter and military flights that cost taxpayers $163,000.       according to EPA records provided to the U.S. House Oversight       Committee. Pruitt and a group of aides also socked taxpayers       with a $90,000 bill for a trip to Italy that included a trip       to visit the pope.        Pruitt was flying first-class because of public       confrontations that involved ``vulgar'' and ``threatening       language,'' according to The Washington Post. Pruitt is       clearly very worried about his security; he has tripled the       size of his security detail, and is the first EPA       administration to have 24/7 security--again, at taxpayer       expense. That security detail includes some EPA agents who       would otherwise be investigating environmental crimes, rather       than protecting their snowflake boss. (Pruitt's predecessors.       Gina McCarthy and Lisa Jackson--who were demonized repeatedly       by West Virginia politicians, among others--flew coach, with       a much smaller security presence.)        Maybe Pruitt is just paranoid in general. In September, he       had the EPA spend $25,000--all together now, in taxpayer       money--to build a soundproof communications booth in his       office. He's asked employees not to bring their mobile phones       to meetings with him, and he reportedly prefers not to use       email--no doubt because emails from his time as Oklahoma       attorney general show how much he cozied up to oil and gas       producers. There are many reasons why Scott Pruitt shouldn't       be leading the EPA, primarily that he doesn't seem to believe       in science and is more interested in helping big business       than, you know, protecting the environment. But his obvious       belief that taxpayer money and resources are given to him for       his personal benefit is a big reason, as well.
