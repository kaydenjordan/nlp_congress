 Mr. Speaker, today, I am on the House floor to talk  about a condition that impacts the lives of so many Americans: tuberous  sclerosis complex, or TSC.   I am honored to speak on behalf of the Cardona family, who shared  their child's story with me, and thousands of other families across  America who love a child with TSC.   TSC is a rare genetic disorder that causes tumors to grow on vital  organs, prompting seizures and developmental issues and often delaying  children's progress in school.   Despite its profound impact on American families, TSC often goes  unrecognized.   Research into diseases like TSC benefits countless individuals and  families battling different conditions. It leads to scientific  breakthroughs and discoveries to help cure a wide range of diseases,  making better care and quality of life a reality for so many.   Today, I invite my colleagues to rally behind rare disease research  for conditions like TSC.                            ____________________
