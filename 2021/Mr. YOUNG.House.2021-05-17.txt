 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend Mr. Lucas for his kind  compliments. It is the best I have heard all day.   I thank Ms. Bonamici, the chair of this committee, for bringing this  bill to the floor.   I am excited about it because the oceans and our waterways are  important to our lives. More than anybody recognizes, water is the next  big issue. Oceans do cover 76 percent of our globe. In doing so, if  they get acidified, then we lose the oceans, not only what it provides  to us, but livelihoods to many fishermen in my communities, which is  very, very important.   I am, very frankly, very excited about this legislation. We have to  do more than legislation, though, because the acidification of the  ocean, what causes it, we have to address. Some say it is climate  change. Let's do that. Let's look at why.   I have just been reading a very serious set of articles on e-fuels,  which I was unaware were created by capturing CO2 and making  it into another fuel which is cleaner, especially for maritime fleets.  I am a mariner, and that would be very, very important because they are  one of the more pollutant factors we have, yet they transport world  goods. So we have to address that.   As we pass this legislation, let's really go forth and make sure not  only NOAA has the authority, but make sure they do the job. That is  oversight. That is your job, Madam Chairman. That is what we have to do  to make sure it is done and address the problem.   You talk about your lobster. It is good, but not quite as good as our  salmon, but it is okay. We have to work on that to make sure that we  have a continued sustainable yield that we will be working with.
