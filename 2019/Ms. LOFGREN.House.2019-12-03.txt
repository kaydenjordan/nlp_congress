 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  the bill (H.R. 5277) to amend section 442 of title 18, United States  Code, to exempt certain interests in mutual funds, unit investment  trusts, employee benefit plans, and retirement plans from conflict of  interest limitations for the Government Publishing Office, and ask for  its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.
