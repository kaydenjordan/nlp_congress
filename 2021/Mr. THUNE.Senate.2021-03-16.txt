 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last week I introduced a bill to  permanently repeal the death tax.   I have been pushing to repeal the death tax for a long time because I  have seen the consequences the tax can have for family farms and  ranches and for family businesses. And I am proud that we protected a  lot of family farms and businesses 3 years ago with the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act by doubling the death tax exemption, but the death tax is  still a big problem.   First of all, the change we made to the death tax in the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act isn't permanent. The increased exemption level expires at the  end of 2025.   Second, Democrats, who are always eager to seize any possible revenue  source, have proposed not merely returning the exemption to its  previous level but reducing it even further. And that would be a big  problem for a lot of family farms and businesses.   The death tax is a fundamentally flawed idea, both in theory and in  practice. Every American, of course, has an obligation to pay taxes to  help support our government, but there should be a limit to how many  times the government can tax you. And death should not be a taxable  event.   The money you leave at your death has already been taxed by the  government at least once, which makes the death tax double taxation.   People who support the death tax tend to talk as if the death tax  only affects the fabulously wealthy, but that isn't the case. Small-  and medium-sized businesses, family farms, and ranches spend a lot of  time and money on estate planning to avoid being hit by this tax.  Farmers and ranchers in my State know, without careful and costly  planning, the Federal Government can come around after their death  demanding a staggering 40 percent of their taxable estate, and their  children won't have the money to pay without risking the farm or the  ranch. Why? Well, farming and ranching is often a cash-poor business.   A farmer might, technically, be worth several million dollars, but  the vast majority of that is land and farming equipment. Only a small  fraction of it is money in the bank.   The Farm Bureau reports that over the past 10 years, the value of  farmland has increased by nearly 50 percent. It is completely possible  that a farmer's land might have substantially increased in value over  the past decade, while his income has barely increased at all or, with  commodity prices the past few years, they may have been losing money.  In fact, it is perfectly possible that in a bad year, a farm with  several million dollars' worth of land might barely break even income- wise.   So what happens when a farmer dies? Well, the Federal Government will  claim up to 40 percent of his taxable estate. But his liquid assets--in  other words, the cash he has available--will likely not come close to  covering the tax bill from the Federal Government. And so the only  thing left for his children to do will be to start selling off farm  equipment and land. In some cases, they will be able to keep the farm,  just a smaller version of it. In others, they may have to sell off the  family farm entirely. The same thing can happen with family-owned  businesses.   In the case of a larger family-owned business, the business owner may  be worth $15 or $20 million, but only a small fraction of that may be  money in the bank. The vast majority may be tied up in the business. In  that case, when the Federal Government comes around demanding 40  percent of the taxable estate, all the money that that business owner  had in the bank won't even come close to covering the tax bill.   To pay the Federal Government, the owner's descendants will have to  sell off part or all of the family business. And this can happen again  and again.   Think about a business that was started half a century ago and passed  down from father to daughter, to grandson. With every death, the  Federal Government will have come demanding a big chunk of that estate.  By the time you get to the third generation, the business may be  struggling to stay afloat if it is still around at all.   I recently read testimony from a business owner who stated that,  without death tax reform, the family company will end with him. Why?  Because the company will have to be sold to meet the tax bill the  Federal Government will hand his descendants. The company has already  faced the death tax multiple times in its history and given millions  upon millions to the Federal Government. This next death tax bill will  be the death blow.   I am proud that Republicans improved the death tax situation for a  lot of family farms and businesses by passing estate tax reform in the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but doubling the exemption is not enough. There  are still family farms and businesses out there that aren't protected  from this tax. And in my view, losing even one family farm or ranch or  business to the death tax is one too many, not to mention the fact that  in less than 5 years, the expanded exemption will expire putting many  farms and businesses back in the tax's crosshairs.   Family farms and businesses play a vital role in the economy and in  communities. Family farms and ranches are the lifeblood literally of  rural communities in South Dakota. They are a source of jobs. They  provide support for local businesses. They help build up local schools  and local infrastructure. Losing a local farm can hit rural communities  very hard.   It is mind-boggling that the Federal Government imposes a tax that  punishes all the things we should be encouraging. The death tax  punishes hard work. It punishes success. It punishes innovation.  ``Success'' should not be a dirty word, and families and employees  should not be punished because a family has worked hard and built up a  successful farm or ranch or business.   On top of all this, the death tax is an inefficient tax that raises a  small amount of revenue while placing a very large burden on farmers  and ranchers and small business men and women.   Repealing the death tax is an idea that has won bipartisan support in  the past, including support from more than one sitting Democratic  Senator. I hope it will win bipartisan support in this Congress as  well. And I will continue to fight to ensure that no family farm or  business has to worry about this punishing tax.   I said it before, and I will say it again: One family farm or  business lost is one too many.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
