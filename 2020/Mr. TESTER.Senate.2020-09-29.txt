The bill before us, H.R. 561, seeks to crack down on  the unfair practice of using veteran and service-disabled owned small  businesses as pass-throughs for larger contractors to secure Federal  contracts. I would like to thank Senator Cardin for working diligently  on this issue and for his leadership as ranking member of the Senate  Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. I look forward to  working closely with him to ensure this legislation meets congressional  intent once it is enacted.
