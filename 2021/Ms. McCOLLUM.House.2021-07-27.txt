 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the en bloc  amendments. These across-the-board 20 percent cuts undermine our  historic investments in education, agriculture, housing,  transportation, broadband, and many other priorities for American  families and constituents.   I want to thank Chair DeLauro and my fellow cardinals, as well as our  dedicated committee staff, for their work in crafting a funding package  that will keep our Nation healthy and competitive.   As vice chair of the Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and  Related Agencies, I offer Chair Pingree my congratulations on an  exemplary bill that protects human health and the health of our  environment. In line with longstanding bipartisan tradition, this  Interior bill provides funding to meet our Federal investments and  treaty obligations to our Native brothers and sisters and Alaska  Natives. The substantial increases in this bill are for the Bureau of  Indian Affairs, the Bureau of Indian Education, and the Indian Health  Service, and it would all be lost with this 20 percent across-the-board  cut.   This amendment would slash funding for clean water and drinking water  infrastructure, even as our Nation faces a historic drought and  contamination from PFOS and lead.   As chair of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I hear from my  colleagues' concerns about national security funding, but the health  and wellness of the American people, improving our economy, and  educating our workforce are all critical components of a strong Nation,  and that is the foundation of strong national security.   Every dollar we invest on the domestic side in infrastructure, public  health, and climate change contributes to our national security. If we  truly mean to safeguard our Nation and its people, we need the  investments made in these nondefense bills as well.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose these reckless across- the-board 20 percent cuts.
