 Mr. Chairman, I rise today during National Police Week  in strong support of the Federal Law Enforcement Officer Service Weapon  Purchase Act.   This bill, which I was proud to help move through the Judiciary  Committee, is a practical measure and a declaration of our unwavering  support for the Nation's law enforcement officers. They are the bedrock  of our communities, and they ensure peace, order, and safety.   By allowing Federal officers the opportunity to purchase retired  service weapons, we can save taxpayer dollars and ensure officers have  firearms with which they are the most comfortable.   This bill and others like it this week present a clear question: Will  we stand up for our police or will we stand idly by as unwarranted and  inappropriate criticism continues to be thrown their way?   I know what my answer is. I stand with our police.   I extend my gratitude to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Fry),  my colleague and good friend, for introducing this bill. I urge my  colleagues to join me in voting in favor of this bill.   Let's send an unmistakable message to our law enforcement officers  across this Nation: We see you. We appreciate you. We stand by you. I  particularly thank my friends and individuals in law enforcement that  I've known so well over so many years in the great State of New Jersey  for the work that they do. I am proud of them. I am proud of what they  represent, and I am thankful for their sacrifice.
