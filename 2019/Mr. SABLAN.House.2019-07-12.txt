 Madam Speaker, good news for the Northern Mariana Islands  and all the insular areas: The Territories Health Care Improvement Act  was introduced on Tuesday, addressing the Medicaid cliff our areas face  when special ObamaCare funding ends this year.   Thursday, the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee reported the  bill without dissent. ``Let's keep it moving,'' Chair Eshoo said. I  believe full committee Chairman Pallone intends to do so as well.   I thank them both and Ranking Members Burgess and Walden for  understanding the urgency of the Medicaid crisis in the insular areas.  I also thank Mr. Soto and Mr. Bilirakis, who led the bill along with  myself and seven bipartisan cosponsors.   It provides exactly what the Northern Mariana Islands Medicaid  director testified she needed: $60 million per year. No local match is  required as we recover from last year's typhoons. After 6 years, we  will get the FMAP any State is offered.   There are new program integrity requirements that I support because  every Federal dollar should go to those intended, without fraud or  waste.   So, healthcare in the insular areas can be as good as healthcare  anywhere in America. That is good news.                            ____________________
