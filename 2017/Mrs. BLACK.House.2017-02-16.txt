 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 123, I call up  the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 43) providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the  final rule submitted by Secretary of Health and Human Services relating  to compliance with title X requirements by project recipients in  selecting subrecipients, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 123, the joint  resolution is considered read.   The text of the joint resolution is as follows:                                H.J. Res. 43         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress       disapproves the rule submitted by the Secretary of Health and       Human Services relating to compliance with title X       requirements by project recipients in selecting subrecipients       (81 Fed. Reg. 91852; December 19, 2016), and such rule shall       have no force or effect.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black)  and the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette) each will control 30  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.J. Res. 43, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Tennessee?   There was no objection.                                time  1345     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.J. Res. 43, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Tennessee?   There was no objection.                                time  1345     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my resolution of  disapproval, H.J. Res. 43, which uses the authority of the  Congressional Review Act to overturn the Obama administration's 11th- hour rule forcing States like Tennessee to fund abortion providers.   I want to begin today by stipulating very clearly what this  resolution is about because, while I am unapologetically pro-life, you  don't have to be in order to support this resolution. You just have to  believe in the Tenth Amendment.   Despite the histrionics you may hear on the other side of the aisle  today, with today's resolution, we are not, we are not, one, voting to  defund Planned Parenthood in any way, shape, or form; we are not voting  to cut title X funding; and we are not voting to restrict abortion  rights.   Madam Speaker, we are simply voting today to affirm the rights of  States to fund the healthcare providers that best suit their needs,  without fear of reprisal from their own Federal Government.   I didn't realize this was a partisan issue. It shouldn't be, because  that is how the title X grant program functioned for more than 45  years, until the Obama administration decided to leave this parting  gift to abortion industry on its way out the door.   For me, this is a personal issue. As a registered nurse, I know that  vulnerable women seeking true comprehensive care deserve better than  abortion-centric facilities like Planned Parenthood. So, as a State  legislator, I worked within my authority to make sure that Tennessee  honored the will of  [[Page H1269]]  our pro-life populace and steered our State's share of title X dollars  away from healthcare providers that performed abortion.   As a result, our share of title X grants have been sent exclusively  to the Tennessee Department of Health, which then allocates them to the  county health departments and other qualified providers that protect  the lives of the most vulnerable. That was Tennessee's right, and it  has been able to exercise that right while protecting access to  comprehensive care for those who are most in need.   As a matter of fact, according to HHS' own 2015 title X Family  Planning Annual Report, our State provided care under title X to more  than 75,000 Tennesseeans. That means that we served even more citizens  than the more populated States like Michigan and Virginia.   But in December of last year, the Obama administration decided to  intervene, setting unprecedented new parameters on how States must  select title X grantees that were specifically designed to prop up its  political allies in the abortion industry.   With my resolution, I am proposing that we go back just a few short  weeks prior to December 15, 2016, the day before the Obama  administration decided to reconfigure this 45-year-old program with its  ill-conceived order. That is all my resolution does is to take us back  45 years to the way the program has operated.   I urge my colleagues to give States the freedom and the flexibility  to take care of their citizens the best way that they know how by  voting ``yes'' on this H.J. Res. 43.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Madam Speaker, we are not even a full month into the new Presidency.  Yet, the President and the Republicans in Congress have already  launched numerous attacks on women's health and access to care. Here's  just a few of the examples aside from today.   They are charging ahead to dismantle the Affordable Care Act without  making any promises to preserve the vital protections for women that  are in that bill.   They imposed and dramatically expanded the global gag rule, which  harms women's access to health care around the world.   And just after the historic Women's March, House Republicans passed  H.R. 7, an extreme bill that effectively bans private insurance  companies from covering comprehensive healthcare services.   But here we are again today, with another bill that threatens access  to family planning care for millions of our most vulnerable citizens by  attacking title X. Title X is the only Federal program dedicated solely  to family planning, which includes a range of services that help women  and their partners prepare for pregnancy and ensure healthy spacing  between births.   Title X helps 4 million people who are uninsured. Title X centers  also play an important role in reducing unintended pregnancy, and title  X centers are also major points of access in our safety net.   Six in 10 women who go to a title X center consider it their major  source of health care. What this rule that Republicans want to roll  back does is it simply reinforces longstanding requirements that say  that States cannot discriminate against providers for reasons that are  unrelated to their qualifications to perform family planning services  when distributing title X funding. In other words, if an organization  provides abortions with its own private money but it qualifies for  title X, it can still get that funding.   Now I keep hearing from my colleagues that this violates states'  rights, but that completely ignores how Federal programs work.  Virtually all Federal funding opportunities require a State to adhere  to certain standards to ensure policy goals are met, and that is  exactly what this rule did.   Republicans will also argue that community health centers can fill  all the gaps created and accessed by denying these centers title X  funding. This claim has been debunked on numerous occasions.   For example, in 21 percent of counties with a Planned Parenthood  center, Planned Parenthood is the only safety net provider in the area.  That is why the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated, if  Planned Parenthood were defunded, as many as 390,000 women would lose  access to care, and 650,000 women would have reduced access. That is  why repealing this rule is a serious problem.    Just this afternoon I read a quote, and here's what it said:  ``Patients and doctors should be making the big decisions--not  government bureaucrats.''   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.   Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.   Let me say that again. ``Patients and doctors should be making the  big decisions--not government bureaucrats.''   Who said this?   Margaret Sanger? No.   Cecile Richards? No.   Hillary Clinton? No.   The person who said this this afternoon is the Speaker of the House,  Paul Ryan. I couldn't agree with him any more when it comes to title X  family planning money. This should be made by patients and their  doctors, not by bureaucrats in Washington.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Smith), who has been a champion for life and been  fighting for life for a long time.   Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank the gentlewoman for her  extraordinary leadership on the life issue.   Madam Speaker, subsidized by over $500 million taxpayer dollars each  year, Planned Parenthood dismembers or chemically poisons a baby to  death every 2 minutes, killing over 7 million innocent children since  1973.   Undercover videos in 2015 exposed, in numbing candor, several high- level Planned Parenthood leaders nonchalantly talking about procuring  children's organs for a price. They describe altering gruesome  dismemberment procedures to preserve intact livers, hearts, and lungs  from freshly killed babies.   All of this begs the question, Madam Speaker, why are U.S. taxpayers  giving half a billion dollars each year to Planned Parenthood?   H.J. Res. 43 simply allows States to redirect funds away from  abortion clinics and does not reduce funding for title X by so much as  a penny. Those funds are just redirected to other health clinics that  provide women's health care and don't engage in abortion.   In mid-December, on his way out the door, former President Obama  finalized a rule that coerces States to fund Planned Parenthood with  their title X money.   Prior to the Obama rule, States had chosen, five of them, to award  title X funds to non-Planned Parenthood entities. These five States,  Tennessee, Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Ohio, account for nearly $16  million in annual title X funding and serve over 279,000 individuals a  year. These five States redirected those funds to other health clinics.   But under the Obama rule, these State recipients are threatened with  losing all--I say again--all of their title X support if they do not  comply. This is the definition of coercion.   The Obama administration essentially told States: You must use your  family planning dollars to support abortionists, or we will take away  your family planning dollars.   I thank the gentlewoman for her courage, for her insight, and for  offering this rule for our consideration today.   Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the ranking member of the House Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Marshall), a freshman and a physician.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Messer), who is the chairman of our Republican Study  Committee.

Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), chair of our Values Action Team.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Thomas J. Rooney).   Mr. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida. Madam Speaker, as one of his final  acts in office, President Obama issued a rule requiring that States  give title X family planning fund grants to abortion providers like  Planned Parenthood.   States have always had the autonomy to distribute these grants to  providers that they choose. Obama took that freedom away from States by  requiring them to directly fund abortions under the false assertion  that this provides women with greater access to health care. That is  just not true.   What people seem to forget is that for every 1 Planned Parenthood  facility in the United States, there are 20 federally funded community  health centers that stand ready and eager to provide health services to  women and don't perform abortions.   States should be able to make their own healthcare decisions. By  passing this resolution, we return that power to the States.   Ms. DeGETTE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Frankel), the chair of the Democratic Women's Working  Group.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Banks), one of our freshman Members.    Madam Speaker, I must, once again, talk about what this  resolution really does. This resolution empowers States. It empowers  States that are able to choose to invest in women's health care over  abortion by sending those title X dollars to clinics that do not  destroy innocent life. My colleagues on the other side talked about how  this is destructive to women's health. I want to just mention that the  true destruction to women's health is abortion. That is the little girl  who is aborted that will never know about being a woman.   This bill does nothing to prohibit States from deciding where to best  use their dollars, but in States such as mine in Tennessee for the last  6 years, who have made that decision to send their dollars to  facilities that they believe give the best women's health care,  comprehensive health care, to over 75,000 women in our State, more than  many States that surround us that have larger populations.   If this were prohibiting women from getting services, we wouldn't be  so successful with providing services to more than 75,000 women in our  State. We haven't seen a decrease in services. We have seen an increase  in services. If you were to ask these women what they thought about  services that they are getting in these other facilities such as  Department of Health and federally qualified health centers, you would  see they are very satisfied because they get comprehensive services  that go beyond what places like Planned Parenthood can even provide for  them. They do mammograms, they do procedures if there are cancer cells  found in a woman's cervix.   So this whole ruse that this is a war on women and that we are taking  away women's right to healthcare services is a ruse. All this does is  to say, if a State like Tennessee decides this is the best place to  give the best quality of care for a woman, and hopefully their babies  and their children--which, if you go to these clinics, you will see  them all running around, they have life--it just gives them the choice  to do that.   Don't take away that choice from my State. Don't punish my State  because we do what we believe is the best thing for women's health.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. DeGETTE.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I include in the Record letters from March for Life Action, Christian  Medical and Dental Associations, and United States Conference of  Catholic Bishops.                                          March for Life Action,                                  Washington, DC, February 15, 2017.      Representative,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of March for Life Action and       the hundreds of thousands of our supporters and fellow       marchers, I urge you to vote in favor of H.J. Res. 43.,       sponsored by Rep. Diane Black (R-TN). When H.J. Res. 43 comes       to the House floor for a vote we will be scoring the vote in       our annual scorecard for the First Session of the 115th       Congress.        In the waning days of his Administration President Barack       Obama, using his power at Health and Human Services, issued a       rule that locked down federal grants for abortion-giant       Planned Parenthood but also usurped state's rights by       blocking states seeking to defund the abortion industry and       redirect funds to county health departments, community health       centers and other clinics that put women's health above an       abortion agenda.        H.J. Res. 43 does not reduce funds for family planning, but       allows states to assure that taxpayer funds do not support or       underwrite abortion providers when so many Americans have       ethical reservations about this procedure. The time has come       for a clean break between government support of family       planning activities and abortion.        Again, on behalf of March for Life Action, I strongly       encourage your vote for H.J. Res. 43. March for Life Action       will score this vote in our annual scorecard.            Sincerely,                                                   Thomas McClusky,      Vice President of Government Affairs.                                   ____                                                 Christian Medical &                                             Dental Associations,                                      Bristol, TN, January 16, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McConnell: Thank you       for your strong, principled and common-sense leadership on       the issue of preventing American tax dollars from funding       abortion on demand. Thank you also for your commitment to       providing healthcare access to the poor and other vulnerable       patients in need.        On behalf of the over 18,000 members of the Christian       Medical Association, we urge you to:        1. ensure the reallocation of funding currently used by       abortion-performing, partisan political organizations such as       Planned Parenthood, by directing that funding instead to the       over 13,000 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and       Rural Health Centers (RHCs); and,        2. overturn, through the Congressional Review Act, the US       Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) rule finalized       December 19, 2016, titled ``Compliance with Title X       Requirements by Project Recipients in Selecting       Subrecipients,'' in order to ensure that states are allowed       to take a similar direction in allocating federal funding.        Many of our members serve in federally funded centers that       focus on providing care to patients regardless of who the       patient is or what the patient's values, orientation,       ethnicity or any other qualities may be. As you know well,       needy patients depend on these centers and on physicians like       our members to provide healthcare when likely no one else       would provide healthcare for them. FQHCs provide       comprehensive services and a ``medical home'' for whole       families and work in the areas of most critical need.        According to the independent government watchdog GAO in       2012, FQHCs served 21 million individuals and provided       services including STD testing, cancer screening and       contraceptive management, as well as other services including       immunizations and general child wellness exams. FQHCs and       RHCs often meet patient needs on modest budgets, and those       who serve in these centers often do so at great personal       financial sacrifice. Unlike Planned Parenthood, which follows       an aggressive business plan designed to maximize profits on       services such as abortion, these centers exist for the       purpose of serving the nation's most needy patients.        Yet some medical groups like the American Congress of       Obstetricians and Gynecologists, whose pro-abortion ideology       aligns with Planned Parenthood and whose members profit       personally from working with Planned Parenthood, decry       ``political interference in the patient-physician       relationship.'' This cry comes, oddly enough, while applying       pressure on politicians to fund political groups like Planned       Parenthood. It is also worth observing what sources such as       the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics and PolitiFact       National have confirmed--that Planned Parenthood spends       millions of dollars each year for one partisan purpose: to       elect Democrats and defeat Republicans.        It's hard to get more political than that, and it's       impossible to get more politically partisan than that.        The majority of Americans do not want their tax dollars to       subsidize abortion, and they certainly do not want their tax       dollars to subsidize an abortion-performing partisan       political machine. Because of the strong concern of American       taxpayers, existing federal law addresses direct funding of       abortion. However, the fungible nature of federal grants to       Planned Parenthood means that every American's tax dollars,       regardless of their convictions about abortion, are being       used to prop up the abortion industry.        Any organization that wishes to avoid political       entanglement can do so quite easily--by simply foregoing       government funding. Those who seek funding should expect       federal and/or state oversight, requirements and standards.        Even the most modest of standards should disqualify from       federal funding organizations such as Planned Parenthood,       given the recent findings of the Select Investigative Panel       on Infant Lives, the list of 15 criminal and regulatory       referrals made by the Panel, and the referral by the Senate       Committee on the Judiciary to the FBI and the Department of       Justice for investigation and potential prosecution.        If any organization can and should do without federal       funding, the billion-dollar, corrupt abortion business       Planned Parenthood is a prime example.        We respectfully urge you to reallocate American tax dollars       away from such profit-centered, divisive and partisan       organizations and provide funding instead to patient-      centered, non-controversial and nonpartisan Federally       Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and Rural Health Centers       (RHCs). And we urge you to ensure that states can do the       same, applying reasonable state standards and requirements to       those who seek to use taxpayer funds. Thank you very much for       your consideration of these views, and for your leadership on       this issue.            Sincerely,                                David Stevens, MD, MA (Ethics) CEO.  [[Page H1278]]                                          ____          United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Secretariat             of Pro-Life Activities,                                 Washington, DC, February 14, 2017.        Dear Representative: I write on behalf of the U.S.       Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Pro-Life       Activities to urge your support for H.J. Res 43. This       resolution of disapproval would nullify former President       Obama's final rule relating to compliance with Title X       requirements by project recipients. 81 Fed. Reg. 91852 (Dec.       19, 2016). The stated purpose of this rule change is to       prevent states from excluding providers such as Planned       Parenthood from sub-awards based on state criteria, such as a       requirement that sub-recipients provide comprehensive primary       and preventive care in addition to family planning services.        The Title X rule change is bad public policy and should be       nullified for several reasons. First, it is deeply troubling       to many Americans that Planned Parenthood, the nation's       largest abortion network (performing over a third of all       abortions), receives more than half a billion taxpayer       dollars per year. This concern has rightly grown with       revelations about Planned Parenthood's willingness to traffic       in fetal tissue from abortions, and to alter abortion methods       not for any reason related to women's health but to obtain       more ``intact'' organs. Additionally, a recent revelation       that the vast majority of Planned Parenthood facilities do       not provide prenatal services provides additional evidence of       its bias toward providing and promoting abortion.        Second, the Department of Health and Human Service's stated       objective in preventing states from ensuring the seamless       delivery of comprehensive care places the Department in a       self-contradictory position. Last year in the Nation's       highest court, HHS touted the seamless coverage of health       services as a virtue. Indeed, the Department argued that       seamlessness is a government interest of the highest order,       sufficient to outweigh constitutionally and statutorily       protected religious objections.        In this new rule, however, HHS takes the opposite position,       saying that the seamless provision of services is an ill to       be avoided. The present rule would ensure that the provision       of care is fragmented, rather than seamless, because it would       undermine state requirements that sub-recipients provide       primary and preventive care in addition to family planning.       Seamlessness cannot at one and the same time be a government       interest of the highest order when it disadvantages religious       organizations, but an affirmative ill to be avoided when it       disadvantages Planned Parenthood.        Third, states may have other reasonable and persuasive       grounds for disqualifying entities from sub-awards that go       beyond the ability of such entities to ``provide Title X       services'' as the rule states (81 Fed. Reg. at 91860). For       example, a sub-award applicant may have been involved in       fraudulent practices, or the applicant or its stakeholders       may even have committed a crime, bearing on the applicant's       fitness and suitability for a sub-award. Indeed, the       requirements for federal awards and sub-awards in general are       typically accompanied by all sorts of standards, many of       which are imposed by the federal government itself, and those       standards often have little or nothing to do with the ability       to provide services (governmental guidelines are replete with       such requirements). States may also have widely differing       standards for sub-awardees based on the states' own policy       judgment. Therefore, it should be permissible for states to       decline to make a sub-award when the sub-awardee does not       meet applicable criteria, whether federal or state, even if       the entity is, strictly speaking, able to ``provide Title X       services.'' Those criteria, of course, themselves remain       subject to applicable federal and state law.        For each of these reasons, we urge you to support H.J. Res.       43.            Sincerely,      Timothy Cardinal Dolan,        Chairman, Committee on Pro-Life Activities, United States       Conference of Catholic Bishops.     Madam Speaker, the 10th Amendment of the Constitution  reads pretty clearly to me: ``The powers not delegated to the United  States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are  reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.''   I understand that there is a diversity of views represented in this  Chamber on matters of health care and human life. I am not asking my  colleagues to set those views aside with this vote. I am simply asking  them not to substitute their judgment for the will of the States.   With this resolution, we are letting States care for their citizens  the best way they know, just as they have had that ability for the past  45 years, and we are maintaining access to care for women and families.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this resolution.   I yield back the balance of my time.
