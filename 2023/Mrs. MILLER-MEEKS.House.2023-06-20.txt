 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to  President Biden's student loan bailout. As Iowans know, a loan taken  out is a loan that must be repaid. Democrats and the  [[Page H2971]]  Biden administration are continuing to push to forgive student loans,  which results in those costs being transferred to other hardworking  taxpayers.   This decision is irresponsible, it is unfair, and it undercuts  students who work to afford tuition and parents who, for years,  sacrificed and saved for the opportunity of a college education.  Student loans shouldn't be viewed any differently than a mortgage or a  car loan. Money taken out must be paid back by those who benefit.   Moving forward, it is crucial that we ensure our students are  equipped with the guidance needed to make an informed decision, and  that they understand the process to pay these loans back.   If we can help our students understand the process and the ultimate  cost of Federal student loans, they will use this information in making  wiser decisions.                             PTSD Awareness Month     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Month.   PTSD affects tens of thousands of Americans who are diagnosed every  year. Sadly, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs, PTSD is  more common among female veterans.   As a veteran, physician, and a member of the House Veterans' Affairs  Committee, I know the realities of the battlefield and the importance  of having adequate access and tools to mental health services that  address the experiences our veterans face.   I was proud to work across the aisle with my colleagues to introduce  the Veteran Care Improvement Act of 2023 that provides our veterans  with increased treatment and rehabilitative services.   As Members of Congress, we have the ability to take action, and I  urge all of my colleagues to support the mental health of our veterans  and servicemembers through passing the Brandon Act.                           Recognizing Keaton Winn     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Keaton Winn  of Ollie, Iowa, for being promoted to the San Francisco Giants' major  league roster. Keaton attended Pekin High School in my district where  he was a standout baseball, basketball, and football player. He then  took his talents to Iowa Western Community College where he earned  first team all-conference honors as a freshman pitcher.   Keaton was drafted by the Giants in 2018 and spent his next years  working through their minor league system. He had a breakout season in  2022 before finally getting the call to the major leagues on June 12 of  this year. He made his first appearance 1 day later, throwing four  innings and becoming the first Giants pitcher to earn a save in his  major league debut.   Keaton's accomplishments are a testament to his unwavering  dedication, perseverance, and exceptional skills on the baseball  diamond. He serves as a shining example for young athletes across Iowa  who aspire to play their sport at the highest level.                        Every State is a Border State     Mr. Speaker, President Biden's and the extreme  House Democrats' open border policies have incentivized a historic  surge in illegal immigration at our southern and northern borders.  Every State is now a border state.   Blue sanctuary cities and States are now using elementary and  secondary school facilities to provide shelter for these illegal  immigrants. This deprives students of opportunities to learn, both  physically and intellectually, as well as puts them physically at risk  when background checks are not conducted.   This week, we will be voting on my resolution, H. Res. 461, which  condemns the use of elementary and secondary school facilities to  provide shelter for illegal aliens who are not admitted to the United  States.   Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment to wish my brother Richard a  happy birthday. Happy birthday, Rick.                            ____________________
