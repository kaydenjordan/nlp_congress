 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate and thank the young chairman  of the Homeland Security Committee, the gentleman from Austin, Texas,  who has had the responsibility and the authority vested in him as  chairman of the committee to make sure that we look at, approach, and  correct the problems that we have at our borders. I want to thank the  distinguished gentleman for his years of service not only to the  Department of Justice, but to the American people and the rule of law.   Mr. Speaker, every day we in Texas and around the United States deal  with crime, drugs, and gangs that are streaming into the United States  from our southern border. Both Chairman McCaul and I recognize that the  challenge that we have ahead of us here in Washington is not only to  support and defend our Constitution, but it is actually to defend  people who live back home, wherever they might be in the United States.   No part of the United States is safe if our southern border is not  effectively taken care of. That is why we are here today with a bill  that addresses this issue even further. That issue is that we must  secure our borders to halt the flow of drugs that come into our  country.    We recognize that one of the most vulnerable piece parts that has  been talked about today and that is known by law enforcement is that of  the use of tunnels, which evade not only the sight of law enforcement,  but take place under the secrecy of those who would intend to bring  illegal drugs, narcotics, people, and other unspecified but dangerous  items into this country.   These tunnels are difficult to detect without sophisticated equipment  or intelligence that advises law enforcement not only where they are,  but how they might discover them. Said another way, cartels and  criminals are one step ahead of the good guys, our law enforcement.   Just last month, United States Homeland Security agents discovered a  600-foot-long drug tunnel running between a private home in Mexico and  an abandoned food restaurant in Arizona. Near the tunnel, they  discovered--as has been talked about here today and it is worth  repeating--261 pounds of methamphetamines, 14 pounds of cocaine, 45  pounds of heroin, and almost 7 pounds of fentanyl. That is enough to  have supplied over 3 million people with dosage units that could cause  them not only harm, but also take their life.   Working with Chairman Michael McCaul, our young chairman from Austin,  Texas, I am pleased to inform you that earlier this month we introduced  H.R. 6740, the Border Tunnel Task Force Act. This bill will enhance not  only law enforcement--Federal, State, and local law enforcement--but  also Tribal law enforcement with the ability that they need to make  sure that these cross-border-related threats are taken care of  properly.   First of all, the task force will look at the issue and understand  how these cartels and drug gangs make these tunnels, where they make  them, and when they make them.   Secondly, the task force will ensure that they are looking out and  working together.   Specifically, this legislation requires the Department of Homeland  Security to establish a Border Tunnel Task Force, which would be  comprised of personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, known  as CBP; U.S. Border Patrol; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,  known as ICE; and Homeland Security investigators. These groups would  work together on border issues where enhanced information could be  shared and law enforcement action would contribute to our border  security missions.   It is my hope that the establishment of these law enforcement groups  will help facilitate not only teamwork among Federal, State, local, and  Tribal officials, but they will also help execute coordinated  activities to crack down on gangs that continue to seek ways to do  their illegal trade and business along our border which places  Americans at risk.   In closing, I would like to once again thank Chairman McCaul and his  Homeland Security Committee, its members on a bipartisan basis, and  their staff for recognizing that this is a true threat against the  United States of America, our citizens, and perhaps our most  vulnerable, our children.   Their work in protecting our country is paramount, and so I urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 6740, the Border Tunnel Task Force Act, a  bill that will encourage, help, and strengthen law enforcement in this  activity. It will protect the United States of America and protect  American families from drug cartels and drug trafficking.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the young chairman for his hard work and  also the gentleman from Louisiana, who recognized, on a bipartisan  basis, that we must protect our homeland.                                time  1430    Mr. Speaker, DHS's Border Tunnel Task Forces have been effective at  identifying and closing tunnels through which smugglers illicitly move  drugs, launder money, and other contraband into the United States. As  such, I support these task forces, but would note that there are two  20-foot-high fences--or ``wall'' as the President likes to call them-- near the U.S.-Mexico border in San Luis, Arizona, the town where a  tunnel was discovered under an abandoned restaurant last month.   Logic tells you that when smugglers cannot easily move goods or  people over or through physical barriers, they will tunnel underneath.   Importantly, the measure under consideration today includes language  offered by Representative Vela, the ranking member of the Border and  [[Page H8750]]  Maritime Security Subcommittee, to require DHS to determine whether  border barriers impact the proliferation of cross-border tunnels.   With DHS having dedicated nearly $9 million over the past decade to  remediating and countering cross-border tunnel threats, DHS needs to  know whether its wall agenda is driving more illicit cross-border  tunnels.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6740, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished  gentleman, who spent his career not only as a sheriff, but a duly- elected constitutional Member in Florida, but also to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Houston, Texas, who has served as an attorney serving  the people of Houston, Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to make sure that as we respectfully  address this issue, H. Con. Res. 72, which urges States to look at  improved family court proceedings of child custody cases, ensuring that  child safety is a top priority, it makes clear that Congress will use  its oversight authority to engage in this issue also.   We do not come at this issue lightly, Mr. Speaker. As a matter of  fact, the Domestic Violence Legal Empowerment and Appeals Project has  provided a great deal of information, not only to Members of Congress,  but by visiting the Members, making sure that they understand that  their work with the Center for Judicial Excellence and the Protective  Parents Association of California have made sure that they saw these  issues clearly and talked to Members of Congress about our ideas, not  only as we fund Federal programs, but as we understand in our  discussions with States that we prioritize and help them look at what  is, seemingly, a national crisis.   This national crisis is about how our children are dealt with in the  court system and looked at. Specifically, this is a concurrent  resolution that urges States to develop family court procedures to  resolve claims of abuse and family violence before making any other  determination in the case, allowing courts to focus on these  allegations affecting child safety independently.                                time  2000    What did I just say? Well, what I just said is many times in court  proceedings where there is a family violence circumstance, where there  is stress in a family, there are examples that either side might talk  about what is in the best interest of the child.   And courts across this country, whether at their local court, whether  a state court, we are asking them to understand that this national  crisis deals with children that are being placed in a circumstance that  might not be in their best interest, and it calls on States to prohibit  the use of discredited or unscientific theories in their family courts.  In other words, there are many times provisions in a court or a bias of  a court to take one side or the other.   Finally, it highlights the problems that some litigants--these are  people back in their own home States--face regarding mandatory fees,  and Congress is asking the States to look at these.   Many times, as the distinguished gentlewoman from Houston talked  about, there are fee structures which keep families from fully  participating to protect their children because of the cost. This is an  important issue.   Tragically, millions of children are impacted in the United States of  America. They call it domestic violence or child abuse, but the bottom  line is that the resulting harm is lasting to our children. Physical,  sexual, or emotional abuse, this trauma stays with our children for  some period of time and many times it lasts for a lifetime.   It also imposes billions of dollars on society where these children  need to be handled, dealt with, and worked through a system for them to  understand what happened in their childhood would create some  difficulties later in their life.   Simply put, we believe that family courts need better expertise.  Better expertise not only in terms of the legal counsel that is  involved, but perhaps outside professionals who would address these  issues.   In my home State of Texas, we have had to reevaluate the  circumstances, not just of divorce, but of domestic violence where a  child is involved, trying to focus more directly on the needs of the  child and then having that family, two sides for sure, who would come  together to see what is in the best interest of that child.   Family courts need to address abuse, and once again, many times it is  not uncommon for them to have to address these through the frailties of  a system, frailties of people who give testimony, and perhaps theories  that are not always in the best interest of the child that might be  proposed in court.   So one story in particular has it of a young girl named Kyra who  tragically lost her life at the age of 2 in 2016 while her family was  going through the court system. The focus became the battle, not the  child, and the child fell in between the processes and, unfortunately,  the tragedy occurred because of this huge disagreement between the  family to where her father brutally murdered her before setting the  house on fire and killing himself.   The tragedy involved, rather than highlighting the differences  between these two, of the safety of the child. And the safety of the  child and of the mother is vitally important.   At least 653 child murders by a parent involved in a divorce,  separation, custody, or visitation, child support have been documented  in the United States over the last 10 years. That is a tragedy. That is  a nightmare that is happening directly before us.   This is why we believe that listening to outside groups, such as the  Domestic Violence Legal Empowerment and Appeals Project and the  Judicial Excellence Coalition have come to Congress to say, we would  like for you to see what is happening back in your States, back in your  communities, back where you are from, Members of Congress, and see if  you can shine a spotlight on showing how important children and women  are, not just in our society, but in the court system.   So what I would say is I would like to thank my colleagues, the  gentleman who started this, the gentleman from Pennsylvania,  Congressman Pat Meehan, for his dedication to this issue, as well as my  dear friend from New York, Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney,  [[Page H8847]]  for her leadership as she has joined me on so many issues where we deal  with women's health and women's safety, children's health, children's  safety, including disabled children and people who cannot protect  themselves.   Mr. Speaker, whether you live in Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, or  wherever you might be in this country, it is important for us to  understand that the focus on children's safety in court matters is  essential to the Nation's health and support for the future.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished gentleman and the  chairman of the committee, Chairman Goodlatte, for allowing this to  come forth at this time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Florida for  yielding me this time.
