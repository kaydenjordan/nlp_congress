 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding to me.   Madam Speaker, we all remember where we were on that fateful day of  Tuesday, September 11, 2001. Today, we finally make permanent our  Nation's commitment to care for the heroes of  9/11 and their families.   We all know that within the first few seconds of the horrific attacks  on the World Trade Center, our brave first responders rushed toward the  wreckage to help their fellow Americans. As has been said before, many  of the  9/11 first responders and the survivors are now living with serious  illnesses due to toxic pollutants that filled the air surrounding  Ground Zero. Many of those friends and advocates are no longer with us.   Congress created the Victim Compensation Fund in 2001, which  committed to those Americans and their families that we will take care  of those who rushed to the scene. I was proud to be an original  cosponsor of the initial bill and its subsequent reauthorizations in  2010 and 2015.   Today, H.R. 1327 keeps Congress' promise to our 9/11 responders and  survivors.   I have never seen the New York delegation work this hard and together  as we did for this bill. I thank Mr. Nadler, Mrs. Maloney, and all the  people for the hard work and their leadership on this. We hope it gets  passed soon in the other body.
