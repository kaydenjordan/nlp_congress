 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  ranking member for yielding me this time.   Last week when I saw the vote calendar for this week and I saw on it  was a schedule to vote on the balanced budget amendment, I actually  laughed out loud. I assumed that it was surely a joke, because there is  no way the Republican majority, just a few months after voting for a  $1.9 trillion tax cut that would add more to the national debt than any  other single vote in my lifetime, surely they wouldn't have the nerve  to come back a few months later and, with a straight face, be pushing a  balanced budget amendment. Yet it turns out it wasn't a joke. Here we  are.                                time  1300    Mr. Speaker, my fellow Americans, this is part of a two-pronged  attack. Part one of that two-pronged attack was the $1.9 trillion tax  cut--83 percent of which goes to the richest 1 percent. Part two is to  stand up here and say: Oh, my goodness, we suddenly have a debt  problem. It must be because we are spending too much. And part two  calls for pushing through a draconian bill that would mandate trillions  of dollars of cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP,  veterans programs, and other critical spending.   Here are the statistics. Under this legislation, by 2028, $2.6  trillion would be cut from Social Security; $1.7 trillion cut from  Medicare; $1.2 trillion cut from Medicaid, CHIP and the ACA; and  finally, $250 billion cut from veterans disability.   We cannot afford these draconian cuts. We must stand up and reject  this laughable attempt to simply push through the largest cuts in  American history. We must say ``no.''
