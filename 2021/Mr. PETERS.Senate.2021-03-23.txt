 Mr. President, I rise in support of Shalanda Young's  nomination to be Deputy Director of the Office of Management and  Budget.   Ms. Young is a proven leader, a dedicated public servant with the  experience and the expertise needed to tackle the challenges facing OMB  and our Nation.   Not only does Ms. Young bring a deep knowledge of the budget process  and government operations, but she has a long track record of working  successfully across the aisle.   During her 14 years as a senior staff member on the House  Appropriations Committee, she worked tirelessly to find a bipartisan  path forward on many critical issues.   She played a key role in ending past government shutdowns and in  negotiating last year's bipartisan coronavirus relief legislation.   Since President Biden announced Ms. Young's nomination, Members and  staff, both Democrats and Republicans, have enthusiastically praised  her ability to work with both sides and get results for the American  people. This is exactly the type of leadership OMB needs to  successfully steer the country through the current public health and  economic crisis.   The passage of the American Rescue Plan earlier this week was a  historic achievement. But much of the work to fully implement this  landmark bill still lies ahead, from getting money into the pockets of  workers and families to ensuring schools open swiftly and safely and  making meaningful investments in small businesses and local  governments.   I have no doubt Ms. Young is prepared to take on the challenging work  of ensuring relief is delivered swiftly and effectively and that  families, businesses, and communities across our country have the  support they need to fully recover from this pandemic.   I know that in order to move past this current crisis, we must work  together. We all want to end the pandemic and reinvigorate our economy,  but there are intense disagreements over how we achieve those shared  goals.   Ms. Young has demonstrated the ability to work hard, to find common  ground during times of crisis and in the face of a deeply divided  political climate, experience that makes her uniquely qualified to  serve at OMB at this very moment.   Having spent most of her career working in Congress, Ms. Young will  also bring a profound respect for the role of the legislative branch.  She understands the importance of Congress's oversight role and has  firmly pledged to work with Congress in a cooperative and a transparent  manner.   Ms. Young also fully understands that laws enacted by Congress are  the law of the land, and they remain the law of the land regardless of  her own personal views.   You know, I know that some of my Republican colleagues have expressed  concerns about Ms. Young's personal views. However, I hope they  recognize that she has repeatedly committed to following the laws put  forth by Congress, including laws that she may personally disagree  with.   There is no doubt that Ms. Young is exceptionally qualified for this  role. OMB urgently needs qualified, Senate-confirmed leaders, not only  to address the current public health and economic crisis but also to  strengthen Federal cybersecurity, review regulations, and modernize the  Federal workforce.   In short, OMB works to ensure that every part of government is  working effectively for the American people. Her budget expertise,  extensive record of bipartisan engagement, and deep-rooted  understanding and respect for Congress are exactly what is needed to  meet the challenges that we face now and the challenges that lie ahead.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the confirmation of  Shalanda Young as Deputy Director of the Office of Management and  Budget.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute.    Madam President, I rise in support of confirming Shalanda  Young as the Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

Her budget experience and  extensive record of bipartisan results are what the OMB needs to guide  our Nation through the current pandemic and through the current  economic crisis.   During her 14 years as a senior staff member for the House  Appropriations Committee, Ms. Young developed a deep understanding of  the budget process and government operations, and she has been  instrumental in negotiating bipartisan agreements on many critical  issues.   She is a proven leader who is ready to get to work at the OMB, and I  urge my colleagues to join me in supporting her confirmation.   I yield the floor.
