 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes  following the first vote in this series be 10 minutes in length.    Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my  longtime scheduler and dear friend, Vaughan Wehr. After 5\1/2\ years in  Washington, Vaughan is returning home to her sprawling, tight-knit  family in Omaha.   Vaughan started with me as an aide in my legislative office in  Lincoln. It was an easy decision to ask her to come to Washington as an  original member of my team. She did a good job, she worked hard, and  she was a joy to have around. She started out in the Senate, where so  many do, answering phones and greeting constituents. That is hard work,  but Vaughan always did it with a smile on her face.   It didn't take long for her to take on more responsibility, first as  a deputy scheduler and later as a scheduler for nearly 4 years.  Throughout that time, Vaughan always did her job with a special blend  of diligence and humor. She has earned a reputation in the Senate as a  top scheduler and the life of any party.   It is no exaggeration to say that Vaughan has been the beating heart  of my office. She has made a mark here by doing her job with love and  laughter every single day.   My husband, Bruce, and I are very thankful for her service, and most  importantly, we are thankful for her friendship. She is one of a kind.  We wish her the very best as she returns home to Nebraska.   I yield the floor.
