 Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, I introduced a statement  into the Record which indicated my intent to object to any unanimous  consent request relating to the nomination of Mayor Eric Garcetti to be  U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of India. I did so because I had  received multiple whistleblower complaints that Mayor Garcetti  witnessed and was aware that his deputy chief of staff, Rick Jacobs,  sexually harassed city employees. In my statement, which I have copied  below, I made clear that I needed to investigate the allegations being  made by whistleblowers and that I needed to review the investigation  that the city of Los Angeles had commissioned which supposedly cleared  Mayor Garcetti of any wrongdoing.   At the time, I instructed my staff to complete this investigation in  no more than 2 weeks, since it is not my intent to drag this out. My  staff spoke with additional whistleblowers and subsequently made three  separate requests to representatives of the mayor to send us the city's  investigative report--on March 11, 18, and 21. The mayor's staff  provided me with a copy of the report on March 21. However, we were  just notified last night, March 23, that there was also an updated  report, along with a summary that was completed several months after  the original report that my office received on March 21.   While I am still reviewing this report, my staff informs me that the  report is focused exclusively on allegations made that Mr. Jacobs  sexually harassed an LAPD officer. It does not address other  allegations made, including allegations that Mr. Jacobs had sexually  harassed the mayor's senior staff and made racist comments toward staff  in front of the mayor.   Due to the extremely narrow scope of this report, the fact that many  of the allegations brought to my office were not investigated in that  report, and the fact that we only received the updated report last  night, I have instructed my staff to continue investigating these  allegations.   As I said earlier, it is not my intent to drag this out and I  anticipate that my investigation will be concluded in the near future.         [Prior Statement]        Mr. President, I intend to object to any unanimous consent       request at the present time relating to the nomination of       Mayor Eric Garcetti, of California, to be the U.S. Ambassador       to the Republic of India.        I will object because I have received numerous credible       allegations from multiple whistleblowers alleging that Mr.       Garcetti, while Mayor of Los Angeles, had knowledge of sexual       harassment and assaults allegedly committed against multiple       city employees and their associates by his close advisor, and       that he ignored the misconduct. The allegations involving the       mayor's office have been the subject of public reporting and       a purportedly independent investigation. However, serious       questions remain regarding the alleged misconduct, as well as       the mayor's knowledge of that misconduct.        First, whistleblowers who have spoken with my office have       not previously spoken to the Foreign Relations Committee, and       are presenting new allegations that must be fully       investigated.        Second, the investigation of the Los Angeles mayor's office       reportedly found no wrongdoing by the mayor or his staff.       However, information provided by multiple whistleblowers       strongly suggests that this investigation was incomplete at       best. The extent to which the investigation was truly       independent is also not clear, and the report has not been       made public.        The United States owes it to the Republic of India to send       them a qualified Ambassador that will represent the values of       the United States. Mayor Garcetti may very well be fully       qualified, but at this time, the Senate needs to look into       these allegations further.        So until my staff and I have conducted a thorough       investigation and are able to speak with everyone involved I       cannot vote to confirm Mr. Garcetti.
