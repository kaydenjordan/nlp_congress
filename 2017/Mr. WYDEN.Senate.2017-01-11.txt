 Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 188 and ask  unanimous consent that it be reported by number.    Mr. President and colleagues, this amendment is supported  by a number of Senators because, as the Senate majority plows ahead  with a scheme that I call repeal and run, it is putting tens of  millions of Americans in danger of losing their health insurance, and  Americans are waiting for Congress to step up and adopt smart policies  that will drive down the cost of prescription medicine.   We understand this is an era of miracle cures and treatments. There  are drugs on the market today that were science fiction not very long  ago. With drug prices rising, the question is whether Americans are  going to be able to afford them. This is a growing source of  inequality, and it cannot go unchecked.   Here is my bottom line.    In a country as rich and strong as ours, cures have to be  available for everyone, not just the wealthy.   I urge support for this amendment.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive section 305(b)(2) of  that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas  and nays.    Madam Clerk, because health care--   --should not just be for the healthy and wealthy, I vote  no.
