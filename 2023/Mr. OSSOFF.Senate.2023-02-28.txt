 Mr. President, I rise today to commend Zachary  Horton of Warner Robins, GA, for the inspiring success of his pecan  business, the Blind Squirrel Nut Company.   Mr. Horton's story demonstrates that optimism and resilience can lead  to amazing achievements. The Blind Squirrel Nut Company was born out of  Zachary's entrepreneurial spirit after he was diagnosed with a medical  condition that caused him to lose his vision. Mr. Horton's self- confidence and determination empowered him to launch a pecan business  that has served customers across middle Georgia for over a year. The  Blind Squirrel Nut Company also offers a variety of products to  customers nationwide, giving Americans across the country a taste of  Georgia's unique pecans.   As Georgia's U.S. Senator, I recognize and commend Mr. Zachary Horton  as a champion who against all odds has been able to fulfill his  greatest dream thanks to his perseverance, passion, and hope.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to commend Pastor  Angel Maestre for his impact on Augusta's Hispanic community.   Pastor Angel Maestre is a beacon of Georgia, serving as the head  pastor at Oasis Augusta Iglesia for the last 18 years. Over the course  of his tenure, Pastor Maestre has worked to uplift the community  through his countless years of mentorship, selfless acts, and service.  Pastor Maestre has also founded the first Hispanic radio station in  Augusta to better connect the community and inform residents of news  impacting their neighborhood. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Pastor  Maestre helped inform the Hispanic community about vaccinations through  his show, ensuring the community was well informed and staying healthy.   As Georgia's U.S. Senator, I commend and recognize Pastor Angel  Maestre for his dedication to Georgia and the Augusta  community.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to commend Ms. Carolyn  McKinley for her leadership as executive director of the Meriwether  County Chamber of Commerce.   As chamber executive director, Ms. McKinley was instrumental in  working with the Flint River Trail, Meriwether County, and  representatives from 18 riverfront counties to create more outdoor  recreation opportunities, which will lead to economic development  opportunities in southwest Georgia. During last year's Georgia  Governor's tourism conference in Athens, McKinley accepted the Georgia  River Network's 2022 Water Trail Hero Award on behalf of the Flint  River Water Trail group. This award honors the partnership between the  Flint River Water Trail and Meriwether County leaders to boost tourism  and economic development along Georgia's more than 2,500 river miles.   As Georgia's U.S. Senator, I recognize and commend Carolyn McKinley's  leadership as executive director of the Meriwether County Chamber of  Commerce and for her commitment to economic development in southwest  Georgia.                            ____________________
