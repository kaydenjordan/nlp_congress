 Mr. Speaker, I thank the CBC for putting together this  Special Order hour.   I just want to start out by saying this is not just a CBC issue. We  need the Tri-Caucus to be involved in this issue, and we need the Tri- Caucus to be speaking out on this issue.    We also need action and courage from the Senate in terms of stopping  the unnecessary killing of Black people throughout our country.   Tyre Nichols should be alive. Trayvon Martin should be alive. Breonna  Taylor should be alive. Atatiana Jefferson, Freddie Gray, Laquan  McDonald--they all should be alive. Michael Brown, Eric Gardner, on and  on and on and on.   Police brutality in our country is a disease that needs to be cured.  It is rooted in historical racism and systematic oppression in our  country.   This has to stop. Federal legislation needs to be implemented to stop  it.   One of the things we are asking for is simple accountability; that is  all. We support law enforcement when they are doing the right thing,  but when they commit a crime, they should be held accountable. They are  not above the law.   What is really painful is taxpayer money pays the salary of law  enforcement.   Taxpayer money pays the pensions of law enforcement.   Taxpayer money pays for the settlements when law enforcement is sued  in court.   Taxpayer money pays for the lawyers.   Cities go into debt using bonds to pay settlement claims. There is a  billion-dollar industry of police brutality that comes out of the  pockets of taxpayers.   If we are going to reach the ideals of our democracy and our  Constitution, we need to stop the unnecessary killing of Black people  in our country.   I will close with this: It is not just policing; it is the overall  system of mass incarceration. We incarcerate more, and there are  disproportionately more Black and Brown people in our country.
