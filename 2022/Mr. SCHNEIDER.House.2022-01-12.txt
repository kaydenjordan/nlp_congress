 Mr. Speaker, I rise to reflect on the remarkable  progress of our Nation's economy over the previous 12 months in what I  suspect history will label the Biden boom.   The progress achieved in 2021, helped along by the American Rescue  Plan, is unmatched in American history. Our economy is growing at its  fastest rate in 40 years. The Nation added 6.4 million new jobs, and  unemployment is now at 3.9 percent, representing the sharpest ever 1- year decline.   J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently said: ``The consumer balance  sheet has never been in better shape,'' predicting continued  extraordinary growth.   A Bloomberg analysis found that President Biden's first year is  ranked either first or second among Presidents for, among other things,  GDP growth, S&P 500 performance, nonfarm payrolls, manufacturing jobs,  and business productivity.   I recognize we still have real challenges, including worker  shortages, supply chain disruptions, and inflation. But working  together, Congress and President Biden are positioned to move our  economy forward and get us through this pandemic stronger than when we  went in.   Whether Republican, Democrat, Independent, or anything else, every  American should be celebrating the resilience of the American spirit.                            ____________________
