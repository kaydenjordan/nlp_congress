 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Arizona for  yielding.   There have been tragedies in this country, and yet it still hasn't  been  [[Page H2463]]  enough, apparently, to have the majority in the House, at least the  leadership, try to work together to come to a solution.   We have seen some of those solutions, and I have got the bill here,  H.R. 7120, but there is no better example than the legislation that  Congressman   Bobby Rush has worked on for years and years trying to  pay an appropriate tribute to a 14-year-old Black young man who was  kidnapped, horribly tortured, and killed. And I can just read the last  phrase of this section 250:         The person may be in prison for not more than 10 years.    So I have an amendment that I thought should get some Democrat votes.  We are not going to pass any of ours unless we have Democrat votes. But  I believe the death penalty in lynching cases is totally appropriate,  certainly in some of them. That is why I felt it was totally  appropriate that the two people under Texas law that lynched, that  killed James Byrd got the death penalty. It has already been  implemented.   But I understood from hearing Chairman Nadler say three times, I  believe it was, the death penalty is barbarous. It is barbarous. It is  barbarous. Okay, he made clear to his members, do not support the  Gohmert amendment. And I would be happy calling it the Bobby Rush  amendment, because a life sentence was originally in his bill.   I offered--and it was spur of the moment, I didn't have it planned-- okay. Look, you are stopping the members--this is what I am thinking-- from voting for my amendment. All right. I need Democrat votes. Let's  take out the death penalty and just say ``any term of years, including  life,'' and stop there, not the ``or death.''   They wouldn't even agree to that. No. They are going to stop anything  that Republicans want to do.   We ought to be setting the example to those who are creating a  Marxist crime wave across our country trying to destroy what we have  instead of playing partisan games in here.   I am glad to hear in here how much the Democrats tried to reach out  and work with us, because I sure didn't get that message, because we  were ready, willing, and able.   And it is further demonstrated in the Senate, when Tim Scott was  doing everything he could to get a bill passed, and he couldn't get any  support.   Look, what do you see out in the streets? You see White spoiled  adults coming up to Black law enforcement officers, spitting, just  chiding them, giving them all kinds of crud. The message is clear: We  are White spoiled brats, and you came off the plantation. Get back.   That is what Clarence Thomas said he felt like because he was a  conservative that wanted to think for himself.   But those same law officers are the ones--I have seen the law  officers I know run to the sound of a gun to save lives even of people  that make fun of them.   How did we forget 9/11 so quickly, when we saw example after example  of their willingness to sacrifice?   Look, this is not going to do anything. This immunity removal is  going to help the law enforcement unions. They will make a fortune,  like teachers' unions do, selling the insurance, but it is going to  keep law officers tied up in civil court instead of criminal court, and  it is going to leave criminals on the street.    Madam Speaker, I say to my colleagues, vote ``no'' on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to yield to the gentlewoman  from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), my friend.                                 JUSTICE Act     Mr. Speaker, I am proud to call Virginia Foxx my  classmate. We have been through a lot together, but nothing like what  is currently going on in this country right now. Extraordinary.   And we are hearing from people back home and from those who are not  from  [[Page H2508]]  my district that have called my office--or called my wife's phone--and  left nasty, vicious messages about our hearing. People who saw the  subterfuge going on in the Committee on the Judiciary yesterday, they  need to understand, back before I became a district judge in Texas,  handling major, civil litigation and felony, criminal cases--up to and  including death penalty cases--I tried a lot of cases, a lot of  different courts, Federal, State. And from time to time, you would see  judges who were not fair, and they played their partisan, silly games.  Sometimes it was just a power thing.                                time  2100    But I determined, when I was a judge, nobody was going to be treated  like that, and we didn't do that.   There were time limits on opening statements and closing arguments,  as there were when I was chief justice of our court of appeals. I  enforced the times, and I made sure that both sides had those times  followed because, to me, what applied in court applies here, one of the  last bastions of civility in the country.   Even when there are riots and protests going on, as long as the  legislature and the courts are acting civilly--and that doesn't mean  you can't yell at each other. Sometimes, debates get very, very  emotional, and some of us get very passionate about the things we feel.  But it should never lead to violence.   We have those arguments. Everybody gets treated fairly. And I have to  say, I have been unhappy with some Republican committee chairs in the  past, but at least they treated both sides the same way.   But we have seen in the Judiciary Committee, which has a storied  history, with strong, freedom-loving patriots like Daniel Webster-- possibly the leading advocate against slavery of his day, and certainly  the most articulate advocate against slavery in this country, a strong  Christian, ethical, moral man. But we have seen such incredible  partisanship in our committee, and I mean by that unfair enforcement of  the rules.   Yes, I get passionate about it because I still believe in fairness.  You shouldn't treat people the way Republicans have been treated in the  Judiciary Committee.   Why is that important? Well, for one thing, it sets an example to the  rest of the country that it is okay to just run over, ignore, threaten,  create havoc for the people who you disagree with. That message goes  out loud and clear: I am screwing over the other side by the rules, by  using and flaunting my authority, and so what? If you agree with me,  join me in abusing our discretion.   Well, we are seeing that abuse go across the country. What are we  seeing across the country? We have seen Democratic Governors, some of  them, and in our biggest cities where the biggest problems are  occurring, and Black lives that matter are being shot in record  numbers, as they were in Chicago, and instead of using our system to  address the problems that have arisen, we have statements like this,  this headline from a Black Lives Matter leader: ``If this country  doesn't give us what we want, then we will burn down this system.''   Well, this system has had millions of Americans suffer and over a  million die in the service of our country so that we would have the  freedoms we do.   One thing has been very clear to me from studying history. I really  got into it in high school, majored in it, and never stopped studying  it. But one thing is very clear: This country is an anomaly.   You know, Jesus said, you remember, they are going to hate you; they  hated me first. We were told you will suffer for Christ's sake.   This was a country where you didn't suffer for being a Christian.  That is an incredible little bubble in time and in space in the history  of the world. This is an unusual country.   As Alexis de Tocqueville pointed out about the churches and the  amazing--yes, there are other religions, and we respect that, respect  those, as long as they are peaceful and don't want to tear down the  system or burn down the system.   But de Tocqueville pointed out that this country seems to have  adopted Christian principles throughout their government. They are more  at play in what is happening in America than anywhere else.   That is paraphrased. I don't have his quotes, but there are many of  them. Some of them that he was given credit for saying he didn't say.  But he certainly observed that.   But this little anomaly of self-government in time and space is in  grave risk. Anybody that has studied world history understands that.  There are people all over the country we have heard from that  understand that.   So when people are allowed, even without burning down the system, to  burn down minority communities, burn down other people's property,  destroy businesses, tear down statues that reflect history, good and  bad, without going through the system the right way, the peaceful way,  the way available, they are already figuratively burning down this  system.   You want a statue removed or you want a name changed, you do what  they are doing in Tyler, Texas, where they have petitioned, as I  understand it, the school board. I am not sure if they have taken  action yet. But that is the way you do it. You go make your case.   If you don't like what is going on, then you simply run for office  and replace those people who are not doing what you believe is the  right thing. That is the way it goes; that is the way it is supposed to  go; and that is the way people who want to destroy America are not  doing it.   If there is an offensive statue, go get it changed, but we might want  you to pay for replacing that with something else. Those who refuse to  learn from history, as we know, are destined to repeat it.   It is good to talk about people who made big mistakes in our history  instead of doing like the Marxist leaders of the crime wave across the  country are trying to do.   Now, there are some who aren't Marxists, and they don't know they are  being used by Marxists. But the things that are going on are right out  of the Marxist playbook.   It was seen in 1917 in and around what became the Soviet Union. It  was seen by Chavez in Venezuela. It has been seen in many places. It  was seen by the Chinese under Mao.   Hitler was a monster. And his murder of and the attempted genocide of  the Jewish people should never be forgotten. But some people are  denying it even happened. It did happen.   So you have two basically totalitarian socialist forms of government.  And I know my friend, my colleague--he probably wouldn't call me his  friend--         as chairman of the Judiciary Committee immediately reacts       when you mention that the fascists were really socialists. It       was the National Socialist Workers Party in Germany. That is       what the Nazis were.    They believed in the same kind of totalitarian socialist government  that Soviet leaders believed in, and they created in the Soviet Union  with their communist government and in China with their communist  government what so many want to drive us to right now. They killed more  people than any form of government in the history of the world.   Now, 20 million is only the estimate of what Stalin starved to death  in Ukraine when there was actually plenty of food, but he intentionally  starved them to death. Mao, there was probably 40, 60 million,  depending on whom you believe, that he killed, determined to make the  country better.   If you look at how many people the coronavirus has killed, which came  from China--you can give them credit for killing millions more, I am  sure, before this is all over. Although we do have some in the U.S.  Government that have an interest--maybe it is pecuniary, some kind of  interest--in defending China and condemning the United States. It kind  of tells you where their heart is.   This country, as Ron Maxwell said some years back, from its  beginning, it has been about liberation. We have George Washington over  there. People are trying to tear down his statues. When you travel the  world, people know the good about that man more so than American  students do anymore because the Bill Ayers of the country, the  terrorists of their day--terrorists in another way now.   But they realized blowing things up, sit-ins, riots were not getting  it done, so they went into our colleges and universities, many of them,  and began to  [[Page H2509]]  teach their socialist/Marxist ideas that have never worked and have led  to more death and suffering than any other type of government.   But they have taught them this is the way to go. Many millennials  have bought into that because they don't know true history. This is  serious stuff.   As I have talked to parliamentarians, members of parliament in  Europe, members of government in other parts of the world, including  Australia--and there are things about America that bug them. Some think  we are too arrogant.   But when it comes down to it, wise people in other countries that  have freedom at this time, they know if the United States' freedom is  destroyed by Marxists or anybody else, there will be no other safe  place in the world that Americans can go to find the freedom that is at  risk right now. If America's freedom goes down, there is no other place  to go.   I know Ronald Reagan said no generation that has ever lost freedom  ever got it back in the same generation. I am telling you, if we don't  stop the insurrection that is being allowed to occur under liberal  mayors, liberal Governors, then we are going to lose the country. And  Donald Trump is determined not to let that happen.   But under our Constitution, there are some places if the mayor or the  Governor won't request help, the President is going to have difficulty  getting it there to protect things. That is just the way it is.                                time  2115    There are consequences to electing feckless leaders who are afraid to  do what needs to be done to protect this greatest bastion of freedom  that has ever existed.   As I said earlier, this has been a history in this country of  liberation. Slavery should never have been allowed to get started here.  But this country, despite the liberal garbage that is out there, it was  not founded on the basis of slavery.   If you look at Thomas Jefferson's original words in the original  Declaration of Independence, his first draft, he knew slavery was bad  and destructive to this country. Perhaps it is the longest grievance  against King George--if it is not the longest, one of the longest. He  lays at the feet of King George of England the horrible thing that was  going on in America, the atrocity called slavery.   King George should never have allowed that to get started here, to be  legal here, but it was. People in Virginia at the time were not  supposed to free their slaves. George Washington, he knew it was wrong  as well. In his will, he freed all the slaves upon his wife's death.   Now, there are some things that don't make sense to some of us here  and now because we weren't living in that day. But the thing that we  can be absolutely certain about is that no human being--only one--has  ever been perfect. Anything that involves humans is going to be  imperfect.   Again, our history has been one of setting freedom as the goal,  recognizing that freedom is a gift of God. But like any inheritance, if  you don't fight for it, you are not going to have it.   Slavery, we had a revolution after the first great awakening, the  great Christian awakening in the 1700s, followed by the Revolution, the  pursuit of freedom and freedom of choice. The second great awakening in  the 1800s was followed by a horrendous civil war.   What Lincoln said, the words are inscribed on the inside of the north  wall of the Lincoln Memorial, and you can tell he is trying to get a  grip on this. He knows there is a God. He believes at that time in God.  Steve Mansfield has a great book documenting Lincoln's days from his  early 20s when he bragged about being an infidel, not believing in God,  until the time he was elected President. He knew a guy like him could  never have gotten elected President unless there was a God that allowed  it to be.   But in that second inaugural speech, I think it was about a month  before he was assassinated, you can find it toward the middle of the  speech, it is inscribed there. He is trying to work through how this  horrible war could occur when there is a good and just God. He works  through it, and he understands and quotes scripture in like three  places in that part.   But he says: Needs be that offenses come, but woe be to the person by  whom the offense cometh.   That offense he was talking about was slavery. He knew it was an  atrocity. He wanted to end it.   He talks about, though, both the North and South read the same Bible.  Both pray to the same God. The prayers of both couldn't be answered.  The prayers of neither have been fully answered. But then he goes on to  point out that if it be God's will that every drop of blood drawn by  the lash is going to have to be drawn by the sword, then we still have  to say, as he said, what was said 3,000 years ago: The judgments of the  Lord are true and righteous all together.   Mr. Speaker, I am joined by friends here on the floor. My friend, the  chairman of the Freedom Caucus, he is a freedom lover. Mr. Speaker, I  yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate so much my friend from  Arizona. I was asked earlier today by someone: Everybody needs friends;  who are your friends in Congress? And I am looking at two of my best  friends right here. It may be sad, but that is the case, and I am  grateful for the friendship.   We had a press conference, the Freedom Caucus did, and I appreciate  your leadership. I want to address my remarks to the Chair. I  appreciate so much the leadership of the chairman of the Freedom Caucus  in having the press conference.   But one guy said he had a question, and Congressman Biggs called on  him, and he ends up saying, you know, he made a case that you are not  spending enough money here in Washington on local police. And this is  probably the same clown that goes out and says, you know, we need to  defund the police. We need to defund the military because that is going  on. And the great irony, then he comes up to us and says we need you to  spend more money because we are trying to defund the police back home.  It is quite ironic.   Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Yoho). We have been through a lot together, and I  have such great respect, and I am going to miss the gentleman from  Florida. It may be because he was a veterinarian before he came up  here, so he was quite used to dealing with the wrong end of a horse and  was trained well for being in Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my brother.   Frederick Douglass, what an extraordinary story, and he was extremely  helpful to Lincoln, prodding him on when others were encouraging  Lincoln not to do what needed to be done. Incredible man, how he could  go through all of the horrors that he did and yet he still had his eyes  on freedom, not just for himself but for everybody.   As my friend from Florida was pointing out about ignorance of  protestors, it could be ignorance--and I am quite sure they are  ignorant of their history because of some of the things they are  tearing down and vandalizing, including there is a story from Mary  Margaret Olohan, ``Rioters Vandalize World War II Memorial, D.C.  Monuments.''   ``Communist Emblem Spray Painted on North Carolina WWII Memorial.''  That is from Jake Dima.   ``George Floyd Rioters Deface 16 Boston statues.'' And I don't think  it is fair to say those are George Floyd rioters, because George  Floyd's family has spoken against this kind of thing. They don't want  George Floyd to have a legacy of violence and destruction in the wake  of saying that is because of George Floyd. They want reforms. ``George  Floyd Rioters Deface 16 Boston Statues, Including Memorial Honoring  Black Civil War Regiment.''   These people aren't about Black Lives Matter, and you can tell that  every time you see some spoiled White bourgeois person going up to a  Black policeman or Black policemen and women and taunting them, calling  them every name in the book. To that person, Black lives don't matter  or they would not be treating an African American the way we have seen  them do it on video.   Another article from Daily Wire: ``Rioters Destroy Statue of Union  Colonel Who Died Fighting Slavery, Confederacy. Also Destroy The  `Forward' Statue.''   Washington's historic St. John's Church was damaged by rioters. Here  is another one from the Blaze: ``Rioters Tear Down More Statues  Including Ulysses S. Grant, Who Defeated the Confederacy and `Destroyed  the KKK.' ''   ``Rioters Deface Memorial Honoring Those Killed by Communist  Regimes.''   ``Armenian Genocide Memorial in Denver Part of Mass Vandalism at  Colorado State Capitol--Public Radio of Armenia.''   ``Park Volunteer Outraged Over Vandalism of Philadelphia Abolitionist  Statue.''   And for those who are out there rioting, ``abolitionist'' means they  were trying to end slavery. I know that is a big word for you. But as  this park volunteer said, he--and he is talking about abolitionist  Matthias Baldwin. The quote was: ``He Was BLM Before There Was a  Slogan.'' And yet as Zachary Evans writes about, they vandalized his  statue.   And then George Washington's statue in Baltimore is defaced. Only man  in history to lead a revolutionary military, win the Revolution. When  it was all over, he comes in and they even sent him a copy of a bill  where they gave him power to make contracts and pay whatever he needed  to pay. And the cover letter basically said, look, we are giving you  all this extra power, but we know when you have no further need for it,  you will give it back. Except no one in the history of the world has,  before or since George Washington, had that kind of power and gave it  back. And he did.   I was in the Maldive Islands some years back with a few other Members  of Congress. It is a beautiful little island south of India in the  Indian Ocean, and one of their leaders sitting by me during our lunch,  he said: We are a relatively new democracy. He said: We are always  hearing rumors about military coups.   For those rioters out there, a military coup is when the military  tries to take over the government from a civilian government, and he  said there are always those rumors.   And then he paused and he said: We never had a George Washington to  set the proper example.   On the other side of the world, 180 degrees from here, this little  island, they know how important what George Washington did, how  important that was.                                time  2145    It was wrong to have slaves. Slavery was wrong.   Thank God for William Wilberforce, for people like John Quincy Adams  and Daniel Webster that fought so hard to bring an end to slavery.   But it tells you these people, they are not about freedom. They are  about Marxist, Leninist, the most murderous form of government in the  entire history of the world.   I am joined by a friend, and I sure don't want to hurt him  politically, but I just love this brother, and he happens to represent  an area in southern Texas, and that is Mr. Chip Roy, one of the most  principled people I have ever met.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I don't want anybody listening to think  when the gentleman asks why didn't we offer amendments that we had the  opportunity to do that. The majority determined there would be no  amendments allowed.    I know my friend from Texas and I were talking earlier today about,  you know, we could have voted for a bill that included some things that  were in the Democrats' bill, but they would not allow any amendments.   The qualified immunity, where law enforcement officers were going to  get sued, every arrest they ever make, most likely they were going to  end up spending more time in civil court than they were in enforcing  the law, we needed to work those things out. But there were no  amendments made, because the majority said, We don't need your input.  This was figuratively what they said: We don't need your input. We  don't want your input. We can pass it by ourselves.   They stopped Tim Scott's bill. He was open to having amendments. They  didn't want to make amendments down there.   They want a symbol. And there is nothing that symbolizes that aspect  that they want a symbol and not a real fix more than their adding the  watered down Emmett Till bill into this law enforcement bill, which is  an embarrassment to say that 10 years for being involved in a lynching  would be the maximum punishment.     Bobby Rush has been working on this for years, and he put a life  sentence maximum in. I think it ought to be the death penalty, but  okay, Democrats are in the majority, so I was willing to drop out the  death penalty.   They didn't want that. They wanted a symbol, not anything effective.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for being here tonight.   I know he was asking rhetorical questions. And for those involved in  the riots, let me explain: ``rhetorical'' means it is not looking for  an answer back.   When he said we weren't making amendments or we didn't do this or  that, we weren't doing our job, I know for a fact that that was  rhetorical, because the gentleman represents San Antonio and so much of  south Texas doing everything he can to make a difference.   We can work together if we are allowed and if the rules don't  continue to be abused the way they have been.   We do need good, trustworthy law enforcement. I think Bill Barr is  doing everything he can, but we need a different FBI director. I don't  think we are going to get much help there as long as Christopher Wray  is there. He is too interested in trying to say the FBI is all well  now, when it is not.   But nonetheless, I hope we can work together. The country is  suffering because we are not allowed to participate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
