 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because this is  Lydia Strunk's last week working on the House floor.   Before I talk about Lydia, I want to talk about the work that she and  all the people here on the floor do for us, for the people's House, on  both sides of the aisle. They are the ones who keep the floor running  on time on a day-to-day basis. They make sure that the votes are  counted and conducted impartially. They make sure that every Member,  majority and minority, is treated fairly. And though the hours are long  and unpredictable, they always set a fantastic tone of decorum.   No one better exemplifies this professionalism than Lydia Strunk. She  has been a part of this institution since 2008, when she started out in  the Republican Cloakroom. We all knew her so well then and enjoyed  watching her rise to these great responsibilities that she now holds.   For more than 4 years now, Lydia has served as the Speaker's deputy  floor director. As it turns out, she accepted this job on the night of  her wedding. How is that for commitment?    Lydia's quiet dedication to the people's House comes through in  almost everything that she does; and because she does her job so well,  almost no one ever notices. Think about it. If you ever wondered how a  joint meeting with a foreign leader or a State of the Union goes off  without a hitch, it is because of Lydia's doing.   One of her jobs, of course, is to keep us on schedule. So I will make  one last point before she tells me to wrap this up, because I assume  that is what she will be doing in a minute.   I want to thank Lydia's family. I want to thank Lydia's husband,  Jeff, and I want to thank, in particular, her children.   Graham and Evie, I want you to know that your mother is an incredible  public servant. She has done so much for us, for this country and this  institution, and we are grateful to you for sharing your mom--and your  wife--with us. This whole House is in her debt.  [[Page H3077]]                                ____________________     Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the  chairman, I want to thank the ranking member, the ranking members, the  chairmen of the subcommittees, and all the staff for their very hard  work in putting this big body of work together.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this package. I want to  explain why. Many of our priorities--not all, but many of our  priorities are advanced in this, and that is because this is a  bipartisan piece of legislation. So each side doesn't get everything  they want, but we are able to come together and find a package that  advances many of our important goals.   For me, I think it is important because it turns the page on the last  administration, on the Obama years. It completes the unfinished  business of the previous administration. Remember, we came to December,  we had a continuing resolution. We are halfway through the fiscal year  now, we have got to do the job of actually getting the government  specifically funded, meeting more of our priorities. This does that.  This marks the beginning of a new era.   No longer will the needs of our military be held hostage by the  demands for more domestic spending. In my mind, that is what is most  important here. Having negotiated a couple of the budget agreements in  the prior administration, this, to me, is paramount and first among all  things.   The rule we lived under under the previous administration basically  says: You want more money for the men and women in the field who are in  our military who need more resources to do their jobs? Okay, but we are  going to need more money for Washington programs; and not just more  money for Washington programs, but the same exact amount of money.   So no matter whether we need more money for our troops--we might need  more ships, more bullets, more gas, and more planes--we had to have the  exact same dollar amount, whether it was needed or not, for domestic  spending.   That is the old formula we had under the prior administration, and  that is not in here. That is really important. I think that is one of  the most important game-changing accomplishments that is in here  because we really believe our military needs help. We believe our  military has been hollowed out in so many areas, and this bill helps  fix this. So that dollar-for-dollar parity rule is a rule no more.   With this bill, we do not have that arbitrary standard--the standard  that has contributed, in my opinion, to hollowing out our military and  declining our readiness. While we have a lot more work to do to fully  rebuild our military, this is a critical first step. With this bill, we  will spend $25 billion more this year than last year on defense so that  we can begin to rebuild our military readiness and our preparedness. We  will do this without a corresponding increase in domestic spending.  That, to me, is a new day under this new administration that we have  with President Trump.   Of course, this legislation also addresses many other priorities for  Republicans and for this administration. For starters, there is a big  and solid down payment on securing our border. In fact, it is the  biggest increase in border security in a decade. Funding for the D.C.  Scholarship Opportunity Program, which reverses the Obama-era crusade  against school choice, that is in here; national resources to fight the  opioid epidemic, which is something that is ravishing communities  across America; no new money for ObamaCare and no bailouts for  insurance companies. This bill protects life.   This bill is a bipartisan compromise, as I mentioned, but it is,  indeed, a good one for conservatives. That is why I urge my colleagues  to support this bill. We all must agree that funding the government at  all like this--and this is the last point I want to make--is not a  process we want to continue. Yes, we are finishing unfinished business  from last year, but let's all work together and endeavor to do these  appropriation bills one at a time. That is the system that we are  supposed to have, and that is the system that I think we all agree-- Republicans and Democrats--that we need to have.   So let's work together to make sure that we don't just do one big  bill, that we do this individually so that individual debate can occur,  so that individual priorities can be met, and so that we can get back  to regular order and we can better guarantee and maintain our Article I  powers as the legislative branch of government exercising the power of  the purse. I challenge every one of us to commit to that process.   In the meantime, let's bank these wins. Let's get this done. Let's  turn this page on this last year, and let's make sure that we give the  troops the support that they so desperately need. With that, I ask  everyone to support this bill.
