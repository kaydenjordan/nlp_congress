 Mr. President, I thank my colleague Senator Warner,  and we will hear shortly from Senator Wyden.   These two great colleagues are championing election security. Senator  Warner, at the helm as vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, has  done as much as any American and any Member of this body to uncover the  serious Russian threat to our election system. It is a threat not just  from Russia but from other countries as well. That is why I have  offered and will ask unanimous consent for the passage of S. 1247, the  Duty To Report Act.   This legislation, like Senator Warner's, is based on a very simple  idea: If you see something, say something. The Duty To Report Act would  require campaigns, candidates, and family members to immediately report  to the FBI and the Federal Election Commission any offers of illegal  foreign assistance. It differs in some technical aspects--for example,  with regard to family members--from Senator Warner's proposed FIRE Act.  Yet it is the same idea because it codifies into law what is already a  moral duty, a patriotic duty, and basic common sense. It is already  illegal to accept foreign assistance during a campaign. It is already  illegal to solicit foreign assistance during a campaign. All this bill  does is require campaigns and individuals to report such illegal  foreign assistance directly to the FBI.   Special Counsel Robert Mueller came before Congress today to answer  questions about his very comprehensive and powerful report that  documents the sweeping and systematic interference in our election, as  he testified, to benefit, principally, Donald Trump's campaign. Yet  this measure is about the future. It is about preventing such election  interference in the future and providing a mandate and a duty to report  any offers of assistance from a foreign government, like Russia.   This report outlines the most serious attack on our democracy by a  foreign power in our history. It tells the story of more than 150  contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian agents. It tells the  story of Russian covert and overt efforts to influence the outcome of  our election by helping one candidate and hurting another, and it  shows--perhaps most importantly for the purpose of this measure--that  the Trump campaign knew of it, welcomed it, and happily accepted it.   Mueller testified this morning:         Over the course of my career, I have seen a number of       challenges to our democracy. The Russian Government's efforts       to interfere in our election is among the most serious. As I       said on May 29, this deserves the attention of every       American.    Equally important is that, just yesterday, FBI Director Christopher  Wray came before the Committee on the Judiciary and warned that the  Russians are still actively trying to interfere in our election, which  is what Mueller said today when he was asked about some of the remarks  and some of the efforts in the Trump campaign. He was referring to  Donald Trump, Jr., when he said, ``I love it,'' in welcoming Russia's  offer of assistance to the Trump campaign in the June 9 meeting,  Director Mueller said, ``I hope this is not the new normal, but I fear  it is.''   This is the context of troubling comments that brings us here today.  One of the most troubling is President Trump's own comment when asked  if he would accept foreign help in 2020, and he said, ``I would take  it.'' That is why we need the Duty To Report Act. If that kind of  assistance is offered, there is an obligation to report it, not to take  it.   The election of 2016 was simply a dress rehearsal. With the 2020  election upon us, we must stop this kind of foreign interference and  ensure that it is the American people, not Russia or any other foreign  power like China or Iran, who decide who the leaders of this country  will be and the direction of our democracy.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Rules  and Administration be discharged from further consideration of S. 1247;  that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the bill  be considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I yield to another great colleague who  has been a champion of this cause of election security, Senator Wyden.
