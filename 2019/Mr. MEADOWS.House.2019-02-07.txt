 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a bill to  provide real consequences against those who would seek to commit fraud  at the expense of America's Veterans.   H.R 450, the Bipartisan ``Preventing Crimes Against Veterans Act,''  would close loopholes in existing laws and provide law enforcement with  additional tools to crack down on fraud cases in connection with  Veterans' benefits.   In recent history, financial predators have increasingly begun  targeting America's veterans, particularly those in low income housing,  looking to commit fraud and rob them of their federal benefits. Many of  these fraudsters pose as federal caseworkers, offering to expedite  Veterans' claims or assist them with unanswered questions--only to  charge them exorbitant fees while providing little or no service in  return.   Absolutely no veteran should be defrauded of their well-earned  benefits, particularly those in need. Those who defraud veterans and  their families of their benefits not only harm these victims, but they  also diminish resources required to pay the claims and fund the  programs needed to assist those who have served our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, Congress has both a responsibility and an obligation to  step up and protect our Veterans against this activity.   Unfortunately, current law hamstrings prosecutors and allows for  criminals engaging in this type of conduct to escape with minimal  penalty.   H.R. 450 would make needed changes to that process. It would impose  new penalties on fraudsters--including a fine, imprisonment of up to  five years, or both. By attaching a criminal penalty to this behavior,  the bill provides prosecutors with the tools to take adequate and  appropriate legal action against those who seek to defraud veterans.  [[Page H1409]]    This is a common sense reform that would send a loud and clear  message of support to those who have served our country so faithfully  and protect them against any effort to rob them of their hard earned  benefits.   Finally, I want to thank the gentleman from Florida, Ted Deutch, who  is the lead Democratic cosponsor, for his leadership on this important  measure.   I support this bill and I urge my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Speaker, I was absent for the vote on H.R. 450-- Preventing Crimes Against Veterans Act. Had I been present, I would  have voted ``yea'' on Roll Call No. 70.                            ____________________
