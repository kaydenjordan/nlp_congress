 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  H.R. 6 and the IMD exclusion repeal probation modeled after my bill,  the IMD CARE Act.   I fought to ensure the IMD exclusion repeal was part of this final  agreement because increasing inpatient treatment options is essential  in our fight against the opioid epidemic.   The Orange County Board of Supervisors agrees with leading addiction  treatment groups: the IMD exclusion repeal and the IMD CARE Act are the  most important steps we can take to end drug overdose deaths in Orange  County.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to  address this public health crisis.    Mr. Speaker, as I travel through my  district, the women of Orange County have expressed their support for  policies that safeguard women and children, including the Violence  Against Women Act. As the mother of two daughters, I share their  support for this legislation and care deeply about ensuring the safety  of all women.   For 24 years, the Violence Against Women Act has provided lifesaving  services for survivors of domestic and dating violence, sexual assault,  and stalking.   While I am pleased we passed a short-term extension of the Violence  Against Women Act, we must work together towards a long-term  reauthorization that will allow us to continue to protect and support  survivors. We owe it to survivors to ensure this law remains in place,  and I will continue to work to make this happen.                            ____________________
