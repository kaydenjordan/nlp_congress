 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 292) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 24355 Creekside Road in Santa Clarita, California,  as the ``William L. Reynolds Post Office Building''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 292         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. WILLIAM L. REYNOLDS POST OFFICE BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 24355 Creekside Road in Santa Clarita,       California, shall be known and designated as the ``William L.       Reynolds Post Office Building''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``William L. Reynolds Office Building''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill which would name a post  office in Santa Clarita, California, after William ``Bill'' Reynolds.   William served in the Vietnam war and earned both the Purple Heart  and Bronze Star. After serving, he moved with his wife, Meg, to the  Santa Clarita Valley, where Reynolds dedicated his life to advocating  for his fellow veterans.   Reynolds passed away in 2021 after organizing the memorial wall at  Veterans Plaza in Newhall and accompanying the U.S. President to Da  Nang in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam war.   Mr. Speaker, I support naming a post office in Bill Reynolds' memory.  I am proud to honor his life of service to the American people and work  to memorialize the memory of America's veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr.  Mike Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, as the son of a veteran who served in Vietnam  during the Vietnam war, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 996) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 3901 MacArthur Blvd., in New Orleans, Louisiana, as  the ``Dr. Rudy Lombard Post Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 996         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DR. RUDY LOMBARD POST OFFICE BUILDING.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 3901 MacArthur Blvd., in New Orleans,       Louisiana, shall be known and designated as the ``Dr. Rudy       Lombard Post Office Building''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Dr. Rudy Lombard Post Office Building''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, which names a New  Orleans post office for Dr. Rudolph Joseph Lombard.   Dr. Lombard was born and raised in New Orleans and grew up witnessing  discrimination in New Orleans which inspired him to become a leading  activist.   As a college student of Xavier University, he organized a sit-in in  1960 at McCrory's Five and Dime store to protest Jim Crow laws.   Dr. Lombard's activism led to the landmark Supreme Court case,  Lombard v. Louisiana, which overturned related charges and set a  critical precedent for striking down segregation laws.   Dr. Lombard was dedicated to justice and equality. However, he is a  lesser-known leader in the civil rights movement due to his humility.   Today the U.S. House publicly recognizes his contributions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this bipartisan legislation, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  bipartisan bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2379) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 616 East Main Street in St. Charles, Illinois, as  the ``Veterans of the Vietnam War Memorial Post Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2379         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. VETERANS OF THE VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL POST OFFICE.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 616 East Main Street in St. Charles,       Illinois, shall be known and designated as the ``Veterans of       the Vietnam War Memorial Post Office''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Veterans of the Vietnam War Memorial       Post Office''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2379, which honors  Vietnam war veterans with a post office in St. Charles, Illinois.   The Vietnam war was one of this country's longest and costliest  conflicts. More than 3.4 million Americans were deployed to Southeast  Asian, and sadly, more than 58,000 U.S. military officials perished  while deployed.   According to the National Archives, almost 3,000 of those casualties  called the State of Illinois home.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill honoring  Americans who gave their lives in service to our Nation and peace  abroad.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no speakers, and I am prepared to  close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3944) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 120 West Church Street in Mount Vernon, Georgia, as  the ``Second Lieutenant Patrick Palmer Calhoun Post Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3944         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SECOND LIEUTENANT PATRICK PALMER CALHOUN POST                     OFFICE.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 120 West Church Street in Mount Vernon,       Georgia, shall be known and designated as the ``Second       Lieutenant Patrick Palmer Calhoun Post Office''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Second Lieutenant Patrick Palmer Calhoun       Post Office''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H4944]]    I rise today in support of this bill, which would name a post office  in Mount Vernon, Georgia, after Second Lieutenant Patrick Palmer  Calhoun.   Patrick Calhoun grew up in Mount Vernon, Georgia, earned a degree  from the University of Georgia, and then enlisted in the U.S. Army.   During his service in South Vietnam, his helicopter was tragically  shot down on April 19, 1965. Second Lieutenant Calhoun was declared  missing in action before being declared dead at the tragically young  age of 24. He perished serving his country, and I support naming a post  office in his memory.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this commonsense legislation, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage support for this  bipartisan bill. I ask all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 4502) to amend title 5, United States Code, to allow Federal  agencies to establish educational requirements for certain  cybersecurity positions in the competitive service, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4502         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Modernizing the Acquisition       of Cybersecurity Experts Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPETITIVE SERVICE                     CYBERSECURITY POSITIONS.         Section 3308 of title 5, United States Code, is amended--        (1) by striking ``The Office of Personnel Management'' and       inserting ``(a) In General.--Consistent with subsection (b),       the Office of Personnel Management''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(b) Education Requirements for Cybersecurity Positions.--        ``(1) In general.--With respect to any covered position--        ``(A) an agency may prescribe a minimum educational       requirement for employment in such a position only if a       minimum education qualification is required by law to perform       the duties of the position in the State or locality where the       duties of the position are to be performed; and        ``(B) an agency may consider education in determining a       candidate's satisfaction of any other minimum qualification       only if the candidate's education directly reflects the       competencies necessary to satisfy that qualification and       perform the duties of the position.        ``(2) Publication.--Not later than one year after the date       of the enactment of the Modernizing the Acquisition of       Cybersecurity Experts Act of 2023 and annually thereafter,       the Office of Personnel Management shall publish on the       Office's website--        ``(A) any changes made to minimum qualifications standards       concerning education for covered positions; and        ``(B) aggregate data indicating the level of educational       attainment, sorted by position classification, of all       accessions to covered positions.        ``(3) Covered position defined.--In this subsection, the       term `covered position' means--        ``(A) any position in the competitive service classified       under the GS-2210 information technology management series,       or any successor series; and        ``(B) any other position in the competitive service       designated as ``cybersecurity'' under the National Initiative       for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce       Framework (NIST Special Publication 800-181), or successor       framework.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4502, the Modernizing the  Acquisition of Cybersecurity Experts Act.   The Federal Government relies on cybersecurity professionals to  protect personally identifiable information, defend against cyber  threats, and build secure government technology.   To ensure this work is done effectively, the Federal Government  desperately needs to hire more cybersecurity experts. The United  States, however, faces a labor shortage of cybersecurity professionals,  amounting to nearly 700,000 job vacancies.   Many cybersecurity experts have the right technical skills and  experience,  [[Page H4945]]  but Federal hiring managers are not allowed to consider them because  they lack a formal college degree.   This bureaucracy creates unnecessary barriers to employing some of  the best and brightest cybersecurity professionals.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this simple and  necessary bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  South Carolina (Ms. Mace), the chair of the Oversight Committee  Subcommittee on Cybersecurity Information Technology, and Government  Innovation.    Mr. Speaker, the Modernizing the Acquisition of  Cybersecurity Experts Act will ensure that the Federal Government can  hire any qualified cybersecurity professional as long as they have the  right knowledge and skills even if they do not have a fancy degree. I  encourage my House colleagues to support this commonsense government  transparency bill, the MACE Act, sponsored by Chairwoman Nancy Mace,  that will make America smarter and more secure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
