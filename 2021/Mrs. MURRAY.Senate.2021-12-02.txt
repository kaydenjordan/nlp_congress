 Mr. President, COVID-19 has killed over 780,000 people  in our country. This pandemic has a higher body count than any war we  have ever fought in, and it is not over.   We should be doing everything we can to stop this virus. We should be  using every tool to keep America safe. We all know the damage this  virus can do to our communities and to our economy. That is why the  Biden administration has taken steps to urge employers to make sure  their employees are fully vaccinated or test negative for COVID-19  before they come to the workplace. That is a move that is widely  popular with the American people. No one wants to go to work and be  worried they might come home to their family with a deadly virus.   Even businesses support this step. The Chamber of Commerce is urging  businesses to comply with the administration's emergency temporary  standard. Perhaps, more importantly, it is a move that will save lives.  We have already seen these requirements have a huge impact. In fact,  many businesses with vaccine requirements have seen vaccine rates rise  well above 90 percent. OSHA estimates that the Federal standard--which  Republicans are fighting to undermine--will help protect 84 million  workers, prevent thousands of deaths and over 200,000 hospitalizations  from COVID-19.   I do not understand why--after all families have been through, after  all we have lost and all the hard work we have done to rebuild--would  anyone want to throw that in jeopardy and throw away one of the  strongest tools we have to get people vaccinated, keep them safe, and  end this pandemic once and for all. It is senseless. It is reckless. I  urge my colleagues to vote against it.   I yield the rest of my time to the Senator from Virginia.
