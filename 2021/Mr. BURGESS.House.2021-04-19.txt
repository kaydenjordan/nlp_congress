 Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to discuss one of the most  important problems facing our country, and that is security on our  southern border.   I don't think there is any question that most Americans agree that  our immigration system is broken, but before we can fix it, we have to  address the crisis at our southern border.   And let's be clear, what is happening at the border is a crisis. In  fact, the President admitted as much recently. His commander of Public  Health Service at the convention center in Dallas, when I went to visit  there, maintained that they were in crisis management. You don't manage  a crisis unless you are in a crisis, so it is a crisis. It is a  humanitarian crisis.   The policies being put forward by this administration, basically  absolutely opening the border are, in fact, inhumane. Smugglers,  traffickers, foreign banks are profiting and enticing a hopeless people  into sending their children or themselves to make this dangerous  journey to unlawfully cross our southern border. These bad actors know  how to manipulate our laws to their advantage. Putting forward policies  that make it easier for them to do so is, in fact, wrong.   During the month of March record numbers of unaccompanied alien  children were referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the  Department of Health and Human Services. The total number of people  coming in without authorization is the highest it has been in 15 years.  Customs and Border Protection encountered over 170,000 individuals  along our southern border attempting to cross without authorization.  Many of them were single adults.   Over the last month, Members from both sides of the aisle, both sides  of the Capitol flocked to our southern border to see and assess the  situation for  [[Page H1948]]  themselves. They held press conferences. They did television interviews  and press releases. Yet the reaction from the White House was one of  denial.   A little less than 30 days ago President Biden named Vice President  Harris to be the point person for the administration to bring a  resolution to the problems on our southern border. But the Vice  President has not ventured to the southern border. She has not had a  press conference about what is happening, and certainly we have seen no  plan.   It was announced last week that she would be traveling to the  Northern Triangle countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.  This would be a great first step. But to fully understand what is  happening, Madam Vice President, you need to visit our southern border.   Right now, hundreds of thousands of people come across our southern  border from Mexico and from Central American countries through Mexico.  And among these thousands are unaccompanied children, who are used as  pawns to take advantage of the administration not enforcing our  immigration laws. Now smugglers have no issue with using these children  as pawns.   From the numbers, we know that America is one of the most generous  countries in the world when it comes to accepting migrants. Through our  Nation's legal immigration process, we welcome over a million  immigrants into America each year. To be clear, these are immigrants  who are going through the normal and correct process, waiting in line  and following our laws. But how discouraging must it be for them to  watch as others take full advantage of our laws not being enforced  because of Washington putting forward poor policy. Despite the  generosity of the American people, others remain intent on entering our  country without the full benefit of the law behind them.   To better understand this problem, it is perhaps important to examine  its roots. In 2018 it was important for me to visit Northern Triangle  countries for myself to see the situation on the ground, to assess the  situation, and determine how the United States can better help and  better address the root causes of irregular migration.   The Energy and Commerce Committee, which I am a member of, does not  oversee foreign policy, but it does have jurisdiction over the  Department of Health and Human Services and subsequently the Office of  Refugee Resettlement, which does take care of children who end up in  the United States from one of those Northern Triangle countries.   I learned that there are different drivers for people to migrate from  each of those countries. There is, unfortunately, corruption at the  highest levels of government in that region. One common theme, however,  is campaign rhetoric that places an ``open for business'' sign on our  border.   The vast majority of people in the Northern Triangle countries do  live below the poverty level and lack the job opportunities to escape  these conditions.   In El Salvador there are problems with gangs, and the gangs are  violent, medieval levels of violence and brutality. Many of the  individuals serving in their government are holdovers from  revolutionaries in the civil war which ended over 20 years ago.   Honduras is a country that is a through point for narcotics  trafficking and, as a consequence, has many of the problems that you  would imagine would be attendant with that type of activity. The  current President ran for a second term. Although the law limited him  to a single term the Supreme Court gave him a favorable decision.  Unfortunately, he won with a very bare majority that only was  determined many days after, some significant time after the election.  Stop me if you have ever heard this before. But the Honduran President  is now subject to extensive protests throughout his country that  question the legitimacy of his Presidency.   I will say that the First Lady of Honduras, who has headed a task  force aimed at addressing irregular migration, is performing a valuable  service. The desire to make change is present, but some of the  resources and capacity are lacking.   In Guatemala corruption is rampant at every level of government.  There are only a couple of ministers who can be trusted. The corruption  is, in this case, exacerbated by term limits because the President can  only serve one term, and apparently there is a notion in the country  that it is important for the President to prepare for the life after  the Presidency while they are in office, so they do not have their  focus on performing in the public good.   There is also a significant prejudice against some of the indigenous  people in the western highlands of Guatemala. These individuals do make  up the majority of migrants who are leaving Guatemala. Guatemala,  unfortunately, has one of the highest rates of malnutrition in the  world, and there is very little effort to combat this because of the  lack of resolve of their central government.   In my travels to the Northern Triangle, I learned that there are  people in those countries who do desire their children stay home. They  understand the difficulty, the danger in exporting all of your young  people. They do not want irregular migration. They do not want mass  migration to happen. However, unfortunately, their governments have yet  to eradicate the corruption from within.   For example, they do not prohibit financial institutions from  contributing to the problem of these desperate populations. The  financing of human trafficking from these countries is extremely  profitable. Beyond the danger to the migrant, the journey from the  Northern Triangle to our southern border is not cheap. It varies what  the estimates are, but families take out loans from $1,000 to $10,000  in order to smuggle someone to the United States.   Children that enter the United States will sometimes go to work to  send remittances back to their homes so that their family is able to  pay off the loan. In fact, it is estimated that as much as 20 percent  of the GDP of Honduras comes in the form of remittances, so it is  disturbing to learn that legitimate banks in Northern Triangle  countries may be in this way aiding the human smuggling trade. It does  seem like it is being fueled by cash from sources from which it should  not come.                                time  2015    One clear solution to the corruption of these countries is to give  more aid to the Bureau of International Narcotics Control and Law  Enforcement, a United Nations organization; nongovernmental  organizations and nonprofits; the United States Agency for  International Development, USAID; the International Organization for  Migration; and other nongovernmental entities.   In addition, the United States Development Finance Corporation,  previously known as the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, is  facilitating needed investment in the region, and numerous nonprofits  and NGOs have set up programs to help poverty-stricken and recent  returnees.   One of my fears is what you hear discussed. Increasing the amount of  aid to Central American countries will help with this problem. I would  simply argue that the money not necessarily go to the governments that  are not doing their jobs but to these nongovernmental agencies, USAID,  and the U.S. Development Finance Corporation, which will provide the  economic benefit needed by the people who find it necessary to undergo  that irregular migration because their economic circumstances are so  dire.   In other words, the governments are not the ones that need the aid.  The aid needs to be placed in the hands of those who can and will help  the people. The answer to this humanitarian crisis is to not give more  aid to the governments of the countries that are failing but to keep  supporting the community-building organizations that are on the ground  and working to serve their people.   In line with this solution, in September 2018, I introduced H. Res.  1092, expressing the sense of the House that the President should  redirect foreign assistance given to El Salvador, Guatemala, and  Honduras away from their central governments and toward the driving  causes of illegal immigration into the United States and to those  nongovernmental organizations. I have reintroduced this as H. Res. 17  in this Congress.   The inability of the central governments of those countries to deal  with  [[Page H1949]]  and solve these issues has left over half of their populations living  in poverty. In fact, millions of El Salvadorans, Guatemalans, and  Hondurans face hunger at points each year.   This is why foreign assistance must be targeted toward the municipal  and regional governments in these countries, as well as community- building organizations that have a direct impact on the lives of the  people. Simply giving more aid to the central governments when it is  not getting to where it is needed is unlikely to solve the problem.   The amount of foreign assistance could be determined by multiplying  the number of unaccompanied alien children from El Salvador, Guatemala,  and Honduras and redirecting that amount for each country to these  noncentral government entities.   Focusing on where aid is directed is an essential part of the  solution. That is why, in December 2018, I offered an amendment to the  Department of Defense Appropriations Act to redirect foreign aid to  nongovernmental organizations in Northern Triangle countries and Mexico  from being given to the central governments.   Instead, this funding would only be given to regional or municipal  governments or educational institutions in these countries, private  entities, or other nongovernmental organizations, or faith-based  organizations operating in these countries.   To keep individuals, particularly unaccompanied alien children, from  arriving at our southern border, the help necessary to make their homes  safer and more prosperous is not through their central governments but  for institution-building and other areas that can provide them the help  they need to show that we are serious and to demonstrate to the central  governments of the Northern Triangle countries that the United States  cannot be constant caretakers for their children.   To that end, I have introduced several times the Unaccompanied Alien  Children Assistance Control Act to withhold aid from El Salvador,  Guatemala, and Honduras by the number of children in Federal custody  due to their immigration status, multiplied by a multiplier, which is  the estimated cost of caring for one unaccompanied alien child.   We should not be surprised that the reversal of the previous  administration's immigration policies led to an influx of unlawful  crossings at our southern borders. I would take issue with the fact  that this is said to be a cyclical uptick. Yes, there are cyclical  variations to the number of people who do cross our southern border,  but this one is not a cyclical uptick. This influx is a direct result  of a policy choice made by the Biden administration.   We faced a similar crisis in 2014, when President Biden was Vice  President, and President Obama's administration instituted the  dangerous catch and release policy that led to a flood of unauthorized  migrants and unaccompanied minors coming across our southern border.  Instead of keeping those who made unauthorized crossings in custody,  our immigration and enforcement agencies were required to release those  individuals into our country.   People were given a court date, but few, if any, would actually  appear. Beyond missing a court date, unauthorized migrants took  advantage of our system. Unfortunately, the diversion of so many people  coming across the border, the diversion of the attention of our law  enforcement officials on the border, has allowed for the free  importation of drugs like fentanyl and heroin across our border.   Due to those failures, it is understandable why the previous  administration instituted a policy that required the enforcement of our  laws. For 4 years, we listened to Members of Congress have these  discussions on the border and in the Halls of Congress about the  misfortune of those who crossed into our country without the benefit of  citizenship.   But what exactly does it mean to put forward a zero-tolerance policy?  It means enforcing the laws and giving needed support to our frontline  border officials.    No one wants to see a child separated from their parents. This is a  problem that Congress needs to fix. It is a problem that Congress can  fix.   To understand why this has happened, we look back to the court case  of Reno v. Flores in 1997, and we look at the asylum laws that were  passed in late 2008.   The Flores settlement prohibited the detention of children from a  noncontiguous country for more than 20 days. After those 20 days, they  are placed in the care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement if they  cannot be reunited with family.   Previously, when adults attempted to cross into the United States  without authorization, they were placed in immigration detention to  await an immigration hearing. But due to the backlog of immigration  cases, these adults were being held longer than 20 days. If they  entered with a child, the Flores settlement required that the child be  released. Therefore, the adults were also being released with them, and  very few ever showed up for their immigration proceedings.   It changed during the Trump administration. They held unauthorized  adults rather than releasing them. And if they entered with children,  those children were placed in the care of the Office of Refugee  Resettlement.   People claimed this was inhumane. If enforcing our laws is inhumane,  then we need to change the law. But it seems like what is inhumane is  incentivizing an already desperate people to make the dangerous journey  to our southern border. To do that in the first place seems inhumane.   We must realize that far too many children are being smuggled into  our country by adults who want to prey on the generosity of Americans.  A significant number of adults with children are not even biological  relatives to the child with whom they enter. Traffickers, cartels, and  smugglers know how to take advantage of a humanitarian crisis.   Being a father and a grandfather, I truly mean it when I say that no  one wants to separate a child from their parents. That is why, on  September 25, during the Rules Committee hearing, I offered an  amendment requiring a plan to promptly reunify children in the custody  of the Office of Refugee Resettlement.   It is not inhumane to enforce laws. Putting forth policies that allow  children to be used as pawns is itself inhumane. Trekking a child  across multiple countries just to smuggle them illegally into another  country, that is inhumane.   Stated another way, our laws are not inhumane; nonenforcement is  leading to inhumane actions by desperate people. We need to help them  at home, not here where the taxpayer is on the hook.   For anyone who turns on the news, you can see the terrible and  disheartening situation at the border. So, today, the question is  asked: Why would anyone object to enforcement of our laws?   There is significant proof that a zero-tolerance policy for violating  our laws is a deterrent for people subjecting themselves to harm by  taking a perilous trip to the American southern border.   For example, in early 2017, Department of Homeland Security Secretary  John Kelly visited the southern border. It was virtually deserted. In  June 2017, a Reuters journalist, Julia Edwards Ainsley, reported on the  decreased number of border crossings. She wrote: ``Last fall, during  the waning months of the Obama administration, hundreds of immigrants  crossed the river on rafts at this point each day, many willingly  handing themselves over to immigration authorities in hopes of being  released into the United States to await court proceedings that would  decide their fate.   ``Now, the agents look out on an empty landscape. Footpaths up from  the water have started to disappear under growing brush, with only the  stray baby shoe or toothbrush serving as reminders of that migrant  flood.   ``The reason for the change, the agents say, is a perception in  Mexico and Central America that President Trump has ended the practice  known as catch and release, in which immigrants caught in the United  States without proper documents were released to live free, often for  years, as their cases ran through the court system.   ``Now, would-be violators know `they will be detained and turned  right back around,' said one of the two agents, Marlene Castro. `It is  not worth it anymore.' ''  [[Page H1950]]    So said Julia Edwards Ainsley in June 2017.   What happened between the Obama years and the first years of the  Trump administration? When people believe that they will encounter a  border wall, or that they will be turned away at the border, they  simply do not come.   Our laws are only effective if they are enforced. If Congress truly  wants to repair our immigration system, we, the Members of Congress,  are obligated to act.   We know this is not the first time in American history that an  administration has used a zero-tolerance policy. Over 40 years ago,  during the Carter administration, between April 15 and October 31,  1980, there was a mass emigration of Cubans. They left from Cuba's  Mariel Harbor to travel to the United States. We remember this as the  Mariel boatlift. Because of this emigration, Fidel Castro decided to  open his prisons and mental health facilities, sending those Cubans  through the Straits of Florida to the United States. President Carter's  administration was left grappling with a Cuban refugee crisis.    In a 1997 interview, former Deputy Secretary of State John Bushnell  recalled a meeting with President Carter in which he and other key  advisers discussed solutions to the Cuban refugee problem:         I remember sitting in that windowless conference room of       the National Security Council with the Secretary of State,       the Chief of Naval Operations, the Director of the CIA, the       head of the Coast Guard, the head of INS, and several other       senior officials, debating how to stop this flow of Cubans.       National Security Advisor Brzezinski chaired until Carter       came in toward the end of the meeting.        There was a long discussion on how the Coast Guard and Navy       ships might physically stop the Cuban boats either from       leaving the United States or returning back with the Cubans       in the Mariel Boatlift. The Navy and Coast Guard, represented       at this meeting by admirals, were concerned.        ``How can we do this?'' they said, and it was suggested       that the boats simply could be stopped, physically prevented       from entering the United States, without any major loss of       life of the passengers. But they did suggest ways of       maneuvering the boats to block their passage, which struck me       as sort of wild. It sounded to me like they had in mind a       picket line of Coast Guard and Navy boats going across the       Straits of Florida to stop the movement of these small boats       with refugees. This naval discussion went on for a long time       but eventually was inconclusive.    Perhaps wisely so.   But from this interview, we understand that President Carter's  administration was contemplating how to physically stop Cuban boats  from coming to the United States.   Then, moving forward to the early 1990s, rafts of immigrants from  Haiti bound for the United States were intercepted at sea, as  authorized by policy enacted by President Bush's administration.                                time  2030    A young governor from Arkansas used divisive campaign rhetoric as he  ran against George H.W. Bush for President. Then-Governor Clinton time  and again spoke of his disagreement with President Bush's zero- tolerance immigration policy.   During his campaign, Governor Clinton often maligned President Bush  for being cruel in the treatment of Haitian refugees traveling to  America via boat. Some feared that he was creating an unrealistic  expectation for the Haitian people, who were suffering from significant  unrest in their country.   In the New York Times, an article entitled, ``Clinton Inspires Hope  and Fear in Haiti,'' a writer, Douglas Farah, wrote: ``It was Mr.  Clinton who helped create the expectation of an exodus from Haiti when  he condemned the Bush administration for a `cruel policy of returning  Haitian refugees to a brutal dictatorship without an asylum hearing.'''   We all know from our history in November of 1992, Governor Clinton  won the Presidential election. Because of President-elect Clinton's  promises, the people of Haiti anticipated being welcomed into the  United States with open arms. The problem is, after securing the White  House, President Clinton changed his mind after learning that perhaps  the true toll such an exodus would take as people took to the waters in  unseaworthy boats.   In a Voice of America address on January 14, 1993--a mere week before  he took the oath of office--President-elect Clinton walked back his  promise. Let me just read some of President-elect Clinton's remarks  that he spoke directly to the people of Haiti over the Voice of  America.   ``For Haitians who do seek to leave Haiti, boat departure is a  terrible and dangerous choice. I've been deeply concerned by reports  that many of you are preparing to travel by boat to the United States.  And, I fear that boat departures in the near future would result in  further tragic losses of life.   ``For this reason, the practice of returning those who flee Haiti by  boat will continue for the time being after I become President. Those  who do leave Haiti for the United States by boat will be stopped and  directly returned by the United States Coast Guard.   ``To avoid the human tragedy of a boat exodus, I wanted to convey  this message directly to the Haitian people: Leaving by boat is not the  route to freedom.''   Well, as you can imagine, this dramatic change did not go without  notice. January 17, 1993, the Chicago Tribune columnist Stephen Chapman  wrote: ``The President-elect has a terrible time making up his mind and  keeping it made up. A lot of Haitians are disappointed to find he's  something less than a man of his word. They're not the only ones.''   So just from these historical moments, we can understand that border  security is not a new debate; it is not an easy debate. President  Carter, President Clinton, President Obama, all learned the same  lesson. It is, in fact, inhumane to encourage anyone to attempt a  treacherous journey in order to reach America's borders without the  proper authorization to enter.   There are things we must prioritize to move forward. First, having  the understanding that enforcing our laws is, in fact, a humanitarian  response.   The next step would be security along the southern border. To put it  plain and simple: We can finish the wall, which includes having not  just the wall, but additional technologies to solve the problem.   In order to solve problems within our broken immigration system, the  bleeding needs to stop. You can't put a Band-Aid on an arterial wound.  You need to stop the bleeding. Congress first needs to address the  humanitarian crisis at our southern border.   So it was encouraging to hear Secretary Mayorkas announce a  reconsideration of filling the gaps in the construction on the southern  border wall. I recently took a trip down to McAllen. Between McAllen  and Laredo, you can see areas where the wall was being built. The  construction had stopped. The construction equipment was literally  abandoned at the side, but I was grateful that Secretary Mayorkas did  say that he was reconsidering filling in the gaps in the construction  in the southern border wall. The problem is the smugglers know where  those gaps are. They know how to use them to their advantage.   Again, let me say, when it comes to immigration, America is the most  generous country in the world. But is it okay for us to allow over  100,000 people a month to enter our country without authorization? Is  it all right for us to subject innocent children to a dangerous  journey?   Sovereign countries must define and defend their borders. I believe  that America is a country worth defending. It is heartbreaking that  after achieving operational control of the border after many years, it  was abandoned. It was abandoned through a series of executive orders  that was signed early in this President's administration. And what has  happened in its place, operational control of the border is no longer  determined by the United States of America. Operational control of the  border is now determined and dictated by cartels.   This week, we are considering two immigration bills: the NO BAN Act  and the Access to Counsel Act. The first will prevent the President  from banning anyone from entering the United States. The second  essentially provides a lawyer to anyone entering our country  unlawfully, thus prolonging the wait times for those who are trying to  enter our country through the normal legal process. And that all will  be done at the taxpayer's expense.   Clearly, these are the wrong solutions at this time. Our priority  should be to ensure that every President has the necessary tools to put  forward lawful priorities and not prevent them  [[Page H1951]]  from doing so. We should be focused on policies that will encourage  legal immigration rather than just reacting to illegal immigration.   It is important that we reinstate the ``Remain in Mexico Policy,''  also known as the Migrant Protection Protocols. We know this program  helped limit fraudulent asylum claims from those who thought they would  be able to just walk into the United States, and instead had to wait  their turn for a hearing while remaining in Mexico. It is not a good  idea to allow lawbreakers to jump in front of those who are here  lawfully.    We are still in the middle of a pandemic. Now, thankfully, the Biden  administration has kept the Trump administration's CDC Title 42  authority in place--oh, except for people younger than 17 years of age.  We are on the verge of ending the pandemic, but we must ensure that we  are doing everything we can to prevent additional spread of this  coronavirus. Something that would aid in doing that is requiring a  negative coronavirus test before someone is released into this country.   What happened when, under an executive order, the Title 42  restrictions were lifted for those under 17? A lot more people under  age 17 started coming through, started coming across. The problem is,  each of those individuals will eventually be placed with a family, and  by not testing for coronavirus, we are risking placing individuals who  are infected with the virus with families throughout the country.   So during consideration of the reconciliation bill, the one that was  supposed to crush the coronavirus, I offered a motion to instruct at  the Budget Committee and an amendment at the Committee on Rules to  provide for COVID testing for all arriving at our southern border. This  was rejected in the Budget Committee, and the Committee on Rules would  not make it in order to have a floor vote on that amendment.   And once migrants are in our Federal custody, we do have  responsibility that they receive appropriate and compassionate care.  Under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Commerce  Subcommittee on Health, we have conducted oversight on the Department  of Health and Human Services and the Office of Refugee Resettlement.   Since 2014, I have made multiple trips to the border and multiple  trips to ORR facilities. In the last few weeks, I visited Office of  Refugee Resettlement shelters in Carrizo Springs, in McAllen and the  convention center in downtown Dallas. Since my visit to the Carrizo  Springs facility, it has been doubled in size. There are so few beds at  ORR shelters along the border, there has been a need to expand further,  which is why I visited the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center in  Dallas.   It was startling to see those 2,400 cots lined up each to allow a 13-  to 17-year-old boy to sleep at night. They were so close together, any  restaurant that tried to open right now with tables placed that close  together would be shut down by the public health authorities. And yet,  here we were, in fact not just condoning it, we were facilitating it.   Look, the bottom line is, this is not a capacity problem, it is a  commitment problem. And we are, unfortunately, on a path to repeat  history. Many of us here know the work done by the Committee on Energy  and Commerce Subcommittee on Health in 2014. That work led to the  unaccompanied minors receiving better health screenings, and better  healthcare.   When I visited shelters in 2014, the children did not have access to  a doctor. They were not receiving any type of health screening. Today,  they have access to a full range of medical and mental health resources  and children are being screened for communicable diseases, children are  being given vaccinations for the usual childhood diseases prior to  their release to sponsors in this country. It makes sense to do that.  This protects American communities; this protects American schools,  where these children will eventually be enrolled.   Today, when a child is released from an ORR facility, they have a  phone number to contact the Department of Health and Human Services  after they leave their shelter. And they will also receive a wellness  check 30 days after their release to a sponsor.   In 2014, it wasn't that way, children were not given any means of  contact after they left Federal custody, and no follow up was  conducted. And unfortunately, you know what is going to happen in that  situation. Some children will not be placed with a competent caregiver,  and they can fall victim to trafficking or abuse.   Now, because of Members of the subcommittee and Members of the full  Committee on Energy and Commerce, if children need help once they leave  the shelter, they do have a lifeline. These are helpful resources for  those who are entrusted to Federal care. My primary goal is to secure  the border and to prevent unaccompanied minors from crossing the United  States without benefit of citizenship in the first place. But while it  is happening, we must do our best to ensure that they are safe after  they arrive.   I understand the care of children is a huge balancing act. Once they  are in our care, it becomes our responsibility, and we must ensure that  those traveling with them are not using them to game our immigration  system. It is simply wrong and potentially harmful to the child, not to  check that the adult with which they are traveling is, in fact, related  or their legal guardian.   Ultimately, we will have to put an end to this crisis. From our  experiences, both recent and throughout history, we know that our  rhetoric matters. The message must be clear: Do not cross the border  unlawfully. For years, Presidents, Senators, Representatives, have  promised to end ``catch-and-release'' and restore order on the southern  border.   The human traffickers, the coyotes in Central America, use our words  spoken in Washington, D.C. They use our words to prey on the  disadvantaged in Central American countries to entice families into  putting their children on the top of a freight train to travel through  the Mexican desert. And they do that by putting a price on the head of  each child. They use our words to subject children to the violence of  cartels, or worse, children who may not arrive in the United States  after beginning that journey.                                time  2045    When we say, or even suggest, that children could receive amnesty at  the border, we put innocent lives at risk. Our words turn these  children into literal game pieces. We can be compassionate and we can  provide a secure border at the same time. These two concepts are not  mutually exclusive.   In 1980, as former Deputy Secretary of State Bushnell recalled,  Congress appropriated over $400 million to assist holding and settling  Cuban refugees in the United States.   And reflecting on that time, later, former Deputy Secretary Bushnell  said, ``I used this appropriation as a key example of why foreign aid  through the Caribbean Group was a good investment. It was much better  to help our neighbors build a good economic future for themselves at  home than to have a flood of desperate refugees, which would cost more  money to settle.''   I think, today, it would be wise to consider Secretary Bushnell's  reasoning. Perhaps Congress could heed my recommendation to address how  we send foreign aid to countries such as El Salvador, Guatemala,  Honduras, and Mexico.   Should it be tied to the care that their children receive?   Here is the deal: Why should we reward countries whose children are  fleeing for their safety to our country?   Certainly, it is something worth consideration.   It is simply irresponsible and it is inhumane for the American  Government to incentivize anyone to subject themselves or their  children to that perilous journey on our border. It was a lesson that  President Clinton learned. It was a lesson that President Carter  learned. It was a lesson that President Obama learned. And I do fear  that it is a lesson that President Biden will learn.   We know the solution. We do know what works. Simply put, enforcement  of Title 42 protections for all age groups, not accepting those younger  than 17. Accept enforcement of Title 42, the CDC requirement that,  during a pandemic, we restrict travel across the border.   Reinstitution of the Asylum Cooperative Agreements with Central  American countries. At great negotiation  [[Page H1952]]  skill, these cooperative agreements were established, but,  unfortunately, they have recently been abandoned. They could be  reconsidered. They could be reestablished. We are going to have to have  agreements with the countries of origin around asylum if we are going  to be able to solve the problem.   The Migrant Protection Protocol, ``Remain in Mexico,'' was  successful. It did help in the assessment of the Asylum Cooperative  Agreements. This could be reinstituted, and it is probably time that it  was.   In fact, it is past time to end a broken and inhumane pattern. It is  past time to stop demonizing those who we ask to enforce our laws. It  is past time to understand that nonenforcement of our laws does lead to  inhumane actions.   It is up to Congress. We are the legislative branch. We are the ones  under the Constitution who are responsible for providing this security  at our border. What is so critically important is that we must do it  sooner rather than later.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
