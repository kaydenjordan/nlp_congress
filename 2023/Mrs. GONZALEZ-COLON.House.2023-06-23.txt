 Mr. Speaker, I rise to reject attempts by the  United Nations Special Committee for Decolonization calling for the  independence of Puerto Rico.   It is no surprise that Cuba, Nicaragua, Russia, Syria, and Venezuela,  who are among the worst human rights violators and antidemocratic  regimes in the world are the ones calling for Puerto Rico's  independence in an attempt to advance their anti-American agenda and  grow their influence in the region.   For 106 years, Puerto Ricans have been proud American citizens,  participating in the U.S. Armed Forces in  [[Page H3132]]  record numbers. As a U.S. territory and under the U.S. Constitution, it  is Congress, not the United Nations, and certainly not a committee made  up of authoritarian regimes that has the ultimate responsibility to  address Puerto Rico's political status.   Puerto Ricans have made it very clear through votes and democratic  elections--something these nations will never learn--we want to join  our fellow Americans on equal footing as a full State of the Union.                            ____________________
