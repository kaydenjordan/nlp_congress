 Madam Speaker, I rise in proud recognition of the  Mountain Fifes and Drums music program in my own district in Twin  Peaks, California.   This program is dedicated to the patriotic mission of teaching young  Americans, age 10 to 18, appreciation of and performance of 18th  century military music.   They do this through instruction in classic musical instruments, such  as the fife and the rope tension drum. I am extremely proud that the  Mountain Fifes and Drums music program is performing today in Mt.  Vernon, appropriately, the home of our first Commander in Chief, George  Washington.   It warms my heart that programs like this exist to teach this  patriotic art and appreciation of this unique period of American  history to a new generation of Americans.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my colleague from  Louisiana, for yielding.   I am honored to join in helping to celebrate National Police Week  where we take a moment out of our lives to honor the commitment and the  sacrifice of the men in blue and the men and women in uniform who help  keep our communities safe.   I represent one of the largest districts in the United States, and,  certainly, the largest district in California. It is very challenging  to police, and my constituents rely on the abilities of the police to  uphold the rule of law and to keep them safe in a very rural setting.   Our law enforcement agencies in California's Eighth District have  done a tremendous job of this. Just this year, the San Bernardino  County Police Department and Sheriff's Department have seized over 100  pounds of fentanyl. That is over half a million pills that they have  kept off the street.  [[Page H2260]]  They have also helped, just this year, 19 adults and four children  escape the evil scourge of human trafficking.   In Inyo County, the Inyo County Sheriff's Department recently held an  event in which they reclaimed almost 200 pounds of unused prescription  medication, keeping those toxic substances out of our landfill and out  of our water supply.    In Mono County, the Mono County Sheriff's Department recently  implemented a 911 text to 911 system that will help the residents of  Inyo County reach law enforcement services when they need it. If you  know that county, Mr. Speaker, then you know how rural it is and how  much those community constituents depend on a responsive police force.   I know there has been a lot of discussion in this body and in  legislatures across the country about police reform this year. What I  wish that all of our constituents knew is that there is broad,  bipartisan agreement on 90 percent of that legislation. We can solve  this problem in a way that implements police reform, but at the same  time, respecting the role that our law enforcement members fill in  serving our community that provides them the training and the resources  that they need to do their jobs, and that honors the role that they  play in protecting our communities.   So happy National Police Week, and I thank our men and women in  uniform.
