 Madam Speaker, 57 years ago this week, President Lyndon  B. Johnson signed into law the Medicare and Medicaid Act. By increasing  healthcare access for elderly and low-income Americans, this act was a  giant leap forward in building a more perfect Union.   Today, nearly 64 million Americans are enrolled in Medicare, and over  83 million Americans receive assistance from Medicaid.   We know that these programs are highly effective. Extensive research  shows that Medicaid coverage is associated with a range of positive  health outcomes. Medicare and Medicaid save lives. Medicare and  Medicaid also have considerable economic benefits. Medicaid  significantly helps reduce poverty and has been tied to economic  mobility across generations and higher educational attainment, income,  and taxes paid.   Despite the benefits of Medicare and Medicaid, my Republican  colleagues are trying to dismantle these programs.   In 2018, a House Republican budget proposed slashing $537 billion  from Medicare over a decade. Yet, while House Republicans try to gut  Medicare and Medicaid, House Democrats are working to expand these  programs to more Americans.                                time  1215    I am fighting particularly hard to improve Medicare and Medicaid in  my district of the Virgin Islands of the United States and the other  U.S. territories, which have long suffered from healthcare inequities.   Before 2017, in the Virgin Islands, nearly 30 percent of residents  didn't  [[Page H7077]]  have health insurance. This is a rate disproportionately higher than  the national average of approximately 9 percent. As of 2021, 34,000  individuals in the Virgin Islands, over a third of our population,  relied on Medicaid and CHIP.   However, the Virgin Islands has historically been denied the same  Medicare and Medicaid benefits available to the States. Unlike the  States, Federal Medicaid funding to the Virgin Islands is capped.  Before the storms of 2017, the Federal Government covered just 55  percent of Medicaid costs to the Virgin Islands, which is substantially  lower than the 83 percent that would have been covered if the Virgin  Islands were treated as a State.   In addition, the Virgin Islands and U.S. territories are excluded  from receiving low-income subsidies under the Medicare prescription  drug benefit, and they are excluded from DSH, the Disproportionate  Share Hospital program under both Medicaid and Medicare.   Through recent legislation, I worked to temporarily increase the  Federal share of Medicaid funding to the Virgin Islands from 55 percent  to 83 percent and increase Federal Medicaid funding to the Virgin  Islands by hundreds of millions of dollars. This has allowed 20,000 of  our most vulnerable Virgin Islanders to retain access to healthcare.   Unfortunately, these provisions are only temporary, and a permanent  solution is needed to ensure the people of the Virgin Islands have  access to affordable healthcare. That is why I introduced H.R. 3434  with Representatives from the other territories.   This bill would eliminate the unfair Medicaid funding limits for U.S.  territories, increase Medicare reimbursements to hospitals in the U.S.  territories, allow residents of the U.S. territories to be eligible for  low-income subsidies under the Medicare prescription drug benefit,  permit DSH payments to U.S. territories, and take other measures to  improve access to health insurance.   Madam Speaker, I am calling on the Senate to address the Medicaid  issue for the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam, Northern Marianas, and  American Samoa to help almost hundreds of thousands of Americans. I am  calling on the Senate to address this in any healthcare reconciliation  bill with what was passed for the territories here in the House.   When President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Medicare and Medicaid Act  into law, he promised: ``No longer will older Americans be denied the  healing miracle of modern medicine. . . . No longer will young families  see their incomes, and their hopes, eaten away simply because they are  carrying out their deep moral obligations to their parents and to their  uncles and their aunts.''   Unfortunately, this promise has yet to be fulfilled to residents of  the Virgin Islands and the U.S. territories. As we mark 57 years of  this legislation, let us commit to fully realizing this hope by  expanding access to Medicare and Medicaid to all Americans.                            ____________________
