Mr. President, the Biden administration can't quite seem  to decide on the status of the pandemic or the status of the economy.   On the one hand, we are being told that we no longer need pandemic- era border restrictions intended to help limit illegal immigration and  prevent the spread of COVID. On the other hand, the administration is  still fighting to require Americans to wear masks on public transit and  airplanes and is urging Congress to pass additional COVID spending to  fight the pandemic the administration seems to believe is over at the  border.   It is a confusing message, to say the least. Americans know the  pandemic can't simultaneously be over for migrants at the border but  make it too dangerous for a South Dakotan to fly from Sioux Falls to  Minneapolis without a mask.   The administration's messaging is similarly muddled on the economy  and student loans. On the one hand, the President is proudly touting  ``record'' job creation and ``record'' economic growth even though most  of what he is taking credit for is the natural consequence of an  economic recovery from the pandemic. On the other hand, the President  recently announced that he is extending the moratorium on Federal  student loan payments, interest, and collections for another 4 months,  until August 31, because Americans are still suffering economically as  a result of the pandemic.   Well, which is it? Is our economy thriving or are Americans  economically distressed?   The student loan repayment moratorium and interest freeze included in  the CARES Act at the beginning of the pandemic made sense. Our economy  was starting to shut down, and Americans' jobs were in jeopardy, but it  made sense as a temporary measure for a genuine emergency. We are no  longer having double-digit unemployment as we did during some of the  worst moments of the pandemic. In fact, our current unemployment rate  is a low 3.6 percent. For college graduates, the unemployment rate is a  staggeringly low 2 percent.   To paraphrase the Wall Street Journal's editorial board on the  subject, if student loan borrowers aren't ready to return to making  payments now, they will never be.   Even the Washington Post editorialized against the President's latest  extension, noting:         What was a needed emergency measure at the start of the       pandemic is no longer justified. It is hard to make an       argument that college graduates are struggling right now. The       unemployment rate for Americans with a bachelor's degree or       higher is a mere 2 percent. There is a near-record number of       job openings.    That was from the Washington Post.   It is true that Americans are facing economic challenges as a result  of the inflation that President Biden and Democrats helped to create  with their ill-considered American Rescue Plan Act, but, if anything,  President Biden's latest student loan pause could help prolong our  inflation problems, and, importantly, it will have the biggest benefits  for those who are most able to deal with price hikes from inflation.  This clearly regressive policy benefits high-debt, high-income  borrowers significantly more than low-debt, low-income borrowers.   Again, to quote the Washington Post once more:         Rising prices of gas, rent, food and cars are a hardship,       but forgiving interest on student loans for four more months       offers the biggest benefits to people who have earned degrees       in medicine and law. These people go on to have lucrative       careers. Meanwhile, the 64 percent of Americans who do not       have a college degree don't benefit at all from Biden's pause       on loan repayments.    That was again from the Washington Post.   And subsidizing all of those doctors and lawyers ends up being pretty  expensive. The student loan repayment moratorium has already cost the  Federal Government more than $100 billion. By the time the President's  latest extension of the moratorium is up, it will have cost the Federal  Government billions more.   After a huge increase in our national debt, thanks to the pandemic  and reckless Democratic spending, the government does not need to be  forgoing billions of dollars by providing student loan relief to  Americans with some of the highest earning potential, which is why,  this morning, I introduced legislation--the Stop Reckless Student Loan  Actions Act--to end the current deferment on student loan repayments  and limit a President's authority to pause student loan repayments in  the future.   My legislation, which I introduced with my colleague Senator Richard  Burr and Senators Braun, Cassidy, and Marshall, would continue to allow  a President to temporarily suspend student loan payments during a  future national emergency, but it would limit those suspensions to a  period of 90 days and subject them to congressional disapproval.   It would also ensure that relief is targeted to those who need it  most by preventing Presidents from suspending  [[Page S2192]]  payments for higher income individuals; and, importantly, it would  prevent a President or a Secretary of Education from using a national  emergency to cancel student loan debt, which leads me to, perhaps, my  biggest concern in all of this.   Deferring student loan payments is a bad policy that is costing the  Federal Government money it doesn't have, but it pales in comparison to  the ultimate goal for many Democrats--and that is canceling student  loan debt entirely.   Days ago, the President's Press Secretary, in referring to the  payment deferment, said:         Between now and August 31, it's either going to be extended       again or we're going to make a decision . . . about canceling       student debt.    That was from the President's Press Secretary.   Her statement made it alarmingly clear that the President isn't just  temporarily deferring loan payments but is seriously considering  canceling--canceling--a significant portion of Federal student loan  debt.   She doubled down on that idea on Monday, noting:         What I would tell you is that not a single person in this       country has paid a dime on Federal student loans since the       President took office.    My gosh, canceling student loan debt is a bad idea for so many  reasons.   In the first place, it is money the Federal Government simply doesn't  have. Democrats often speak as if the Federal Government were able to  draw from an unlimited pot of money, but, of course, we know that is  not true. Government funds aren't anywhere close to being unlimited,  and government coffers aren't filled from a pot of gold at the end of  the rainbow. They are filled by taxpayer dollars, and sooner or later,  it will be taxpayers who foot the bill for any loan forgiveness  program, including the many taxpayers who opted not to attend college  or who chose a debt-free way of doing so.   I can scarcely think of anything more unfair than forcing Americans  who incurred no college debt to shoulder the bill for those who did,  especially when a substantial portion of that debt is incurred by those  with the greatest earning potential.   Canceling student debt would also be grossly unfair to the Americans  who worked hard for years to pay off their loans. An American who has  just finished paying off his or her higher education debt would get  nothing--nothing--from such a cancellation while a recent graduate who  had made just a month or two of payments could see his or her debt  disappear entirely.   And canceling student debt would do nothing to address the real  problem, which is the out-of-control cost of higher education. In fact,  it would likely make that problem worse, not to mention the fact that  student loan cancellation would take an already bad inflation situation  and, almost undoubtedly, make it much worse. We think 8.5-percent  inflation is bad, and it is, but canceling student loan debt this fall  could take inflation to new and even more painful heights.   Now, I strongly support finding ways to drive down the cost of higher  education and educate students about the dangers of excessive debt. I  also support measures to help students pay off their student loans  without putting taxpayers on the hook for hundreds of billions of  dollars or more. I would note the measure that I got included in the  CARES Act and extended later that year to allow employers to make tax- free payments on their employees' student loans; but unnecessarily  deferring student loan payments--or worse, the canceling of a  significant portion of student loan debt entirely--is a terrible idea  for many reasons.   I hope that colleagues from both sides of the aisle will join the  student loan bill that I introduced earlier today to end these endless  and unnecessary loan deferment extensions.   I hope at least some of my Democratic colleagues will recognize the  unwisdom of canceling student loan debt, its blatant unfairness to  individuals who have already paid off their student loans or who never  went to college and the negative effect it would have on our inflation- ridden economy.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4094         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Congress finds the following:        (1) The Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students       Act of 2003 (20 U.S.C. 1098aa et seq.) was intended to       provide relief opportunities for members of the armed       services.        (2) The authority provided under the Higher Education       Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 has been abused       by the Executive Branch during the COVID-19 national       emergency regarding the payment of Federal student loans.        (3) The unilateral payment pause on Federal student loans       has cost $100,000,000,000.        (4) The individuals benefitting the most from the payment       pause continued by the Executive Branch are doctors, who       receive 11 times the benefit of bachelor's degree recipients       and 14 times the benefit of associate's degree recipients.       SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE HIGHER EDUCATION RELIEF                     OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS ACT OF 2003.

A bill to improve access for diverse-owned asset management  firms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions.
