 Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 60th  anniversary and the opening of a new location of the legendary Pancake  Pantry in Nashville.   On December 13, the Pancake Pantry, a Nashville staple and landmark  restaurant, will open a second location to offer its famous varieties  of pancakes as well as begin a partnership with the Nashville Predators  Foundation to support local communities.   Since 1961, this iconic restaurant has brightened the mornings of  both tourists and residents of the Music City and will now partner with  the Nashville Predators Foundation to give back to the community.   Through grants and partnerships directed towards the educational,  health, and social needs of Middle Tennesseans, the Pancake Pantry is  committed to supporting the local community.   To show their support, special ``Nashville Predator'' pancakes will  be available between January 1 and February 28, 2022, and for each  order sold, the Pancake Pantry will make a monetary donation to the  Nashville Predators Foundation.   Established on August 18, 2009, the Nashville Predators Foundation  strives to meet the needs of the local community by offering resources  and financial support to youth-oriented organizations, awarding nearly  $7.0 million to the greater Nashville community. Let us celebrate this  announcement and commitment to helping those in need.                            ____________________
