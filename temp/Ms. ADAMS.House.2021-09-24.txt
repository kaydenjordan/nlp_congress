 Madam Speaker, a woman who does not own or control her own  body cannot call herself free.   I want you to close your eyes and imagine being forced to give birth  during a global pandemic: fewer in-person visits, more telehealth  visits; new parents having children alone without their families,  worrying if the baby will catch the virus; something goes wrong, there  may not be space in the ICU.   Now open your eyes to the truth. A woman should not have to yield  control over her own choices and her own body.   So let's pass this bill, the Women's Health Protection Act. That is  what we need to do.  [[Page H5151]]         Madam Speaker, I want to amplify the voice of Calla Hales,  a woman in my district who is both an abortion care provider, and a  mother.         ``Last year, I made the choice to have a child with my       husband.        What I didn't choose was prenatal checkups with COVID       precautions. I didn't choose the complications I had during       my pregnancy. I didn't choose delivering my amazing baby girl       without my family because the pandemic limited the visitors       in the maternity ward.        I didn't choose worrying every day if she would be safe       from the coronavirus, despite her pulmonary issues.        I am proud of the choice that I made, in spite of       everything that's gone wrong over the past two years.        But no one should ever be forced to make that choice. No       person should be forced to carry a pregnancy to term, during       a global pandemic, or any other time.''
