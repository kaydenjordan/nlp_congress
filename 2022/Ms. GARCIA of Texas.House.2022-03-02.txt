 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  President Biden and the significant accomplishments he shared with us  during last night's State of the Union address.   Last year, together with President Biden, we made a promise that  Democrats would deliver for the people; and that we have. Thanks to our  President's bold leadership and our work in Congress, we have been  delivering. Let's look at a few areas.   Jobs, jobs, and more jobs. As was mentioned last night by President  Biden, in his first year, 6.7 million jobs were created, marking the  strongest year of job growth in history. In my home State of Texas  alone more than 37,600 manufacturing jobs were created. These are good,  well-paying jobs that are putting Texans back to work. Our economy is  on the rise. Wages are strong. The unemployment rate is low.   Another area is our Nation's GDP. While GDP dropped 3.4 percent in  2020, it was able to shoot up to 5.7 percent in 2021--the highest rate  since 1984. Simply put, the economy has rebounded during President  Biden's first year in office.   Another very important area to all our working families is our public  schools. I am proud of the significant progress that has been made in  our public schools during the President's first year. We have made huge  strides in reopening our schools and keeping them open safely.   One year ago, Mr. Speaker, merely 46 percent of schools were open  because it just wasn't safe for teachers, students, and faculty due to  COVID. Today, 99.9 percent of schools are safely opened. The  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act as well as the American Rescue  Plan both provided schools the necessary funds they needed to stay open  and make up for lost learning time.   Another very crucial area, vaccination rates. One year ago today,  only 15 percent of the U.S. population was fully vaccinated against  COVID-19, today that number is 65 percent. The massive increase in  vaccinations is the direct result of the President and this Congress'  leadership to tackle this virus. Even today we do not have to wear our  masks this morning.   Let's look ahead. Action from the Biden administration and Congress  has already resulted in significant progress on the supply chain  challenges. The bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will  improve and protect supply chains and reduce reliance on foreign oil  immensely for years to come. It will help lower costs and inflation  rates with time. As President Biden said last night, the plan is to  lower your costs, not your wages.    There is a lot more President Biden and Democrats are working on in  building a better America, like investments in affordable childcare and  paid and universal pre-K that would allow more working families to  participate in the economy.   It is those very workers and everyday hardworking Americans who  deserve the greatest praise of all.   Our hometown heroes have braved through this pandemic and powered  through many challenges. They have been the muscle and the backbone of  our Nation's record-breaking economic growth and recovery from the  pandemic and we thank them.   With President Biden's leadership, Congress' partnership, and the  support of the American people, there is truly no limit as to what we  can achieve together in building a better America.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to tell the people of Ukraine that  we stand with them. I stand with them. ``Yes, we can,'' ``si se  puede.'' I want the people of Ukraine to know that we see you, we hear  you, and we love you. And Russia, who has purposely invaded your  homeland has been--well, I should not say the word I really want to say  on the floor--but they have been inhumane, cruel, and just beyond the  pale. We will not stand for this.   We will stand with Ukraine. Again, ``yes, we can,'' ``si se puede.''  We stand with you.                            ____________________
