 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the first-ever graduating  class from the Valley Scholars program at James Madison University in  Harrisonburg, Virginia.   Between eighth grade and high school graduation, potential first- generation college students are recruited as scholars from surrounding  public school districts, and they engage in educational and cultural  enrichment activities.   During the Valley Scholars program, students are encouraged and  motivated to become leaders in the classroom and the community while  building skills that will increase awareness and access to institutions  of higher education.   With the goal of receiving scholarship support to attend JMU, the  students have the opportunity to be the first in their families to earn  college degrees.   Virginia's Sixth District is incredibly proud of these talented  students for their hard work to achieve their American Dream.   I congratulate the first graduating class of Valley Scholars and  their families back home. America can't wait to see what the future has  in store for them.                            ____________________
