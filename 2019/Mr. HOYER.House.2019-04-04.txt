 Mr. Speaker, I have taken no backseat to my support for  Israel for half a century. I rise in opposition to this cynical,  political ploy.   We are about to vote on a resolution concerning U.S. involvement in  the conflict in Yemen and how to promote an end to a humanitarian  crisis in a country that threatens the lives of 22 million people. They  are hungry. They are displaced. They are scarred by a war and violence.  This resolution is about them and about what we as a nation can do to  put a stop to that conflict.   The gentleman is incorrect. The gentleman did not tell us the truth.  This kills this resolution.   In an effort to prevent Congress from taking action on such an  important issue, however, House Republicans are trying to make this a  vote about something else; and in doing so, they risk undermining the  long history of bipartisan consensus supporting our ally, Israel.   How shameful. How sad.   The American people will not be fooled or misled by this tactic. Our  fellow supporters of Israel will not be fooled. No one can accuse me of  failing to defend the U.S.-Israel partnership and strongly opposing  BDS.   Mr. Speaker, I will be voting against this motion, and I urge all of  my colleagues to do so as well. I urge every single one of them to do  so.   And I urge every Republican who believes that using Israel as a  partisan cudgel is dangerous, cynical, and harmful to Israel to join me  in voting against this motion.    Mr. Speaker, none of the major organizations supporting Israel have  any illusions about what this motion seeks  [[Page H3082]]  to do. Its intention is not to unite, but to divide. Its intention is  not to support our ally, but to sabotage our resolution about the  conflict in Yemen. This vote on this motion is a vote to kill this  joint resolution through a cynical and dishonest tactic.   So let's move past this charade of a motion. Let's stop playing games  with this very important and serious issue in support of Israel. Reject  ``gotcha'' politics.   Let me be clear: For as long as I am majority leader, House Democrats  will never waiver in our party's steadfast support for a strong Israel  relationship. Vote ``no.''    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. Scalise, for  yielding. I also thank him for not mentioning the LSU-Maryland game one  more time.    We are both lamenting that fact.   On Monday, Madam Speaker, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning- hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed  until 6:30 p.m. On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning- hour debate and 12 p.m. for legislative business. On Wednesday, the  House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. On Thursday and  Friday, no votes are expected in the House.   We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. The  complete list of suspension bills will be announced by close of  business tomorrow.   Madam Speaker, the House will also consider H.R. 1644, Save the  Internet Act of 2019. This bill will reverse the administration's  repeal of critical net neutrality protections, which will empower the  FCC to prohibit unjust, unreasonable, and discriminatory practices and  ensure consumers can make informed decisions when shopping for internet  plans. This bill also enacts authorities to support expanding broadband  to rural communities and struggling Americans.   In addition, Madam Speaker, it is possible the House will take action  to set the budget levels for discretionary spending for the next 2  fiscal years.    Madam Speaker, as the gentleman knows, we share views, as  he has expressed, and we are awaiting committee action. When the  committee acts, we will make a determination of how to go forward.    Madam Speaker, as I said, I agree with the gentleman's  objective and position with respect to BDS. The committee has  legislation before it and is considering it.   As you know, Mr. Schneider and Mr. Nadler, I think, are the  cosponsors of that legislation. I expect the committee to consider it,  and then, at that point in time, we will make a decision how to move  forward.                                time  1245     Well, of course, as the gentleman well knows, we have,  Madam Speaker, passed many substantive pieces of legislation. We have  sent to the Senate H.R. 1, a very broad-reaching reform bill trying to  ensure voting rights and access for everybody, trying to ensure fair  redistricting throughout the country, trying to make sure that dark  money does not control our elections, and making sure that we are  operating both in the executive and the legislative agency with ethical  conduct.   That passed unanimously on our side. I forget exactly how many.    Today's vote, obviously, we had two very substantive  pieces of legislation, one of which is going now to the President, and  the other of which--the Violence Against Women Act--had a signature  bipartisan vote, as the gentleman knows, passed the House.   We have done the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which had been  pending for some period of time in making that a permanent piece of  legislation.   We made sure that women--in 1963, we passed the Equal Pay Act. John  Kennedy signed it. Unfortunately, we are still struggling to make sure  that that promise is realized and that women are, in fact, paid based  upon what they do, not based upon what their gender is.   So I would say to my friend, we have passed a lot of legislation we  had pending, and we are doing a lot of hearings. We are dealing with  infrastructure. We are dealing with drug prices. We made it a big issue  in the campaign. We are moving ahead to make sure the Affordable Care  Act works in a way that it was designed to work.   So I would say to my friend that we have pursued, both on the floor  and in committee, the substantive legislation that we have talked to  the American people about.   I also feel very strongly that we want to avoid what happened to us  at the end of the last Congress, when you were in the majority. We shut  down the government.   I am going to be working hard, hopefully on both sides of the aisle.  I don't think anybody wants to see that as an objective, so I am  hopeful that we can work together.   I am working with your ranking member on the Appropriations  Committee, Kay Granger, with whom I have served for some period of  time, and Mrs. Lowey to make sure that we get the appropriation bills  done in a timely fashion and send them to the Senate.   I am hopeful that that will occur, and I am hopeful that we can fund  the government in a rational way and not shut down government, which  was so irrational and so harmful to our country and so costly to our  taxpayers.   So those are some of the things that we have done, are doing, and  will do; and, hopefully, we can, to some degree, work on this in as  bipartisan a fashion as possible.   In particular, the President has said he wants to bring the cost of  prescription drugs down. We share that view. I am hopeful that we can  work together.   The President said he wants a substantial infrastructure piece of  legislation. We share that view. We hope we can work together on that.   So we have been pursuing, on a weekly basis; and this was, from our  perspective, a pretty good week. I know we disagree on the net  neutrality bill, but we do agree that it is a major piece of  legislation, and I expect to pass that next week as well.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comment.   Of course, there was no budget last year until very, very late in the  year.   What was done was what we will certainly make sure we do very early  on, which is to try to establish the numbers, which, of course, a caps  deal would do. And our objective will be to show our values in the  appropriation bills as they come to the floor--hopefully, in a timely  fashion--and our main objective would be not to shut down the  government but to do our work on time.   I am confident that, working together, we can reach that objective.    Madam Speaker, as the gentleman may know, the Speaker  invited Mr. Lighthizer to address members of the Democratic Caucus on  where we stood.   As you know, that agreement has not been submitted. The Speaker said  the other day that, in order to consider that in a positive way, the  Mexicans, whom the President has been somewhat critical of through the  years, take certain actions which make sure that our workers and their  workers are treated fairly so we are competing on an even keel.   But we certainly are in discussions. There are a number of items of  concern, which have historically been of concern, regarding the  environment, regarding workers' rights, regarding the availability of  prescription drugs for people, as well as enforcement, dispute  resolution.   So those are being discussed. The conversations are ongoing, and I  believe that the administration will make a determination when they  believe it is timely to submit that document to us. As the gentleman  knows, once they do so, there is a timeframe in which the House and  Senate must act. The committees must act within, essentially, a 3-month  period of time.   So we are in discussions. We are waiting on the administration's  judgment as to when to submit. And I am sure they are discussing with  us as to when we think that is timely as well, but there are still  substantive matters that are being discussed.   I would presume some of those are on your side as well.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his question.   As the gentleman knows, Madam Speaker, the House voted on this bill  during the last two Congresses. The most recent time it was brought to  the floor, the gentleman and his party were in control of the House,  the Senate, and the Presidency. That bill was not brought up in the  Senate.   The gentleman mentioned, earlier, H.R. 1 and that Mr. McConnell has  said that wouldn't be brought up. In fact, when it passed this House,  it went to the Senate, and it was not brought up by Senator McConnell.  So there are no plans at this point in time for us to bring this up.    Madam Speaker, I have nothing further to say. I thank the  gentleman from Louisiana.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday next, when it shall  convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative  business.
