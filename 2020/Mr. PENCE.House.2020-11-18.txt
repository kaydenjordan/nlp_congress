 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 672, a  resolution that reinforces our Eastern European allies in the Three  Seas Initiative.   Since the Iron Curtain was lifted in 1991, citizens of Eastern  European countries have suffered the economic consequences of poorly  kept, soviet-era infrastructure that ensures their reliance on Russia  for generations to come.  [[Page H5904]]    As we all know, the goal of the Three Seas Initiative is to diversify  resources in the region by collectively investing in cross border  projects into the EU.   Reclaiming valuable economic leverage will open doors to enhanced  energy development and expand access to global markets.   By capitalizing on this partnership, countries of the Three Seas  Initiative are better equipped to meet the needs of a 21st century  economy.   A more economically prosperous and secure Eastern Europe is in the  interest of American foreign policy.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Three Seas  Initiative and pass H. Res. 672.   I want to thank the sponsor, Congresswoman Kaptur, Chairman Keating,  and Ranking Member Kinzinger for their leadership.
