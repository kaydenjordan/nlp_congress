 Madam Speaker, I am fairly new here. Actually,  this is my first floor speech. But I rise to oppose this impeachment.   I asked my staff this morning, how many times in our Nation's history  have we impeached a President? Well, they said, up until this  President, only two times in our Nation's history.   So here we are, 7 days left in his first term, and we are going to  impeach a President. For what reasons? For what reasons? There have  been no hearings. There have been no committees.   We must defend the right and protect the process of impeachment. If  we pursue this, from now on, from this day forward, impeachment will  always be a political process.   I ask my friends across the aisle--they always talk about healing-- healing. How do we come together as a nation?   Since 2016, there have been hashtags going around in our Nation that  said, ``Not our President,'' ``Resist, resist.'' Members across the  aisle have said things in public to have supporters of this President  attacked and demeaned.
