 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today to try, with my colleagues,  to put an end to the double shutdown threat.   There are two shutdown threats existing right now in the U.S.  Capitol. One is a threat by certain Members in the House majority to  shut the government down at the end of the month. That would be  foolish. It would hurt people unnecessarily. It would be particularly  foolish given the existence of Federal law that says Federal employees  get paid even during a shutdown. How would it be fiscally conservative  to shut the government down, lock Federal employees out of their  offices, disable them from serving their fellow Americans, and then pay  them? So we need to put an end to any risk of shutdown or threat of  shutdown, and, in fact, it is a bad-faith tactic even to raise it. The  second shutdown we need to avert is the shutdown of military  promotions, and that is what I want to address today.   The senior Senator from Alabama has held up political nominations of  more than 300 senior military officers for months. I have spoken about  this numerous times on the Senate floor, and yet it is getting more and  more severe every day. This is the behavior of one Senator who has  placed a hold on these nominations, but, frankly, it is behavior that  is being enabled by his colleagues on the Republican side of this body.   Military leaders who have done nothing other than volunteer to wear  the Nation's uniform and risk their lives in serving this country, who  have served honorably, have had their lives and careers derailed over a  disagreement on a policy matter that these officers had nothing to do  with.   A few weeks ago, Senator Reed and I took to the floor, and we read  the names and backgrounds of all who had been blocked. We read their  names, their rank, how long they served, where they have been deployed,  military awards, nominations, and medals they received: Silver Star,  Bronze Star, Purple Heart--all of whom are being blocked--it is  extremely disrespectful to all these nominees--simply because an  executive Agency has implemented a policy that one Senator does not  like. As I have explained previously on the floor, it is particularly  galling because we have repeatedly given this Senator an opportunity to  convince his colleagues that the DOD policy is wrong, and he has been  unsuccessful.   In the Armed Services Committee, where we serve together, he wanted a  vote on an amendment to change the DOD policy. He failed. I have failed  in making amendments in the Armed Services Committee before, and I  never take out my failure on people who are serving, wearing the  uniform of this country. If I am not persuasive enough to convince my  colleagues of a policy, I am not going to punish those who are serving  this country.    This is causing critical challenges in critical positions throughout  the DOD, and it is affecting Virginia, just as it is all States. Of  those who are being held, 39 of the positions are positions that affect  Virginians. They are unable to move their families and unable to put  their children in school. They can't start the jobs for which they have  been nominated based upon their track record. Of the 39 positions, 25  are in one region; Hampton Roads, VA, the center of sea power in this  country. These affect operations, modernization, and the future of the  largest naval base in the world. But it is not just Hampton Roads, it  is also McLean, Fort Belvoir, Falls Church, Fort Gregg-Adams, and  Winchester.   The irresponsible hold is not only affecting the lives of individuals  and affecting the strength of our military, it is getting attention  from around the world. It is getting attention from allies who depend  on us and want to know we are reliable, and it is also getting  attention from adversaries.   Let me just read a sampling--and this is a small sampling--of  headlines about how the actions of the U.S. Senate in blocking these  appointments are being interpreted around the world.   RT is Russia Today newspaper. An article that was somewhat lethal:  ``U.S. military hit by unprecedented leadership void''--this is a good  news story in RT. The action of the Senate is a good news story in  Russia Today.   Al Jazeera. This is not a publication of an adversary, but it is a  publication that is widely read throughout the Middle East, including  by folks and nations that are adversaries. ``Senator stalls US military  promotions in anti-abortion standoff.'' This is going throughout the  Middle East.   BBC News. The UK is probably our most reliable ally militarily and  also in the intelligence community. They are part of the Five Eyes. We  share intel. ``Senator Tuberville: No truce over military blockade on  abortion.''   The Presiding Officer knows President Biden announced 2 years ago a  pivotal new partnership called AUKUS--the United States, Australia, and  the UK. This is an alliance that has been important and will be more  important. Yet what is being read by the citizens and military leaders  in the United Kingdom? They are reading about this action of the United  States in blocking military promotions.   This is a publication--and I have to admit, I cannot pronounce this,  but I will translate it. It is Global Times. It is a publication in the  People's Republic of China that is subordinate to People's Daily. ``The  dispute over the right to abortion has been spreading like fire!''  Exclamation point. This is a good news story in China. ``More than 300  appointments were blocked by Republican lawmakers, and the three U.S.  military branches angrily denounced them.''   This is what our adversaries are saying about what is happening in  this Chamber--or, more accurately, what is not happening in this  Chamber.   The Sydney Morning Herald. Again, this AUKUS announcement about our  framework with the United States and UK will depend heavily upon not  only cooperation with the Australians, but the Australians have planned  to invest billions of dollars in the American submarine industrial base  so that we can train them and eventually build up a domestic submarine  production capacity in Australia.   ``US senator blocks hundreds of military promotions over reproductive  rights.'' As the Australian Parliament is making the decision about  whether to commit these resources to the United States in a historic  way, this is  [[Page S4433]]  what they are reading about the American military and the leadership of  this body with respect to the promotion of military members.   CBC. This is the Canadian broadcasting network, and this is, again,  one of our primary allies in the world whom we work with together on  everything. ``Embassies unstaffed, military gaps: America's toxic  politics spills into foreign affairs.'' One of our best allies, that is  what they are saying about us.   Finally, this last publication, this is a Taiwanese publication.  Taiwan is increasingly reliant upon the United States and other nations  to try to protect them from Chinese aggression. ``U.S. anti-abortion  senator boycotted general promotions, criticized for `assisting the  Communist Party.' ''   Whether it is our allies or our adversaries, they watch what we do,  and they watch what we don't do; and they are paying critical attention  to the blockade of these worthy men and women in the military.   Now, my Republican colleagues have sort of switched tactics. For a  while, they weren't sure whether they wanted to defend the blockade  that the Senator from Alabama is leading. They have realized it is  indefensible, so now they are trying to blame Senator Schumer for it,  that Senator Schumer should just take responsibility for addressing  this by putting votes on the floor.   Senator Schumer has nothing to do with these blocks. During his  entire time in the Senate, he has not put a blanket hold on military  promotions nor has any other Member of the Democratic caucus. The  suggestion that it is Senator Schumer's fault is laughable.   The Congressional Research Service has done the study and suggests  that the only way to overcome this massive blockade by the Republicans  would be to take up each of these appointments--hundreds of them. That  would take over 700 hours to complete what, throughout decades, has  been a matter of course in this body. Of course, if we did that, we  wouldn't get to the budget. We wouldn't get to other important  priorities. We wouldn't get to the FAA reauthorization. We wouldn't get  to the farm bill. We wouldn't get to confirm judges. So, as to the  notion that we will just bring them all up individually, the Republican  majority knows that that is not practical.   Some have suggested something that, frankly, is even more pernicious  and that I find insulting. Some of my Republican colleagues have said:  OK. Look, Senator Tuberville is holding up hundreds of people,  including service chiefs and the head of the Naval Academy in  Annapolis. Why don't we do this: Why doesn't Senator Schumer just bring  up the top brass? Then we will have votes on the top brass and allow  Senator Tuberville to keep punishing everybody else down the line.   That is not a good-faith offer, and it is directly contrary to the  spirit of the American military. I am not a veteran. I serve on the  Armed Services Committee, and I am from a very military State. My  oldest son is a U.S. marine. If you say to somebody in the military  ``just advantage the brass, and punish everybody underneath them''--I  would advise you not to say that to anybody in the military. That is  not the American military effort. I have heard my son say many times  that officers eat last. You take care of the enlisted. You take care of  the lower ranks before you take care of the higher-ups.   So the notion that this body or that even some of the military  nominees who have been advanced for the high positions would accept  this body's acting on them while continuing to punish everybody beneath  them is outrageous.   In fact, I will just remind my colleagues and my colleagues who are  here--the Presiding Officer and the Senator from Washington--that we  all were together once at a lunch a number of years ago with Senator  John McCain before he passed away. A decision was made that was sort of  rare, which was that we would have a closed-door lunch with all 100  Senators and Senator McCain would speak about the unspeakable: his time  as a POW in Hanoi during the Vietnam war.   His plane was shot down in Hanoi. He was beaten and tortured. He was  imprisoned as a prisoner of war for multiple years. There came a time  during his imprisonment when his captors realized that his father was  one of the key members of the Navy, one of the key members of the  brass. He was a VIP. Many people had been imprisoned as POWs in that  same Hanoi Hilton before Senator McCain, but the North Vietnamese  believed, if we let Senator McCain out, it will suggest that we are  beneficial; but it also may weaken the morale of those who remain here  because we will have let out somebody who is high up on the list, and  we will have continued to punish others.   They came to Captain McCain, and they said: We will let you out.   How tempting that must have been. I don't know any of us who could  kind of put themselves in that position. The Presiding Officer and I  were together a few years ago at the memorial for John McCain where he  was shot down in Hanoi. Put yourself in that position. You have been a  POW for years, and you are given an offer for your freedom. And he  turned it down. He turned it down and said: I am not accepting it  because there are people who were here before me; and only if you let  all of those hostages go will I then accept your offer of freedom. I am  not going to let you benefit me and continue punishing others who were  here before me.   That is what the ethos of the American military is. You don't benefit  the VIP or the big shot or the person with the high rank and punish  others.   So for us to countenance such a suggestion in this body that we would  have a debate and a vote on a few of the top brass and then would allow  the punishment of these poor people who are trying to move across the  country--whose kids need to be in school, whose spouses have jobs they  can't report to--not only should we not do this here, but I can't  imagine that the key military leadership who is waiting in line would  even want us to do that.   There is one solution for this, and the solution is for the  Republican minority in this body to go to Senator Tuberville and  convince him to stop this punishment of these individuals. These  officers had nothing to do with the policy that Senator Tuberville  doesn't like. If he doesn't like the policy--and I disagree with him on  that--he is within his rights to not like the policy, but when he has  had the repeated ability to try to persuade his colleagues that the  policy is wrong and he has been unsuccessful, he should not take out  his inability to persuade his colleagues on these patriotic public  servants.   I urge, in the most urgent way that I can, the quickest end to this  blockade. Let's get these people into the positions that they have  earned through their lives of service and enable them to continue to  serve this country.   I yield the floor.
