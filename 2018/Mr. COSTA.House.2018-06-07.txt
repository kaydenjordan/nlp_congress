 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the  administration's approach to trade and the pain that we are already  feeling due to the shortsighted and poorly-considered decisions that  have been made.   Since the administration announced its plans in March to use wide- ranging tariffs to address trade imbalances, I have been warning the  President and the Nation that this is a wrongheaded approach. So many  of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, I believe, agree.   We all want to see American jobs secure and increase opportunities  for our economy; that is without doubt. But raising broadly-defined  tariffs will do, I believe, just the opposite. We all know, or at least  most of us know, that the most likely effect of raising tariffs will be  other countries adjusting their trade measures to protect their  economies and their industries and their workers.   Let's realize that, in the global economy that we live in today, most  countries have leverage. I hope the President realizes this. And what  happens as a result? We have a trade war. That is where we are going,  and I have been saying since March, no one, Mr. Speaker, no one wins in  a trade war; which is why both Republicans and Democrats have publicly  expressed grave concerns with the administration's tariff-based  approach to trade.   But beyond the warnings and concerns, Mr. Speaker, we are now feeling  the negative impacts of the administration's approach. Without a doubt,  our country is beginning to engage in these stages of a trade war.   Tariffs, for example, on California agriculture products are already  in place. Forty-four percent of California's agriculture economy, which  is the number 1 agricultural State in the Nation, 44 percent of it is  based upon international trade. Almonds, wine, pistachios, citrus, all  face increased tariffs on exports to China, and that is just the start.  It is also taking place in Mexico and Canada.   I met with a California almond processor yesterday who told me that,  as a result of these tariffs, the Chinese buyers are staying away from  the table. He told me that this time of the year he usually has sold a  significant portion of his harvest to Chinese buyers, but because of  the uncertainty of these tariffs he hasn't sold a single pound.    Mr. Speaker, the retaliatory tariffs imposed in reaction to this  administration's steel and aluminum tariffs are already impacting the  California agriculture economy, which, again, 44 percent of it is based  upon international trade, and it is hurting our relationships with many  of our allies in Europe, as well as our neighbors to the north and to  the south.   Yes, there are trade imbalances in the global market we live in, and  we should address them. There is bipartisan agreement we should address  them. But the way to address these trade imbalances is through  successful re-negotiation of NAFTA, negotiating trade agreements with  our European and Pacific Rim allies. That is the way to deal with the  trade imbalances.   We cannot address trade imbalances or arrive at mutually beneficial  agreements through trade wars, plain and simple. What's more, the  President and the Congress must work together on trade agreements.   Based upon where we are today, it looks like it will require us in  Congress to re-assert our constitutional authority and responsibility  to regulate international trade agreements. That is part of our job.  This will take hard work, bipartisan negotiations, and serious policy  deliberations which, in turn, requires that we overcome our partisan  division and come together as America's Congress.   I call on my colleagues today to join me in real negotiations, in  real bipartisan work, and in the type of policy deliberations that our  Nation needs and that America deserves. We can do this and we must do  this.   Our country currently is being led by this administration into a very  real trade war, but it is not too late to stop it, and it is Congress'  responsibility, frankly, to say, time out. Let's sit down and work  together with our allies in Europe, our neighbors to the north and to  the south of us, and in the Pacific Rim, to do what is right, and that  is to ensure that we protect American workers, American industries,  American agriculture, and, yes, that we don't engage in a trade war  that will lead to no good end.   We can fix this trade imbalance, and we should, and we must assert  ourselves.                            ____________________
