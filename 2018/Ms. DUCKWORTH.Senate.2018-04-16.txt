 Madam President, I was necessarily absent for  vote No. 74 on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to concur in  the House amendment to S. 140. On vote No. 74, had I been present, I  would have voted nay on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to  concur in the House amendment to S. 140.                            ____________________
