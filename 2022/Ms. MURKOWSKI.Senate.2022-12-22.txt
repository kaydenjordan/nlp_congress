 Mr. President, this measure is good for babies, it is  good for new mothers, and it is good for employers to get these women  back into the workforce. I would encourage an ``aye'' vote.                          Vote on Amendment No.6595     Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the  life and career of John P. Connelly, longtime National Fisheries  Institute president and CEO. John succumbed to cancer on November 20,  but not before leaving a profound mark on the commercial seafood  industry that is so dear to us in Alaska.   Following service in the U.S. Navy--including Active-Duty service as  an officer in the Navy's destroyer fleet--John joined the American  Chemistry Council, where he rose to become ACC's corporate secretary.  In 2003, he was named president and CEO of the National Fisheries  Institute. In nearly two decades of leadership at NFI, he joined with  many of us in the Senate in tackling the priority issues confronting  American seafood producers and the fisheries they rely on--from vital  legislation such as the 2007 Magnuson-Stevens reauthorization  legislation and the 2011 Food Safety Modernization Act, to ensuring  that Federal nutrition guidance reflects the science regarding the  value of seafood consumption and utilizing trade agreements to open key  markets to seafood exporters from Alaska and elsewhere. On his watch,  commercial seafood producers made sustainability the core of their  operations. On issue after issue, he brought disparate players together  in what often can be a fractious industry, driving concrete progress  where others' efforts had stalled.   While at NFI, John Connelly held leadership roles with the NOAA  Marine Fisheries Advisory Committee; the International Seafood  Sustainability Foundation; the International Coalition of Fisheries  Associations; the ``FISH'' for Crewmembers social responsibility  standard; the Seafood Industry Research Fund; and many others. In  October 2022, the Global Seafood Alliance awarded him the Wallace R.  Stevens Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of his ``leadership,  integrity, and commitment to responsibility.''   As is so often the case, however, it was not the plaques on the wall  that made John Connelly effective. He was known to many in the seafood  world, including to my staff and me, as a warm, engaging person who  always wanted to learn about the people he met before delving into  business. John loved sharing and swapping stories--the funnier the  better--and as any Alaskan will tell you, fishing and storytelling go  hand in hand. What a wonderful match between a leader and the industry  he chose to serve.   To paraphrase Lincoln, I know nothing I say on the floor today can  beguile  [[Page S10090]]  John's wife of 36 years, Margaret, or their four children, from the  grief they are more than entitled to feel at the untimely loss of a  dear husband and father. I do hope, nevertheless, that this brief  tribute will leave the Connelly family--and all those who benefited  from his service to the seafood industry--with the solace of knowing  how valuable that service was to our Nation. John Connelly will be  missed by many in my State and by so many in the industry he  loved.                            ____________________
