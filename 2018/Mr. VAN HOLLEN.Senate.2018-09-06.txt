 Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to my  constituent and dear friend, Sheldon S. Cohen, who passed away earlier  this week. Sheldon Cohen left an extraordinary legacy of accomplishment  and service to our country.   A proud native Washingtonian and graduate of DC public schools,  Sheldon was a World War II Navy veteran. One of the world's leading tax  attorneys, he served as chief counsel and then Commissioner of the IRS  under President Lyndon B. Johnson, becoming the youngest person to hold  that position. Among his countless other accomplishments was his  creation of the first Presidential blind trust. Significantly, the 1978  Ethics in Government Act made blind trusts the preferred vehicle for  public officials who do not want to dispose of holdings that raise  potential conflicts. In addition, he was instrumental in helping to  computerize the IRS and in drafting an overhaul of the Federal income  Tax Code. Following his government service, he had an extensive career  in private practice, including founding the law firm of Cohen & Uretz.  He served as general counsel to the Democratic National Committee and  helped settle a civil case stemming from the break-in of DNC offices at  the Watergate office complex by Nixon campaign operatives.   Sheldon Cohen's work was influential internationally as well. He  advised many countries on their tax systems, was a founder of the  Inter-American Center of Tax Administrations, and was a senior fellow  of the National Academy of Public Administration. He participated on UN  Special Missions to advise developing countries on tax systems,  including meeting with Nelson Mandela. He vetted the tax returns of  numerous Democratic Presidential and  [[Page S6054]]  Vice Presidential candidates, set up the Presidential Commission on  Debates as a nonprofit organization, was a frequent author and speaker  on tax policy and ethics, and often testified on Capitol Hill. He  taught at his alma mater, George Washington University Law School, from  which he had graduated first in his class, and at Howard and Miami law  schools.   Sheldon Cohen was deeply involved in the community and held numerous  leadership roles. These included serving as president of the Jewish  Social Service Agency, president of the Order of the Leaf of Camp Airy,  chair of the American Jewish Historical Society, trustee and chair of  the GW board of trustees, founder and trustee of the United Jewish  Endowment Fund, founding member and treasurer of the Supreme Court  Historical Society, and trustee of the Jewish Theological Seminary and  Adas Israel Congregation.   Sheldon Cohen was a decent, compassionate man, known for his high  standards of integrity, his brilliant mind, his concern for those in  need, and his devotion to his family and friends. I knew Sheldon Cohen  well and will miss his friendship and wise counsel, as I do that of his  wonderful and beloved wife Faye, who left us earlier this year. Their  partnership and warm hospitality were known throughout our community  and will always be remembered by the many friends and activists with  whom they teamed up in support of important civic causes.   I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to this fine man and  in sending condolences to his family, including his children Melinda  and her husband Alberto Goetzl, Laura and her husband Perry Apelbaum,  Jonathan and his wife Joanne, and Sharon and her husband Michael  Liebman; his 10 grandchildren; his brother Gerald Cohen and his wife  Joanne; and his sister Barbara and her husband Dick Wolf.                            ____________________
