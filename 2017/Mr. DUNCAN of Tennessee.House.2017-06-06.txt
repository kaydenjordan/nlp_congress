 Mr. Speaker, many years ago I received an  undergraduate degree in journalism, was a reporter on a daily  newspaper, and taught journalism for 1 year. In those years, there was  a clear separation between the front page and the editorial page.   I don't believe I have ever read a more biased, partisan, opinionated  [[Page H4628]]  paragraph in a ``news'' story than one that was on the front page of  yesterday's Washington Post. Philip Rucker does not now deserve the  title of journalist but, instead, should be referred to as a Democratic  or leftwing hack.   He wrote that a traditional President would have reacted carefully  ``to the London attacks by instilling calm, being judicious . . . and  appealing to the country's better angels.'' Instead, he accused  President Trump of reacting ``impulsively . . . stroking panic and  fear, being indiscrete with details . . . and capitalizing on it to  advocate for one of his more polarizing policies and to advance a  personal feud.''   Apparently, Mr. Rucker is so blinded by hatred for the President he  cannot see straight and has written one of the most unfair, one-sided  articles I have ever read in a ``news'' story in what used to be a  newspaper.                            ____________________
