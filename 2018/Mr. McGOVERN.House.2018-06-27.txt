 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a proud servant of  the people and Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Major General George W.  Keefe, who passed away last Thursday, June 21.   He will be laid to rest tomorrow, June 28, in Northampton,  Massachusetts, surrounded by his family, friends, fellow officers, and  the men and women who served with him throughout his 49-year career in  military service.   Major General George W. Keefe was born in 1939 in Northampton. He  attended public schools in Northampton and graduated from Northampton  High School in 1956. He received his associate's degree from Holyoke  Community College in 1966.   He enlisted in the Massachusetts Air National Guard's 104th Tactical  Fighter Group in 1956 as a crash fire rescue specialist, attaining the  rank of master sergeant before he was selected for a commission as an  officer and first lieutenant.   He served as a squadron group and vice wing commander at the 104th  Tactical Fighter Group before being selected to serve at the  Massachusetts National Guard Joint Force Headquarters. He was the last  member to serve in uniform of the Massachusetts Air National Guard that  was federally activated and deployed from October 1961 to September  1962 in Phalsbourg, France, for Operation Stair Step, the U.S.  military's response to the Berlin crisis.   George was also enshrined in the U.S. Air Force's Enlisted Heritage  Hall at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama as one of the few general  officers who rose from the rank of airman basic to major general.   He was selected and appointed as the 39th adjutant general of  Massachusetts in 1999 by Governor Paul Cellucci. With this appointment,  he became the first U.S. Air Force officer to serve as a Massachusetts  adjutant general since 1778. That is a long time, even by Massachusetts  reckoning.   He continued to serve under Lieutenant Governor and then acting  Governor Jane Swift, and Governor Mitt Romney reappointed George to a  second term as adjutant general, a position he held until retiring in  2005 after 49 years of military service.   Among one of the bigger moments in his job as adjutant general was  September 11, 2001, when he had to activate the Massachusetts National  Guard to respond to the terror attacks on New York City that involved  two jetliners that had flown out of Logan International Airport in  Boston.   I first met Major General Keefe at the start of my second term in  office. I had just won my first reelection campaign and he had just  been appointed adjutant general of Massachusetts National Guard. I  respected the experience and long view that he brought to his position,  and he was very helpful to me then and over the next 6 years in  understanding the priorities of the Massachusetts National Guard and  introducing me to the soldiers, airmen, and uniformed men and women who  serve in the Massachusetts Guard and Reserve as well as their families.   I appreciated his Irish sense of humor, and I admired and respected  his dedication and service to our country, the Commonwealth, and, most  importantly, to the many servicemembers of the Massachusetts National  Guard.   Like so many in Massachusetts, his little piece of heaven was his  house on Cape Cod where he watched his sons and his grandchildren enjoy  the beach, the waves, fried seafood, and the countless whiffle ball and  miniature golf matches.   The eldest of his four sons, Gary W. Keefe, currently serves as  adjutant general of the Massachusetts Air National Guard.   Few lives are as filled with service, love of friends and family, and  so firmly rooted in Massachusetts as that of former Major General  George W. Keefe. He made a big difference in the lives of so many  people and in the life and history of our Nation.   Major General George W. Keefe was not only a great man but, more  importantly, a very, very good man. He will be missed, and we salute  him as we say farewell and Godspeed.                            ____________________
