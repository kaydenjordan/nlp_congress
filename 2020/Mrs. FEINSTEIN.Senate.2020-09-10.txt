 Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a bill  to facilitate better access to the Desert Sage Youth Wellness Center.   The Desert Sage Youth Wellness Center, located in Hemet, CA, is a  health center run by the Indian Health Service. It is the only  currently operating center in the State of California that provides  culturally-sensitive substance use disorder treatment to indigenous  youth.   The Desert Sage Youth Wellness Center serves an important role to the  regional Native American community. The facility not only provides  healthcare but also academic support, family therapy, and an  individualized treatment plan to support the healing and long-term  recovery of youth enrolled at the center.   Despite the center's important work, the Desert Sage Youth Wellness  Center is only accessible by a dirt road. Lack of a paved road limits  access to the center during California's extreme wet and dry seasons.  The dirt road frequently cracks or floods during these times and  creates significant challenges to those receiving healthcare.   Private landowners are supportive of selling their land to allow the  Indian Health Service to pave an access road, but the agency does not  currently have the authority to do so. It is appropriate we provide for  safe and dignified access to the center, and I am pleased to introduce  legislation that will solve this problem.   The bill would authorize the Director of the Indian Health Service to  purchase land from willing sellers and construct a paved road to  improve access to the Desert Sage Youth Wellness Center. After  construction, Riverside County would own and maintain the road.   This effort includes widespread, bipartisan support. An identical,  bipartisan bill introduced by Representative Raul Ruiz passed the House  of Representatives as part of a larger package just last month.  Representative Ruiz's bill is cosponsored by Representatives Ken  Calvert, Pete Aguilar, Paul Cook, Doug LaMalfa, Nannette Diaz Barragan,  Tony Cardenas, and Josh Harder. This legislation also has the support  of local stakeholders, including Riverside County, and organizations  like the California Rural Indian Health Board.   The bill will provide safe access to the Desert Sage Youth Wellness  Center, ensuring indigenous youth can receive healthcare in a  supportive and culturally-sensitive environment. American Indian and  Alaskan Native youth report 14.9 percent rate of substance dependence  or abuse, furthering underscoring the need to guarantee the  accessibility to facilities like the Desert Sage Wellness Center.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this  legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a bill  to facilitate better access to the Desert Sage Youth Wellness Center.
