 Madam Speaker, first of all, let me thank  Chairman Engel for yielding and also for his leadership.   Also, I want to just mention Congressmen Khanna, Pocan, and McGovern.  I want to also thank them in addition to Chairman Engel for bringing  this critical measure to the floor.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S.J. Res. 7, which, of  course, is a joint resolution directing the removal of U.S. Armed  Forces from hostilities in Yemen.   This critical resolution, which we are taking now for the second time  this Congress, would end America's unconstitutional participation in  the war in Yemen.   Since 2015, the United States has participated in the Saudi-led  military campaign in Yemen without authorization from Congress. We have  helped create and worsen the world's greatest and largest humanitarian  crisis.   Madam Speaker, 22.2 million Yemenis--that is 75 percent of the  population--needs humanitarian assistance.                                time  1000    At least 85,000 children under the age of 5--85,000--have died from  war-related hunger and disease.   Our involvement in this war is shameful. That is why this bipartisan  and bicameral measure to end the United States' unconstitutional role  in this war is so important.   Yes, Madam Speaker, I voted against that 2001 resolution, because I  knew it was open-ended and would set the stage for endless wars. It was  a blank check. We see this once again today in Yemen. We must repeal  this 2001 blank check for endless wars.   Over the past 18 years, we have seen the executive branch use this  AUMF time and time again. It is a blank check to wage war without  congressional oversight.   It is past time for Congress to reassert our Constitutional duty to  debate on matters of war and peace, and it is past time to end this  illegal, horrific war in Yemen.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and to support  this bipartisan bill to end the United States' role in Yemen.
