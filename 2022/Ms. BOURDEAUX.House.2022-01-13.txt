 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Korean- American Day, which marks the arrival of the first group of Korean  immigrants to the United States in 1903.   I am proud to represent tens of thousands of Korean Americans in  Georgia's Seventh District. These individuals are critical members of  our community. From small business owners to healthcare workers, they  continue to support us throughout the pandemic.   I would like to take this time to acknowledge Korean-American leaders  in my district. Representative Sam Park is the grandson of refugees  from the Korean war who became the first Asian American and openly gay  person elected to the Georgia State House of Representatives.   Michelle Kang serves as president of the Korean-American Public  Action Committee and is a tireless leader in the community. It is an  honor to work with each of you.   Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been challenged  with an increase in the number of anti-Asian hate crimes. This Korean- American Day, I am particularly grateful to all of those working to  address and end anti-Asian hate in Georgia and across the country. I  look forward to continuing this work in Congress.                            ____________________
