 Madam President, the military junta that seized power  from Burma's democratically elected leaders back in February has kept  up its campaign of brutal and violent repression. More than 800 people  are now dead, and more than 5,000 others have been detained on various  charges of resistance.   Just today, the longtime leader of Burma's democracy, my good friend  Aung San Suu Kyi, stood for the beginning of a show trial. Other  members of the National League for Democracy are awaiting their own  appearances before the sham court, and many more protesters,  journalists, and activists are filling Burma's prisons right up to the  rim.   Several foreigners have been among those detained, including  Australian economist Sean Turnell and two American journalists, Nathan  Maung and Danny Fenster. The State Department has reported that both  U.S. citizens were denied consular access. Mr. Maung reportedly even  endured torture during his detention.   The people of Burma are well acquainted with the brutality of the  Tatmadaw's military rule, but the wider international community is  receiving a sobering reminder of the challenges facing the country's  pro-democracy movement and of the junta's willingness to flout even the  most basic international norms and treaty obligations.   I appreciate the continued attention the Biden administration is  giving to the crisis. Over the weekend, I was particularly encouraged  by the G-7 leaders' joint condemnation of the junta and by the  reiteration of a shared commitment to shutting off the flow of any  assistance funds that might help the military further their repression.   Of course, for friends of democracy, including the United States,  there is more to be done to translate words into action. It is time to  expand the sanctions aimed at the military to include the infamous  cronies who continue to make common cause with the Tatmadaw.   It is time for Burma's neighbors and key trading partners to join  these sanctions efforts and commit to providing increased humanitarian  access and assistance, particularly, I would say, from Thailand.   It is time for greater international scrutiny of the markets for jade  and rare earth metals that give the military and other bad actors  targets for exploitation.   It is time for international bodies like the U.N. Security Council to  put Burma on the agenda and force the Tatmadaw's supporters to defend  the brutal regime out in the light of day.   So our work isn't over, but there is reason for optimism. Burma's  ethnic minorities, diverse and often divided, have united behind the  representative National Unity Government in peaceful opposition to the  military rule, and the NUG continues to broaden and deepen this  coalition.   Earlier this month, the National Unity Government announced its  policy on the status of the Rohingya Muslims in the western state of  Rakhine, pledging accountability for those responsible for years-- years--of violent persecution and committing to greater inclusion for  all of Burma's ethnic minorities.   So, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the National Unity  Government's important statement on this matter be printed in the  Record at this point   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:    Republic of the Union of Myanmar National Unity Government--Policy                 Position on the Rohingya in Rakhine State                                 3 JUNE 2021         In honour of human rights and human dignity and also to       eradicate the conflicts and root causes in the Union, the       National Unity Government aims to build a prosperous and       federal democratic union where all ethnic groups belonging to       the Union can live together peacefully. This objective is       clearly stated in the Federal Democratic Charter.        Sovereignty belongs to the member states and the people of       the member states as proclaimed in the guiding principles for       the establishment of a federal democratic union.        Everyone in the Union has full enjoyment of fundamental       human rights. All ethnic groups who are native to the Union       have full enjoyment of individual rights held by individual       people and collective rights held by ethnic groups. All       citizens who swear allegiance to the Union regardless of       their ethnic origins are considered to have full enjoyment of       citizens' rights. The National Unity Government will not       tolerate any form of discrimination.        The National Unity Government regards the above-mentioned       policies as a basis in addressing the matters related to the       Rohingyas in Rakhine State. We are confident that extensive       deliberations, which consider the positions of all       stakeholders in Rakhine State, their historical backgrounds,       and national and international laws, will enable all to find       shared solutions in a way that respects the human rights of       all persons.        At present, the elimination of the military dictatorship       has become the common goal of the entire people because of       the violence committed by the illegitimate military council.       It is also the period of national resistance against the       military dictatorship. The solidarity of the entire people is       now at its best. We are confident that we can rebuild a Union       that meets the needs of all those in the country who have a       stake in its future.        After consultations with the many different stakeholders in       Rakhine States, including Rohingya groups and refugee       representatives from the IDP camps, the NUG here makes clear       how it will seek to apply these principles for the good of       all in the Rakhine State.        The National Unity Government well understands the violence       and gross human rights violations inflicted upon Rohingyas by       the thuggish military and the massive displacement, with       hundreds of thousands fleeing their homes during the       conflicts in Rakhine State over the last decades: We are       deeply saddened by this. The entire people of Burma is       sympathetic to the plight of the Rohingya as all now       experience atrocities and violence perpetrated by the       military.        Endeavouring to bring the perpetrators to account is not       only for the realization of justice but also acts as a       deterrent against future atrocities. Therefore, we regard       this as a priority task. Reparation and Justice will  [[Page S4506]]       be ensured in the future Federal Democratic Union       Constitution.        We will actively seek justice and accountability for all       crimes committed by the military against the Rohingyas and       all other people of Myanmar throughout our history. We intend       if necessary to initiate processes to grant International       Criminal Court jurisdiction over crimes committed within       Myanmar against the Rohingyas and other communities.        We consider that the 88 recommendations set out in the       final report of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State       chaired by Dr. Kofi Annan must play a crucial role in       addressing the affairs in Rakhine State. These       recommendations are based on solutions for the root causes of       violence. However, over the past four years, much has changed       to make the situation worse in Rakhine State for all ethnic       groups there. Using these recommendations as well as other       relevant recommendations as inputs, we earnestly believe that       we can work together with all the people in Rakhine State to       chart a new course towards a democratic inclusive and       prosperous future.        We would also like to highlight the importance of legal       matters in seeing to the Rakhine question. We will consider       the opinions and views of the entire people in the country,       including those in Rakhine State, in drafting a new       constitution that can resolve the many problems caused by the       2008 constitution. The views and insights of all can       contribute to this process. All the people in the country,       including all stakeholders in Rakhine State, are invited to       participate in the process of drafting the new constitution.       Such dialogue is essential to creating a shared future for       the country.        The process of repealing, amending, and promulgating laws,       including the 1982 Citizenship Law, by the new constitution       when the drafting is completed will be beneficial in       resolving the conflict in Rakhine State. This new Citizenship       Act must base citizenship on birth in Myanmar or birth       anywhere as a child of Myanmar Citizens.        We further commit to abolishing the process of issuing       National Verification Cards, a process that the military has       used against Rohingyas and other ethnic groups coercively and       with human rights violations. The Rohingyas are entitled to       citizenship by laws that will accord with fundamental human       rights norms and democratic federal principles.        The voluntary, safe, and dignified repatriation of       Rohingyas who fled to neighbouring countries from Rakhine       State due to Tatmadaw violence is a crucial matter. We       reaffirm the agreements signed with neighbouring countries       for the repatriation process. We are ready to cooperate with       all stakeholders of good will in a special programme to       implement the process. We are committed to the repatriation       of Rohingyas as soon as repatriation can be accomplished       voluntarily, safely, and with dignity.        The National Unity Government is a government whose primary       duty is to fight the illegal military dictatorship. While we       focus on this task, we are also planning for the future. We       believe it will be beneficial in building the future       democratic federal union to listen to all stakeholders in a       spirit of collaboration.        Therefore, we invite Rohingyas to join hands with us and       with others to participate in this Spring Revolution against       the military dictatorship in all possible ways.    This statement represents months of work to build a  cohesive, inclusive, and representative government and the best path  toward national reconciliation and justice for victims of the  Tatmadaw's violence. So the NUG's efforts deserve the full support of  the world's oldest democracy. The pro-democracy movement must know that  the United States continues to stand with them and that we are ready to  support the hard work of national reconciliation that still lies ahead.                            ____________________     Now, Madam President, on one final matter, late last  week, the Democratic leader and the Democratic whip gave in to the urge  to pick at the scab of politically motivated investigations that have  become their party's favorite weapon against the previous  administration. They indicated that they were prepared to compel two  former Attorneys General to testify before the Judiciary Committee on  efforts to trace leaks of sensitive national security information.   In case anyone had forgotten, our colleagues are among the same  Democrats who spent years demanding repeated investigations of a  Republican President while turning a blind eye to the clear abuses of  power that infected the investigation of his campaign. So any outrage  from Democrats that alleged criminal leaks within their own ranks  rightly drew the attention of Federal investigators rings completely  hollow.   It is particularly disappointing that our colleagues have taken to  attacking former Attorney General Bill Barr over investigative  decisions that predated--predated--his time at the Department of  Justice. Let me say that again. It is particularly disappointing that  our colleagues have taken to attacking former Attorney General Bill  Barr over investigative decisions that occurred when he wasn't there  yet. Attorney General Barr served our Nation with honor and with  integrity. These latest attempts to tarnish his name bear the telltale  signs of a witch hunt in the making.   Here are the facts: The Department of Justice is empowered to  investigate criminal conduct by Members of Congress and their staff.  Necessarily, this sort of investigation is subject to strict procedural  protections, and the Department's inspector general is fully equipped  to determine whether these procedures were followed in this case. So I  am confident that the existing inquiry will uncover the truth. There is  no need for a partisan circus here in the Congress.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
