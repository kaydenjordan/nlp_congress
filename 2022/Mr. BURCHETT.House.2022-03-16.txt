 Madam Speaker, I greatly appreciate Chairman Johnson  for heading this up day after day.   I just wonder, have the Democrats been to the gas pumps lately? I  used to love to go to the gas pumps and talk to folks to see what was  going on. Now, honestly, I am afraid to even make eye contact with  somebody because they are going to light you up, Madam Speaker.   I know we see a lot of these little, cute stickers. That is not my  thing. I don't want to cause any vandalism with our President pointing  at the pump saying, ``I did that,'' but the truth is, he did do this.   If they would listen to what is going on, they would know that  America is ticked, and they should be. The national gas average today  is $4.30 a gallon. The average a year ago was $2.87.   In 2020, gasoline or oil was around $17 a barrel, and today, I  believe it has dropped to $95. I heard someone from the White House  earlier bragging about how oil has dropped. I mean, that is the  Washington way, to not talk about how it was at $17 a couple of years  ago, but talk about how it has dropped from over $110 down to $95.   Madam Speaker, we need to turn the spigots back on. We need to get  back into the oil business. The oil and gas companies, we have been  told that they have the permits, and then they boast about that, that  they are not drilling because of it.                                time  1745    The truth is, Madam Speaker, not enough pipelines have been permitted  to move the product. If they get it, there is nowhere for it to go.  There is no storage capacity. There is no way to move the product. The  pipelines have to be completed, and that is part of the master plan  here.   As has been stated by Members on this floor and other times, I have  heard, $7 a gallon and electric vehicles are in. That is no way to  drive innovation, Madam Speaker. Innovation is  [[Page H3766]]  driven through creativity, through capitalism, not by crooked  politicians and evil folks trying to change the American agenda.   Electric cars are not affordable yet. Over $50,000 a car. That is  ridiculous. You have got over eight adapters on the plugs. It takes  several hours to charge. I don't know if you have ever driven across  country or not with a family but stopping 8 hours at a truck stop is  not my idea of a vacation.   Renewables aren't reliable sources for our power grids. Democrats  seem to double down, though, on these crazy woke environmental agenda  issues. It just creates higher energy bills for Americans, Madam  Speaker, and increases costs for business. That is why everything is  up.   If you look at the price of fuel, I filled up my daughter's Dodge  diesel the other day, and it cost me over $100. Why are we doing this  to ourselves? We can turn the spigots back on. We can put Americans  back to work. We can increase our economy. We can show the world that  we are leaders.   As the Ukrainian President stated so eloquently this morning, our  President needs to lead the world. It is a shame when a country that  small has to call on a power as great as America and tell its leaders  to lead once again. Until things change, though, Madam Speaker, Biden's  economy is a bust.   I appreciate Chairman Johnson and his truculent behavior. He has  raised this from more than lackluster, and I want to praise him for  that.
