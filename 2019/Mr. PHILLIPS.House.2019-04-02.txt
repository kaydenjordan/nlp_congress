 Madam Speaker, while traveling recently through my home  State of Minnesota, I met a wonderful couple in their early 60s. They  were both teachers who had dedicated their professional lives to  enriching our community by educating our children.   They had done everything right, saved as much money as they could,  and it was time to retire, until the husband was diagnosed with early- onset Alzheimer's. Now, the out-of-pocket costs for his care will wipe  out all of their retirement savings--all of their savings.   Madam Speaker, I ask: What is our President thinking?   This is an all-too-common story played out in blue and red districts  throughout our Nation. Yet, we have a White House determined to wipe  out the Affordable Care Act. It is callous; it is wrong; and it is  unacceptable. It is time for us to make the moral decision to ensure  that all Americans have access to affordable, high-quality healthcare,  no matter their circumstances.   That is why we just introduced a bill in the House, led by my  Minnesota colleague, Angie Craig, to reduce premiums and lower  healthcare costs. That is why I am a cosponsor of Congressman Doggett's  bill to make prescription drugs more affordable.   There is hard work to be done to make our health system work for all  Americans, and we are doing it in the House.   I say to President Trump and my Republican colleagues that it is not  too late to abandon this misguided effort to dismantle the ACA and join  us to work on real solutions. That is what we are sent here to do.                            ____________________
