 Mr. Speaker, during the votes held on  April 13th, 2018, I was away handling important matters related to my  District and attending my 15th Annual Jobs Fair held in Atlanta. If I  had been present I would have voted ``yes'' on H.R. 4790--the Volcker  Rule Regulatory Harmonization Act.                             personal explanation
