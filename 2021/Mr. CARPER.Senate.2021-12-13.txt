 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  permitted to speak for up to 15 minutes, Senator Tuberville for up to  10 minutes, and Senator Padilla for up to 10 minutes prior to the  scheduled vote.    Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon to  talk about my friend Bob Dole, who was laid to rest last week. Before I  do that, I want to just take a moment to express our heartfelt thoughts  and sorrow at the loss of so many lives in more than a half dozen  States, including Kentucky, where my sister and her family live;  including Arkansas, where other friends live.   We just want the folks to know who are going through a really tough  time and tough patch, that when we talk a lot about you are in our  thoughts and our prayers, that you literally are, and it is not just  words that we are saying. We hope and promise we will be there to help  you going forward as you deal with all of this.
