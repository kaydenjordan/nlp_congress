 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  my bipartisan amendment to the Veterans' Access to Child Care Act,  which I sponsored with my colleagues from New York, Antonio Delgado and  Elise Stefanik.   Our amendment guarantees that if our veterans suffer a mental health  crisis, such as one caused by PTSD or depression, childcare for their  kids is covered during the crisis.   Let me tell you why this is so important to me and the veterans in  our community.   A few weeks ago, I visited the Stanislaus County Veterans Service  Office and I spoke to multiple veterans suffering with mental health  problems. A veteran in my district told me PTSD was his invisible  injury.   Roughly 20 percent of our veterans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan  suffer from depression, PTSD, or traumatic brain injury. That is triple  the national average, and it affects our communities in numerous ways.  For example, in my district we struggle with veteran homelessness.   So, today, we are doing something about it. This bipartisan amendment  helps ease the pain of mental health emergencies for our veterans and  makes sure their kids are taken care of.   By passing this amendment, we can show our veterans, whether they are  from Stanislaus County, Essex County, or Ulster County, that we can  actually work together in a bipartisan manner to give them the respect  and honor they have earned.                            ____________________
