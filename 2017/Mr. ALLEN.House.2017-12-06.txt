 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding time to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 38,  the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act.   Since I was elected to Congress in 2014, I have been devoted to  preserving the constitutional rights of Americans, including the  inalienable right to bear arms.   Despite our Second Amendment protections, many States have laws  restricting the ability of citizens to carry concealed weapons,  principally out-of-State residents. This is particularly confusing and  burdensome for law-abiding citizens who choose to conceal carry and  live near a State line.   For example, the district I represent borders South Carolina along  the Savannah River. For many of my constituents, the closest grocery  store, bank, and even their work may be in South Carolina. Thankfully  for my constituents, Georgia and South Carolina already have firearm  permit reciprocity.   But this is not the case everywhere. As the law currently stands,  Americans in other States are losing their right to bear arms on a  daily basis simply because they live near a State line. Just as your  First Amendment right to free speech does not change from one State to  another, neither should your right to protect yourself and your family.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will see this and will join me in  voting for this commonsense legislation to solve this problem.
