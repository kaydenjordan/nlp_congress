 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. I want to, first  of all, thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for all the hard  work that has gone into this legislation so far. I want to especially  thank our chairman, Ed Royce, who has been my partner on this committee  for nearly 5 years. We have passed excellent legislation. The  legislation today just adds to it, and it shows what you can do when  you work in a bipartisan way, so I want to thank the chairman for all  his hard work and all his courtesies.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill. I certainly plan to vote for it,  but it seems we may be on the floor before we have ironed out all the  differences with the other body. I hope that is not the case.   In particular, there have been issues with the North Korea sanctions.  It was another Royce-Engel bill, which already passed in the House and,  frankly, should have been taken up by the other body on a separate  track; instead, it is now put into this bill. I hope we don't face  further delays when this bill gets back to the other House.    Our job isn't done, obviously, until we get this thing across the  finish line; and we need to do that because this bill is critical to  our national security.   It does far more than just send a message to leaders in Russia, Iran,  and North Korea. It exacts a heavy price for their aggressive and  destabilizing behavior.   Just like the bill we already passed, this legislation would update  and expand our sanctions on North Korea, closing loopholes that have  allowed money to flow to the Kim regime, funding its illegal weapons  program. It would crack down on the trading partners, banks, and  shipping vessels that enable the regime, and go after the regime's most  lucrative enterprises, whether exported goods or the pilfered wages of  North Korean laborers sent abroad to work.   With respect to Iran, this bill would go after so many of the things  Iran's leaders do to drive violence and instability, from Tehran's  ballistic missile program and its support for terrorism to the regime's  abhorrent human rights record and efforts to build up its military. I  have said this again and again, that we need to hold the regime's feet  to the fire on all these issues. This bill does exactly that.   Finally, on Russia, this bill is a strong, direct response to  Vladimir Putin's efforts to undermine American democracy. It imposes  new sanctions on those who want to do business with Putin's cronies or  with Russia's military or intelligence. It strengthens existing  sanctions for Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and armed  intervention in eastern Ukraine. It pushes back against Russia's  cybercrimes, including the hacking of our election to help Donald  Trump--a story which Congress and the special counsel are still trying  to get to the bottom of--as well as Putin's support for the murderous  Assad regime in Syria. And it gives Congress a strong oversight role in  making sure that these Russian sanctions are not lifted prematurely.   This administration has shown over and over that they are willing to  cozy up to Putin, but here is the truth: Russia is not our ally. Putin  wants to harm the United States, splinter our alliances, and undermine  Western democracy. This Congress will not allow him to succeed, so I am  glad to support this bipartisan bill.   I thank the chairman once again. We need to keep working to make sure  this bill gets to the President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Cicilline), my colleague on the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Cicilline), my colleague on the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Castro), our colleague on the Foreign Affairs Committee and a  member of the Intelligence Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who was instrumental in putting this bill  forward, who has been with us every step of the way and so invaluable  to this finished product, the distinguished Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I now yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Sherman), one of my senior colleagues on the  Foreign Affairs Committee, the ranking member of the Terrorism,  Nonproliferation, and Trade Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly), one of our senior members on the Foreign  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Maxine Waters), the ranking member of the Financial  Services Committee.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member  Engel for his leadership and for yielding me time. I thank Chairman  Royce for his leadership and the way that he has worked with our side  of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Russia, Iran, and North Korea  Sanctions Act, legislation that is desperately needed to prevent this  administration from rolling back sanctions tied to Russia's invasion of  Ukraine and interference in our election.   This bill's enhanced sanctions on Russia are important in light of  the actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin, not to mention the  many ties between the Trump administration and the Kremlin.   In a recent development, the Treasury Department confirmed that  ExxonMobil violated existing Russian sanctions while under the  leadership of Rex Tillerson, who is now Donald Trump's Secretary of  State. Indeed, in 2014, Exxon signed documents related to oil and gas  projects in Russia with Igor Sechin, president of Rosneft, a Russian  state-owned oil giant. Sechin was one of the individuals subject to  sanctions. Exxon was fined a mere $2 million--a slap on the wrist for a  company that earned $7.8 billion in profits in 2016.   Russia is continuing its aggression in Ukraine. It is supporting the  murderous regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. It interfered in the 2016  U.S. election. That is why we must strengthen the sanctions against  Russia, and we must block Rex Tillerson and Donald Trump from waiving  or lifting those sanctions without review.   Before closing, I would also note that the legislation before us also  includes several measures championed by Democrats on the Financial  Services Committee. These provisions will focus the government on  creating a national strategy to combat the financing of terrorism,  enhance Treasury's tools for combating money laundering vulnerabilities  such as the well-known risk in high-end real estate, and help address  the de-risking trend that is driving fund transfers into the shadows.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Ms. Sinema), my friend on the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Ryan), my friend on the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 1 minute to  the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), a respected member of  the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Price).   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise to stress two  critical aspects of this legislation.   First, it would impose tough sanctions on Russia for its serious  international violations, the seizure of Crimea, its violent incursion  into Ukraine, its cyber interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Perhaps  most importantly, in the present context, it would prevent President  Trump from removing or softening existing sanctions without  congressional approval.   Second, the bill addresses Iran's unacceptable behavior in the non- nuclear realm, such as ballistic missile development, human rights  violations, financing of terrorism, without violating the nuclear deal  with Iran.   The JCPOA celebrated its second anniversary 2 weeks ago. It has given  the international community 24/7 access to Iran's nuclear sites,  provided an enforcement mechanism to ensure that Iran's nuclear-related  activity is solely peaceful, and elongated Iran's breakout time to over  a year. It has made the world a safer place.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from North Carolina.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as the United States  continues to monitor the JCPOA and Iran's behavior, it is important  that Congress continue to refrain from actions that would violate the  deal, threaten the deal, or impose careless sanctions that--under the  guise of being tough on Iran--would make the United States less safe.   This legislation meets that test, and I urge its adoption.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   On Vladimir Putin's orders, Russia attacked American democracy last  year. That makes Russia a threat to this country, just like Iran, just  like North Korea.   When the United States faces a real threat, we have an obligation to  respond. So far, a response to Russia has fallen far short. That ends  with this legislation.   Along with Pyongyang and Tehran, Moscow needs to understand that if  you violate international law, you threaten the security of the United  States and our allies, there will be consequences.   Now, I wish we were going to pass this incentive to the President's  desk today. So after we vote today, leaders in both houses have an  obligation to clear away any remaining issues and get this bill signed  into law as soon as possible.   So long as Russia remains a threat, so long as Iran and North Korea  defy global norms with their destructive agendas, none of us are off  the hook.   I want to also thank the Democratic leader, Ms. Pelosi, for her  advice and counsel on this bill. Let's pass this bill and keep pressing  this bill forward.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
