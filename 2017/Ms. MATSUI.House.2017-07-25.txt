 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3178, the  Medicare Part B Improvement Act, and, specifically, a provision to  extend the IVIG demonstration project that Chairman Brady and I worked  on together.   I have long been a champion of those impacted by primary  immunodeficiency diseases, which include more than 300 rare genetic  diseases, all of which keep the immune system from functioning  properly. A mild infection can cause serious problems and even death  for these patients.    Thanks to the IVIG demo, Medicare beneficiaries with immunodeficiency  diseases are now able to receive in-home IVIG therapy, meaning they can  avoid community settings of care, which can be very important to people  with compromised immune systems.   I am pleased that this provision was included in the Medicare Part B  Improvement Act. I urge support of this important bill.
