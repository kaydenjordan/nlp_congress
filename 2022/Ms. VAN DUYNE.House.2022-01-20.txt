 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, this weekend, tens of thousands of men and women will  fill the streets of our Capital to march for the lives of the unborn  and to advocate for the rights of the most vulnerable Americans.   These men and women are advocating for an end to abortion, but they  are not just seeking policy solutions. I know many of the devoted  participants in the March for Life and about all the work they do in  our communities to make sure that no woman ever feels alone or that  abortion is her only option.                                time  1330    They staff pregnancy centers, host diaper drives, provide information  on adoptions, and organize childcare for young mothers. They are doing  the work of making their cities and neighborhoods a place where no one  is alone and there is a support system for every mother. There is  sensitive and compassionate help available to those facing an unwanted  pregnancy.   Mr. Speaker, as we march for life this weekend, we march for a  greater future for all of us, one that values the unborn and sees the  potential in every life. I am proud to support, champion, and stand  with these efforts.
