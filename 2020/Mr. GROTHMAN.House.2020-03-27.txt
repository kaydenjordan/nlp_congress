 Mr. Speaker, we have gone from a story that barely  affected Americans 3 weeks ago to a $2 trillion bill today. The cost is  too high. But the crisis in response to government experts may be right  and may be wrong, who said: Don't fly, don't eat out, don't worship  together, and don't go to school. Our economy was shattered.   Was our President held up by irresponsible Democrats and too many  irresponsible Republicans for excessive spending? Yes. But we must act  to calm the panic and move back to normalcy.   I flew here yesterday with five passengers on the only Southwest  flight from Milwaukee. Usually there are two almost-full flights.   Restaurants are shuttered by the government, and their employees are  laid off.   President Trump is right to act and stand up to the purists who have  let businesses go under or don't understand that even the greatest of  Presidents have had to compromise.   I am concerned about the unemployment benefits going over $900 a  week--more than most Wisconsin people make. I want to help Americans  laid off, but this provision delays the recovery, and I hope Americans  don't bite on it.
