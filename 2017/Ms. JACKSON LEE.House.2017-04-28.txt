 Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman from Massachusetts was  speaking, I rushed to the floor because he was making such eloquent and  important statements, and I wanted to make sure to join him on  recognizing that, though we are pushing the can down the road, we know  what the mindset of the administration is in terms of funding this  country. As a member of the Budget Committee, we received the skinny  budget, and, to my dismay, it was a budget that harmed and hurt and  undermined the governance of this Nation.   I think it is important to match the Affordable Care Act with the  outside needs of living and thriving in this Nation. So my Houston  Housing Authority has now stopped vouchers for families in Section 8  housing for fear of not having the money. They had breaking news 2 days  ago telling those families, don't show up because we have no money to  house you--similar to no money and no room at the inn.   The zeroing out of the community development dollars, which ends our  opportunities for parks and sidewalks and housing and fixing those  hurricane roofs of senior citizens who are living in devastation from  Hurricane Ike.   It is not realizing the importance of the National Endowment for the  Arts or recognizing the EPA and clean air and clean water for those of  us who live near the Gulf or near the border.   It is not recognizing that you are not the President of the 10  percent that may approve of what you are doing, but you are the  President of the United States of America.   And then, for those who work in health care, in a meeting I just had  with the National Institutes of Health, $6 billion cut. Do you realize  that one of the institutes sends 88 percent of their moneys out for  grants so that researchers, young scientists who live here in the  United States, can thrive and provide new kinds of research?    There are 27 institutes in the National Institutes  of Health. One of them happens to deal with diabetes. The number one is  cancer. And for those of us who have experienced it, and for African- American women and others who have the triple negative trait, breast  cancer, the research of the NIH is crucial.   Or Dr. Fauci's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  Dr. Peter Hotez, in Houston, head of Baylor Infectious Diseases,  understands Ebola and Zika. We need these resources. What an outrage to  cut, in the skinny budget, $6 billion.   So we may push this to another 7 days, but I can tell you that we are  pushing the hearts and minds of Americans. We are creating a disaster.   And I can't appreciate the fact that law enforcement will be losing  funding. The Department of Justice and the Civil Rights Division, in  spite of who is leading that Department, it is a Department for the  vulnerable.   So I thank the gentleman for providing me with this time, but I  wanted to make sure that we added this long litany of those who will be  negatively impacted and that America is not about that. America is  about serving all of the people of the United States.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about H.J. Res. 99,  ``Making Further Continuing Appropriations for Fiscal Year 2017.''   This resolution is an imperfect vehicle for appropriations for FY  2017, because it does not fully fund the government for the entire  fiscal year and it keeps in place sequestration.   H.J. Res. 99 goes against sound fiscal practice by including the  budget gimmickry known as sequestration, a fiscal bludgeon that makes  across the board cuts in funding for the valuable services depended  upon by American children, seniors, workers, veterans, students, and  small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, the Continuing Resolution before us extends current  Fiscal Year 2017 government funding by seven days, through May 5, 2017,  at its current rate, which means a continuation of the across-the-board  cut of .19% for all accounts, defense and non-defense, contained in the  expiring continuing resolution that was approved December 8, 2016.   Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that we have again been placed in the  position of having to fund the government through the device of a  continuing resolution rather than through the normal appropriations  process of considering and voting on the twelve separate spending bills  reported by the Committee on Appropriations.   H.J. Res. 99 is far from perfect, but it is a modest and positive  step since it ensures that funding for appropriated entitlements will  continue at a rate maintaining program levels under current law and,  for a week at least, prevents congressional Republicans from shutting  down the government again and manufacturing a crisis that only harms  our economy, destroys jobs, and weakens our middle class.   The government shutdown of 2013, which was manufactured by the  Republican majority lasted 16 days and cost taxpayers $24 billion.   The enormous harm and disruption of the lives of federal employees  and the people they serve, however, was irreparable.  [[Page H2957]]    As I stated, Mr. Speaker, this Continuing Resolution is not perfect  and it only funds the government until May 5, 2017.   As veteran and seasoned Members of Congress, we have been in this  challenging position before.   But working together--in a spirit of goodwill, bipartisanship, and  realism, I believe we can reach a long-term agreement that will avert a  shutdown of government operations and the disruption a shutdown causes  to the lives of millions of Americans who depend upon federal programs  to do their jobs, educate their kids, care for their parents, and  contribute to their communities.   Our constituents look to the Congress and the President to make  responsible choices and decisions to keep the nation safe, the economy  prosperous, and to make necessary and prudent investments in education,  healthcare and research, transportation and infrastructure, economic  development, science, the arts and humanities, and the environment.   This is, after all, just another way of saying that the American  people expect their leaders in Washington be guided by the  Constitution's Preamble and pursue policies and provide the resources  that will:   ``establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the  common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings  of liberty.''   The funding priorities that have been floated by the Trump  Administration fail this essential test of leadership because they are  irresponsible, impracticable, unrealistic, and, in many respects,  insensitive or indifferent to the deleterious impact they will have on  the lives of real people living in the real world.   They do not command majority support in the Congress or of the  public.   To win such support, I believe that it is essential that any  subsequent continuing resolution or omnibus appropriations bill  achieves the following goals and objectives:   ``To establish justice'' and ``To promote the general welfare'':   1. Full funding for the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights  Division and the Department of Education Office of Civil Rights so that  they have funds needed to enforce laws protecting civil rights, voting  rights, and prosecuting hate crimes.   2. Fully funds community development block grants and low income  housing programs in urban and rural communities.   3. Fully funds the Legal Services Corporation so that working and  low-income persons who lack an army of lobbyists to represent them in  Washington will at least have the assistance of counsel to defend their  legal rights in courts of law.   4. Fully funds programs providing food assistance to housebound  seniors, such as Meals on Wheels.   5. Fully funds programs that provide students from low and moderate- income families access to affordable higher education and provides  students with special needs the support needed to receive the free  appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive  environment (LRE) guaranteed by the Individuals with Disabilities  Education Act (IDEA Act).   6. Fully funds before and after school programs and other student  enrichment programs that help students succeed.   7. Fully funds programs that make federal housing safer through  energy efficient heating and cooling systems.   8. Preserves tax credit programs that help revitalize low income  communities.   9. Fully funds the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of  Energy programs developing the next generation of clean energy and  transportation technologies.   ``Provide for the common defense'':   1. Provides robust funding for the Department of State and USAID to  advance national security interests in places like Iraq and Afghanistan  and to end violent conflicts in trouble spots which could threaten the  security interests of the United States.   2. Provides adequate funding for United Nations peacekeeping missions  throughout the world and distribution of food aid to people in  developing and famine stricken countries, such as South Sudan, Somalia,  Yemen, and Nigeria.   ``To ensure domestic tranquility'':   1. Fully funds cost-sharing reduction subsidies, or CSRs, to  compensate insurers for reducing deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums  for low-income customers on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.   2. Protects the adequacy, solvency, and integrity of the Medicare and  Medicaid programs, which provide health sustaining support for 70  million Americans.   3. Fully funds the National Institutes of Health research programs so  that patient access to lifesaving treatments is not delayed.   4. Does not convert funding for the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention into block grants which would hinder the nation's ability to  respond swiftly and effectively to public health crises like Ebola,  Zika, and HIV/AIDS.   Mr. Speaker, I believe that if all members of the House and Senate  work together, we can reach agreement on an appropriate budget  framework that invests in the American people, preserves our national  security, and keeps faith with the values that have served our nation  well and made the United States the leading nation on earth.    Mr. Speaker, I first want to rise and salute a very  special friend of mine, Johnny Mata, on his 80th birthday.   Longtime Houston activist and leading founder of the Greater Houston  Coalition for Justice, Johnny, we love you because you have been a  fighter for justice all of your life. I look forward to coming home and  celebrating you, not only as a fighter for justice, but a great  American, and certainly one who served in the United States Army.   I know that Johnny would not mind me making mention of the fact that,  in the 100 days that this President has served, not only has he not  provided any service to the American people in terms of providing for  their comfort, but today he will celebrate his 100 days by going and  speaking before the National Rifle Association, where over 80 percent  of those members believe in responsible gun safety, but not one word  [[Page H2961]]  has come from the President of the United States. Yet every day, 48  children and teens are shot in murders, assaults, and suicides in this  country and, as well, over $200,000 in costs for health care is part of  the tragedy of gun violence.   I would hope that this Presidency will join Members of Congress for  responsible gun safety to save lives, and stop catering to the special  interests of the National Rifle Association--not its membership, but  its leadership who are taking advantage and using this as a moneymaking  machine.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to my constituent and longtime  friend Mr. Johnny Mata on his 80th Birthday.   Johnny Mata is a longtime Houston activist who is the presiding  officer of the Greater Houston Coalition for Justice.   He has been a champion of social justice, education, and civil rights  in Houston and across the State of Texas fighting to improve the  criminal justice system.   He served his country with distinction in the United States Army and  later joined the Gulf Coast Community Services Association, where he  served for 32 to years helping struggling families to make better lives  for themselves.   His life has been a commitment to service on behalf of those less  fortunate, particularly in the Latino communities where his outspoken  voice against prejudice and injustice has had a profound effect on our  criminal justice system.   Johnny Mata has held numerous leadership positions including six  terms as the Director of two local districts and two terms as Texas  State Director for the League of United Latin American Citizens.   He is responsible for bringing to the forefront issues regarding law  enforcement and education in the Hispanic community and has been  nationally recognized for getting public school districts to hire more  Hispanic educators and administrators.   In 1999, Johnny Mata founded the Greater Houston Coalition for  Justice, an umbrella organization of more than 25 civil rights and  advocacy groups dedicated to raising awareness of human rights issues  and to addressing deficiencies in the Greater Houston area's criminal  justice system.   In the same spirit as Cesar Chavez, Johnny Mata is an inspiration to  us all because of his kind spirit and humble heart that allows him to  continue his fight for the least of these and for those who just need  an opportunity to achieve the American dream on a level playing field  with fair and equal justice for all.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Johnny Mata for his deep and abiding  commitment to the causes of social justice and equal rights and offer  him the very best for his continued success fighting for change and  also to recognize his contributions to this country on his 80th  birthday.   Johnny Mata is an American hero.                            ____________________
