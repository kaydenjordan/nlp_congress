 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Mr. Fred Randle.   Mr. Randle was a longtime Hot Springs resident who was part of  Merrill's Marauders during World War II. Merrill's Marauders were U.S.  soldiers who fought in the Pacific Theater, using jungle warfare  techniques to penetrate deep behind enemy lines. In just 5 months, the  Marauders advanced 720 miles through some of the harshest jungle  terrain in the world. Upon return, each man in the unit was awarded a  Bronze Star.   Mr. Randle's book, ``Hell on Land, Disaster at Sea--the Story of  Merrill's Marauders and the Sinking of the Rhona,'' described his  experience watching the sinking of this ship in 1943. He was one of a  handful of men with the Marauders who had been sworn to secrecy about  the sinking for 57 years, since it was caused by the world's first  guided missile.   Mr. Randle passed away at the age of 97 on November 23, 2020. But  before he did, we were able to contact him and his family and let them  know that a Congressional Gold Medal will be placed in the Smithsonian  in his honor.   Perhaps there is no better tribute to his life than in the words of  his family, He loved the Lord and he loved the United States flag.                            ____________________
