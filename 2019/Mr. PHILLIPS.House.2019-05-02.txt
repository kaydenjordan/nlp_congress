 Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Levin for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Representative Levin's amendment and  H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act.   I know when you think of Minnesota, the first thing you think of is  snow. It is true that we know how to handle a snowy winter. But this  year, the Midwest was hit with record levels of snowfall, and when all  that snow melted, it led to record levels of flooding.   Farms and homes across the entire region have been devastated, and it  is because of climate change, one of the greatest threats of our time.   We must lead, and we must be on the right side of history, so I  cannot understand why the President pulled us out of the Paris climate  agreement.   I support H.R. 9 to recommit us to this agreement because we should  be running toward sustainable solutions, not away from them.
