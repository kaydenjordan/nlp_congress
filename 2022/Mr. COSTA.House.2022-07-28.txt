 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (S. 3451) to include certain computer-related projects in the Federal  permitting program under title XLI of the FAST Act, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3451         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. FEDERAL PERMITTING IMPROVEMENT.         Section 41001(6)(A) of the FAST Act (42 U.S.C. 4370m(6)(A))       is amended, in the matter preceding clause (i), by inserting       ``semiconductors, artificial intelligence and machine       learning, high-performance computing and advanced computer       hardware and software, quantum information science and       technology, data storage and data management,       cybersecurity,'' after ``manufacturing,''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense bill that I believe has bipartisan  support involving the construction of chip manufacturing and other  computer-related manufacturing rights here in the United States.  Obviously, this is a big effort that has been ongoing in Congress for  some time.   The bill here simply adds key national security-related technologies,  like semiconductors, to the types of projects that are eligible for an  existing Federal program that improves the coordination between Federal  departments on permitting. We oftentimes, as we know, have difficulty  in getting the permitting process to work, and it creates delays in  process. It not only takes time, but it increases costs. So this is an  effort to try to address that.   The bill passed the Senate unanimously back in January. Sending this  bill to the President will build on the progress we are already making  today with the CHIPS and Science Act.   Both bills are critical to America leading in manufacturing of chips.  We know that it is the future of the 21st century economy that creates  good jobs and ensures our competitiveness in the global economy that we  live in.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the House's adoption of this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, clearly, I think there is an agreement that  America needs to increase its production of critical minerals for the  economy of the 21st century. I think oftentimes there are differences  on how we establish a framework and a goal in terms of the production  of those critical minerals.   I think that there is support on both sides of the aisle for  streamlining the permitting process that is reflected in this bill,  and, clearly, I appreciate the efforts and the comments of my  colleague, the gentleman from Arkansas. Obviously, we have more work to  do, and this is a good bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the House's adoption, and I yield the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, the people and communities of California's  San Joaquin Valley have been dealing with devastating drought  conditions for years.   Water is life, as we say, agua es vida.   A reliable, sustainable water supply is absolutely essential to put  America's food on our dinner table. It is a national security issue.  Think about it. We can't live without food. Without water, we cannot  grow food.   Farmers in my district are feeling the impact of the drought  firsthand. Many have fallowed land, sadly. It is becoming more and more  difficult to grow food and maintain farmland.   It is really simple. We say back home: Where water flows, food grows.   Small businesses are struggling to survive. Residents suffer from  declining air quality, spurred by dust and wildfires that continue to  spread across the West.   We must confront the devastating impacts of climate change. The  Wildfire and Drought Resiliency Act will improve drought resiliency and  protect the giant sequoia trees that are part of America's natural  heritage.   Without a doubt, we cannot wait to confront this issue. We must act  now.                            ____________________
