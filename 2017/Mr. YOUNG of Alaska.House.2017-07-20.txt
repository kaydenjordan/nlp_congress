 Mr. Chairman, this is an issue that should have  been settled a long time ago.   In 2009, this Congress passed a land exchange piece of legislation,  very similar to this, and we made one mistake. We did put into it the  ability to have the Fish and Wildlife Service make recommendations.  Even then, the recommendations were on a positive side.   The last administration decided, under the Secretary of the Interior,  not to build an 11-mile road to save my constituents, the Aleut people  from King Cove, in favor of a goose, and the people who live in King  Cove weren't really considered.                                time  1000    Now, this is a road that is 11 miles long that goes not through the  Izembek Refuge, but through some of the areas, mostly just along the  edge. And the argument you will hear is that they will disturb the  geese. You will hear it disturbs the eelgrass that the geese and the  loons live on. The road will bother them.   It is ironic; the refuge itself, which this refuge is not a new area,  it has been inhabited by man, frankly, in the last generation, and they  built about 70 miles of road to supply a military base called Cold Bay,  which is the airport we are trying to seek this road to connect it with  King Cove.   They actually take tourists that arrive in Cold Bay and take the bus  and go out the same road, not the one we want to build, but a road  right next to the so-called lagoon and the eelgrass for the tourists.  And for some reason, tourists don't bother geese. That is what I can't  quite understand. But it is all right for them to do that, but not  allow the people of King Cove to save their lives.   Since the refusal to build this road, 19 people, my constituents,  Aleut people from King Cove, have died because they could not be  evacuated to the airport so you could fly them out.   Now, some people will say, well, they have got an airport. Yes, 1,600  feet, winds are blowing 90 miles an hour, you try to get off. Or put  yourselves on a boat and go across in 30-foot waves.   And you will hear, well, we built them and they got a hovercraft.  They never wanted it. They knew it wouldn't work. The Clinton  administration said,  [[Page H6121]]  oh, this is our solution and it is better than a road that would  disturb the geese, so they accepted the use of it, and it did fail.   The hovercraft does not work, yet we will have an amendment later on,  the area that did not ask for it is going to be requested to pay the  money back. I didn't hear anybody, by the way, say, because a levee  failed and we put money into it, they had to pay the money back.   So let's really consider what we are talking about here. We are  talking about 11 miles, single lane, gravel-covered road to provide  access to Cold Bay for people in the community who do not have access  to a hospital, which is 600 miles away in Anchorage.   We had one lady evacuated at a cost of $250,000 by the Coast Guard.  The helicopter crashed, and she lost her life.   We had two other elders that went across with a crab boat. They had  to put the people into a crab pot because there was no way to get to  this airport.   So, Mr. Chairman, I am suggesting to my fellow colleagues, let's do  what is right. This does no harm to the refuge. It, in fact, saves  lives, gives them an opportunity to take and experience the medical  care that all the rest of us have. Let's do the right thing today.   Let's not be caught into special interests that say it is going to  hurt the refuge. I know many even got phone calls: Oh, this is going to  be terrible.   The truth of the matter is it is not terrible. It is the right thing  to do. So I am asking my colleagues, let's vote ``yes'' on this bill.  Let's vote ``no'' on the amendments. Let's do what is right today in  the House of Representatives.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This amendment is mischievous and trying to defeat what we are trying  to do today. The amendment is wholly unnecessary to mitigate impacts of  migratory birds in Izembek Refuge. Again, the single-lane noncommercial  11 miles has no affect upon the wildlife, the waterfowl, of any kind.   It would allow, again, the Secretary, or one of the other Secretaries  of a lesser part, like Fish and Wildlife Service, to delay the project.  It is an effort, again, to delay the project.   We didn't expect--by the way, when we say there are 70,000 or more  public comments, there was less than 100 from Alaska. These are outside  comments. This whole idea of public comments sometimes doesn't make  sense when they are nowhere near the Izembek Refuge or this road.   Sometimes I think we get caught in this idea that, oh, we have got  all of these public comments against something or for something, let's  look at where they are from.   This amendment, again, as I say, is mischievous. It is trying to kill  the project. It should not be done. It is being pushed by the  environmental community, again, to kill this project.   As I mentioned in my opening statement, you probably got some phone  calls. Frankly, they don't know what they are talking about. So I urge  my colleagues to vote against this amendment, which is an attempt,  again, to stop this road. Let's build this road for the people of King  Cove.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to reclaim my  time. I made a mistake and I said ``yield,'' when I should have said  ``reserve.''    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for allowing me  to speak on this again.   I stress the fact that the Federal Government is going to receive  43,000 acres for additional wilderness in exchange for 42 acres. I  mean, I don't know how many deals you can ever work that you get that  kind of deal. This is a great thing for the refuge. It is the right  thing for the refuge.   Again, as we go about this bipartisan legislation, we expected in  2009 to have this road built. That is why we are back here. It is not  the first time. For 40 years this community has been trying to get this  road built.   We thought that we had it in 2009, but because of the administrations  that were unfavorable to it, and the slowness of the report of the Fish  and Wildlife Service, and then having Secretary of the Interior Sally  Jewell say, ``No, there are other alternatives,'' when they did not  work.   So I am suggesting, respectfully, that, again, this amendment is  trying to kill the bill. It is not trying to provide a solution to  anything.   Respectfully, I would say this again: vote against this amendment.  Let's defeat this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I just inquire how much time is  remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Utah (Mr. Bishop) who is the chairman.    Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining?    Again, may I suggest we talk about this  legislation. We thought 9 years ago or 8 years ago that we would have  this road built. There is no Federal money involved in it. It is a road  that needs to be done, and if we reinstate this language, what will  happen is there will be a time where the road again will be studied and  won't be built. For forty years, they have waited and lost lives, and  we are talking about letting the Federal Government get involved again.   Mr. Chairman, I am saying this is the time to build the road.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    I have an amendment at the desk, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Chairman, in order to fully ensure that this  emergency route will not be slowed down by unnecessary regulatory  delays, my amendment makes minor changes to section 7 to conform to the  text of H.R. 218 with the Senate text of S. 101.   Section 7 of the underlying bill waives the NEPA process because the  NEPA process had already been completed in 2014 under Secretary Jewell.  An environmental impact statement has already been published. Secretary  Jewell ignored the public health and safety aspects that killed people  because we don't have a road.   There is no reason to make the people of King Cove go through the  time-consuming and expensive process again when it was done so  recently. The people of King Cove have fought for this road for 40  years. People have literally died, again, because of the lack of this  road to Cold Bay which has a 6,000-foot airstrip.   Mr. Chairman, again, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Again, Mr. Chairman, let's not wait again for 40  years or 9 years or 10 years. This has already been done by the study.  The impact statement has already been done. The NEPA process has  already been done. It has been done recently, and this is not a cheap  effort for a small community. So I am suggesting, respectfully, this  amendment be adopted so we can build a road.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would penalize the  State of Alaska for a Clinton administration decision by making them  pay back grant money for the costly and often unreliable emergency  hovercraft system.   Residents of King Cove never wanted this system and only agreed to  the compromise when it became clear the Clinton administration would  oppose any effort to authorize the construction of this lifesaving  road.   After years of working in good faith to make the solution work, King  Cove had to abandon the system due to exorbitant cost and, frankly,  mechanical failures on the craft. It was very expensive to run.   Very frankly, the amendment attempts reparation but it targets the  wrong group. The amendment puts a price tag on the safety of King Cove  residents who have sought more reliable access to medical care for  decades.   Congress does not require Louisiana to pay the Federal Government for  the failed levees in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina before  building new ones and should not be charging the residents of King Cove  for constructing this road.   By the way, furthermore, the amendment seeks repayment from the State  of Alaska that did not receive money; however, the grant money is for  temporary emergency relief efforts which were largely awarded to the  local governments.   Mr. Chairman, again, I think this amendment is a punitive amendment.  I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop) who is the chairman of  the committee.    Mr. Bishop of Utah. Mr. Chairman, as we close on this particular  amendment, let me say I would never consider this amendment uppity. I  would consider it cute and a gotcha amendment because the reality is,  unlike what has been alluded to, the community did not want this  hovercraft.   They wanted what was promised them in the bill, which was an 11-mile  road to connect to the rest of the road. It was forced upon them by the  Clinton administration that said: This is it; take it or leave it.   They tried to make it work. The bottom line is the system didn't  work. But the Clinton administration here, 6,000 miles away, forced on  to local residents who knew they would have a problem something that  did not work, and they quit doing it simply because they could not  afford to maintain that hovercraft.   The hovercraft is for sale; but no one needs a hovercraft. That is  why this community now is stuck with the decision that we made 6,000  miles away because we know what is right for King Cove, Alaska, instead  of allowing them to have some kind of control over their own lives.   What Mr. Young said is accurate. When the levees broke along the  Mississippi and the Missouri, we didn't go  [[Page H6128]]  to those States to insist on it. When there are wildfires that take  place in the West, including the gentleman from Arizona's home State,  we don't go back to Arizona and force them to pay for all of it. This  is simply an amendment that is cute, and it is a gotcha amendment. But  it is also wrong.   It was also pointed out the grants went to the community. The  community is not being required under this amendment to pay it back, it  is the State, which simply means the amendment is also poorly written  if it ever was indeed supposed to be a sincere amendment.   This is one of those things that we don't need to go through. The  options are very clear. We have gone through the process. Vote against  this particular amendment.    Vote ``yes'' on the bill and ``no'' on the  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
