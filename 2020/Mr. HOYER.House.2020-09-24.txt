 Mr. Speaker, I am going to make some comments, but I want  to just briefly remark about the gentleman from Pennsylvania's remarks  about the PPP.   That program was, of course, a bipartisan program that was negotiated  between Mr. Cardin, Mr. Rubio, and Nydia Velazquez, the chair of the  Small Business Committee here, who played a role.   We passed the HEROES Act. We are 4 months-plus from passing the  HEROES Act, and the Senate has taken no action.   Now, one could say, well, the Senate hasn't taken action because they  can't get the votes of the Democrats for a bill that we believe is  woefully inadequate. I didn't hear the gentleman talking about those  people in food lines or the families who need that payment of $1,200  and dollars for children. I didn't hear him say anything about the  testing capability so we can stop this virus.   I do not criticize him for mentioning the Chabot bill. I will tell my  friends on the Republican side, I am hopeful that they are going to get  the opportunity to vote either for an agreement between Secretary  Mnuchin and Speaker Pelosi and Senator Schumer and others who choose to  participate in the negotiations.   I am very hopeful that we will have either an agreement or a bill  that we can pass that I hope everybody on this floor votes for, which  will deal with the problems I mentioned, with the challenges the  gentleman from Pennsylvania mentioned. But, of course, the response to  HEROES was, from the Republican leader in the Senate: Let the States go  bankrupt.   I don't know whether anybody has any thoughts on, if the States go  bankrupt, the impact that that will have on the fight against COVID-19.  I think it would be substantial, including cities and localities and  counties.   So we have some time to go before we are leaving here, and we have  time to address not only the challenge that Mr. Joyce brings up, but  the challenges of families and children, of people who are sick.   All of us ought to be motivated by the fact that 200,000 of our  fellow citizens have died as a result of COVID-19. I am going to speak  to that now.   Mr. Speaker, this week, Democrats are coming to the floor to  highlight the work we have been doing over the past 2 years governing  for the people, in sharp contrast with the way President Trump and  Republicans have failed the people.   First and foremost, they have failed our country by responding  inadequately to the COVID-19 pandemic.   Now, we started out with bipartisan action, and that was good,  overwhelming bipartisan action, Republicans and Democrats responding to  a crisis that was killing our people; and then, unfortunately, that  bipartisan process fell apart.   First and foremost, our Republican colleagues have failed our country  by responding inadequately to the COVID-19 pandemic by not having the  Senate respond to our bill and come to a conference and try to get an  agreement. In addition, when we tried to have negotiations, as we had  successfully had four times, they refused to come to the table.   In February, President Trump told the American people that the virus,  like a miracle, would disappear. He called criticism of his response to  the virus a hoax. More than 200,000 Americans have now died from that  hoax.   There has been no miracle. Criticism of that failure is no hoax.  Other nations' governments have figured out how to slow the spread of  the virus, yet this administration keeps failing and keeps  contradicting our health providers and our experts.    Based on our population, Mr. Speaker, if we had the same fatality  rate for COVID-19 as Australia--listen, my friends, to this figure. If  we had the same fatality rate for COVID-19 as Australia, fewer than  11,000 Americans would have died, if we had had the same success rate.  And if we had had the same rate as Japan, fewer than 5,000 Americans  would have lost their lives.   Yet our President says we have handled it the best of anybody in the  world. The facts, of course, do not interfere with his conclusions.   The Democratic-led House passed the HEROES Act in May--May 15, to be  exact--more than 4 months ago. More than 110,000 Americans have died of  COVID-19 during the 4 months that President Trump and the Republicans  blocked the HEROES Act from helping us defeat this pandemic.   In that same period, President Trump, who in 2011 criticized  President Obama for playing golf, in that same period, President Trump  left the White House to play golf as many as 30 times--fiddling while  Rome burned. That is eight times per month on average.   What did President Trump say when asked in August about the rising  fatalities? ``It is what it is.''   How recklessly irresponsible, how callous and dismissive of people's  pain, and how indicative of a lack of decency and leadership.   At the same time, President Trump and congressional Republicans have  been working hard to eliminate access to affordable healthcare for  millions of Americans and remove protections for more than 133 million  people with preexisting conditions. And they say, of course: Oh, no. We  are for preexisting conditions. We are just trying to get rid of the  law that gives protection for preexisting conditions.   Their lawsuit to overturn the Affordable Care Act comes amid a deadly  pandemic worsened by their own failures.   For 4 years, President Trump and Republicans have been promising to  unveil a secret plan that they say covers everybody. The President  says: I am going to cover everybody--lower cost, higher quality.   We have seen no such plan in 3 years and 8 months of this Presidency.  That is because there is no Republican healthcare plan. They tried one  early on. It failed. It failed because they couldn't get a Republican  vote--John McCain, who thought it wasn't a real bill.   As a matter of fact, the President, who hailed the bill at the White  House as the most wonderful thing in the world, 2 weeks later, said: It  was a mean bill.                                time  0915    There is only the unyielding drive to get rid of the Affordable Care  Act and  [[Page H4889]]  tell tens of millions of Americans: You are on your own. Sixty-five- some-odd votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, no alternative have  the Republicans, even when they were in charge, adopted.   As a result of President Trump and Republicans hitting pause, the  minority leader of this House said: Let's wait and see what happens. We  have seen what happens, 110,000 additional people have died.   As a result of President Trump and Republicans hitting pause on  responding to the pandemic, tens of millions are out of work, critical  support in the form of expanded unemployment insurance was allowed to  expire in July, and the unemployment rate has jumped from 4.7 to 8.4  percent.   The Federal deficit has also skyrocketed as a result of these  failures. During President Obama's last full year in office it was $585  billion. Too high? Yes. But what is it now? $3.3 trillion. It was the  pandemic. Yes, certainly that is the case.   It was the $1.5 trillion tax cut for the wealthiest in America. It  was the pandemic.   But it was the failure to respond in an effective way to what the  President, in January, knew was a critically important health risk, and  told the American people: Don't worry, it is going to go away in just a  few days.   Our health and our economy are not the only things that are under  threat from President Trump and his allies in Congress, our democracy  is under threat as well. Even before he was sworn into office, the  President had shattered the democratic norms that have made America  strong and stable.   As a candidate, he solicited campaign help from Russia. Send me those  emails, Russia. Send it, in public, brazenly. Help me Russia.   And while in office, of course, he was impeached for soliciting help  from Ukraine to help his reelection.   Numerous Trump administration appointees and campaign officials have  been convicted of crimes relating to Russia's interference in the 2016  election and lying to law enforcement. I guess we rationalize that if  you are an ally of Trump, lying to law enforcement is no problem. Paul  Manafort. Michael Flynn.   The President has refused to divest himself of his businesses and  created massive conflicts of interest. Since 2015, more than $16  million of taxpayer funds have been spent at President Trump's own  properties.   This is a President for whom the law appears to mean little, for whom  democratic norms appear to be nothing, and for whom personal power and  enrichment appear always to come first.   Not America first, as he likes to say. Not for the people.   Trump first. Himself above others and above the law.   And Republicans in Congress, unfortunately, and sadly, have been  unwilling to stand up and say the emperor has no clothes.   Mr. Speaker, we have been working every day. We passed hundreds of  bills. Minimum wage. You are on your own. Violence against women. You  are on your own. Equality for all Americans. You are on your own.  Voting rights for Americans. You are on your own. Sitting unattended,  unconsidered on Mitch McConnell's desk.   Mr. Speaker, America is struggling, and what we ought to be doing is  working together. And I am hopeful, as I said, in the next 5 to 6 days  we get either an agreement or a bill passed in this House that the  Senate will pass. I am for either one of those options, but we must  take one of them.                            ____________________
