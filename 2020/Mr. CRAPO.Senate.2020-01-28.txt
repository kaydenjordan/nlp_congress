 Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator  James E. Risch and Representative  Mike Simpson, I congratulate the  city of Idaho Falls and Bonneville County on the preservation of the  historic Hotel Bonneville.   The Bonneville County Heritage Association provided historical  background about the area and the original naming and purpose of the  hotel that has stood in Idaho Falls for nearly a century. The  association notes this remarkable structure was named for Captain  Bonneville, who led an expedition from 1832 to 1834 through the vast  country between the Missouri and Columbia Rivers. Idaho later became  part of the United States through the Oregon Treaty in 1846. Then, on  March 4, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln signed a bill establishing the  Idaho Territory, and Idaho became the 43rd State on July 3, 1890.  Further, the Bonneville County Heritage Association explained that on  February 7, 1911, Governor James Henry Hawley put an end to a fight for  county division by signing a bill designating Bonneville County and  naming Idaho Falls the county seat.   The Bonneville County Heritage Association found a May 1927 Times  Register article providing an account of the historical significance of  the Hotel Bonneville in Idaho Falls at the time of its construction  that states the hotel ``is the result of the desire on the part of a  number of the people of Idaho Falls, and community, to have the use of  a strictly first class hotel, with adequate accommodations and quality  of service which would enable Idaho Falls, as a community, to invite  public gatherings and conventions and to be prepared to take care of  them in a way and manner, which would reflect on the community.'' The  name Hotel Bonneville was selected for the original hotel to honor the  founder of this part of the country, and the hotel opened its doors for  business on June 1, 1927.   The Bonneville Hotel has recently undergone extensive renovations  transforming it into an affordable housing complex that includes retail  space. We commend the visionaries and partners who came together to  provide a new life for this local landmark. A plaque at the building  notes the original Hotel Bonneville was built by 481 citizens. Through  the leadership of Idaho Falls Mayor Rebecca Casper, the Idaho Falls  City Council, the Idaho Falls Redevelopment Agency, and the hard work  and vison of many Idahoans, the renewal of this landmark honors the  founders of the county and those who worked to build and renovate the  hotel and preserves this historic building for generations to come.  Congratulations on this local transformation.                            ____________________
