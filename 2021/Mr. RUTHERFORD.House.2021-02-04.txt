 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory and to honor the  millions of babies killed since the Roe v. Wade decision almost 50  years ago.   There is nothing more precious than the gift of life, given to us by  God, who knew us before He formed us in our mother's womb.    Mr. Speaker, there is nothing more precious than the  gift of life given to us by God, who knew us before He formed us in the  womb.   Mr. Speaker, life is sacred, and it is heartbreaking that there are  those across this country and in Congress who reject that truth and  view abortion as nothing more than a medical procedure.   Sadly, a professed Catholic who knows better has already taken steps  to increase the killing of babies across the world and make innocent  taxpayers foot the bill.   He has revoked the Mexico City policy, which means American taxpayers  will now be sending dollars overseas to support the killing of unborn  babies in foreign countries. And he is actively working to eliminate  the Hyde amendment, which is a longstanding, bipartisan doctrine that  prevents taxpayer funds from paying for the killing of babies in the  United States.   Let's be clear, abortion is murder, not healthcare.   Abortion is not the answer to a child's mental or physical  challenges. I am reminded today of the words of Frank Stephens, a  Special Olympian. Many of you heard him speak here at Congress. He is  now living with Down syndrome. He said this: ``About abortion, I don't  want to make it illegal, I want to make it unthinkable. Politicians  change laws. I want to change people's hearts.''   Mr. Speaker, I agree with Frank Stephens, but I believe we can do  both. We can change lives and we can change people's hearts.                            ____________________
