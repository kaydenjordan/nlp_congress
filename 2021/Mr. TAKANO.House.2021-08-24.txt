 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of a  generous and fearless leader, Chairman Mike Hong.   Chairman Hong was a beloved member of the AAPI community, who had a  sincere devotion to serving a variety of communities and causes. He  mentored countless young people and believed in the importance of Asian  Americans being politically engaged.   He exemplified the immigrant who, by dint of talent, persistence, and  faith, blazed a trail to success and then ensured many others would  share in his blessings, and they did.   I am especially proud that he helped finance a memorial of Dosan Ahn  Chang Ho, a revered Korean independence freedom fighter, in the  downtown mall of my hometown of Riverside, California.   Chairman Hong dedicated his life to the service of others, and that  will never be forgotten. To the Hong family and all those who knew,  loved, and respected him, I offer my deepest condolences.                            ____________________
