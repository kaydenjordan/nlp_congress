 Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize Gerald Brence,  the athletic director for the Plano Independent School District, for 39  years of dedicated service to the students and athletes in Plano,  Texas.   Before earning the title of athletic director in 2007, Gerald Brence  served as the head coach of the Plano Senior High School football team  from 1992 to 2007. During his tenure, the Plano Senior Wildcats secured  a State championship title in 1994 and made five trips to the State  quarterfinals. One of the most winning coaches in Plano Senior High's  history, Coach Brence has earned the respect and admiration of those  around him.   Under his steadfast leadership as athletic director, Plano ISD earned  State championships in seven different sports, including golf, tennis,  baseball, boys basketball, boys soccer, girls soccer, and girls  basketball.   Our community is proud of Director Brence's leadership within Plano  ISD, and we are grateful for the countless lives he has inspired  throughout his career. Now, upon his retirement, I ask my colleagues in  the House of Representatives to join me in thanking Director Gerald  Brence for his dedication to Plano ISD.                            ____________________
