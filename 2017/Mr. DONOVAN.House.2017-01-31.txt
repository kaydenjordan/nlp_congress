 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 549) to amend the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11  Commission Act of 2007 to clarify certain allowable uses of funds for  public transportation security assistance grants and establish periods  of performance for such grants, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 549         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Transit Security Grant       Program Flexibility Act''.       SEC. 2.

(c) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the       enactment of this Act and again not later than five years       after such date of enactment, the Comptroller General shall       submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report on the review       required under this section.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 549, the Transit Security Grant  Program Flexibility Act. With more than 10 billion riders using surface  transportation annually and limited security screening, it should not  be surprising to us that terrorists have an interest in targeting mass  transit. We saw it in London, Madrid, Brussels, and when a terrorist  left a backpack of IEDs at a transit station in Elizabeth, New Jersey,  last fall.   Given the repeated calls from ISIS and other radical Islamic  terrorist groups for lone wolves and sympathizers to plan smaller  attacks where larger crowds gather, we must ensure that the first  responders and transit agencies have the tools they need to secure our  transit systems.   That is why, last Congress, I introduced the Transit Security Grant  Program Flexibility Act. This bill addresses concerns raised during a  field hearing the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and  Communications held last year in Ranking Member Payne's district on  preparedness for incidents impacting surface transportation. As  chairman of that subcommittee, I introduced this legislation to ensure  action follows our subcommittee's oversight, and that is why I  reintroduced this commonsense legislation in the 115th Congress.   Witnesses at last year's field hearing testified about the importance  of the transit security grant program, but found that the period of  performance was a challenging timeframe to meet, especially for  completing vital, large-scale capital security projects. These projects  are vital to transit agencies to help enhance their security features  systemwide and harden infrastructure.   H.R. 549 addresses this challenge by codifying the period of  performance for transit security grant program awards at 36 months for  the majority of eligible projects and extending the period of  performance for large-scale capital security projects to 55 months.   Additionally, transit security grant program awards can be used to  provide personnel with effective security training. Unfortunately,  recipients of these awards are not currently permitted to use transit  security grant program funds to pay for backfilling personnel attending  such training. In some cases, that extra cost at the transit agency has  resulted in an inability to send staff for vital security training. My  bill will permit transit security grant program funds to be used for  this purpose, consistent with other Homeland Security grant programs.   The current threat environment is evolving and complex, which makes  it even more imperative that the transit security grant program provide  flexible solutions for grant recipients. I am proud to sponsor this  bipartisan legislation, which passed the House by voice vote last year.   I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.R. 549.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I, once again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 549.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 687) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish  a process to review applications for certain grants to purchase  equipment or systems that do not meet or exceed any applicable national  voluntary consensus standards, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 687         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``First Responder Access to       Innovative Technologies Act''.       SEC. 2. APPROVAL OF CERTAIN EQUIPMENT.         (a) In General.--Section 2008 of the Homeland Security Act       of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 609) is amended--        (1) in subsection (f)--        (A) by striking ``If an applicant'' and inserting the       following:        ``(1) Application requirement.--If an applicant''; and        (B) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:        ``(2) Review process.--The Administrator shall implement a       uniform process for reviewing applications that, in       accordance with paragraph (1), contain explanations to use       grants provided under section 2003 or 2004 to purchase       equipment or systems that do not meet or exceed any       applicable national voluntary consensus standards developed       under section 647 of the Post-Katrina Emergency Management       Reform Act of 2006.        ``(3) Factors.--In carrying out the review process under       paragraph (2), the Administrator shall consider the       following:        ``(A) Current or past use of proposed equipment or systems       by Federal agencies or the Armed Forces.        ``(B) The absence of a national voluntary consensus       standard for such equipment or systems.        ``(C) The existence of an international consensus standard       for such equipment or systems, and whether such equipment or       systems meets such standard.        ``(D) The nature of the capability gap identified by the       applicant and how such equipment or systems will address such       gap.        ``(E) The degree to which such equipment or systems will       serve the needs of the applicant better than equipment or       systems that meet or exceed existing consensus standards.        ``(F) Any other factor determined appropriate by the       Administrator.''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(g) Review Process.--The Administrator shall implement a       uniform process for reviewing applications to use grants       provided under section 2003 or 2004 to purchase equipment or       systems not included on the Authorized Equipment List       maintained by the Administrator.''.        (b) Inspector General Report.--Not later than three years       after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Inspector       General of the Department of Homeland Security shall submit       to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report assessing the       implementation of the review process established under       paragraph (2) of subsection (f) of section 2008 of the       Homeland Security Act of 2002 (as added by subsection (a) of       this section), including information on the following:        (1) The number of requests to purchase equipment or systems       that do not meet or exceed any applicable consensus standard       evaluated under such review process.        (2) The capability gaps identified by applicants and the       number of such requests granted or denied.        (3) The processing time for the review of such requests.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response,  and Communications, I rise today in support of H.R. 687. This  legislation would establish a review process for grant applicants  seeking to purchase equipment or systems that do not meet or exceed  national voluntary consensus standards.   With threats consistently evolving, it is reassuring to see new  technology emerge which will promote the safety of our communities and  first responders. However, emerging technology is frequently developed  faster than voluntary consensus standards can be implemented.   Recipients of grants under FEMA's State Homeland Security Grant  Program and the Urban Area Security Initiative must procure equipment  that meets these standards. Unfortunately, if emerging technology or  equipment does not have a voluntary consensus standard and a grant  recipient would like to use those funds to purchase such technology,  FEMA does not have a uniform process to consider applications for that  equipment.   H.R. 687 requires FEMA to develop such a process for reviewing these  requests. Previously, this bill was introduced in the 114th Congress by  the subcommittee's ranking member, Mr. Payne, and subsequently received  bipartisan support by my subcommittee and the Committee on Homeland  Security as well as the House when it was passed under suspension of  the rules in September of 2016.   I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) for reintroducing  this commonsense bill. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of H.R.  687 because it will ensure our first responders have the ability to  purchase equipment and emerging technology needed to effectively adapt  to the current threat landscape.   Earlier this month, the Committee on Homeland Security released the  January Terror Threat Snapshot, which found that the United States  remains a top target for terrorists. It is clear that the threat to our  communities is not going away.   Congress has the responsibility to make America safer and stronger.  We can do so by ensuring commonsense measures are in place to ensure  first responders have the tools that they need to address these  threats.   I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.R. 687.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 687, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 584) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to enhance  preparedness and response capabilities for cyber attacks, bolster the  dissemination of homeland security information related to cyber  threats, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 584         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Cyber Preparedness Act of       2017''.       SEC. 2. INFORMATION SHARING.         Title II of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended--        (1) in section 210A (6 U.S.C. 124h)--        (A) in subsection (b)--        (i) in paragraph (10), by inserting before the semicolon at       the end the following: ``, including, in coordination with       the national cybersecurity and communications integration       center under section 227, access to timely technical       assistance, risk management support, and incident response       capabilities with respect to cyber threat indicators,       defensive measures, cybersecurity risks, and incidents (as       such terms are defined in such section), which may include       attribution, mitigation, and remediation, and the provision       of information and recommendations on security and       resilience, including implications of cybersecurity risks to       equipment and technology related to the electoral process'';        (ii) in paragraph (11), by striking ``and'' after the       semicolon;        (iii) by redesignating paragraph (12) as paragraph (14);       and        (iv) by inserting after paragraph (11) the following new       paragraphs:        ``(12) review information relating to cybersecurity risks       that is gathered by State, local, and regional fusion       centers, and incorporate such information, as appropriate,       into the Department's own information relating to       cybersecurity risks;        ``(13) ensure the dissemination to State, local, and       regional fusion centers of information relating to       cybersecurity risks; and'';        (B) in subsection (c)(2)--        (i) by redesignating subparagraphs (C) through (G) as       subparagraphs (D) through (H), respectively; and        (ii) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following new       subparagraph:        ``(C) The national cybersecurity and communications       integration center under section 227.'';        (C) in subsection (d)--        (i) in paragraph (3), by striking ``and'' after the       semicolon;        (ii) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (5); and        (iii) by inserting after paragraph (3) the following new       paragraph:        ``(4) assist, in coordination with the national       cybersecurity and communications integration center under       section 227, fusion centers in using information relating to       cybersecurity risks to develop a comprehensive and accurate       threat picture; and''; and        (D) in subsection (j)--        (i) by redesignating paragraphs (1) through (5) as       paragraphs (2) through (6), respectively; and        (ii) by inserting before paragraph (2), as so redesignated,       the following new paragraph:        ``(1) the term `cybersecurity risk' has the meaning given       that term in section 227;''; and        (2) in section 227 (6 U.S.C. 148)--        (A) in subsection (c)--        (i) in paragraph (5)(B), by inserting ``, including State       and major urban area fusion centers, as appropriate'' before       the semicolon at the end;        (ii) in paragraph (7), in the matter preceding subparagraph       (A), by striking ``information and recommendations'' each       place it appears and inserting ``information,       recommendations, and best practices''; and        (iii) in paragraph (9), by inserting ``best practices,''       after ``defensive measures,''; and        (B) in subsection (d)(1)(B)(ii), by inserting ``and State       and major urban area fusion centers, as appropriate'' before       the semicolon at the end.       SEC. 3. HOMELAND SECURITY GRANTS.         Subsection (a) of section 2008 of the Homeland Security Act       of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 609) is amended--        (1) by redesignating paragraphs (4) through (14) as       paragraphs (5) through (15), respectively; and        (2) by inserting after paragraph (3) the following new       paragraph:        ``(4) enhancing cybersecurity, including preparing for and       responding to cybersecurity risks and incidents (as such       terms are defined in section 227) and developing statewide       cyber threat information analysis and dissemination       activities;''.       SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that to facilitate the timely       dissemination to appropriate State, local, and private sector       stakeholders of homeland security information related to       cyber threats, the Secretary of Homeland Security should, to       the greatest extent practicable, work to share actionable       information related to cyber threats in an unclassified form.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to  [[Page H794]]  revise and extend their remarks and include any extraneous material on  the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 584, the Cyber  Preparedness Act of 2017.   Cybersecurity is a major national security issue and the threat is  real and immediate. Day in and day out nation-states or criminal actors  target the United States' critical infrastructure, the private sector,  and everyday Americans, and they are succeeding. However, even with the  heightened awareness on cybersecurity, it appears that the United  States is not adequately prepared to prevent and respond to cyber  attacks.   Since 2012, FEMA has released an annual National Preparedness Report,  which highlights States' progress in meeting 32 core capabilities, as  defined by the National Preparedness Goal. Every year, States have  ranked their cybersecurity capabilities as one of their lowest.   I found these facts very alarming and wanted to learn more about the  current state of cyber preparedness. That is why, last Congress, my  subcommittee, the Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications  Subcommittee, held a joint hearing with the committee's Cybersecurity  and Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee to look at cyber  preparedness and how the Federal Government can help States address  some of the challenges they face.   We heard from a Homeland Security adviser, a fusion center  representative, the Center for Internet Security, a chief information  officer, and a chief technology officer, who explained the great  progress the United States has made in enhancing their security  capabilities. However, they cautioned that challenges still remain,  especially with regard to information sharing of cyber threats and  risks, and whether Homeland Security grants may be used for  cybersecurity enhancements.   Last Congress, I introduced this bill to address the findings from  that hearing. I introduced this bill in this Congress to ensure that  States and first responders have the resources needed to prepare for  and protect against cyber attacks.   This commonsense legislation will: Enhance cyber risk information  sharing with State and major urban area fusion centers; authorize  representatives from State and urban area fusion centers to be assigned  to the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center;  and permit the NCCIC personnel to be deployed to the fusion centers.   It will allow information sharing on cyber preparedness best  practices with State and local stakeholders. It will clarify the  eligibility of State Homeland Security Grant Program and Urban Area  Security Initiative funding for cybersecurity enhancements; and it will  work to combat the overclassification of cyber risk information so that  it can be shared more broadly with stakeholders who have a need to  know.   I appreciate that Chairman McCaul, Chairman Ratcliffe, and Ranking  Member Payne joined me again as original cosponsors of H.R. 584. This  bipartisan legislation passed the House by voice vote last Congress. I  am pleased that the House is willing to take up this measure again in  the new Congress.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 584,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 690) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to enhance  certain duties of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 690         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Gains in Global Nuclear       Detection Architecture Act''.       SEC. 2. DUTIES OF THE DOMESTIC NUCLEAR DETECTION OFFICE.         Section 1902 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.       592) is amended--        (1) by redesignating subsection (b) as subsection (c); and        (2) by inserting after subsection (a) the following new       subsection:        ``(b) Implementation.--In carrying out paragraph (6) of       subsection (a), the Director of the Domestic Nuclear       Detection Office shall--        ``(1) develop and maintain documentation, such as a       technology roadmap and strategy, that--        ``(A) provides information on how the Office's research       investments address--        ``(i) gaps in the enhanced global nuclear detection       architecture, as developed pursuant to paragraph (4) of such       subsection; and        ``(ii) research challenges identified by the Director; and        ``(B) defines in detail how the Office will address such       research challenges;  [[Page H795]]         ``(2) document the rational for prioritizing and selecting       research topics; and        ``(3) develop a systematic approach, which may include       annual metrics and periodic qualitative evaluations, for       evaluating how the outcomes of the Office's individual       research projects collectively contribute to addressing the       Office's research challenges.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 690, the Gains in Global  Nuclear Detection Architecture Act of 2016, sponsored by Representative  Richmond. H.R. 690 directs the Department of Homeland Security's  Domestic Nuclear Detection Office to develop and maintain documentation  that provides information on how the office's research investments  align with gaps in the Global Nuclear Detection Architecture and the  research challenges identified by the Domestic Nuclear Detection  Office.   It further directs the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office to document  the rationale for selecting research topics and to develop a systematic  approach for evaluating how the outcomes of the office's individual  research projects collectively contribute to addressing the research  challenges.   ISIS has declared its intention to develop weapons of mass  destruction, which include nuclear devices, as well as radiological  dispersal devices. The key to preventing this from happening is to make  sure that nuclear material never falls into terrorist hands.   According to data compiled by the International Atomic Energy Agency,  there were nearly 1,150 incidents involving theft, criminal possession,  or loss of radiological material reported between 1993 and 2014. The  James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California  identified 325 instances alone between 2013 and 2014 in 38 different  countries where nuclear or radioactive material was stolen, lost, or  outside of regulatory control.   The amount of nuclear material in peaceful uses in the world has  risen by 70 percent since 1999. It will continue to grow in the coming  decades as global use of nuclear power increases.   Just last summer, six men were convicted in Tbilisi, Georgia, for  trying to sell uranium-238; and in January of 2016, three members of a  criminal group were detained for trying to sell caesium-137, which  could be used to make a dirty bomb.   We must ensure that terrorists never get their hands on radioactive  materials. This bill will enhance the Domestic Nuclear Detection  Office's ability to provide radiation detection devices specifically  aimed at preventing terrorists from being able to obtain enough  radioactive material to construct a dirty bomb.   This bill will ensure that the research topics it chooses to invest  in to enhance our ability to detect smuggled nuclear materials are  aligned with the gaps that have been identified in the Global Nuclear  Detection Architecture, a multiagency framework for detecting,  analyzing, and reporting on nuclear and other radioactive materials  that are out of regulatory control.   Requiring the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office to document their  rationale for choosing research topics will ensure that the most  important gaps in the Global Nuclear Detection Architecture are  addressed.                                time  1615    I would like to thank Mr. Richmond for the work that he and his staff  have done on this legislation. I believe this will better enable this  country to detect smuggling of nuclear materials and prevent ISIS and  other terrorists from carrying out a nuclear or radiological attack on  American soil.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space and             Technology,                                  Washington, DC, January 30, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 690, the       ``Gains in Global Nuclear Detection Architecture Act,'' which       was introduced on January 24, 2017.        H.R. 690 contains provisions within the Committee on       Science, Space, and Technology's Rule X jurisdiction. In       order to expedite this bill for floor consideration, the       Committee on Science, Space, and Technology will forego       action on the bill. This is being done on the basis of our       mutual understanding that doing so will in no way diminish or       alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on Science, Space,       and Technology with respect to the appointment of conferees,       or to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject       matters contained in the bill or similar legislation.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 690.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 655) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish  the Securing the Cities program to enhance the ability of the United  States to detect and prevent terrorist attacks and other high  consequence events utilizing nuclear or other radiological materials  that pose a high risk to homeland security in high-risk urban areas,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 655         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency  Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I rise in support of H.R.  655, the Securing the Cities Act of 2017.   Representing New York's 11th Congressional District, which includes  Staten Island and Brooklyn, and as a former district attorney, I fully  understand the importance of protecting our major cities from  catastrophic terrorist attacks. In keeping our pledge to never forget  9/11, it is our duty to ensure that such an attack never happens again.  This legislation underscores our commitment and gives the Department of  Homeland Security the tools it needs to carry out this mission.   In 2015, the Committee on Homeland Security held a hearing at Ground  Zero in lower Manhattan. At that hearing, we heard from Commissioner  Bratton of the New York City Police Department who described the  current threat environment facing New York City. In his testimony, he  specifically referenced the risk that terrorists may introduce illicit  nuclear materials into the city to conduct an attack. Similarly,  Secretary of Homeland Security Kelly recently stated: The United States  must prepare for the eventuality of a catastrophic attack given the  potential impact and consequences.   This bill establishes the Securing the Cities program at the  Department of Homeland Security to enhance the ability of the United  States to detect and prevent terrorist attacks and other high- consequence events using nuclear and other radiological materials in  high-risk urban areas.   The Securing the Cities program within the Domestic Nuclear Detection  Office provides training, equipment, and other resources to State and  local law enforcement in high-risk urban areas to prevent a terrorist  group from carrying out an attack using a radiological or nuclear  device.   The Securing the Cities program began in 2006 as a pilot program in  the New York City region which included Jersey City and Newark. Since  2007, the New York City region has purchased nearly 14,000 radiation  detectors and trained nearly 20,000 personnel. The pilot program has  been so successful it was expanded to the Los Angeles/Long Beach region  in fiscal year 2012, the National Capital Region in fiscal year 2014,  and to the cities of Houston and Chicago in 2016. Once the Securing  [[Page H797]]  the Cities program is fully implemented, it will protect nearly 100  million people across this country.   I would like to thank the Department of Homeland Security for its  hard work and commitment to this program. Given the alarming terrorist  threat from ISIS and al Qaeda and their willingness to carry out an  attack using a weapon of mass destruction, this program could not be  more vital.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 655.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 655, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 437) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to codify  authority under existing grant guidance authorizing use of Urban Area  Security Initiative and State Homeland Security Grant Program funding  for enhancing medical preparedness, medical surge capacity, and mass  prophylaxis capabilities.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 437         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Medical Preparedness       Allowable Use Act''.       SEC. 2. USE OF CERTAIN HOMELAND SECURITY GRANT FUNDS FOR                     ENHANCING MEDICAL PREPAREDNESS, MEDICAL SURGE                     CAPACITY, AND MASS PROPHYLAXIS CAPABILITIES.         Section 2008 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.       609) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)--        (A) by redesignating paragraphs (10) through (14) as       paragraphs (11) through (15), respectively; and        (B) by inserting after paragraph (9) the following new       paragraph (10):        ``(10) enhancing medical preparedness, medical surge       capacity, and mass prophylaxis capabilities, including the       development and maintenance of an initial pharmaceutical       stockpile, including medical kits, and diagnostics sufficient       to protect first responders, their families, immediate       victims, and vulnerable populations from a chemical or       biological event;''; and        (2) in subsection (b)(3)(B), by striking ``subsection       (a)(10)'' and inserting ``subsection (a)(11)''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's  Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I  rise today in support of H.R. 437, the Medical Preparedness Allowable  Use Act. H.R. 437 was introduced by Congressman Bilirakis, a former  chairman of the Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications  Subcommittee.   This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to make it clear  that State Homeland Security Grant Program and Urban Area Security  Initiative Grant funds may be used to enhance medical preparedness and  purchase medical countermeasures.   H.R. 437 codifies current grant guidance to ensure that recipients of  the State Homeland Security Grant Program and Urban Area Security  Initiative Grants will continue to be able to use these funds for  medical preparedness equipment and activities.   Mr. Speaker, the threat of a terrorist attack using a chemical or  biological agent is real. We must ensure our first responders have the  tools and capabilities they need should such an event occur.   In my district, the City of New York has put their Homeland Security  grants to good use for this purpose. In 2014, they held a full-scale  exercise which simulated an anthrax attack on the city. Participants  from agencies across the city, including the health department, the New  York City Police Department, and the Office of Emergency Management  worked to set up locations to quickly distribute lifesaving medical  countermeasures to city residents across the five boroughs.   We must ensure that the State Homeland Security Grant Program and the  Urban Areas Security Initiative funds continue to be available, despite  any changes to yearly grant guidance, for exercises like the one  conducted by New York City and other important medical preparedness  activities. This bill does just that.   Identical language to H.R. 437 passed the House last Congress by a  vote of 377-2.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Bilirakis for introducing this  commonsense bill. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this  bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 437.   I yield back the balance of my time.
