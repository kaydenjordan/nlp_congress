 Mr. Speaker, since LBJ launched the War on  Poverty, the percentage of Americans living below the poverty line has  remained persistently static.   As reform efforts in Congress continue to falter, American's poverty  reduction efforts continue to fall short of their objectives. We need a  different approach to help millions of Americans escape poverty.   Today, I am introducing the People Centered Assistance Reform Effort  Act, or the People CARE Act. This legislation creates a bipartisan  commission in order to empower caseworkers to treat each person  holistically, rather than simply administer programs; realign the 90- plus, often duplicative, poverty programs; remove benefit cliffs; and  more.   It encourages employment, marriage, and education, activities  identified by the Brookings Institution and others as effective means  to end poverty.   The commission cannot launch new programs, nor directly cut spending.  Upon receiving the commission's recommendation, Congress would have to  vote to approve or disapprove.   People CARE offers a path for progress in the War on Poverty. Mr.  Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to cosponsor the People CARE  Act.                            ____________________
