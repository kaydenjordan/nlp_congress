 Mr. President, the U.S. Innovation & Competition Act the  Senate passed yesterday sends a loud, clear signal to the Government of  the People's Republic of China and to the Chinese Communist Party:  American foreign policy is grounded in our values, and we will work  with our allies to defend our interests and to protect our friends.  Enactment of this bill will place the United States in a much stronger  position to thwart Chinese aggression, uphold human rights, increase  U.S. competitiveness, and enhance our national security.   I am proud to have worked on a bipartisan basis with Chairman  Menendez and Ranking Member Risch and other colleagues in both parties  to put forward legislation ensuring that defense of human rights and  good governance and upgrading our armory in the battle against  corruption remains at the forefront of our national security policy.   This measure will complement the action President Biden took just  last week to define the fight against corruption as a ``core U.S.  national security interest.'' In the National Security Study Memorandum  the President released on June 3, he ordered a high-level review of how  our government, our partners, and others can work together to combat  illicit, corrosive corrupt activity.   The interagency review that he directed the National Security Advisor  to lead should yield a robust strategy that brings all the tools at the  disposal of the United States to bear on one of the most consequential  problems we face. I look forward to seeing the results of this high- level report and working with the Biden-Harris administration to target  corruption wherever we find it. In the meantime, the legislation the  Senate has passed will provide the Executive with more tools.   While corruption is a global issue--no country is immune from the  disease that is corruption--it is important that we bring this fight  directly to the Chinese Government. S. 1260 calls for a report to  Congress on the corruption and corrupt activities of the senior  officials of the Government of the People's Republic of China so that  the United States can expose these individuals and hold them  accountable.   Congress cannot--and must not--turn a blind eye to the People's  Republic of China's shocking, systematic abuse of its Uighur  population, as well as of ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgz, and other Muslim  minority groups in the Xinjiang Uighur autonomous region. This ongoing  genocide demands a forceful U.S. response.   The U.S. Innovation and Competition Act protects the innocent victims  of these atrocities by authorizing appropriations for protecting human  rights to include programs that prioritize the protection and  advancement of the freedoms of association, assembly, religion, and  expression for women, human rights activists, and ethnic and religious  minorities in China. The bill also authorizes and encourages the  imposition of sanctions relating to forced labor and with respect to  systematic rape, coercive abortion, forced sterilization, and  involuntary contraceptive implantation in the Xinjiang Uighur  autonomous region.   Beijing's plan to circumvent Hong Kong's independent legal system  with a far-reaching, oppressive national security law is dangerous and  in complete disregard of the principles of the ``one country, two  systems.'' S. 1260 ensures that we stand with Hong Kong's citizens for  their freedoms, democracy, and basic human rights by authorizing  funding for the promotion of democracy in China and specifically in  Hong Kong.   Until the Chinese Communist Party changes its behavior, we and our  allies and partners must hold it accountable. This bill reiterates our  strong, bipartisan commitment to working together to call out brutal  regimes and use tools like the Global Magnitsky Act to hold individuals  accountable for their violations of human rights and corrupt practices.   The bill permanently reauthorizes the Global Magnitsky Act, allowing  the U.S. Government to continue to utilize this valuable tool. While  this is a crucial step, I also hope we significantly expand the Global  Magnitsky sanctions authority by adopting parameters used to implement  Executive Order 13818.   The United States can counter Chinese threats to our national  security by upholding our values, emphasizing transparency, and  exposing corruption, but other nations must see that we live, as well  as preach, our values.   I am gratified that S. 1260 includes my proposal to expand a ban on  postemployment by senior State Department officials on lobbying the  U.S. Government on behalf of any foreign governments and state-owned  entities. Doing so ensures that the U.S. Government practices what we  preach, removing the appearance that our diplomats might be doing less  than their best on behalf of the American people in order to position  themselves for immediate postemployment jobs advocating for foreign  interests.   I was pleased to join many of my colleagues in supporting several  specific initiatives to hold the Chinese Communist Party and other  regimes accountable.   The Transnational Repression Accountability & Prevention, TRAP, Act,  which I am proud to co-lead with my colleague Senator Wicker, who is  also ranking member of the U.S. Helsinki Commission, takes aim at the  pervasive and pernicious problem of authoritarian abuse of INTERPOL.  Dictators regularly submit to INTERPOL abusive red notices and  diffusions based on false or trumped-up charges in an effort to coerce  law enforcement agencies in democratic countries to harass and even  extradite those who have spoken out against oppression and corruption.   Bill Browder, who ensured that Sergei Magnitsky's courage and  integrity became known to the world and who worked closely with me on  the Magnitsky Act, has been subject to no fewer than eight abusive  INTERPOL red notices submitted by the Russian Government. While Bill  Browder's case is emblematic of the wider problem, he is by no means  alone. Countries such as Russia, China, and Turkey regularly file  abusive red notices to go after those individuals who have fallen afoul  of these regimes, despite this being a clear violation of INTERPOL's  constitution.   Adding the TRAP Act to S. 1260 would do three things. First, it sets  priorities for the United States in responding to INTERPOL abuse and  promoting reform within INTERPOL. It is critical that the United States  use its voice, vote, and influence within the organization to  reestablish its rule of law foundation. Second, it identifies areas for  improvement in the U.S. Government's response to INTERPOL abuse and  mandates that the Agencies tasked with managing U.S. engagement at  INTERPOL examine and determine who the abusers are, their tactics, and  how the United States can best respond. Finally, it protects the  [[Page S4016]]  U.S. judicial system from the influence of abusive INTERPOL notices by  clearly mandating that no person may be extradited solely because of a  red notice or diffusion.   Thanks to the TRAP Act, autocrats will be much less able to abuse  INTERPOL's information-sharing protocols, and dissidents can sleep  better at night knowing that the long arm of dictatorship will be held  at bay.   I am also pleased to have worked with Senator Rubio to include in S.  1260 the South China Sea & East China Sea Sanctions Act. This measure  authorizes the President to impose blocking sanctions and prohibit  visas for Chinese individuals who contribute to construction or  development projects and those who threaten the peace, security, or  stability of the South China Sea, SCS, or East China Sea, ECS. China's  military has been creating artificial islands in the South China Sea  and thereby asserting that its sovereignty extends into the long- recognized territorial waters of other nations and they are using these  creations as military outposts to threaten their neighbors further. The  SCS & ECS Sanctions Act also imposes sanctions on foreign financial  institutions that knowingly conduct or facilitate a significant  financial transaction for sanctioned persons if China takes several  actions in the SCS or ECS.   Finally, the measure gives the Executive authorization to curtail  foreign assistance to countries that recognize China's sovereignty in  the SCS or the ECS, with exceptions for Taiwan, counterterrorism,  democracy support, counter-narcotics, global health, and humanitarian  assistance.   Collectively, all of the provisions I have just discussed reinforce  the values that drive our foreign policy. The U.S. Innovation &  Competition Act will prove to be an important tool in countering the  People's Republic of China and other authoritarian regimes around the  world. I want to commend Senator Schumer for his persistence with  respect to bringing this bipartisan bill to the floor, and for allowing  its consideration under regular order.                            ____________________
