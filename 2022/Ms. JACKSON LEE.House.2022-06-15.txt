 Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2543 represents a seismic and  powerful response to racial discrimination in financial products. Thank  you to Chairwoman Waters, and to my colleague who is managing, for the  leadership given.   My amendment is very important. I am pleased that my amendment is  included in the en bloc amendment that the Financial Services Committee  has today.   It requires the Federal Reserve Board to submit a report to Congress  about the prevalence of racial discrimination in lending to victims of  a Federally declared disaster. I know it well.   This amendment merits the support of all of my colleagues because no  district is exempt from natural disasters. I am reminded of 2017, among  others, in my district where it was devastated by Hurricane Harvey over  an area of 41,500 square miles, 21 trillion gallons of rainfall, and  one-third of Houston underwater.   There was major discrimination against Black and Brown Houstonians  who sought loans or home loans or financing to pay for repairs. They  faced obstacles, delays, and outcomes that were different than their  neighbors.   Mr. Speaker, this endemic discrimination was seen in efforts to gain  assistance from the Small Business Administration.   Mr. Speaker, as an outspoken advocate for equity in this country's  economy, I rise in support of the Financial Services Racial Equity,  Inclusion, and Economic Justice Act.   This bill requires that financial services regulators and companies  establish procedures to ensure racial equity and eliminate racial  disparities in all aspects of their operations including employment,  income, wealth, and access to affordable credit.   In addition to the reforms in H.R. 2543, the bill requires regulators  to provide reports to Congress about economic inequality, especially  within the labor force, and enact plans to minimize said inequalities.   America's economy has only rarely worked to the advantage of working- class people. Worse still, there has been an endemic and vile trend of  implicit and perhaps explicit discrimination against people of color  within policies and overall economic policy.   However, unfair monetary policy is not just an anachronism from long  ago or a relic from a different era. It is happening now.   Recent analyses have found that algorithms used by lenders often are  designed in such a way that they result in black and brown Americans  being charged higher interest rates.   This legislation takes a major step toward fixing long-overdue-- disparities and fundamentally changing the financial services industry  to make it proactive in fighting economic discrimination.   I am also very pleased that my amendment is included in the En Bloc  Amendment that the Financial Services committee is bringing before the  House today.   My amendment requires the Federal Reserve Board to submit a report to  Congress about the prevalence of racial discrimination in lending to  victims of a federally declared disaster.   This amendment merits the support of all of my colleagues because no  district is exempt from natural disasters, and with the acceleration of  climate change, it is increasingly likely that these events will occur  even in areas of the country that previously felt insulated from them.   When disasters occur, our Nation has a moral and legal duty to  facilitate their recovery and rebuilding. It is totally unacceptable  and abhorrent for racial or ethnic discrimination to be injected into  decisions on financial factors impacting remedial action.   However, in some instances, discrimination--whether by intent or  effect--has occurred during these moments of greatest need.   For example, in 2017, my district in Houston was one of the many in  Texas devastated by Hurricane Harvey. Over an area of 41,500 square  miles spanning Texas and Louisiana, the storm dropped nearly 21  trillion gallons of rainfall and damaged 203,000 homes, of which 12,700  were destroyed.   At its peak on September 1, 2017, one third of Houston was  underwater, and over 300,000 structures of all types were flooded in  southeastern Texas, where extreme rainfall hit many areas that are  densely populated.   Hurricane Harvey was the largest housing disaster to strike the U.S.  in our Nation's history. When the cleanup began, thousands of  Houstonians needed loans to help rebuild their homes and their lives.  [[Page H5581]]    But black and brown Houstonians who sought loans or home loan  refinancing to pay for repairs faced obstacles, delays, and outcomes  that were different from their other neighbors. This endemic  discrimination was seen in efforts to gain assistance from the Small  Business Administration.   If there was ever a moment when our financial systems need to fully  support minority communities, it is after they have been decimated by a  natural disaster.   For majority Houstonians who applied and received a $200,000 loan  from the Small Business Administration or $25,000 by virtue of a  government declaration, the process was streamlined. They could also  apply for and receive $40,000 from the SBA to replace or repair  personal property--such as clothing, furniture, cars, and appliances-- that was damaged or destroyed in the disaster.   The SBA asks applicants for collateral, such as a first or second  mortgage on the damaged real estate, which are common forms of  collateral for an SBA disaster loan.   In the case of majority applicants, it was found that the SBA usually  would not decline a loan for lack of collateral.   However, for black and brown families, the system worked differently.  Financing was difficult to access. Applications for loans from black  and brown residents were less likely to be approved than applications  from their white counterparts.   My amendment protects black and brown Americans who face the  consequences of a debilitating natural disaster. It would guarantee  their protection from unfair policies in their most vulnerable moments.   Fighting economic discrimination should be a bipartisan issue. No  American deserves to be left behind because of antiquated monetary  policy or a federal government that refuses to fight on their behalf.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to recognize the discrimination and  to fix it by adding the Jackson Lee amendment.   I include in the Record an article titled: ``Black Communities are  Last in Line for Disaster Planning in Texas.''                  [From the Washington Post, May 12, 2022]     Black Communities Are Last in Line for Disaster Planning in Texas         Houston.--Lawrence Hester worries every time it rains.       During heavy storms, water overflows the dirt drainage ditch       fronting his yard and the bayou at the end of his block--      flooding the street, creeping up his front steps, pooling       beneath the house, and trapping his family inside. ``We are       always underwater here,'' said Hester, 61. And yet, the state       of Texas allocated none of the $1 billion in federal funds it       received to protect communities from future disasters to       neighborhoods in Houston that flood regularly, according to       an investigation by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban       Development.        HUD has now found the exclusion of those majority Black and       Hispanic urban communities to be discriminatory. The state       ``shifted money away from the areas and people that needed it       the most,'' disproportionately benefiting White residents       living in smaller towns, the agency concluded. Houston has       faced seven federally declared disasters in the last seven       years and suffered an estimated $2 billion in damage from       Hurricane Harvey in 2017. That storm devastated Kashmere       Gardens, where Hester has lived his entire life. The       floodwaters from Harvey deposited black mold throughout       Hester's home and left his daughter chronically short of       breath.        The state, which is appealing HUD's findings, denied       discriminating, saying the Texas General Land Office       administered the federal grant program based on HUD approval.       The situation in Texas illustrates the challenge facing the       Eiden administration, which has pledged to focus on racial       equity but is struggling to protect low-income communities of       color from the growing threat of climate change. Even after       HUD's finding of discrimination, the agency said it does not       have the power at this time to suspend the rest of the $4.3       billion in disaster mitigation money awarded to the state       under criteria approved by the Trump administration. ``What       is happening here with these federal dollars going through       the state and not one dime coming to the City of Houston       post-Hurricane Harvey is absolutely crazy, and it cannot be       justified,'' said Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner. ``What do I       say to the people in Kashmere Gardens when these storms keep       coming, and we are not putting in the infrastructure that       they desperately need to mitigate the risk of future       flooding?''        Black and Hispanic communities in northeast Houston,       including Kashmere Gardens, are especially vulnerable to the       more frequent storms and catastrophic flooding expected due       to climate change, according to the Federal Emergency       Management Agency. Many of the residential streets lack curbs       and gutters--common storm drainage infrastructure in       predominantly White neighborhoods in Houston--and rely       instead on open ditches dating back to the 1930s.        ``Sometimes we can't get out because the water is so       high,'' said Jackie Spradley, Hester's wife. ``You're       literally trapped until the water starts to subside.'' She       can't get to work. Their 12-year-old daughter can't get to       school. The whoosh of traffic and trains permeates the       triangular neighborhood of modest single-family homes penned       between two highways and two sets of railroad tracks. During       large storms, runoff from impervious highway surfaces flows       onto residential streets.        Piles of trash--old tires, mattresses, furniture, home       insulation--accumulate for weeks in the drainage ditches       along many streets, blocking water from flowing through the       ditches to the bayou. Silt and other debris clog many of the       culverts beneath narrow driveways and footpaths spanning the       ditches. In the summers, standing water breeds mosquitoes.       The city of Houston had hoped to use $95 million in federal       grants to upgrade Kashmere Gardens' storm drainage       infrastructure. The proposed improvements, including       converting some of the ditches to a curb and gutter system,       would have removed the flood risk to nearly 1,400 properties.       But without the money, the city shelved those plans.        Hester's daughter Ashlei was 7 years old in 2017 when       Harvey floodwaters breached their family room, lapping at the       legs of the card table on which the family played dominoes.       Her cough worsened, and doctors prescribed four different       medications for asthma. She was hospitalized in 2018 for more       than a week. But doctors still did not know what was causing       her illness. It wasn't until December 2019, more than two       years after Harvey, when Hester and his wife discovered the       black mold that was making their daughter so sick. A city       inspector recommended that the house be condemned.        ``I was so ashamed,'' Hester said. ``We didn't have nowhere       else to go.''        His mother had purchased the home in 1960, paying the       mortgage with wages from her job flipping burgers 16 hours a       day. Hester was born in the house months later. He had stayed       in the house after Hurricane Alicia flooded the home in 1983.       And after Ike in 2008. Even after Harvey, Hester stayed,       hoping to someday pass the three-bedroom ranch-style home       onto his daughter. But Hester, who is on disability for       herniated disks in his back and neck from his years as a       long-haul truck driver, and his wife, who sells insurance,       never had the money to adequately repair the storm-ravaged       roof and mold-covered walls. Hester said the city informed       him after Harvey that he was ineligible for funding to fix       the home because of unpaid property taxes ``It's not just       about the storm drainage,'' Hester said. ``It's about       everything.''        Hester said that the rainbow-hued oily waters he had       splashed in while playing in the drainage ditches as a child       had been polluted with cancer-causing creosote used to treat       wooden railroad ties and utility poles. A 2019 state health       department investigation confirmed elevated cancer rates       among residents in the southern end of Kashmere Gardens,       located near two Superfund sites. Residents fear that       flooding will carry toxic deposits into their yards. Hester's       mother had died of cancer. So had his father. And one of his       brothers. ``Cancer is killing the whole neighborhood,'' said       Hester, who is too afraid to visit the doctor about his own       health problems.        Federal disaster mitigation grants are supposed to improve       the inferior flood infrastructure in lower income       communities. But the HUD investigation found that competition       rules set by the Texas General Land Office unfairly favored       smaller towns with less urgent needs and where residents are       more likely to be White and less likely to be lower income.       The state knowingly adopted scoring criteria that prioritized       lower-density areas and excluded communities that HUD       designated as the most impacted by disasters from half the       grants, HUD said. ``Because the criteria had these       unjustified discriminatory effects, their use failed to       comply with HUD's regulations,'' the agency found.        No other state adopted Texas' method of distributing the       funds, according to HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal       Opportunity. The agency concluded that without Texas's       discriminatory criteria, nearly four times as many Black       residents and more than twice as many Hispanic residents       would have benefited from the grants. The General Land Office       said in its April 1 appeal that the state ``does not       discriminate, and the projects it has funded help minority       beneficiaries across Texas.'' The state said more than two-      thirds of residents in communities that received awards are       Black, Hispanic or Asian. The state pointed out that its plan       was approved two years ago and characterized HUD's new       objections as ``politically motivated.''        In addition to Houston and surrounding Harris County, the       General Land Office denied grants to the predominantly Black       and Hispanic cities of Port Arthur, Beaumont and Corpus       Christi as well as Jefferson and Nueces counties--all of       which experienced significant flooding from Harvey, according       to the civil rights complaint. Texas Housers, a nonprofit       focused on housing in low-income communities, and Northeast       Action Collective, a grassroots advocacy group of Houston       residents, filed the complaint with HUD last year. Instead,       funds were steered toward inland, Whiter communities that       were far less severely impacted by hurricanes and used to       fund routine infrastructure, the complaint said. That       includes $17.5 million for a new community center in Caldwell       County that is supposed to double as an evacuation center;       $10.8 million to install a sewage system in the 379-person       town of Iola; $6 million for a new sheriffs department radio       tower and  [[Page H5582]]       radios for Gonzales County; and $4.2 million for a 2,000-      foot-long road in Bastrop County to connect a Walmart parking       lot and a Home Depot, justified as an alternate path for       emergency vehicles in case the adjacent freeway is clogged       with hurricane evacuees from the Gulf Coast 161 miles away.        ``These mitigation funds are a strategy to undo the       systemic racism of the past, but that's not what we're seeing       Texas interested in at all,'' said John Henneberger, co-      director of Texas Housers. ``This is a test of how serious       HUD and the Biden administration are in enforcing civil       rights.'' HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development,       which oversees disaster mitigation aid, wrote to the Texas       General Land Office in March expressing ``grave concerns''       over the distribution of the first round of grants. ``The       State has not identified a plan to protect communities while       guarding against competition criteria that could disadvantage       minority residents,'' HUD wrote. If a voluntary resolution       cannot be reached, HUD said it could refer the matter to the       Department of Justice for enforcement. But advocates worry       that could come too late for communities like Kashmere       Gardens. While HUD said it cannot stop the state from       awarding the rest of the grants ``due to prior decisions,''       it would begin monitoring how the money is distributed and       warned it could claw back the funds if necessary.        ``Texas has a history of sending money to those who are       politically connected,'' said Shannon Van Zandt, a professor       of urban planning at Texas A&M University whose research       focuses on hazard reduction and housing. She noted that       racial disparities occurred with the distribution of disaster       funds after Hurricane Ike in 2008. Civil rights advocates say       HUD has the authority to suspend Texas's ability to spend       federal grant money; it has done so under previous       administrations. But Sara Pratt, former deputy assistant       secretary in HUD's fair housing office who is now       representing Texas Housers as an attorney, said there is       long-standing division among HUD staff over enforcing civil       rights violations when making funding decisions.        ``There is deep disagreement internally,'' Pratt said.       ``The secretary's job is to resolve disputes like this.'' HUD       Secretary Marcia L. Fudge declined to comment because the       Texas investigation remains open, HUD spokesman Michael Burns       said. ``Her commitment to civil rights and fair housing is       well documented and unwavering, and she is committed to       ensuring that all HUD funds are used in compliance with all       relevant laws and program requirements,'' Burns said. In       response to widespread criticism over how the first $1       billion in Harvey disaster grants was distributed, Texas now       plans to allocate $750 million to Harris County. Houston is       due to receive an additional $9 million out of $488 million       that the state plans to send to the Houston-Galveston region.       City officials point out that the $9 million amounts to less       than one tenth of the cost of its proposed improvements to       Kashmere Gardens.        In Kashmere Gardens on a recent morning after a       thunderstorm inundated streetside drainage ditches,       bulldozers and dump trucks worked to widen and deepen Hunting       Bayou to absorb runoff from future storms. The work is a       small portion of a $2.5 billion flood protection bond that       Harris County passed in 2018. The bulk of the bond money was       directed to wealthier neighborhoods because the county       expected to receive federal disaster funds for poorer ones,       according to county commissioner Rodney Ellis. But without       money to upgrade the ditch system to drain storm water from       neighborhood streets, it's unclear if the bayou expansion       will be effective.        ``This is the Texas two-step in Houston. You have to get       the water from the neighborhoods to the bayous. And then you       have to get the water from the bayous to the Gulf of       Mexico,'' said Ellis, who represents the area. Residents,       too, remain skeptical. ``It's a wait and see situation,''       said Dorothy Wanza, another Kashmere Gardens resident whose       street turned into a river during Harvey and flooded her home       with more than a foot of water. The experience left the So-      year-old so traumatized that ``every time it rains, I get the       hell out of dodge.''        She spent the previous night fully dressed, prepared to       evacuate to one of her children's homes. ``The ditches       overflow, and once they are full, the water comes back on       you,'' Wanza said. On the other side of the bayou, Hester       said the city had recently cleaned out part of a ditch lining       his street for the first time he could recall in more than a       decade. Dirt and bricks still block some of the culverts.        ``Right up under there, look,'' he said, pointing beneath       the concrete walkway leading from the street to his front       yard. ``It's stopped up on both sides.'' He nodded farther       down the street to another culvert: ``That whole drain hole       was flooded.'' He and his next door neighbor had removed as       many bricks as they could to move the water through. ``If we       don't do things around here, ain't nothing going to get done.       I have to go around here and try to help, and I'm in bad       shape myself.'' Hester limped around the perimeter of his       home and pointed two feet up the siding where Harvey       floodwaters had reached--a reminder of the catastrophe he       says he failed to protect his daughter from.        A nonprofit had removed the mold inside when it fixed up       the house in 2020, installing new cabinets, a new roof and       laminate flooring. But the entryway still slopes. The floor       joists need to be repaired. The porch is lopsided, its wood       rotted. Hester is stooped from years of pain. Yet he remains       intent on doing what he can to make things right. ``It's not       my life I'm worried about. It's my daughter's,'' Hester said.       ``I'm half dead.''     Madam Speaker, it is very meaningful that we are  holding this special order today in honor of the First Focus Children's  4th Annual Children's Week.   I would like to thank Congresswoman Sara Jacobs for leading today's  effort, which serves as a reminder that we must always be mindful of  the needs of our nation's children in all our efforts.   As a mother and grandmother, I am intimately invested in First Focus  Children's invaluable work to bring awareness and attention to the  needs of our nation's children, and I applaud recognition provided by  the 4th annual Children's Week.   This week, we celebrate the successes made in the fight to improve  the lives of children across the country and lament the many heavy  burdens still weighing on the shoulders of our youth.   I have been fighting on Capitol Hill for the rights and needs of  children and families for over 25 years.   Why are we still fighting for so many of the same things we were  fighting for in 1995?   Why in one of the richest countries in the world are children still  going to bed hungry? Why are families begging for affordable childcare?  Why are mothers and fathers choosing between making rent and keeping  the lights on?   I speak to you today with a heart full of grief, anger, and still  unrelenting hope.   Hope, because what are our children if not the promise of a better  tomorrow--if we can only be watchful stewards of today?   Frederick Douglas once said that ``it is easier to build strong  children, than to repair broken men.''   As the founding Chairperson of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I  overwhelmingly urge Congress--let us work together in bipartisan  action. Let us build strong children.   When passing the American Rescue Plan, Congress demonstrated its  commitment to keeping children fed, cared for, and supported.   The bill provided direct housing assistance and nutrition assistance  for 40 million Americans, expanded access to safe and reliable  childcare and affordable health care, extended unemployment insurance  so that 18 million American workers could pay their bills, and  supported 27 million children with an expanded Child Tax Credit.   As a direct result of this legislation, 7.8 million children were  prevented from falling into poverty.   Importantly, the American Rescue Plan made the provision of safe and  affordable childcare a priority.   At the age of 5 most American children are ushered into schools where  they and their families will be provided with community and supports.   And yet children under 5, who have as many if not more needs than  their older counterparts, have no such universal resources available to  them.   How is a caregiver expected to work to provide for their family if  they have a young one at home?   Each of us, whether a parent or not, has a stake in the success of  child care in this country.   High-quality, accessible, affordable childcare will allow our early  learning system to provide opportunities for self-reliance, agency, and  personal growth for millions of caregivers--ultimately leading to the  success of our children and our national economy.   I had the pleasure of congratulating a class of exemplary high school  graduates in Texas over the weekend.   Before receiving their accolades, regalia, and diplomas, these young  scholars had to overcome many obstacles--obstacles that many of my  fellow Congressmen did not face in our childhoods.   I implore us today to absorb the impact of the First Focus Children's  4th Annual Children's Week.   Let us remember the core of our responsibility to our nation, to  create and preserve a future in which our country's children can  flourish.                            ____________________
