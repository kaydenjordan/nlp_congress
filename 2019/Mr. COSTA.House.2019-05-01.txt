 Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise today to  congratulate Madera High School's robotics team for being crowned the  world champions.   They are the home of the Coyotes, and this hardworking group of 15  students from my district, otherwise known as MadTown Robotics, beat  out more than 400 teams not only throughout the country, but throughout  the world, in a competition in Houston, Texas, in the last week. They  worked long hours on this project, with each student member putting in  more than 200 hours, including weekends.   The community celebrated their success last weekend with a parade  through Madera and a rally at the school gym, which I participated in.  I am exceptionally proud of these students, their teachers, and the  faculty for their accomplishments.   Madera is a wonderful, growing area, which shows that the San Joaquin  Valley is not only a world leader in agriculture, but also in  innovation, for future generations across our country.   Congratulations, Madera High School.   Go, Coyotes.                            ____________________
