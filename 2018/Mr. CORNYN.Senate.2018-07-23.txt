 Mr. President, it is hard for me to believe, but it has  only been 2 weeks since I was at the White House, along with many of  our other colleagues, to await the President's announcement of who  would fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by the retirement of Justice  Anthony Kennedy. At that time, the President had said he had narrowed  the candidates to a field of four, all of whom were well known and well  qualified.    I was personally pleased that he had selected Judge Brett Kavanaugh,  a candidate whom I had been proud to introduce and support early in my  career in the Senate when he was nominated and confirmed to the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. That would have been back in 2006.  His academic background, his longstanding experience in public service,  and his now 12-year record of faithfully applying the law as an  appellant judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, I believe, make him  exactly the type of jurist we should want to serve on our Nation's  highest Court.   We know the attacks already began even before the nominee was  announced. To me, that was the most telling thing of all. One leftwing  group's literal fill-in-the-blank press release confirmed all of the  terrible things that nominee xx was going to do when nominee xx was  nominated to the Supreme Court. Last week, the leader rightfully  referred to this as the ``fill-in-the-blank'' opposition. If you can  come out with such certainty and such vigor against an unnamed nominee,  it looks to me like you really don't have an open mind in the first  place.   Now Judge Kavanaugh's name has been filled in, and the attacks have  been more direct and more personal. They have attempted to attack his  qualifications, but that has sputtered out pretty quickly given that  Judge Kavanaugh's qualifications are unassailable. No one can argue  that he is not impeccably well suited for a seat on the Nation's  highest Court.   The Nation first got a glimpse of Judge Kavanaugh's character when he  spoke at the White House. We heard about his being an only child who  had grown up with two hard-working parents and who still refers to his  mom as being the original Judge Kavanaugh because of her service on the  State court bench in Maryland. We heard about his being a loving father  of two daughters and being referred to as ``Coach K'' because of the  coaching of his daughters' basketball teams. We also heard about his  being a public servant who has been devoted to supporting his community  and living out his faith. Yet let's set all of these character traits  aside for a moment because, in the end, these aren't the primary  measures we will use to confirm this nomination.   Judge Kavanaugh graduated with honors from Yale College. He attended  Yale Law, and he clerked for two Federal appellate judges before  clerking for Justice Kennedy on the U.S. Supreme Court. He then went on  to private practice, and, from there, he went to work at the White  House, where he started in the counsel's office before becoming the  Staff Secretary to President George W. Bush.   Let me pause there for a moment and remind people what the Staff  Secretary does because, I suspect, there are going to be requests for a  lot of documents he touched during the time he was Staff Secretary. As  I understand the role of Staff Secretary at the White House, there has  to be one final person who determines that a document is ready for the  President's signature. Has it been properly vetted for policy  statements? Is it in the correct application of whatever the current  law is that pertains to that topic? More than anything else, it just  has to have one final stop that tells the President: OK. We have  checked all of this out. We have consulted with all of the relevant  people, and this document is now ready for your signature.   In almost no case did Judge Kavanaugh generate the document or author  the document. It was written by somebody else. He had merely confirmed  it was in its proper shape after  [[Page S5116]]  having consulted with the people who did write it and after having  consulted with the authorities who were responsible for that policy.   I suspect we are going to hear of requests for millions of documents  that came across his desk while he was Staff Secretary, virtually none  of which will have any bearing whatsoever on his fitness or  qualifications to serve on the Supreme Court.   More relevant, though, are the 12 years he served on the Federal  appellate bench here in Washington, DC. The DC Circuit Court has  sometimes been called the second highest court in the Nation. We have  seen Judge Kavanaugh earn a reputation for being a fair, well-respected  jurist who has a record of faithfully applying the law as written.   While it is clear that Judge Kavanaugh is uniquely qualified to serve  on the Supreme Court, if I were dreaming up the right qualifications  and temperament and experience, I am not sure I could have picked a  better person. In its failing to find fault with his character and his  qualifications, here is where the opposition has moved in its  outlandish claims about how he may apply personal political views to  the law.   The opposition started by digging up an old law review article Judge  Kavanaugh wrote for the Minnesota Law Review that made the case that  Congress should consider enacting legislation to govern a sitting  President's lawsuits and investigations. Some of our colleagues have  already begun to twist the words in the article and mislead the  American people into believing he argued the President could never be  investigated or prosecuted.   In fact, the Washington Post fact-check called these claims an  ``extreme distortion'' of Judge Kavanaugh's views. It is a bogus  conspiracy theory that is only being made by those who haven't reviewed  the article or don't want to but who clearly want to try to damage the  nomination. In his article, Judge Kavanaugh explicitly wrote that he  believes no one is above the law. His point was not to take away checks  on the President but only to say Congress might want to consider  passing additional legislation.   Some of our friends across the aisle then argued that if confirmed,  Judge Kavanaugh would be the deciding vote to overturn the Affordable  Care Act, including to overturn protections for preexisting conditions.  This is so farfetched that the New York Times fact-check from two  health law professors debunked the claim and called these arguments  ``overstated'' and that in Judge Kavanaugh's writings on the topic, he  focused on specific legal issues, as judges are supposed to do in the  cases that are presented to them.   Most every one of our colleagues agrees that preexisting conditions  should be covered, but that is a policy decision for Congress. What a  specious idea to suggest that somehow this judge who served on the DC  Circuit Court of Appeals for 12 years is some crusader who is  determined to undermine preexisting conditions coverage for the  American people. It is just a loony idea. It is precisely why we, as  elected officials, are the ones to make the law and to make policy and  to represent the interests of those we serve. When our constituents  don't think we are doing a very good job, they can tell us: Hey, you  need to be doing a better job, and if you don't, then I am going to  exercise my right at the next election to vote against you.   Judges, though, are presented not with a policy or a political or an  ideological agenda that they are supposed to pursue but, rather, with  specific cases and facts. Then they are to apply the law without having  any predisposed policy preferences. That is what judges do. Opposing  him based on a guess of how he might rule on a given case that may or  may not ever come before him is an act of pure desperation.   Don't they remember the standards set by Justice Ginsburg, who  declined to prejudge any case since she said that would be  inappropriate? As she said in her own confirmation, that sort of  assurance is completely wrong. Justice Ginsburg gave what, I think, is  the correct response to such requests, saying she would offer no hints,  no forecasts, and no previews of her specific rulings.   As a former State court judge and justice myself, I strongly believe  those who serve in our judicial branch must put their personal,  political, and ideological beliefs aside and apply the law as written.  If you can't do that, you ought to run for the legislature or city  council or county commissioner, not serve as Federal judges. I believe  attempts to predict how Justices will decide particular cases are  futile, particularly when you have a judge who calls balls and strikes  as he or she sees them. Cases depend on specific facts and  circumstances as well as on the lengthy and detailed legal arguments by  the parties who come before the Court.   I hope our colleagues will spend less time dreaming up hypotheticals  that will never come to pass and more time in meeting with and in  getting to know Judge Kavanaugh, which, so far, they have declined to  do. If they want to get to know the man and the judge, I hope they will  take him up on the offer to sit down and talk to them and to answer  their questions and explain how his judicial philosophy would be put  into action.   Thank goodness for a couple of our colleagues, both the junior  Senator from North Dakota and the senior Senator from West Virginia.  They were quick to say they will not be influenced by their  leadership's pressure or messaging from their far-left base. Let's hope  others will follow suit.   In having failed to pick apart Judge Kavanaugh's character or his 12- year judicial record, some of our colleagues are now requesting to see  every piece of paper--every email, every document--from Judge  Kavanaugh's career at the Bush White House. I agree we should fully vet  the nominee, and it makes sense to review documents that are important  to the confirmation process.   Yet, with nearly half of the Democrats having already announced their  opposition to this nomination, why are they requesting these documents?  Is it because it would cause them to reconsider their opposition to his  nomination? I think they have pretty much made a political decision to  oppose the nomination, so any effort to force the production of  documents that will not have any relevance whatsoever to his  qualifications makes no sense. Instead, we know some of these demands  are being made merely so they may drag their feet--as a pretext in  order to delay Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation.   Instead of chasing after irrelevant records from the Bush White  House, I urge our colleagues to read Judge Kavanaugh's opinions and  meet with the judge and get to know him. Sadly, I have heard, as I  said, that virtually all of the Democrats have, so far, not been able  to or have not found time to meet with the judge, which, I think, is a  shame.   Despite the attacks, the attempts to distract, and the efforts to  stall, though, the American people can be assured of one thing--we will  press forward in our vetting process and vote on the confirmation of  Judge Kavanaugh this fall in advance of the October term of the Supreme  Court. The majority leader, Senator McConnell, has made it clear that  if there is foot-dragging, and this is drug out beyond the first Monday  in November, when the Supreme Court has its first oral argument, we  will stay here until the bitter end--all the way up to and including  the midterm elections on November 6. That would be the consequence of  dragging this out for no good reason, but we will vote on his  nomination before the midterm election.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another note, we will vote today on the  nomination of Robert Wilkie to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs.   Mr. Wilkie brings to this position a firsthand understanding of the  mental and physical demands of military life. The son of an Army  commander who was wounded in Cambodia during the Vietnam war, he said  his father's recovery was at the forefront of his mind when he was  offered the position at the Veterans Health Administration. He himself  is an Air Force Reserve officer who has spent three decades helping to  shape military policy.   In fact, he started out his career in this very Chamber and worked,  most recently, for our friend from North Carolina, Senator Tillis. He  holds a law degree and multiple master's degrees, but he has had real- world experience as the Under Secretary of Defense  [[Page S5117]]  for Personnel and Readiness, as Assistant Secretary of Defense, and as  Senior Director of the National Security Council. Those are positions  of great responsibility and great importance. My home State of Texas is  home to 1 in 12 veterans, so having a well-functioning Veterans Health  Administration is crucial to my State.   Mr. Wilkie, I believe, has the experience, the compassion, and the  drive to make sure our Department of Veterans Affairs can efficiently  and effectively serve those who have served in uniform, to whom we owe  a moral duty. No nominee for this position has ever received a ``no''  vote on the Senate floor, and my hope is, we continue that tradition  during the vote today.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Burr), the Senator from Tennessee (Mr.  Corker), the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator from  Arizona (Mr. McCain).
