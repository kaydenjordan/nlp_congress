 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this reckless  spending bill, which, contrary to its name, will do absolutely nothing  to address inflation. In fact, the bill before us today will further  threaten the prosperity of hardworking, middle-class taxpayers.   The same leaders who drove this economy into a recession are back.  But this time, it is another failed plan to raise taxes, build more  bureaucracy, and create a government slush fund with taxpayer dollars.   We need to call this bill what it is. It is a $700-billion debacle  that will drive up costs for everyone, double the size of the IRS,  attack medical innovation, as you have already heard, and use $350  billion to implement the Green New Deal all while giving handouts to  the wealthy.   Hardworking Americans across the country are facing the reality of  rising prices and a nationwide recession. They deserve leaders who are  focusing on the lives of everyday Americans, not politicians who pander  to the President and his failed policies.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this egregious bill.
