 Mr. Speaker, today I would like to send my  congratulations to an extraordinary south Jersey native, who  represented our Nation at the international Henley's Royal Regatta this  past summer.   Matthew Catanoso is a rising sophomore on the crew team at the United  States Naval Academy, which was chosen to participate in the King's Cup  competition in July. This race commemorated the historic Henley's Royal  Regatta in 1919 that was originally held to celebrate the end of World  War I.   For the centennial anniversary of the tournament, eight countries  were invited to send a team to compete for the cup over the summer.  Matthew, the former coxswain of Ocean City High School, participated  with the rest of the Naval Academy and he took home the King's Cup  after narrowly beating Germany in the final race.   I congratulate Matthew on his big win at the Henley Royal Regatta,  and I thank him for representing our Nation and south Jersey at this  historic event and wish him the very best as he continues his education  at the Naval Academy. We are proud of him and we are proud of what he  has done. Congratulations.                            ____________________
