 I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I recognize Kerry Adams, the  Wakulla County Teacher of the Year from Shadeville Elementary School in  Crawfordville, FL.   Kerry says the most important life lesson she teaches her students is  that, even though things can be challenging, through struggle and  desire they can achieve their goals. The growth her students achieve is  especially notable because she works primarily with students whose  previous year's test scores indicate they are struggling in math and/or  reading.   Kerry recently had a student who entered her class and struggled with  new math concepts. She worked with this student as a dedicated teacher  who is committed to their student's success. At the beginning of the  school year, he would grow frustrated and not want to correct his work.  He settled for failure or less than his fullest potential. Kerry,  however, would not settle for anything less than what she knew he could  achieve.   Later that year, she gave him an assignment and told him she knew  this was hard work, but 1 day, he will think back to this moment and  appreciate her actions. This student left her classroom scoring on  grade level and ready for success in the future.   Kerry graduated summa cum laude from Flagler College, earning a  bachelor's degree in elementary education and holds the English for  Speakers of Other Languages endorsement. She currently teaches math to  fifth-grade inclusion classes and has taught all subjects in her 11  years of working with fifth graders.   I extend my best wishes to Kerry for her dedication to ensuring her  students achieve their full potential. I look forward to hearing of her  continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am pleased to honor Brian  Andrews, the Florida Principal of the Year from Lawton Chiles Middle  Academy in Lakeland, FL.   Brian's colleagues commend him for the innovative ways he has led  their school to incorporate innovation and technology into everyday  learning. In one of the school's lab classrooms, students use 3D  printers to make their computer-created designs come to life. They are  then able to use a large spindle device to cut those designs into  plywood. Elsewhere on campus, students work on and maintain a  hydroponic garden.   Brian supports these new ideas for students and gives teachers  flexibility in implementing the ideas in their classrooms. Brian  instills his trust in his teachers to develop lesson plans and  implement technology that benefits all students.   Brian firmly believes that, if something is good for the students,  and his teachers focus on those needs that, despite the myriad of  challenges faced in education, their students will be successful in  life. He teaches his students to believe they can do anything and to  believe in themselves.   Brian received his bachelor of arts degree in English literature and  his master of science in education from Hofstra University in New York.  He has worked in public education for 22 years and has served as an  English teacher and administrator.   I would like to thank Brian for his dedication in providing students  with a successful learning environment and for the support he gives to  the teachers. I extend my best wishes to Brian, and his family, and all  of Lawton Chiles Middle Academy and look forward to hearing of his  continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am pleased to honor Traci  Athanason, the Henderson County Teacher of the Year from Spring Hill  Elementary School in Spring Hill, FL.   Traci believes the most challenging thing about teaching is  motivating students who have no desire to be at school. She tackles  this challenge by providing fun, engaging lessons and being her  student's biggest cheerleader. It has been her belief that, when a  teacher builds trust and rapport with their students, every student can  achieve success.   As a teacher, Traci finds the most fulfilling aspect of her  profession is empowering her students to take control of their own  learning. Though teaching has its challenges, she is a firm believer in  knowing every day is a chance for her to make a difference in the lives  of her students.   The principal of her school attests that Traci is a problem-solver,  an innovator, and a dynamic mentor to multiple first-year teachers on  her team. She helps them build their lesson plans and develop their  practice.   Traci is currently a fourth grade teacher at Spring Hill Elementary  School. She earned her bachelor of arts degree in elementary education,  along with her master's degree in curriculum and instruction from the  University of Central Florida. She has taught for 29 years, the last 7  in Hernando County. Her favorite subject to teach is writing.   I thank Traci for her devotion to educating students throughout her  district. I extend my best wishes to her and look forward to hearing of  her continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I honor Kayla Bailey, the Gulf  County Teacher of the Year from Wewahitchka Elementary School in  Wewahitchka, FL.   Kayla possesses a very positive attitude in the classroom and engages  her students at a high level. These traits undoubtedly helped  contribute to her receiving the Teacher of the Year award.   Her colleagues attest that Kayla works hard to learn the needs of  every student in order to reach them at their instructional level.  Kayla's desire to teach to the best of her ability and treat every  available moment as teachable for her students distinguishes her among  her peers.   Kayla is a fifth-grade English language arts teacher and, although  relatively new to teaching and to the district, has quickly gained a  reputation  [[Page S2617]]  for her respect to students, parents, staff, and the administration.   I am pleased to congratulate Kayla for receiving this important award  and her commitment to teaching her students. I extend my best wishes to  her and look forward to hearing of her continued success.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Lindsey  Borcherding, the Okeechobee County Teacher of the Year from Yearling  Middle School in Okeechobee, FL.   Lindsey teaches seventh grade math at Yearling Middle School and said  her students were really excited and supportive of her nomination.  While accepting the award, Lindsey thanked the people who have  supported and helped her throughout her teaching career, especially her  students. Lindsey stated that none of this would be possible without  the help of countless others, and she is grateful to be a part of the  lives of her students and colleagues. She said it was an exciting and  emotional moment and was incredibly honored to be named the winner.   I would like to congratulate Lindsey for her commitment to teaching  her students throughout the years. I extend my best wishes to her and  look forward to hearing of her continued success.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Tess Borengasser,  the Indian River County Teacher of the Year from Glendale Elementary  School in Vero Beach, FL.   Tess was honored with this award because of her dedication to not  only providing her students with the best educational opportunities  possible, but also because she strives to provide her new colleagues  with ideas to teach their students as well. When these new teachers  come to her school, she is a leading voice in helping them establish a  successful curriculum for their students.   Tess's students know that, because of her motivation to encourage and  educate, they have someone who is looking out for their best interests  and will always be a voice they can rely on when needing help with  their schoolwork. These students know Tess listens to their needs and  will help them become successful in every way she can.   Tess was born in Houston, TX, and grew up in Vero Beach. She  graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor's degree in  elementary education and a master's degree in special education. She  currently leads Glendale Elementary School's second-grade team, teaches  at the school's afterschool program, and serves as a mentor for new  teachers.   I am pleased to congratulate Tess for her dedication to teaching her  students over the years. I extend my best wishes to her and look  forward to learning of her continued success in her future  endeavors.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I honor Bonnie Bresnyan, the  Hillsborough County Teacher of the Year from Lewis Elementary School in  Temple Terrace, FL.   After receiving the Teacher of the Year award, Bonnie said that those  who want to make a difference, who want to shape the future, and who  want the best for children are the people who teach. She knows these  are the people who work in our schools.   Bonnie compares her classroom of kindergarten and first grade  students to a beehive. She states that all the bees--her students--can  and are expected to contribute in some way in making the class a  success.   Bonnie has also done extensive training for other teachers within the  district. According to her, we retain 95 percent of what we learn when  we teach it to someone else. From her students to her colleagues, they  all can attest that she has a simple message for them: Be the best you  can be.   Bonnie has been a teacher for 31 years, with 20 of those years in  Hillsborough County.   She currently serves Lewis Elementary School as a student education  specialist. Some of her accomplishments include National Board  Certification, 2006-2007 Ida S. Baker Distinguished Educator of the  Year finalist, and 2002-2003 Teacher of the Year--Shaw Elementary/ District Finalist. She also trains for the district, mentors new  teachers at the University of South Florida, and teaches Sunday School.   I would like to extend my best wishes to Bonnie for her hard and look  forward to hearing of her continued success in the years to  come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize  Rebecca Caskey, the Citrus County Teacher of the Year from Citrus  Springs Elementary School in Citrus Springs, FL.   Rebecca believes students need a curriculum that teaches skills such  as self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship  building, and responsible decision-making that will provide the tools  to succeed in school, their future careers, and in life.   Rebecca is encouraged when she witnesses students authentically apply  and communicate newly learned concepts and behaviors with peers in new  constructs and environments. These opportunities motivate her to  continue developing challenging, engaging, and rigorous learning  experiences for children that leave a lasting impact into adulthood.   Rebecca has taught physical science, biology, environmental science,  and general math skills in secondary education and has provided  guidance and counseling services in elementary education. She also  provides therapeutic services to children in the private sector.  Rebecca currently teaches K-5 with a self-made program titled SEEK UP,  promoting Self-Esteem, Empathy, and Kindness by Unifying Peers. As a  member of Citrus Springs Elementary School's administrative team, she  serves in a leadership capacity by creating and executing decisions  benefiting the advancement of the school's overall culture.   Rebecca holds a bachelor's degree in animal science, a master's  degree in counseling, and has a license for mental health counseling  from the Board of Clinical Social Work, Marriage, and Family Therapy  and Mental Health Counseling. Throughout her 14 years in the  educational system, she has worked at the elementary, middle, and high  school levels.   I would like to thank Rebecca for the good work she has done for her  students over the years. I wish her the best and look forward to  learning of her continued success in coming years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I honor Tammy Chabot, the  Collier County Teacher of the Year from Gulf Coast High School in  Naples, FL.   Fittingly, Tammy was notified of her Teacher of the Year award while  she was teaching one of her classes. Her students and colleagues praise  Tammy for her dedication to ensuring those who enter her classroom are  able to achieve success and gain a better understanding of science.   Tammy also seeks to establish a relationship with her students'  parents, with many congratulating her for winning this award. Outside  of the classroom, Tammy and her colleagues note the importance of  student involvement in clubs and activities.   Tammy teaches at Gulf Coast High School in the Science Department.  She has served as a sponsor for her school's Girl Up! Club and was  named a Discovery Education STEAM Award winner in 2016.   I extend my best wishes to Tammy for her hard work throughout the  years and look forward to hearing of her continued success in the  upcoming years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Lynsee Dicks, the  Suwannee County Teacher of the Year from Branford Elementary School in  Branford, FL.   Lynsee's former students say her passion, dedication and  determination pushed them to the edge and then convinced them to jump  in. This passion for learning motivates those around her to work hard  in the classroom. Lynsee's determination has shown students how to  persevere even when the challenge seemed overwhelming.  [[Page S2618]]    At the Teacher of the Year awards ceremony, Lynsee felt overwhelmed  and humbled to hear the firsthand accounts from her students on how she  inspired them. She thanked God and believes He makes teachers special  in Heaven, crafting them with hands to serve in an array of capacities  and to be ready at any moment for anything.   Lynsee is currently a fifth-grade teacher of writing and social  studies in Suwannee County. She has been instructing students for the  past 14 years in grades ranging from second to eighth. At the  University of Florida, she earned a bachelor's degree in advertising  and holds a master's degree in curriculum and instruction from Florida  Gulf Coast University. While working as a substitute teacher, she fell  in love with educating children and became certified through a  transition-to-teaching program in Florida.   I express my best wishes to Lynsee for her dedication to her students  and look forward to hearing of her continued success in the years  ahead.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Cathy Felty, the  Bay County Teacher of the Year from Margaret K. Lewis School in Panama  City, FL.   Cathy is the media guru at Margaret K. Lewis School, running the  media center and striving to inspire her students to reach their full  potential. According to her colleagues, the media center is the heart  of Margaret K. Lewis School, and Cathy is its heartbeat. Many years  ago, Cathy interned at an elementary school, and at the time, it was  not what she was looking for. When a position opened up at Margaret K.  Lewis, however, it turned out to be the best thing that ever happened  to her. She loves her job and focuses on doing what is best for her  students.   After winning this award, Cathy took a flight in an adversary T-38  aircraft, becoming the first teacher to do so. While she considers  herself a thrill-seeker, she was more focused on how to share this  unique experience with her students. She plans to use her flight as an  opportunity to work with students, teaching them about flight and the  military. Her desire to incorporate personal experiences into her  lesson plans demonstrates why she was named Teacher of the Year. In  sum, she is always thinking of how to better the lives of her students.   Cathy has worked at Margaret K. Lewis School for 21 years and has  been a pioneer for the creation of the school's media center. She  specializes in helping and advocating for students with cognitive  disabilities.   I would like to extend my best wishes to Cathy for her dedication to  teaching for more than two decades. I look forward to hearing of her  continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I honor Lenora Henderson, the  Washington County Teacher of the Year from Chipley High School in  Chipley, FL.   When Lenora began teaching chemistry, she quickly learned that her  students became bored with lectures. They were more interested and  performed better when they were doing more than just listening. She saw  they loved being out of their seats, talking, and trying to figure  things out on their own. As a result, she designed her lesson plans to  include such activity.   Over the past few years, she developed a curriculum with the hopes of  eventually flipping her classroom. Flipping means she has removed  lectures from part of the curriculum and reserved that time for higher- order thinking skills and project-based learning.   Her regular and honors chemistry classes are partially flipped, while  her advanced placement chemistry class is completely flipped. Her  students use livescribes and a livebinder to retrieve background  information before coming to class to discuss assignments. This allows  more time in class for them to complete individual hands-on activities,  laboratories, and cooperative learning activities.   Lenora was excited to receive the Teacher of the Year recognition,  saying she has been waiting for a long time, but stated in her  acceptance speech she knew this would happen on God's timing, not her  own. Her faith plays a key role when it comes to teaching. She has been  with the Washington County School District for 12 years.   I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Lenora for all of the  hard work she does for her students. I extend my best wishes to her and  look forward to hearing of her future endeavors.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I honor Joan Kennett, the  Walton County Teacher of the Year from South Walton High School in  Santa Rosa Beach, FL.   Joan was in shock and humbled after she was named Teacher of the  Year. She considers it an honor and privilege to represent every  teacher and student in Walton County. She is a mentor to other teachers  and an advocate for developing best classroom practices.   In the spring of 2017, Joan's students scored 97 percent and ranked  fifth Statewide on the biology State test. She has also been awarded  grants from Walton Education Foundation and the National Defense  Industrial Association ACCELerator Program to enrich students in  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.   Besides helping her students in the classroom, Joan also assists with  various school organizations. Joan motivates student leaders within the  school and community as the Student Government Association sponsor and  helps with projects such as the Senior Citizen Prom.   Joan earned her bachelor of science degree from Kennesaw State  College and received her gifted credentials from West Georgia State  College. She has taught in Georgia, Indiana, and Florida, and has now  taught biology for 27 years, with 5 years at South Walton High School.   I congratulate Joan for receiving this important recognition after  decades of teaching. I express my best wishes to her and look forward  to hearing of her continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I honor Amanda McGhee, the  Calhoun County Teacher of the Year from Blountstown High School in  Blountstown, FL.   As a teenager, Amanda felt that high school was a place with caring  teachers who took the time to teach the content while maintaining  discipline and, at the same time, asking about your sick brother or  sister at home. She thought these teachers seemed to know everything  about their students and admired their notion to care for students.   She is inspired every day to bring this same feeling of  connectedness, hope, and a passion for learning to her students. She  seeks to pass along what was given to her and seeks to validate, teach,  and inspire the next generation.   Amanda's colleagues say she teaches her students the foundational  skills and then acts as a facilitator that nurtures their ideas to  create video game apps, build robots, create videos, use 3D printers,  and fly drones to record video. She also teaches her students  strategies for critical thinking and involves them in project-based  learning that allows them to apply their mathematical skills.   Amanda has been a teacher at Blountstown High School for more than 10  years. Currently, she teaches advanced placement science, along with  experimental science, digital media, and aerospace technologies in  conjunction with Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.   I would like to thank Amanda for her hard work to provide students  with a successful learning environment. I extend my best wishes to her  and look forward to hearing of her continued success in the coming  years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I honor Lynn Mongiardini, the  Charlotte County Teacher of the Year from Sallie Jones Elementary  School in Punta Gorda, FL.   Lynn received the Teacher of the Year award because of her dedication  [[Page S2619]]  to her students to equip them with the necessary skills needed to  achieve success in both the classroom and real world. She is a member  of the district core team responsible for the roll out of the  comprehensive literacy framework. Her passion is finding ways to  improve students' thinking around academic and social challenges by  actively contributing to the growth mindset in professional learning  communities and its philosophies.   As both a parent and a teacher, Lynn understands the needs of her  students and their families. She uses this understanding to create a  nurturing classroom environment that fosters the highest level of  learning.   Lynn has been teaching in Charlotte County schools since 2006. She  has served as an educator for the second, third, and fifth grades at  Peace River Elementary, Myakka River Elementary, and currently at  Sallie Jones Elementary School.   I extend my best wishes to Lynn for her hard work and dedication to  her students and look forward to hearing of her continued success in  the upcoming years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I honor Martin O'Hora, the  Highlands County Teacher of the Year from Avon Park High School in Avon  Park, FL.   Martin says he has always wanted to be a teacher thanks to his  parents, who served as teachers for more than 30 years. Their  dedication to teaching helped guide him to becoming a teacher himself,  and he knew how important it is for students to have a positive  influence in their lives.   Martin's colleagues and students attest to his commitment as a  teacher and coach by noting he is someone they can always come to for  advice and help. Martin received this important recognition because he  fulfills and exceeds all that is expected from teachers.   Martin has been at Avon Park High School since 2014, teaching  exceptional student education and algebra before his current resource  position at the school, while also coaching the boys basketball team.  He started teaching in the district in 2011 at Hill-Gustate Middle  School.   I would like to extend my best wishes to Martin for his hard work and  look forward to hearing of his continued success in the years  ahead.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Sarah Anne  Elizabeth Oravec, the DeSoto County Teacher of the Year from Arcadia,  FL.   Sarah received the Teacher of the Year award for her exemplary  enthusiasm, innovative teaching approaches, and genuine concern for  education.   Her dedication to achieving excellence has earned her an enviable  reputation as an excellent teacher and coach who truly cares about  people and is generous with her time. Sarah demonstrates the highest  level of professional commitment and competency in her work with  students and colleagues.   Sarah has been a valued teacher in the DeSoto school district for  more than 3 years and 5 months as the District ESOL Instructional  Coach. Her positive attitude, hard work, and respect for children is a  true asset to DeSoto County.   I would like to express my sincere appreciation to Sarah and look  forward to hearing of her continued success in the years ahead.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I commend Catherine Tinsley  Peel, the Holmes County Teacher of the Year from Ponce de Leon  Elementary School in Ponce de Leon, FL.   After Catherine won the Teacher of the Year award, she noted that,  when new challenges arise daily in the educational field, she  approaches them with excitement and suspense. She has a passion to help  students in her hometown to become the best academically and socially.   Knowing she can help students inspired her to become a teacher, and  each time she receives a handwritten note, card, or illustration saying  they appreciate her, she considered it proof that she is doing her job  correctly. While teaching requires many demands, she would not trade it  for anything because she gets to make a difference in children's daily  lives.   Catherine is a fourth grade teacher at Ponce de Leon Elementary  school. She is a Ponce de Leon High School alumni who has taught first  and third grades, but has now found her home teaching fourth grade.   I congratulate Catherine for her hard work and commitment to teaching  her students. I express my best wishes to her and look forward to  hearing of her future endeavors.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I commend Heather Phillips,  the Okaloosa County Teacher of the Year from Bluewater Elementary  School in Niceville, FL.   Heather knows that being an educator is never predictable, and she  thrives on the ever-changing nature of her profession. Heather was  humbled to be considered among such an immensely talented group of  educators and considers it an honor to represent her school, and  district, as its Teacher of the Year.   She loves seeing the world through the eyes of children and allows  their energy to influence her focus on what truly matters. Her teaching  experiences in Japan and Hong Kong helped her appreciate diversity, and  she works to implement these experiences in the classroom.   Heather is a 15-year educator who currently teaches fourth grade. She  is an active member of her church in Niceville and enjoys being part of  the community.   I am pleased to congratulate Heather for her dedication to teaching  her students. I extend my best wishes to Heather and look forward to  learning of her continued success in her future endeavors.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I honor Chelsea Smith, the  Hamilton County Teacher of the Year from Hamilton County Elementary  School in Jasper, FL.   Chelsea believes it is important to show her students that she cares  about them being successful as individuals. Her students come to her  from various socioeconomic backgrounds and academic capabilities, but  they all seek success.   According to Chelsea, her educational philosophy is based on teaching  students to learn how to deal with frustrations in order to break the  learning barrier. Her students can then work on academically improving  oneself to become proficient. Implementation of enrichment  opportunities should be incorporated to challenge students once they  have achieved mastery of grade level skills.   Chelsea says each student has a different mindset for what success  means. It is her responsibility to seek out the individual and  determine what he or she needs in order to be triumphant. Her students  begin class by knowing they will search for whatever opportunity  today's class will bring in order to achieve individual success. Every  day, once all students are in her classroom, she counts to three, and  they recite the quote: I am important. I am intelligent. I will do my  best. I will seek opportunity over obligation.   Chelsea has a bachelor's of science degree in elementary education  and a master of education degree in education leadership education and  training management/instructional technology. She has taught fifth or  sixth grade since 2013.   I am pleased to recognize Chelsea for her dedication to providing her  students with the opportunity to be successful. I extend my best wishes  to her and look forward to hearing of her continued success.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I honor 1SG Terry Walker, the  Jefferson County Teacher of the Year from Jefferson K-12 Somerset  School in Monticello, FL.   Terry has been a valued member of the Jefferson County School  District for 9 years as the Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps  instructor. He is a  [[Page S2620]]  favorite among students and staff because he leads by example. His  students trust his judgement and know he is someone that is dedicated  to guiding them through school.   Terry's students respect him for the type of mindset he brings to the  classroom. Those who have spent time with Terry describe him as a  teacher who is dedicated to making sure his students reach their full  potential, whether with the JROTC or in their academic careers. Terry's  colleagues and students are proud to have him represent both Jefferson  County and Jefferson K-12 Somerset School as Teacher of the Year.   I am pleased to extend my best wishes to Terry for the dedication he  has shown to his students and look forward to hearing of his continued  success in the years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, when the story of the 21st century is  written, there will be a couple chapters about Vladimir Putin's Russia,  most certainly chapters about radical jihadists, and perhaps a few  chapters on some other things we have yet to fully anticipate.   There still remains over 80 years in this century, but there is no  doubt that the vast majority of the story about the 21st century will  be about the relationship between the United States and China. China-- the most populous nation on Earth, the second largest economy, and soon  to be the largest economy on the planet--is a country that cannot be  contained. It will be a major factor, both economically and  geopolitically, as it should be for a nation of that magnitude and a  culture that deep, with such long history. However, there are  imbalances developing in that relationship, which I believe are  threatening, not just to our Nation but ultimately to the peace and  security and the stability of the world.   It is on that topic I wanted to come to the floor and speak today and  perhaps about some of the things we need to do about it. There was a  consensus--which I would admit I, perhaps, from time to time, was a  partaker in--that China was a country that would, eventually, as it  grew more prosperous, become not just more democratic but more willing  to live by the rules the world has conducted itself by since the end of  the Second World War.   Perhaps I wasn't as strong an adherent to that as some others. I have  always been, of course, deeply suspicious of communism and autocratic  nations, but there was still the belief that things could work out,  and, eventually, at some point, both demographics and economics would  force China to accept the benefits and the wisdom of a global economic  order that has maintained the peace since the end of the Second World  War.   That was a terrible mistake. For, in fact, that is not how it has  played out. For the better part of 30 years now, China has been allowed  to systemically violate all of the rules of fair play in trade and  commerce under the guise of saying, eventually, they are going to come  around and behave. Not only has it not worked, it has allowed them to  accelerate their economic growth to the detriment of American workers,  American industry, and economies all over the world.   Today, China is 3 years into a plan called Made in China 2025. What  ``Made in China'' means, and what it is all about, is China intends to  be the dominant power and dominate 10 key sectors of the future  economy. They outline what all 10 of those are.   Now, if that dominance was the result of being more innovative or  spending more money on research or just being better, then we would  have little to complain about. It would be on us to become more  innovative ourselves and put more money into research and technology  and these sorts of things. That is not what it is the product of. It  [[Page S2626]]  is the product of cheating. It is the massive theft of intellectual  property--the largest single transfer of wealth in the history of  mankind stolen; stolen because they buy small companies that are  developing some key component in a broader technology, and they take it  for themselves; stolen because when an American company or any foreign  company, for that matter, wants to do business in China and have access  to their 1.4 billion people, you have to partner with them. They make  you partner with a Chinese company. Your ``partner'' steals your  secrets and then they kick you out and now they are your competitor.   So think about it. They are able to make all of these advances  without paying for them. Imagine if you had a business that was able to  grow without having to pay for all the research that went to getting  you to that point. This is what they do. It has allowed them to expand  militarily, commercially, and economically to the point where we are at  the edge of a very dangerous economic and geopolitical imbalance that  needs to be addressed. It needs to be addressed now. We are almost out  of time because 5 years from now, 6 years from now, or 3 years from  now, it may be too late to address this.   I want to reiterate what I said at the outset. This is not about  containing China, nor is it about crippling China. It is about ensuring  that we are going to have stability in the world; a stability in which  our companies and their companies can partner, but they need to do so  voluntarily; a stability where they cannot steal our secrets; a  stability where they cannot violate the rules of trade but benefit from  the rules of trade.   That is what I hope to address through a new bill called the Fair  Trade With China Enforcement Act, which I am introducing today. The  first problem we want to address is that China is building its  industrial capacity with U.S. intellectual property and technology.   I have highlighted how they steal our technology and our intellectual  property, and they use it. As an example, General Electric and  Honeywell technology is being used in China by one of GE's and  Honeywell's competitors. They didn't sell it to them. It was stolen  from them. Two American companies had their secrets stolen, and now  their competitor in China is using their technology that they spent  money and time investing in.   The solution to that problem is to pass a law that prohibits the sale  of national security-sensitive technology and intellectual property to  China. The bill would do this by directing the Department of Commerce  to use its export control authority to block military capacity exports  and components of Made in China 2025 exports to China.   So, basically, the Department of Commerce would look at Made in China  2025. These are the sectors they are trying to dominate, and we would  prohibit the sale or the transfer of intellectual property sensitive to  those industries. That means American companies--even if they have a  partnership with China--would be prohibited by law in sharing this  information with them willingly.   The second problem we have, frankly, is here at home. We have these  large multinational U.S. companies that have very valuable intellectual  property and technology that partner with Chinese firms. They know  their intellectual property is going to be stolen, but they don't care.  They don't care, No. 1, because they are not going to pay the full cost  of the loss of this intellectual property. It is going to be borne by  the entire country.   A great example of that would be a CEO or business executive who  knows they are only going to be at the company for x number of years.  They make the decision: I don't care if they are going to steal our  intellectual property. I want to have access to the Chinese market  because it is 1.4 billion people. That is going to allow us to sell a  bunch of stuff there. Our profits will go up. I am going to look good  in the quarterly reports and look good before the board of directors.  Who cares if this harms the United States? My obligation is to the  corporation and not the country.   That is their view. In fact, many of these CEOs of large  multinational companies consider themselves to be citizens of the world  before they consider themselves to be citizens of the United States.  They are willing to turn these things over because by the time we are  hurt by it as a nation, they are long gone; by the time they are hurt  by it as a company, they are long gone, but they are going to have some  pretty good quarters as they expand into the largest market in the  world, and their shareholders and board of directors are going to be  very happy about it.   That is a big problem. Just because a company has their address in  the United States, does not mean they consider themselves to be  American companies. Of course, this is a big problem among many large  multinational corporations that are doing business there and know  exactly what is going on but are more interested in the short-term  profits than the impact on our national security.   The solution I propose to that problem in this law is to increase  taxes on multinational corporations on the income they earn in China.  The tax would be increased equal to the amount of the lost value of the  stolen intellectual property or technology. So if we lost $1 billion,  there would be a $1 billion increase in that business's profit that  they made in China through that partnership.   It does this by imposing a tax rate of 2 percent--roughly equal to  what the Trade Representative's office estimates is the cost of lost  intellectual property as a percent of total corporate profits in China.   The third problem we have is that China--and I mean China, both its  sovereign wealth management and individuals who made a lot of money,  directed by the government, in many cases--has gone on a buying spree  of U.S. debt--meaning Treasurys, stocks, and even real estate. My  hometown of Miami is one of the places being heavily invested in now to  increase their trade surplus and to weaken the U.S. economy.   You say how? Let me give you an example. After China rose to the  World Trade Organization, it had all this excess capital resulting from  its large surpluses. That drove them to take that excess capital they  were making now that they were part of the WTO and invest it in the  United States in real estate, for example. Here you have people coming  in and paying for real estate above the value of the property, driving  up prices. It is one of the things that helped fuel the housing  bubble. You can only imagine that if the property next door, the  building next door, or the luxury condominium units next door are sold  at a price higher than what the asking price might be, you are driving  up the market for everyone. But they do this over and over again. This  cheap financing of our debt, this buying up so many of our Treasury  notes because there is such demand for our debt, our yield--the amount  of interest we pay back to the investor--is lower. The result is it is  one of the things that has driven our national debt here. It has been  easy to borrow because it has been cheap.    What is the solution? The solution is to update the income tax treaty  that was signed in the 1980s and that taxes China's profits on these  investments, including their holdings of the national debt at a  preferential rate for what it would be for anybody else.   What my law would do is make withholding taxes on China's investment  income revert to what the law is for everyone else. For example, the  U.S. payor would withhold the greater amount of tax on distributions to  Chinese payees, so whatever income they are making from the debt, from  the stocks, from the assets they bought in the United States and they  have invested in--whatever they are making on it, they would pay taxes  on that income the same as anyone else would, as opposed to under a  preferential rate from the 1980s.   This is important because among the things that all of this surplus  investment does in the United States, it increases the value of the  dollar artificially. They did that when they were manipulating the  currency. The stronger the dollar, the weaker our exports, the more  expensive it is to buy something in the United States than somewhere  else.   The currency fluctuates as a matter of course through economic  engagement. This is the deliberate manipulation of our currency. This  is one of the byproducts of this. Taxing the income  [[Page S2627]]  they make on those investments the same as anybody else would have to  pay--and not this preferential rate--would help bring some balance to  that.   One additional problem we want to address is that the Chinese  Government's Made in China 2025 plan is a plan to displace advanced  American manufacturing, and they intend to do that no matter what it  takes. Let me give you an example. Made in China 2025 targets  artificial intelligence and next-generation information technology.  They target robotics. They target new energy vehicles. They target  biotechnology--meaning biopharma, biologics--in terms of curing  disease. They target energy and power generation. They target  aerospace, which is not just airplanes and space travel. They target  high-tech shipping, advanced railway, new material, agricultural  machinery. These advanced, high-tech industries are supposed to be the  competitive advantage of the United States in the 21st century.   What I am talking about is not protectionism. If this were a fair  competition of these technologies versus them, that is what free  markets are supposed to do. That is not how they are doing it. The way  they compete with us in these industries--in addition to stealing our  secrets and buying up the companies that are up in the supply chain--is  to deny our companies access to their markets, but they want full and  unfettered access to ours.   What is the solution? The solution is to prepare duties on and impose  Chinese investor shareholding caps on U.S. companies producing goods  targeted by Made in China 2025. This bill would do this by defining  Made in China 2025 as a countervailable subsidy for American industries  affected by Made in China 2025 exports, thus reducing future demand for  Chinese exports in these industries.   We have to raise the prices of the products they are stealing from  us; otherwise, they will put our industries out of business, and our  children will live in a world where we depend on China for artificial  intelligence, for robotics, for new energy vehicles, for aerospace, for  biopharma.   Can you imagine living in a world where the cure to Alzheimer's is  controlled by Chinese pharmaceutical companies--the amount of leverage  it would give them geopolitically? If they reach that plateau because  they outhustle us, that is one thing. But to get there by stealing what  we produce, by denying our companies the ability to sell over there but  asking us to allow their companies to sell here--that is not  competition; that is theft. That is an imbalance that needs to be  addressed.   We will also have the SEC block any majority stake acquisition of a  listed company producing the component goods in any of these  industries--the Made in China 2025 exports--in order to limit their  ability to buy up our small companies or buy up enough of a controlling  interest in American companies to take them from us. That is the other  strategy they have. They go into industries that go under the threshold  of what the government looks into, and they buy up percentages of the  company or the entire company itself. Then they control what is  supposedly an American company, and they own it. Try doing that in  China if you are an American.   The argument that we should continue to allow them to do it because  they are a developing industry is ridiculous. No one can make that  argument anymore. That is the argument that has been made for all of  these years.   There is one last thing we need to do, and it has been on the news a  lot lately. The Chinese have tried in the United States and around the  world to use their companies involved in telecommunications,  particularly Huwawei and ZTE, to infiltrate U.S. networks. Basically  how that works is they wanted us to buy components, parts, and  equipment from Huwawei and use it for our cell phone networks, our  internet networks, our servers and routers--put those in our country.  If you are a country that, as a matter of geopolitical strategy,  steals--not just spies as normal countries do, but steals intellectual  property and corporate secrets to build your economy at the expense of  someone else's and you control the routers and the telecom system or  enough of it in another country, we are just making it easier for you  to steal these things from us.   Imagine a major U.S. university conducting research, and their entire  back office and all of their computer networks in which it is stored  has Huwawei equipment. This would allow the Chinese Government to go  into this equipment and use it remotely to extract all of this  information. They don't even have to send any spies over here because  we have brought them inside. This is a problem across the economy, and  that needs to be dealt with in broader terms.   In this bill--a bill I have separately introduced with Senator  Cotton--we would prohibit the Federal Government or subsidiaries and  contractors of the Federal Government from buying telecommunications  equipment or services from Huwawei or ZTE. What we cannot afford is to  have in our own government--or in companies that are servicing the  government--telecommunications equipment and services vulnerable to  espionage, either corporate or national security.   Let me close with this. There are a lot of big issues going on in the  world, and for a lot of people, including myself, this issue is pretty  new. I have long been concerned about China's military expansion. They  are putting all kinds of missiles now on the islands in the South China  Sea. I most certainly have long been concerned about human rights  violations--what they have done with Tibet and the way they are  bullying people in Taiwan. By the way, just so you know the sort of  influence level they have, Marriott Corporation fired an American  worker--an American living in the United States, working for Marriott,  was fired because they liked a social media post about Tibet. So the  Chinese got mad. They told Marriott: You need to correct this. And they  fired the employee--this American--because he liked a social media post  by mistake about Tibet.   Do you know that United Airlines and American Airlines just got a  letter from the Chinese Government saying: Unless you change your  website so that it says Taiwan-China and not just Taiwan, we are going  to start fining you and may take away your ability to fly into China.  These are American companies that I hope do not give in. This is  happening every single day.   Do you know that Hollywood movies are made so that they will be  allowed to be distributed in China? Hollywood entertainment is  deliberately not making movies or saying certain things in movies-- political things, things that would offend the Chinese Government-- because if they do, they will not let them sell their movies to 1.3,  1.4 billion people. Do you know there are actors, like Richard Gere,  for example, who can't make major movies anymore because they can't be  distributed in China because he is in favor of Tibet and its  independence?   These things are happening, and we are arguing about a bunch of other  silly things. This is historic. This is the single biggest challenge  facing this Nation for the next 20, 30, or 40 years, and we are almost  out of time to take it seriously.   Just a week ago, I traveled to Latin America. I was in Panama, where  the Chinese have built not one but two port facilities on the Panama  Canal. Not surprisingly, because of all this investment, last year  Panama decided to switch. It no longer recognizes Taiwan. It switched  to China. Last week, while I was in Panama, the Dominican Republic  announced they have switched. Little by little they are going and using  their investments in these countries, first just to get them to  derecognize Taiwan but, ultimately, because they are spending so much  money in these countries to leverage them, to align their foreign  policy to China's in our own hemisphere.   We do not want conflict with China. We want parity, stability,  reciprocity, and fairness. That is not what we have right now, and we  have taken far too long to take it seriously. Now is the time to do it.   This is about more than just trade. This is about geopolitics and  national security. It will be the defining issue of the century, and  the time to take it seriously is now.   My bill, which we hope to continue to build on and improve, is our  effort to hopefully begin this dialogue and take steps on this very  important topic.  [[Page S2628]]                                       ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Roberts, Ms. Baldwin, and Ms.          Stabenow):   S. 2830. A bill to reauthorize the rural emergency medical services  training and equipment assistance program under section 330J of the  Public Health Service Act; to the Committee on Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions.    Mr. President, when the story of the 21st century is  written, there will be a couple chapters about Vladimir Putin's Russia,  most certainly chapters about radical jihadists, and perhaps a few  chapters on some other things we have yet to fully anticipate.   There still remains over 80 years in this century, but there is no  doubt that the vast majority of the story about the 21st century will  be about the relationship between the United States and China. China-- the most populous nation on Earth, the second largest economy, and soon  to be the largest economy on the planet--is a country that cannot be  contained. It will be a major factor, both economically and  geopolitically, as it should be for a nation of that magnitude and a  culture that deep, with such long history. However, there are  imbalances developing in that relationship, which I believe are  threatening, not just to our Nation but ultimately to the peace and  security and the stability of the world.   It is on that topic I wanted to come to the floor and speak today and  perhaps about some of the things we need to do about it. There was a  consensus--which I would admit I, perhaps, from time to time, was a  partaker in--that China was a country that would, eventually, as it  grew more prosperous, become not just more democratic but more willing  to live by the rules the world has conducted itself by since the end of  the Second World War.   Perhaps I wasn't as strong an adherent to that as some others. I have  always been, of course, deeply suspicious of communism and autocratic  nations, but there was still the belief that things could work out,  and, eventually, at some point, both demographics and economics would  force China to accept the benefits and the wisdom of a global economic  order that has maintained the peace since the end of the Second World  War.   That was a terrible mistake. For, in fact, that is not how it has  played out. For the better part of 30 years now, China has been allowed  to systemically violate all of the rules of fair play in trade and  commerce under the guise of saying, eventually, they are going to come  around and behave. Not only has it not worked, it has allowed them to  accelerate their economic growth to the detriment of American workers,  American industry, and economies all over the world.   Today, China is 3 years into a plan called Made in China 2025. What  ``Made in China'' means, and what it is all about, is China intends to  be the dominant power and dominate 10 key sectors of the future  economy. They outline what all 10 of those are.   Now, if that dominance was the result of being more innovative or  spending more money on research or just being better, then we would  have little to complain about. It would be on us to become more  innovative ourselves and put more money into research and technology  and these sorts of things. That is not what it is the product of. It  [[Page S2626]]  is the product of cheating. It is the massive theft of intellectual  property--the largest single transfer of wealth in the history of  mankind stolen; stolen because they buy small companies that are  developing some key component in a broader technology, and they take it  for themselves; stolen because when an American company or any foreign  company, for that matter, wants to do business in China and have access  to their 1.4 billion people, you have to partner with them. They make  you partner with a Chinese company. Your ``partner'' steals your  secrets and then they kick you out and now they are your competitor.   So think about it. They are able to make all of these advances  without paying for them. Imagine if you had a business that was able to  grow without having to pay for all the research that went to getting  you to that point. This is what they do. It has allowed them to expand  militarily, commercially, and economically to the point where we are at  the edge of a very dangerous economic and geopolitical imbalance that  needs to be addressed. It needs to be addressed now. We are almost out  of time because 5 years from now, 6 years from now, or 3 years from  now, it may be too late to address this.   I want to reiterate what I said at the outset. This is not about  containing China, nor is it about crippling China. It is about ensuring  that we are going to have stability in the world; a stability in which  our companies and their companies can partner, but they need to do so  voluntarily; a stability where they cannot steal our secrets; a  stability where they cannot violate the rules of trade but benefit from  the rules of trade.   That is what I hope to address through a new bill called the Fair  Trade With China Enforcement Act, which I am introducing today. The  first problem we want to address is that China is building its  industrial capacity with U.S. intellectual property and technology.   I have highlighted how they steal our technology and our intellectual  property, and they use it. As an example, General Electric and  Honeywell technology is being used in China by one of GE's and  Honeywell's competitors. They didn't sell it to them. It was stolen  from them. Two American companies had their secrets stolen, and now  their competitor in China is using their technology that they spent  money and time investing in.   The solution to that problem is to pass a law that prohibits the sale  of national security-sensitive technology and intellectual property to  China. The bill would do this by directing the Department of Commerce  to use its export control authority to block military capacity exports  and components of Made in China 2025 exports to China.   So, basically, the Department of Commerce would look at Made in China  2025. These are the sectors they are trying to dominate, and we would  prohibit the sale or the transfer of intellectual property sensitive to  those industries. That means American companies--even if they have a  partnership with China--would be prohibited by law in sharing this  information with them willingly.   The second problem we have, frankly, is here at home. We have these  large multinational U.S. companies that have very valuable intellectual  property and technology that partner with Chinese firms. They know  their intellectual property is going to be stolen, but they don't care.  They don't care, No. 1, because they are not going to pay the full cost  of the loss of this intellectual property. It is going to be borne by  the entire country.   A great example of that would be a CEO or business executive who  knows they are only going to be at the company for x number of years.  They make the decision: I don't care if they are going to steal our  intellectual property. I want to have access to the Chinese market  because it is 1.4 billion people. That is going to allow us to sell a  bunch of stuff there. Our profits will go up. I am going to look good  in the quarterly reports and look good before the board of directors.  Who cares if this harms the United States? My obligation is to the  corporation and not the country.   That is their view. In fact, many of these CEOs of large  multinational companies consider themselves to be citizens of the world  before they consider themselves to be citizens of the United States.  They are willing to turn these things over because by the time we are  hurt by it as a nation, they are long gone; by the time they are hurt  by it as a company, they are long gone, but they are going to have some  pretty good quarters as they expand into the largest market in the  world, and their shareholders and board of directors are going to be  very happy about it.   That is a big problem. Just because a company has their address in  the United States, does not mean they consider themselves to be  American companies. Of course, this is a big problem among many large  multinational corporations that are doing business there and know  exactly what is going on but are more interested in the short-term  profits than the impact on our national security.   The solution I propose to that problem in this law is to increase  taxes on multinational corporations on the income they earn in China.  The tax would be increased equal to the amount of the lost value of the  stolen intellectual property or technology. So if we lost $1 billion,  there would be a $1 billion increase in that business's profit that  they made in China through that partnership.   It does this by imposing a tax rate of 2 percent--roughly equal to  what the Trade Representative's office estimates is the cost of lost  intellectual property as a percent of total corporate profits in China.   The third problem we have is that China--and I mean China, both its  sovereign wealth management and individuals who made a lot of money,  directed by the government, in many cases--has gone on a buying spree  of U.S. debt--meaning Treasurys, stocks, and even real estate. My  hometown of Miami is one of the places being heavily invested in now to  increase their trade surplus and to weaken the U.S. economy.   You say how? Let me give you an example. After China rose to the  World Trade Organization, it had all this excess capital resulting from  its large surpluses. That drove them to take that excess capital they  were making now that they were part of the WTO and invest it in the  United States in real estate, for example. Here you have people coming  in and paying for real estate above the value of the property, driving  up prices. It is one of the things that helped fuel the housing  bubble. You can only imagine that if the property next door, the  building next door, or the luxury condominium units next door are sold  at a price higher than what the asking price might be, you are driving  up the market for everyone. But they do this over and over again. This  cheap financing of our debt, this buying up so many of our Treasury  notes because there is such demand for our debt, our yield--the amount  of interest we pay back to the investor--is lower. The result is it is  one of the things that has driven our national debt here. It has been  easy to borrow because it has been cheap.    What is the solution? The solution is to update the income tax treaty  that was signed in the 1980s and that taxes China's profits on these  investments, including their holdings of the national debt at a  preferential rate for what it would be for anybody else.   What my law would do is make withholding taxes on China's investment  income revert to what the law is for everyone else. For example, the  U.S. payor would withhold the greater amount of tax on distributions to  Chinese payees, so whatever income they are making from the debt, from  the stocks, from the assets they bought in the United States and they  have invested in--whatever they are making on it, they would pay taxes  on that income the same as anyone else would, as opposed to under a  preferential rate from the 1980s.   This is important because among the things that all of this surplus  investment does in the United States, it increases the value of the  dollar artificially. They did that when they were manipulating the  currency. The stronger the dollar, the weaker our exports, the more  expensive it is to buy something in the United States than somewhere  else.   The currency fluctuates as a matter of course through economic  engagement. This is the deliberate manipulation of our currency. This  is one of the byproducts of this. Taxing the income  [[Page S2627]]  they make on those investments the same as anybody else would have to  pay--and not this preferential rate--would help bring some balance to  that.   One additional problem we want to address is that the Chinese  Government's Made in China 2025 plan is a plan to displace advanced  American manufacturing, and they intend to do that no matter what it  takes. Let me give you an example. Made in China 2025 targets  artificial intelligence and next-generation information technology.  They target robotics. They target new energy vehicles. They target  biotechnology--meaning biopharma, biologics--in terms of curing  disease. They target energy and power generation. They target  aerospace, which is not just airplanes and space travel. They target  high-tech shipping, advanced railway, new material, agricultural  machinery. These advanced, high-tech industries are supposed to be the  competitive advantage of the United States in the 21st century.   What I am talking about is not protectionism. If this were a fair  competition of these technologies versus them, that is what free  markets are supposed to do. That is not how they are doing it. The way  they compete with us in these industries--in addition to stealing our  secrets and buying up the companies that are up in the supply chain--is  to deny our companies access to their markets, but they want full and  unfettered access to ours.   What is the solution? The solution is to prepare duties on and impose  Chinese investor shareholding caps on U.S. companies producing goods  targeted by Made in China 2025. This bill would do this by defining  Made in China 2025 as a countervailable subsidy for American industries  affected by Made in China 2025 exports, thus reducing future demand for  Chinese exports in these industries.   We have to raise the prices of the products they are stealing from  us; otherwise, they will put our industries out of business, and our  children will live in a world where we depend on China for artificial  intelligence, for robotics, for new energy vehicles, for aerospace, for  biopharma.   Can you imagine living in a world where the cure to Alzheimer's is  controlled by Chinese pharmaceutical companies--the amount of leverage  it would give them geopolitically? If they reach that plateau because  they outhustle us, that is one thing. But to get there by stealing what  we produce, by denying our companies the ability to sell over there but  asking us to allow their companies to sell here--that is not  competition; that is theft. That is an imbalance that needs to be  addressed.   We will also have the SEC block any majority stake acquisition of a  listed company producing the component goods in any of these  industries--the Made in China 2025 exports--in order to limit their  ability to buy up our small companies or buy up enough of a controlling  interest in American companies to take them from us. That is the other  strategy they have. They go into industries that go under the threshold  of what the government looks into, and they buy up percentages of the  company or the entire company itself. Then they control what is  supposedly an American company, and they own it. Try doing that in  China if you are an American.   The argument that we should continue to allow them to do it because  they are a developing industry is ridiculous. No one can make that  argument anymore. That is the argument that has been made for all of  these years.   There is one last thing we need to do, and it has been on the news a  lot lately. The Chinese have tried in the United States and around the  world to use their companies involved in telecommunications,  particularly Huwawei and ZTE, to infiltrate U.S. networks. Basically  how that works is they wanted us to buy components, parts, and  equipment from Huwawei and use it for our cell phone networks, our  internet networks, our servers and routers--put those in our country.  If you are a country that, as a matter of geopolitical strategy,  steals--not just spies as normal countries do, but steals intellectual  property and corporate secrets to build your economy at the expense of  someone else's and you control the routers and the telecom system or  enough of it in another country, we are just making it easier for you  to steal these things from us.   Imagine a major U.S. university conducting research, and their entire  back office and all of their computer networks in which it is stored  has Huwawei equipment. This would allow the Chinese Government to go  into this equipment and use it remotely to extract all of this  information. They don't even have to send any spies over here because  we have brought them inside. This is a problem across the economy, and  that needs to be dealt with in broader terms.   In this bill--a bill I have separately introduced with Senator  Cotton--we would prohibit the Federal Government or subsidiaries and  contractors of the Federal Government from buying telecommunications  equipment or services from Huwawei or ZTE. What we cannot afford is to  have in our own government--or in companies that are servicing the  government--telecommunications equipment and services vulnerable to  espionage, either corporate or national security.   Let me close with this. There are a lot of big issues going on in the  world, and for a lot of people, including myself, this issue is pretty  new. I have long been concerned about China's military expansion. They  are putting all kinds of missiles now on the islands in the South China  Sea. I most certainly have long been concerned about human rights  violations--what they have done with Tibet and the way they are  bullying people in Taiwan. By the way, just so you know the sort of  influence level they have, Marriott Corporation fired an American  worker--an American living in the United States, working for Marriott,  was fired because they liked a social media post about Tibet. So the  Chinese got mad. They told Marriott: You need to correct this. And they  fired the employee--this American--because he liked a social media post  by mistake about Tibet.   Do you know that United Airlines and American Airlines just got a  letter from the Chinese Government saying: Unless you change your  website so that it says Taiwan-China and not just Taiwan, we are going  to start fining you and may take away your ability to fly into China.  These are American companies that I hope do not give in. This is  happening every single day.   Do you know that Hollywood movies are made so that they will be  allowed to be distributed in China? Hollywood entertainment is  deliberately not making movies or saying certain things in movies-- political things, things that would offend the Chinese Government-- because if they do, they will not let them sell their movies to 1.3,  1.4 billion people. Do you know there are actors, like Richard Gere,  for example, who can't make major movies anymore because they can't be  distributed in China because he is in favor of Tibet and its  independence?   These things are happening, and we are arguing about a bunch of other  silly things. This is historic. This is the single biggest challenge  facing this Nation for the next 20, 30, or 40 years, and we are almost  out of time to take it seriously.   Just a week ago, I traveled to Latin America. I was in Panama, where  the Chinese have built not one but two port facilities on the Panama  Canal. Not surprisingly, because of all this investment, last year  Panama decided to switch. It no longer recognizes Taiwan. It switched  to China. Last week, while I was in Panama, the Dominican Republic  announced they have switched. Little by little they are going and using  their investments in these countries, first just to get them to  derecognize Taiwan but, ultimately, because they are spending so much  money in these countries to leverage them, to align their foreign  policy to China's in our own hemisphere.   We do not want conflict with China. We want parity, stability,  reciprocity, and fairness. That is not what we have right now, and we  have taken far too long to take it seriously. Now is the time to do it.   This is about more than just trade. This is about geopolitics and  national security. It will be the defining issue of the century, and  the time to take it seriously is now.   My bill, which we hope to continue to build on and improve, is our  effort to hopefully begin this dialogue and take steps on this very  important topic.
