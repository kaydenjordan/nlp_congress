 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, today, we will  vote to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, one of the most  important bills in history to protect women and girls.   This photograph is of then-Senator Joe Biden, myself, and other women  leaders when we introduced this important bill in 1994. It is still  important. We need to reauthorize it. There is no doubt he will sign it  into law.   We live in a world where 1 in 4 women have experienced sexual  violence. Reauthorizing VAWA is about creating a future where all those  experiencing dating and gender-based violence feel supported to seek  help, and where survivors are given the tools they need to heal. It is  about ensuring a better, safer future for the next generation. I urge a  ``yes'' vote by all of my colleagues.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, there is no time  limit on equality. The equal rights amendment passed the needed 38  States, including the great State of New York. Enough is enough. It is  long past time for women to be in the Constitution.   We may not always be able to control, nor should women's rights be  dependent upon who controls State governments, who is in the White  House or Congress, or who sits on the Supreme Court.   Our rights shouldn't be determined by these types of things. It  should be in the document, the document they interpret and that they  are bound by.   It is long past time to spell out equality in our Constitution with  the ERA.   Unfortunately, we are seeing the effects of gender inequality acutely  during this pandemic. An estimated 1 million more women than men have  lost their jobs, and a disproportionate number of those suffering are  Black women and Latinas.   We need to pass it. It is urgently needed. Let's just imagine if the  ERA had been ratified in the 1970s, as it should have been.   Would we have needed today a dramatic Me Too, Time's Up movement with  hundreds of thousands of women having to tell their often painful  personal stories in order to get justice?   Or would the Violence Against Women Act and other legislation  addressing sexual assault have been passed, if it had been passed much  sooner, without the risk of a Supreme Court ruling limiting a woman's  right to sue? Women could sue directly if they were in the  Constitution.  [[Page H1422]]    We have the opportunity to make equal rights under the law a reality  for our mothers, our daughters, our granddaughters, and ourselves. We  must recognize that there is no time limit on equality and vote to pass  today's resolution now.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs.  Lawrence for her extraordinary leadership.   In 1921, exactly 100 years ago, just after ratifying the 19th  Amendment, the suffragists set their sights on another constitutional  change. The vote was not enough for them. They knew we needed to put  gender equality into our Constitution.   So, these women, among them my relative Alice Paul, wrote the equal  rights amendment. It was first introduced in Congress in 1923 in  celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention, the  first women's rights convention in our country. It was introduced in  the House by Representative Daniel Anthony, nephew of the great  suffragist leader, Susan B. Anthony, to honor her work, as well as the  work of many others, like the great suffrage leader Elizabeth Cady  Stanton, also of New York.   Today, during Women's History Month, we honor these women as  constitution-makers. But verbal praise alone is not enough. We must  also carry out their wishes. Because now, a full 100 years later, the  equal rights amendment is still not part of the U.S. Constitution.   I thank Jackie Speier and all the women and like-minded men in this  Congress that voted to move the equal rights amendment forward.   Eighty-five percent of U.N. member states have constitutions that  explicitly guarantee equality for women and girls. These constitutional  guarantees have enabled national legal reforms that eliminated  discriminatory laws and helped usher in new laws protecting girls and  women. Where once the U.S. was a leader on gender equality, when it  comes to our Constitution, we are now far, far behind.   Today, we must fulfill the hope of our suffragist foremothers and  make equality a reality in our Nation's most fundamental document.   I must say, throughout this struggle I have always said: Where are  the women? When I walk around the Mall, they have museums for  everything, but not women. It is hard to empower women if we don't even  recognize them. So this Women's Caucus put in a bill to create a  national women's museum on the mall. I thought this would be easy. It  took us two decades to finally pass it last year, but it is now going  to be built. It was a priority of this caucus, and we made it happen.  [[Page H1486]]    I just want to close by saying that our Smithsonian Women's History  Museum will inspire visitors of all ages and all genders for  generations to come.   I am so glad to join my colleagues for tonight's Special Order to  celebrate the historical achievements of women and to look forward to  creating a more equal future for all and preserving this history and  the contributions of women in the new Smithsonian women's museum, which  is now going to be built on the mall due to this Congress and this  Women's Caucus.   I thank all of my colleagues that helped this happen and helped the  passage of the ERA today.
