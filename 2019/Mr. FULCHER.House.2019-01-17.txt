 Madam Speaker, I am often asked why I came to Congress,  and I have asked myself that very same question. It is certainly not  for the money, and it is not for the notoriety or the scrutiny that  comes with that.   Ultimately, for me, it comes down to the honorable purpose of  supporting the divinely inspired principles behind our Nation's  founding, being a voice for those unavailable or unable to speak.   There is none more vulnerable or unable to speak than the unborn, and  there is no more noble cause than protecting or promoting life.   Madam Speaker, I stand today, during this week honoring the sanctity  of life, to ask every Member of this body to use any and all influence  to return to our Nation's legal environment that promotes life and to  return to a cultural environment that promotes life as well. Our unborn  would ask the same, if they could.                            ____________________
