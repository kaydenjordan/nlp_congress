 Madam President, first, I want to welcome back all of my  colleagues from the August work period. As we return to Washington, as  everyone knows, the Senate has a very busy schedule ahead of it.   On the nominations front, we will begin this week by holding a  cloture vote on James Kvaal to be the Under Secretary of Education.  Tomorrow, we will move the nominations of David Estudillo to be  district judge of the Western District of Washington, Angel Kelly to  serve as district judge for the District of Massachusetts, and the  Senate will also begin consideration of Veronica Rossman to be the  circuit judge for the Tenth Circuit.   On the legislative front, the Senate will pick up exactly where we  left off last month. We will continue our fight to preserve voting  rights for millions of Americans, and, of course, we will continue  working to pass President Biden's Build Back Better agenda and set our  country on a path to prosperity for decades to come.   At the end of last work period, the Senate took two important steps  to achieving that goal. First, we passed the bipartisan $1 trillion  infrastructure bill that will make historic investments in our Nation's  physical infrastructure.   Second, Senate Democrats came together to pass a budget resolution  with reconciliation instructions that will clear the way to pass a  reconciliation bill with historic and transformative investments in  American jobs, American families, and the fight against climate change.   Over the August State work period, I remained in constant  communication with the chairs of the Senate's relevant committees, as  well as with the Speaker and the White House, including the President.  I am pleased to say we have made substantial progress in translating  provisions of the budget resolution into policies we can pass into law.   As we continue our work over the next few weeks, I want to take a  step back and explain why this legislation is so important.  [[Page S6440]]    For far too long, millions of American families have worried that the  American dream has increasingly fallen out of reach. Too many in the  middle class are just struggling to stay there. Too many who are trying  to get to the middle class find the ladder up steeper and steeper.   Today, the cost of raising a family, saving for college and  retirement, getting a good-paying job and affording healthcare have  become very, very hard. As a result, that sunny American optimism, so  key to our national identity, has been replaced by a growing sourness  and divisiveness in the land. We have to do better, and we will do  better.   With this legislation, we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to  rebuild our economy and rekindle faith in America's future. It will  include the largest tax cut for the middle class in a generation. It  will include provisions that are both critically important and  overwhelmingly popular with the American people, from strengthening  childcare and education to making healthcare more affordable for  millions. And, crucially, it will include unprecedented steps to fight  the climate crisis and preserve our planet for the next generation.   After yet another summer marked by hurricanes, floods, and wildfires,  we cannot hold off on taking action any longer. The world is looking to  us for leadership on climate change. By achieving the emissions goals  Democrats are laying out, we can reassert America's leadership.   And through it all, we are going to make sure that this bill is paid  for and that those at the very top finally pay their fair share.   When this Senate majority began its work many months ago, our  original task was to pass legislation that would get our country out of  the depths of the COVID pandemic. Now, the legislation we will work on  over the next 2 weeks will lay a new foundation for the future of our  economy. It will restore the middle class in the 21st century and give  many more Americans the opportunity to get there. Building ladders to  middle class--that is what this is about, and that is what we are going  to do.   The next few weeks will be crucial to achieving this goal, and I look  forward to working with my colleagues to continue to deliver on our  promise of big, bold change for the American people.   Of course, even as we work to deliver on our Build Back Better  agenda, the House and Senate will also work on other important  priorities that demand immediate attention, including passing a  continuing resolution before the September 30 expiration of government  funding, providing emergency funding to help those devastated by recent  natural disasters, and helping resettle our Afghan allies and partners.  I expect all of this to be done in a bipartisan and timely way.   Of course, over the next few weeks, the House and Senate must also  come together to address the debt ceiling. In America, when it is time  to pay the bills, we follow through on our obligations, without  exception. For a long time, addressing the debt ceiling was considered  a routine and responsible step that both sides worked together to  achieve. Even when President Trump was in office, Democrats worked  three times with Republicans to suspend the debt ceiling because it was  the right and obvious thing to do. We didn't pick excuses and say: Here  is why we don't want to do it. We knew it was important and it was time  to lay aside differences and move it forward.   But now, unfortunately, some of our Republican colleagues--even  though they were eager to have Democrats support them when President  Trump was President--now some of our Republican colleagues are  reportedly contemplating a reckless idea, spearheaded by the Republican  Senator from Wisconsin, to oppose any effort to raise the debt ceiling  whatsoever. And, unfortunately and sadly, the Republican leader seems  to be going along.   Let me be clear: taking the debt hostage and playing games with the  full faith and credit of the United States is reckless, irresponsible,  and will harm every single American. It is a complete nonstarter.   This is not just another political debate. It is about honoring our  unbroken commitment to pay our debts and avoid another financial crisis  at a crucial moment for our country.   Now it is important to remember that this is not about green-lighting  future spending. This is about paying debt from past spending, which  was incurred during the Trump administration and which received  favorable votes from the majority of Republicans and Democrats.   Indeed, it is a new study that came out. According to the nonpartisan  Congressional Research Service, the Trump administration incurred $5.4  trillion in new debt after the debt ceiling was raised in 2019, up  through his last day of office. So all of the new $5 trillion in debt,  bottom line, was caused under the Trump administration, not by  Democratic spending--under the Trump administration, $5.4 trillion from  the last day the debt ceiling was raised in 2019 to the last day of  Trump being in office.   Another report by the Treasury Department further states that, over  the entirety of the Trump administration, that figure rose to as high  as $8 trillion.   Again, let me repeat this so my Republican colleagues hear it loud  and clear. This is not about the Democrats incurring debt. Between the  last time that the debt ceiling was raised in 2019 and the final day of  the Trump administration--nothing to do with Biden or Democrats or  anything in 2021--his administration added more than $5 trillion to the  national debt; and over the 4 years of Donald Trump, new debt totaled  as much as $8 trillion.   So both sides--both sides--have a responsibility to pay our bills.  Both sides, led by the Republican Senate, incurred much of this new  debt. Senators from both parties voted overwhelmingly in support of the  many laws that contributed to this obligation.   In the middle of the COVID pandemic, the Congress came together under  Donald Trump, when Donald Trump was President, to pass successive COVID  relief laws, like the CARES Act, the PPP extension, and the ``908 COVID  deal'' in December. Democrats and Republicans voted in huge numbers in  support of these laws. Republicans voted to make these expenditures.   Now we must come together to do the responsible thing and pay those  bills. Leader McConnell assured the country in 2019, when Donald Trump  was President, that we would ``no doubt [raise the debt ceiling] on a  bipartisan basis.'' Again, that is what McConnell said when Trump was  President: We will ``no doubt [raise the debt ceiling] on a bipartisan  basis.'' He said, when Trump was President, failure to do so would be a  ``disaster.''   Failure to do so now, Leader McConnell, is an equal disaster. It  doesn't matter who is President. We still incurred the bills. So I  believe it should be no different this time around.   The United States has never, ever, defaulted on its debt. I can't  imagine Republicans would want to be responsible for the first-ever  default. We need to work together to raise the debt ceiling and avoid  causing irreparable harm to our economy, still recovering from the  devastation of the pandemic.   I would say to the business community and the financial community,  let Leader McConnell know, stop playing games with the debt ceiling.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on one final issue, on voting.  Before the Senate concluded the previous work period, Republicans  blocked multiple efforts to even debate voting rights legislation in  the U.S. Senate.   Let me be clear: Republicans refusing to support anything on voting  rights is not an excuse for Democrats to do nothing.   Over the recess, a number of my colleagues and I, including Senators  Klobuchar, Merkley, Warnock, Manchin, Padilla, Kaine, King, and Tester,  worked diligently to craft a revised voting rights piece of  legislation.   This compromise proposal would protect the freedom to vote, end  partisan gerrymandering, stop the scourge of dark money in our  politics, among many other good things.   I applaud my colleagues for their hard work and their progress to  come together with a very strong voting rights bill that all Democrats  can support, while respecting the role of States and promoting greater  confidence in our democracy.   Now Senator Manchin has been having discussions with our Republican  [[Page S6441]]  colleagues to try and garner support for this important legislation.  This is a good proposal and I encourage all my Senate colleagues to  support it.   That said, we must be honest about the facts. The Republican-led war  on democracy has only worsened in the last few weeks. Most notably, the  Governor of Texas recently signed into law a vile new voter suppression  bill that ranks as one of the most draconian and undemocratic in living  memory. Meanwhile, partisans across the country are sharpening their  knives for a coming spate of vicious gerrymandering, which further  threatens to divide our politics.   This is unacceptable. So the Senate much must act. I intend to hold a  vote in the Senate as early as next week on voting rights legislation.  Time--time--is of the essence.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in  [[Page S6453]]  a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak therein  for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  September 14; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, and the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day and  morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of morning  business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Kvaal nomination postcloture; further, that all  postcloture time on the Kvaal nomination expire at 11:30 a.m.; that  following the cloture vote on the Estudillo nomination, the Senate  recess until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus meetings; that if  cloture is invoked, at 2:20 p.m., all postcloture time on the Estudillo  nomination expire; that if cloture is invoked on the Kelley nomination,  all postcloture time expire at 5:30 p.m.; finally, that if any of the  nominations are confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action.    Mr. President, for the information of Senators, there  will be two rollcall votes at 11:30 a.m., two rollcall votes at 2:20  p.m., and two rollcall votes at 5:30 p.m.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:31 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, September 14, 2021, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
