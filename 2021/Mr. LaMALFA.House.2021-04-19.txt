 Madam Speaker, I rise out of great concern for the  violence and looting that has taken over Minneapolis. Even more  troubling is the seeming endorsement and, yes, incitement of it by  Members of this body.   It is unconscionable that a Member of Congress sent to Washington to  make the laws that govern our Nation would encourage Americans to  disregard those laws. Yet one of our Democratic colleagues, only one  day after 136 rioters were arrested, called for protesters to ``stay on  the street,'' ``get more active,'' and ``get more confrontational''  against our law enforcement, urging this escalation by asking  protesters to ignore the citywide curfew. Hours later, that inevitable  escalation did occur, with National Guardsmen and police being fired  upon.   These are very dangerous actions. Is this the standard by which we  want this House to represent the people of this country, that  incitement? I recall a lot of talk some months ago about a much lesser  speech being inciteful, language must less geared toward that being  inciteful, yet it happens here.   Strong action needs to be taken by Speaker Pelosi and this House  against these types of words.                            ____________________
