 Mr. Speaker, once again, we have gotten a glimpse into  the dark future Republicans have in store for Americans unless we stop  them.   The Republican-controlled Supreme Court hasn't just stripped women of  the right to determine their own future by overturning Roe v. Wade, but  Justice Clarence Thomas has invited attacks on access to  contraceptives, private intimacy between adults, and marriage equality.   Last week, our House Democratic majority voted to codify Roe v. Wade,  and this week, the House Democratic majority is here to defend your  right to marry who you love. I rise in strong and urgent support of the  Respect for Marriage Act.   Republicans are intent on turning back the clock to create a group of  second-class citizens with limited rights. When they say they want to  send these issues back to the States, that is code for wanting to  ensure that State legislative bodies can eradicate civil rights  protections.   If you think your hard-earned rights are protected, think again,  because Republicans are coming for you. Democrats, however, are with  you.   To the American public, take note of our votes, and who is with you  and who is not.
