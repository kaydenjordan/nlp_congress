 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in opposition to this resolution, and I want to associate  myself with the remarks of the chairman and the ranking member of the  Foreign Affairs Committee.   For all those reasons, we cannot withdraw our 900 troops now because  of what was said about ISIS.   But in addition to that, we are defending the Kurds against certain  slaughter at the hands of the Peshmerga if we were to withdraw our  troops.                                time  1430    The Turks, as we know, are supporting the Peshmerga. In addition to  which, if we were to withdraw our troops, that increases the worry that  Israel has to have about Iran, and that increases the odds of a  conflict between Israel and Iran, which is the last thing the Middle  East needs or the world needs.   For all these reasons, I strongly urge this body to reject this  resolution. We truly should review all of the AUMFs we have lying  around. I didn't know we had one from 1991. This resolution is the  wrong vehicle, and it is productive of chaos and probably slaughter. I,  therefore, oppose it.
