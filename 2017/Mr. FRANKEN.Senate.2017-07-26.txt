 Thank you, Madam President.   Madam President, I rise this evening to speak in opposition to the  Republican plan to dismantle our healthcare system. Their effort to  repeal the Affordable Care Act and gut Medicaid would put the health,  as well as the financial security of millions of Americans, at risk.   Let me tell you how this would affect Minnesotans such as Annie and  her 5-year-old son Carter. Carter has autism spectrum disorder and  relies on Medicaid to help cover necessary therapy services. When  Carter was 2, he did not talk, make eye contact, or interact with  anyone. But now, because of the treatment he receives under Medicaid,  Carter speaks full sentences and is entering kindergarten. Annie  explains how none of that would be possible without Medicaid. If  Republicans succeed in imposing drastic cuts to Medicaid, which is what  they want to do, and States are forced to cut back services, Annie and  her family would not be able to afford the therapy that Carter needs to  thrive.   Think about that. Think about what that does to one life. Think about  the other millions that would be affected in such a negative, tragic  way.   There is also Mari and Chrysann, both from Moorhead, MN. Moorhead is  in northwestern Minnesota, right across the river from Fargo. Mari took  care of her aging mother in her home as long as she could, but when  Chrysann's health began to decline, Mari helped her mom move to a  nursing home where she could access the higher level of care she  needed.   Mari and her husband work full time and still have children at home.  I visited the nursing home where Mari spoke, and she got emotional when  she told me that if it were not for Medicaid, her family would not have  any other way to pay for her mother's care. She does not know how she  would care for her mom or what would happen to her.   Chrysann, Mari's mom, is worried too. She spoke at this roundtable at  the nursing home. She is worried about how the Republican plan will  affect her own future and those of others who are in similar situations  in nursing homes. Sixty-four percent of Americans in nursing homes have  their care paid for by Medicaid. Chrysann told me this  [[Page S4268]]  plan is not about taking care of people but simply about ``survival of  the fittest.''   Is that really the healthcare system we support in the United States  of America--the survival of the fittest?   How about Chuck? Chuck is the CEO of Perham Health. It is a rural  hospital that is doing really innovative work in Northwest Minnesota.  It is kind of central, north. It is in rural Minnesota, not unlike the  rural areas in the Presiding Officer's State.   Chuck told me: ``Cutting Medicaid as drastically as they are  proposing will force us to cut staff in areas that are actually saving  the system money today.''   These cuts would affect nurses who run the hospital's medical homes,  community paramedics, and other staff who are helping to keep people  out of the Emergency Department, reduce readmissions, and keep people  healthy overall. This is part of the innovation they are doing there.  This is part of the innovation that Minnesota leads the Nation in.   Perham Health is one of the largest employers in town so taking away  jobs does not just impact the patients and the hospital, it affects the  community and rural economy. Cutting jobs and getting rid of successful  reforms just does not make sense, and this would be repeated over and  over and over again in rural America.   Again, the question is, Why are Republicans pursuing such a reckless  and irresponsible strategy?   All of the bills they have proposed thus far will increase patient  costs, including premiums and out-of-pocket costs, will increase the  number of uninsured Americans, and will rip apart our healthcare safety  net. These are not the changes Americans want. In fact, this is the  opposite of what Americans want and are asking for.   Now, over the last day, we have heard a lot more about another path  Republicans may pursue--a scaled-back plan that eliminates a handful of  the ACA provisions, including the employer mandate and individual  mandate. While these two changes may be politically expedient, they  would, according to the Congressional Budget Office, drive up premiums  and cause millions of Americans to become uninsured.   What is more, as the New York Times points out, this plan does  nothing to address the criticisms Leader McConnell, President Trump,  and their allies continue to lodge against the Affordable Care Act. For  example, this approach does nothing to improve competition and choice  in the individual market and, in fact, injects far more uncertainty  into individual health insurance markets, which are already rattled by  the administration's deliberate efforts to sabotage them.   Should this plan pass the Senate, it will surely get much worse when  the differences between the plan and the House bill are reconciled in  the conference committee. According to news reports, a number of my  Republican colleagues are arguing that passing this scaled-back version  of repeal is really just a means to get to conference, where Members  can further negotiate the House and Senate repeal and replace bills. In  fact, some are even suggesting that the provisions in the House-passed  bill would be a guidepost for negotiations.   I think all of us remember how awful, far-reaching, and--according to  President Trump--mean the House-passed bill is. What is more, we can  see the worst provisions of the Better Care Reconciliation Act  resurface in the conference committee, which is the Senate repeal and  replace bill that was defeated on a bipartisan basis.   Overall, pursuing this path is dangerous, given the tremendous number  of unknowns. Not only would this half-baked--that is being generous-- quarter-baked, scaled-back version of the ACA repeal destabilize health  insurance markets, but it would also serve as a vehicle for Republicans  to take up the most controversial measures included in the defeated  BCRA and the House-passed bill.   Why on Earth would we support that?   Frankly, it is also delusional to believe that a small group of House  and Senate leaders can craft a workable solution in a matter of days or  weeks. They have had 7 years to come up with an alternative. They do  not have one so how can we expect them to, all of a sudden, come up  with a viable plan that affects one-sixth of our economy?   Look, this whole process has been and continues to be irresponsible.  In fact, this is one of the most irresponsible policymaking processes I  have seen in my time in the U.S. Senate. What we should do is just what  Senator McCain called for in his speech yesterday, which is to pursue  regular order, work together--Republicans and Democrats--and seek out  compromise. If we reject this wrongheaded effort, then I and many of my  colleagues are ready and committed to work in a bipartisan way on  reforms that will expand coverage, lower costs, and improve care.   Let's have bipartisan hearings on the individual market, on drug  prices, and more. Let's call in nonpartisan expert witnesses. Let's  have meaningful committee and floor debates. Let's fix what needs  fixing in the Affordable Care Act. Annie, Carter, Mari, Chrysann,  Chuck, and millions of other Americans need us to do just that.   To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, please, stand up to  the bullying, stand up to the lies, and work with us to improve  people's lives, not make them worse. Paul Wellstone said that politics  is not about winning, that it is not about power, that it is not about  money. Politics is about working to improve people's lives, and that is  what we should be doing. You owe it to your constituents. You owe it to  yourselves.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
