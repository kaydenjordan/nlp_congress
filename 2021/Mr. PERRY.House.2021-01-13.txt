 Madam Speaker, what did the Speaker know, and what did  other legislative leaders know, and when did they know it? Maybe that  is a rush to impeach the President so we will never know what  legislative leaders here knew.   The FBI knew about a number of individuals that were planning a war  on the Capitol, including killing police officers, and they shared the  information. But nothing happened.   The chief Federal prosecutor in Washington stated he is pursuing  conspiracy charges. The fact that IEDs were constructed and placed  informs me that there was preplanning for portions of the tragic events  last week.   How does the President incite an attack that was preplanned and  already underway before his speech concluded?   Now, I know my colleagues on the left want America to believe that  the President incited a spontaneous riot that they would like to call  an insurrection, but the facts are stubborn things, even if you choose  to ignore them.   The truth is the multiple lawless and violent events last summer,  including a months-long siege of a Federal courthouse, burning,  looting, physical violence in so-called sanctuary cities, more closely  fits the definition of insurrection than anything the President said  last week.
