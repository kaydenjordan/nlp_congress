 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last week, Putin again invaded the  sovereign territory of a neighboring country. Sadly, it was long clear  that attempts to invoke genteel international norms would not move this  self-styled czar.   Putin only cares about norms insofar as he wants to rewrite them. He  only cares about the peaceful international order insofar as he wants  to disrupt it.   Like his Soviet predecessors, Putin has always rejected the postwar  order that held up states' sovereignty and territorial integrity as  sacrosanct. Putin and Xi of China both want to replace this peaceful  order with spheres of influence.   They want to bend other countries to their will and redraw borders by  force. Make no mistake, this crisis does not and will not end with  Ukraine. And the reason isn't simply that appetites grow with eating.  Confrontation with the West is Putin's main objective.   He wants to restore the Russian empire. He said explicitly, he wants  NATO rolled back to its 1997 borders. We have a dictator trying to  dismember a U.S. partner, trying to decapitate its democratically  elected government.   Does anybody really think it stops here? Does anybody think that  Europe, or for that matter, Taiwan, will be safe if the world lets this  stand?   We will only deter further Russian and Chinese aggression if Putin is  made to pay a significant price. Massive and sustained sanctions that  undermine his ability to wage war, now and into the future, will be  necessary.   But sanctions alone will not suffice. Russia has massive currency  reserves. It has options to blunt economic pain and to impose  countercosts on America and our partners, at least in the near term.  The sanctions that would hurt Moscow the most would also have a  significant impact on our friends in Europe. So there will continue to  be resistance to maximalist sanctions.   To date, the Biden administration has sent mixed messages about its  own sanctions policy. For months, we heard that prospective sanctions  were being drafted to deter Putin's aggression. But last week, the  President said he and his advisers never thought sanctions would deter  Russia. Now, they are finally imposing sanctions but short of  everything that is available.   So to what end exactly? What is the administration's coherent plan? I  believe we should have used more of these tools prior to this brutal  escalation to deter Putin and to weaken his capacity to wage war. Now,  we must use these tools aggressively to impose massive costs for  Putin's aggression, to demonstrate to other aggressors that we mean  business, and to degrade Putin's longer-term ability to threaten NATO  and compete with the West.   But ultimately, sanctions are no substitute for military power. They  are no substitute for the steps we must take  [[Page S818]]  to help Ukraine now and to defend ourselves in the future. Moscow and  Beijing will only be deterred from aggression if they see concretely  that military force cannot achieve their objectives and the cost of  military aggression will be too high.   In the immediate term, we must ensure the Ukrainians can adequately  defend themselves and impose costs on Russia that prove prohibitive.  The administration brags about giving $650 million to Ukraine last  year, but the manner in which it did so deserves scrutiny.   When Putin built up forces along Ukraine's border last spring, the  Biden administration delayed an arms assistance package, literally, for  months.   A headline from last June read: ``White House freezes Ukraine  military package that includes lethal weapons.''   Even as Putin began directly threatening Ukraine last fall, an  assistance package languished for weeks at the White House before it  was approved. This weekend, the administration rushed to announce  another $350 million in military assistance. For which weapons? On what  timeline? And how will the weapons reach the brave Ukrainians who have  lost ground?   So Congress must use its oversight tools to ensure we are providing  Ukraine the weapons it needs as quickly as possible. The same goes for  helping to shore up our NATO allies' defenses along the eastern flank.  And we need to identify what shortfalls, redtape, and limiting factors  have slowed our assistance, so we are better prepared to help the next  partner in need.   As I have warned repeatedly, we cannot afford to move at the speed of  bureaucracy.   Beyond the immediate crisis in Ukraine, American Presidents,  beginning with President Biden, must recommit our Nation to the longer- term challenges that we face. Seventy-two years ago, Harry Truman led  the West in rebuffing the Communist assault in South Korea, as well as  contesting Soviet domination over Europe.   America made sure NATO would not be a toothless political alliance,  but rather a capable military fighting force. This meant sustained  investment in American and allied military strength. Defense funding  was the precondition for impactful diplomacy that kept the Cold War  from going hot.   Now, it is this President's job to seriously meet the growing threats  posed by Russia and China. The United States and our allies and  partners must understand that the core of our competition with Russia  and China is the military dimension.   President Biden's first budget proposed to actually cut defense  spending in real terms. Congress had to take bipartisan action to beef  up the NDAA to correct his error. Clearly, more investment is needed.  Congress must keep strengthening defense capabilities as we work on  appropriations.   But President Biden must lead by example. The President's next budget  request must include at least a 5-percent increase in defense spending  above inflation.   Russia and China have prioritized military modernization literally  for decades.   They have invested in specific tools like long-range aerial defenses  and hypersonic weapons that are designed to push the U.S. and our  allies further away from the fight.   We are actually behind in this competition. We are actually behind.  Hypersonic weapons, nuclear force modernization, power projection,  global presence--these things cost money. It is a small price to pay  for keeping security threats off of our shores. I have criticized NATO  allies who failed to contribute fully to our collective security, but I  am a strong supporter of the transatlantic alliance. I am encouraged by  how our partners have responded, however belatedly, to the growing  threat posed to our collective security.    For example, special praise to the courageous decision by Chancellor  Scholz this weekend to seek an emergency appropriation of 100 billion  euros for the German military. This effectively doubles Germany's  military budget this year--doubles Germany's military budget this year.   He wants Germany to fulfill its pledge to spend 2 percent of GDP on  defense. He wants to build liquefied natural gas terminals and make  other energy investments to finally dial down Germany's dependence on  Russia.   If our wary European friends are finally shaking off their slumber  and getting serious, then certainly the United States of America can do  the same.   President Biden must lead the charge and lead it now.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on an entirely different matter,  with a cascade of major crises testing our country, Senate Democrats  are prioritizing a show vote on mandating 9 months of abortion on  demand across America.   Senate Democrats want to go on record supporting the radical and  massively unpopular proposition that we should have functionally no  restrictions on abortion whatsoever. Democrats already have the United  States, one of just seven nations in the entire world that allows  elective abortions after 20 weeks. This radical fringe policy places us  in company like China and North Korea.   But now, Senate Democrats want to go even further than Chairman Xi  and Kim Jong-Un. Ninety-one percent of Americans support some  restrictions on abortion during the third trimester. The public  overwhelmingly disagrees with Democrats' extreme obsession on this  issue.   But yet again, our colleagues wish to demonstrate that the radical  left fringe runs today's Democratic Party.   As the world prays for Ukraine and debates consequences for Putin, as  American families contend with violent crime, open borders, and runaway  inflation, Washington Democrats want to spend their time arguing for  unlimited abortion on demand.   So I want to thank the majority leader for making it so clear where  his party's priorities lie.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on yet another matter, last  week, our distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Oklahoma,  the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, announced he will  retire from the Senate at the end of this Congress. By this autumn,  Senator Jim Inhofe will have been a stalwart champion for Oklahomans  and a hugely impactful Senator for 28 years. He has led crucial  committees, shaped major legislation, and helped keep the needs and  concerns of middle America at the forefront of this institution and its  work.   The fruits of Jim's labors are apparent across his beloved home State  and our whole country. Most recently, atop the Armed Services  Committee, he has been a remarkable advocate for fellow veterans, for  today's servicemembers, and for the needs of our national security.   We will have much more to say about Senator Inhofe's storied service  as we move through the remainder of this year and this Congress. But  for now, I just want to congratulate our colleague, his wife Kay, and  their 20 kids and grandkids on a well-earned retirement, to which they  are now looking forward.   And I am very glad to have the Senator's wisdom and leadership to  call upon for 10 more months, especially at a time such as this.                            ____________________     Now, on one final matter, I was saddened to hear this  morning that Richard Blum, the husband of my friend and colleague  Senator Feinstein, has passed away following his fight with cancer.   For 30 years, Elaine and I have been privileged to cross paths with  Dianne and Dick in a number of ways, both professional and personal. It  was always a great pleasure to break bread together, compare notes, and  catch up.    Our colleague's very loving husband was, simply put, a fascinating  person. He was highly successful, adventuresome, brave, and curious.  For years, he moved seamlessly between such things as creating major  value in the highest ranks of the private sector and studying Tibetan  Buddhism. His passion for the Himalayas led him to befriend both the  Dalai Lama and Sir Edmund Hillary. I understand he even made his own  attempt on Mount Everest.   Dick's appetites for adventure, for philanthropy, for civic  engagement,  [[Page S819]]  and business success all seemed to be truly boundless. He was full of  life and kept impossibly busy with a wide array of projects that were  both interesting and impacted his community for the good.   I know all Senators are grieving with and praying for our colleague  Senator Feinstein and their entire family at this very difficult time.  Elaine and I join in those thoughts and prayers in a particular way.                            ____________________
