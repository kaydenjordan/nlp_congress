 Madam Speaker, I want to start by making clear that  congressional support for Ukraine remains broad and bipartisan. We  know, from previous votes on the floor amendments and the standalone  bill on Ukraine funding, that assistance to Ukraine has overwhelming  bipartisan support in Congress.   While I am especially proud of the work the United States has done  and President Biden has done to build a global coalition in support of  Ukraine, Congress' inability to pass a Ukraine supplemental is sending  a dangerous message to the world that America cannot be relied upon as  a partner.   The question for the Speaker now is: When will the House be allowed a  vote to continue to support Ukraine?   In these times of crisis, leadership matters. Those of us who  continue to stand against Vladimir Putin's aggression, who continue to  stand with the brave Ukrainians fighting on the front lines defending  their democracy and their people, history will judge us favorably.   How will history judge those who have cynically chosen to use aid to  Ukraine as a wedge issue, to play partisan politics with assistance  meant to support Ukraine's fight against Russia's aggression?   This is a critical moment for Ukraine and for this body. The  administration's top national security officials have made clear that  continued support is essential for Ukraine as it continues its fight.  We know the consequences if we cannot agree to additional funding for  the arms they need to win, to the economic and development assistance  that has been critical to Ukraine's livelihood. All of this will be  impacted.   I think it is also important we are all working from the same set of  facts. In particular, I continue to hear from some of my colleagues who  oppose Ukraine funding as they propagate misinformation regarding the  management of our assistance.    The administration has instituted robust monitoring for all of the  assistance we provide to Ukraine. The State Department, the Defense  Department, and our Ukrainian partners are all ensuring this assistance  is carefully tracked and accounted for. This misinformation both  undermines Ukraine's courageous efforts while benefiting one person,  Vladimir Putin.   The world is watching, and what we say in this body and what we are  able to pass has consequences. Our allies, including Finland and  Sweden, where I recently visited, are proudly joining NATO. They are  doing their part. The EU and partners across the globe are increasing  commitments to help Ukraine. What signal does it send if the United  States of America, the country that has led this coalition, is the  first to step back?   It is not only friends who are watching. Our foes are as well. Putin  wants us to get tired, to get distracted. The Kremlin is active in  supporting anti-Ukraine candidates of any political stripe, and China  is strategically hedging its bets. The only person who thought this  would be a small, victorious war and a quick war was Vladimir Putin.   There is no simple, predictable end. As long as Ukraine continues to  push back Russia's brutal, unprovoked assault, our commitment to  Ukraine should stand. If the large bipartisan majority in this House  that I know believes in standing there and believes in this commitment,  if we stay united with all of our allies, we will prevail.                                time  1745
