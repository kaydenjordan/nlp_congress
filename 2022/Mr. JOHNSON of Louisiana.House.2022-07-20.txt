 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, the recent Supreme Court term  has come to an end and the Court's decision has sent Washington  Democrats into a tailspin.   Members of this body have called to abolish the Supreme Court--and by  the way, some of those very same Members have also called to expand the  Supreme Court, so we are not really sure which one they are committed  to.   Just yesterday, Members of this body were pretending to be handcuffed  over their support for taxpayer-funded abortion on demand until birth.  Washington Democrats are making excuses for the outright harassment of  the Supreme Court Justices, their families, their children, and even  the assassination attempt on the life of Justice Kavanaugh.   Washington Democrats are silent on attacks against pro-life pregnancy  care centers across this country. Some have even called for these  centers to be shut down all across the Nation. It is appalling. It is  unhinged. Why would anyone want to shut down pregnancy centers that are  designed to help struggling mothers in their time of need? But that is  where we are.   Why all the hysterics though? My constituents are really curious  about this. Why are they so animated right now? Why do they want to  tear this institution to the ground?   Well, here is the simple reason, because the Supreme Court has made  some very thoughtful constitutionally based decisions in this term.   They correctly said, for example, that a football coach was  exercising his First Amendment rights when he privately prayed on the  50-yard line.   The Supreme Court correctly said that citizens don't have to ask the  government for permission to exercise their fundamental rights to keep  and bear arms.   The Supreme Court correctly said that if Congress wants to address  climate change, then Congress has to legislate on that issue instead of  just outsourcing that work to unelected bureaucrats.  [[Page H6909]]    Because the Supreme Court correctly said that elected Representatives  of the people may again be allowed to place restrictions on the killing  of innocent unborn children.   That is why they are motivated. That is why they are so unhinged.  That is why they want to tear the institution to the ground.   I guess we shouldn't be surprised by all of this. We are, after all,  only a couple of months removed from Senator Schumer's infamous,  dangerous, unhinged rant on the steps of the Supreme Court itself. He  called out Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh by name, and he said, Hey, we  are going to release the whirlwind on you.   Well, it happened. And it is clear what is happening here. Democrats  are doing anything and everything they can to try to use these obvious  and straightforward Supreme Court decisions to stoke fear and change  the subject before the November election.   But we are here today to say that this election will be about three  things. It is going to be primarily about soaring inflation,  uninhibited illegal immigration, and the general staggering  incompetence that we see by the Democrats in charge of Washington.   The three I's. I call it: Inflation. Immigration. Incompetence.   I think that summarizes it very well.   There was a very interesting story on CNN this week that caught my  eye. It was entitled, ``Vulnerable Democrats Sound the Alarm Over  Inflation Crisis.'' Well, welcome to the party. It is a little late for  that.   I would humbly suggest that those vulnerable Democrats should have  thought about that before they voted to pass $5.4 trillion--with a  ``T''--in new partisan spending last year.   We warned them. This was so completely foreseeable. Government  spending is what is causing the current inflation crisis, plain and  simple. And now that this bill is coming due, these vulnerable  Democrats are hoping the American people would simply forget their  vote. We don't intend to let that happen, the stakes are too high, and  the issues are too important.   I thank my colleagues for joining us today to discuss the harm that  the Democrat agenda has caused our country and our alternative,  conservative vision for how to fix all this.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser), first among my many colleagues that will be  joining me here in the hour, who knows a whole lot about the economy.    Immigration.   Mr. MEUSER: Immigration. And instead of taking any action to correct  this devastating problem, and the effect it is having on American  families and small businesses, large businesses, you name it--dogs and  cats, probably--the Biden administration has doubled down on the  backwards policies and undertaken a massive blame-game campaign.   Not exactly a profile in courage taking place here, Mr. Speaker.   First, they branded the inflation brought on by their reckless  spending the ``Putin price hike.'' Then, despite inflation beginning  long before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, by the way, then the  administration laid the blame for their policies at the feet of greedy  corporations--yeah--and then local gas station owners.   Mr. Speaker, 60 percent of the gas stations throughout our country,  and certainly in my district, are owned by small independent  businesspeople. They are to blame for the gasoline prices that we are  paying?   I would like to reiterate, when faced with the highest gas prices in  history caused by atrocious energy policies, the President of the  United States and many Democrat Members of this House point their  fingers and blame small business owners.   The American people are not fooled by the Biden administration's  finger-pointing, though they are paying a steep price for it. Despite  the administration's best efforts to deceive the American people, we  have learned that inflation was not temporary and has continued to  skyrocket, largely because of the Biden House Democrats' out-of-control  spending.   Instead of addressing America's inflation crisis, House Democrats  have continued to push for billions more in government spending, which  will increase inflation, it will not decrease it. Continued excessive  spending will increase inflation. It is a mathematical and physical  certainty.   We must correct course. Stop the reckless spending and unleash  domestic American energy production, which will strengthen both our  economy and our national security. We must also stop overregulating and  overtaxing small businesses, and enough with the blame games and these  go woke and broke policies. They have failed the American people.    Mr. Speaker, the free nations of the world need a strong United  States, both militarily and economically to lead. We face serious  threats. Free nations worldwide know that the world is a far more  peaceful and stable place with strong American leadership. The weakness  shown both at our southern border and the Ukraine border, initially,  have had devastating effects on humanity and on the stability of the  United States, Europe, and the free world.   Only with a clear vision, realistic plan, and earnest execution will  this be corrected.    That is so well said, my friend. And it is  so true that a strong and vibrant America is good not only for the  people in this country but for people all around the world. We maintain  peace through strength, and if we don't show that strength, then we are  in real jeopardy.   Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Babin), my good friend from right over the border.                                time  1545     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend. It is a  very stark reality that we face, but we are optimists. We know we can  turn this around, and the American people are going to give us a chance  this fall, aren't they? I thank the gentleman for that good word and  stark reminder.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Good).    Mr. Speaker, wow, there are so many  important facts there. I will tell you what, it is hard to count all  the crises. I thank my friend, that was so well said, as usual.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose),  faithful to come on this floor week after week and relay the facts to  the American people.    Mr. Speaker, there are so many great points  there. I appreciate the gentleman for coming here and explaining that  because we can't say it too much.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Mann).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for standing  up for those wheat farmers. I know they appreciate that representation.  For all of those in the ag community, this is just a critical issue.   The gentleman is exactly right. The inflation crisis has real-world  consequences, and that is just some of them.   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to go across the country to California again  to hear, once more, from our dear, faithful friend.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend. There are  so many important things he highlighted there.   Mr. Speaker, we will go from California over to the great State of  Texas next.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for my friend's  voice. He was a guest on my podcast last week, and we have gotten a lot  of attention on that. People are grateful for his passion on these  issues. I hope my friend will keep speaking loudly here on the floor  and everywhere. I am grateful he has a national platform to talk,  particularly about this immigration crisis, which is a whole different  subject, and he has great insight on that.   Mr. Speaker, I will wrap this up. I thank my colleagues for joining  me today in this Special Order hour to discuss the harm that the  Democrat agenda has caused our country and our alternative visions on  all these issues.   By way of recap, just quickly, I was taking notes as my colleague  spoke from across the country, from Texas. Dr. Babin reminded us that a  staggering 77 percent of Americans believe our country is on the wrong  track--obviously, because of all this.   Mr. LaMalfa from California just reminded us of the excesses and  abuses of the Federal agencies, which are overregulating our farmers  and food producers and wasting our time and precious resources on these  superfluous projects.   Mr. Meuser of Pennsylvania reminded us that this inflation is going  to cost the average hardworking American family this year an extra  $6,000 in the cost of living.   Mr. Rose from Tennessee reminded us about that skyrocketing inflation  rate. It is obviously the result of the Biden policies and the  administration's backward approach to all this. But they even now want  to remove and eliminate the Hyde amendment so that taxpayers have to  fund abortions.   Mr. Good of Virginia reminded us about that border catastrophe and  the numbers, which are staggering--Mr. Roy knows, as well--3 million  encounters at the border, 800,000 got-aways that we can't even account  for, and that is just the numbers the DHS admits to, so we know it is  higher. He talked about the energy policy disaster causing pain to  every hardworking American family, as well.   Finally, Mr. Mann of Kansas talked about how the inflation crisis has  real-world consequences for our farmers in the wheat State and  everywhere else.   Mr. Speaker, we could go on and on all night. I will conclude our  Special Order hour. This is just a sampling of all the many crises that  have been created by the Biden administration and the Washington  Democrats in charge of this institution. We cannot wait to begin to  turn this around after the November election.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
