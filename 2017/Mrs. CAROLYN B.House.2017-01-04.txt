 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, residents in New  York City had a special reason to celebrate as this new year began. The  very first new subway in over 60 years and the largest subway in the  country opened its doors and carried passengers at 12 noon on New  Year's Day. This new line is expected to carry over 200,000 travelers a  day, reducing commute time, reducing costs, operating with efficiency,  and boosting small businesses.   It is a project that has been on the books for over a century and one  that I fought for every single day that I have been in Congress. It is  the gift that keeps on giving. It has already generated over 16,000 new  jobs. It has spurred over $840 million in good wages. The regional plan  says that it is responsible for over $2.5 billion in new economic  activity. They just opened their doors.   Let's work together and support other good, important infrastructure  projects in our country. It is good for Americans; it is good for  America.                            ____________________
