 Mr. Speaker, many times, the American people wonder  about the correlation between the work that we do here. As a member of  the Budget Committee, I can tell them that the tax bill that is about  to move through this House--the Republican Trump tax bill--will bring  about $1.41 trillion in revenue decreases in discretionary spending,  which means cuts in their Medicare and Medicaid.  [[Page H9160]]    Why do they want to do this?   They want to do this so that they can compound the injury to those  who need a mortgage deduction, which will be eliminated for any home  that you buy in the future.   If you have medical expenses, that will be eliminated. You will not  be able to deduct that, whether you are a young family with a  catastrophic illness or a senior citizen.   Then those of you who are trying to increase your opportunities for  the future--help your children--you will not be able to deduct student  loan interest, tuition, and other education expenses.   Elections matter, but actions matter. This tax bill is a crippling,  devastating bill, and it will create the complete opposite of what  Republicans say they believe in--a huge deficit, with a huge debt, on  the backs of the American people. Vote ``no'' on this tax bill.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  his leadership, his stewardship of these very special ways of  communicating to the American people.   I just left a meeting on temporary protected status, so I will try to  summarize my remarks, because I think it is very important to join in  the Congressional Black Caucus Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman, Mr. Richmond, and my  colleague Mr. Payne and my colleague Mr. Evans, who will join us in  that effort, because this is a way to communicate with our colleagues  of the urgency of some of these issues.   So let me first of all take a moment that really gives me great  consternation, great concern, and that is that, as I said in my  remarks, while the President was out of the country, that I will always  wish him safe travels and safe return, but you have to think about how  we have turned the corner on the dignity of the Presidency when you  have to monitor the tweets or the words that are being said by that  Office when they are out of the country.   There is one point I have to make, because I am a product of the  Voting Rights Act of 1965. Barbara Jordan was able to be the first  African American from Texas, since Reconstruction, elected to the  United States Congress, along with Andy Young from Georgia, after the  Voting Rights Act.   Mr. Speaker, there was nothing untoward. It was just simply allowing  one person one vote. Heretofore, in the Deep South and in the  Southwest, African Americans were denied the right to vote by  suppression, poll tax, and a number of tactics; but the Voting Rights  Act eliminated or prevented, had to have preclearance, any  discriminatory factor that could be raised that would keep minorities  from voting, that one vote, one person.    It pains me to read the headlines: ``Trump Says He Believes Putin's  Election Meddling Denials.''   I believe that it is important for people of goodwill, for Members of  the United States Congress, to denounce these comments and to ask for  the dignity of this Office to really put Americans first and put this  Nation first, because that is not what is being done.   All of the intelligence agencies, 17 plus, have indicated that not  only did they influence, they intruded, they skewed the election. They  didn't just meddle. You cannot ask a former KGB officer to tell you  that he didn't meddle in our elections. Elections matter.   This is no comment on who won or lost. This is a comment on reality.  The elections were skewed to one person, and it was confirmed by the  intelligence agencies, and it is time for the highest Office to speak  on behalf of the American people.   That brings me right to the Trump tax cuts, the Republican tax cuts.  I spoke earlier during 1 minutes to try and correlate between tax cuts  and the needs of the American people.   These major tax cuts will offer more benefits to corporations, which,  by the way, are having their biggest season of profits that we have  ever had. They are succeeding beyond imagination. They have not only  stock prices going up, but the profits that they are able to stock away  are going up.   Take that in the backdrop of this tax bill, having to cut and violate  the Medicare trust fund and Medicaid in order to find the dollars to be  able to give the top 1 percent the greatest tax cut and to give  corporations a 20 percent tax cut in the United States and a 12 percent  tax cut overseas, which, in addition to giving them that money on the  corporate rates, which is a reasonable thing to discuss, but by the  inequity of the lower amount being overseas, you can imagine that jobs  are still going to leave and go overseas.   This is a tax cut that is made for the basket, if you will, of  goodies for the top 1 percent. This is not worrying about working  Americans.   Let me put into the Record what you will lose.   You will lose the mortgage interest.   You will lose the fairness of the child tax credit.   You will lose the student loan interest, tuition, and other education  expenses; personal casualty losses; tax preparation costs; medical  expenses; alimony payments; moving expenses--which will impact victims  of Hurricane Harvey, my constituents in Kashmere Gardens, northeast  Houston, Third Ward, Acres Home, the Heights, Jacinto City, places  where individuals have been impacted; this moving expense, elimination  of that as a deduction, will impact individuals who are trying to  restore their lives--and employee business expenses.   This bill will hurt the average working American. It is a frightening  bill. I would almost like to say it is a bill made near purgatory on  the way to you know where. This is a disgusting attack on hardworking  Americans.   I want to also put in the Record my concern about extending the  temporary protected status for Haitians as well as El Salvadorans and a  number of other countries that are facing the 6-month deadline that  seems to be what has come out of the administration.   All of these countries have devastation, and all of these countries  are deserving, if you will, of an extension for the people who are here  because they are, in fact, suffering still. Haiti is suffering still  from the earthquake. El Salvador is suffering.   I want to mention one of my constituents, Jose, and his wife, who  were deported during the horror and the hysteria of the announcement  from the administration of: I am going to be hard on deportation.   A hardworking family man, a manager of a paint store, was deported  out of this country back to El Salvador where there is no work, there  is no opportunity, and they are still suffering from the devastation of  years past. This is what we are in the midst of.   Let me, finally, express, as I indicated, my concerns about extending  the temporary protected status certainly for Haitians and others. We  are working on that as we speak.   Then let me come back to Hurricane Harvey. There are about 50,000  people in the hotels. We are still in need.  [[Page H9162]]    I am going to close with this.   We just experienced Veterans Day. What a pleasure to be able to speak  with the many veterans, the Buffalo Soldiers, who celebrated at the  downtown celebration, the American Legion. The Aldine Mail Route had a  parade. Stafford had a parade. Many places had a parade. I want to  celebrate our veterans by saying thank you.   When I spoke to young people, eighth graders, I told them about the  value of joining the United States military, putting on the uniform.  Policy does not relate to the value of the men and women who put on the  uniform.                                time  2000    I believe that it is certainly of concern that we should understand  what the needs of the military are. And if this proposal goes forward  of giving waivers for individuals with depression, bipolar disorder,  getting waivers, let me be very clear, I advocate for the full  utilization of people, and those people who have mental health issues.   It is very important, as they are recruited into the United States  military, that all of the resources needed to have them perform at the  fullest of their capacity, we must ensure, as Members of Congress, that  that happens. That must be our responsibility because, as we look at  our veterans and we see the sacrifice, we see what war means, we have  to make sure that we embrace them solidly and respect them and honor  them.   So I thank the gentleman for allowing me to share a few thoughts. I  will simply say that the gentleman is absolutely right, this tax  legislation will be devastating, costly, and hard for the country to  dig out of the deepening debt that is going to be created.   Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus  in drawing attention to the Republican Leadership's latest plan to hurt  the American taxpayers, especially those who did not support the  President during the election.   The Republican tax cut bill will hurt hospitals.   The House tax bill would remove tax-exempt status of private activity  bonds for construction of a non-profit facility such as a hospital.   This could potentially impact a fourth of the rural hospitals in  Texas and many urban hospitals that may be planning construction or  extensive renovation projects in the next few years.   Many non-profit hospitals depend on tax exempt private-activity bonds  (PABs) as a financing tool.   PABs are tax exempt for certain entities, including qualified  501(c)(3) organizations including hospital bonds, but under the new tax  reform legislation being considered by this body, the tax exemption  will be removed.   PABs play a critical role in helping not-for-profit hospitals and  health systems access low-cost capital.   Access to low-cost capital financing allows qualifying entities to  keep infrastructure expenditures low.   This increases the ability for qualifying hospitals and health system  to use these savings to increase more efficient, more affordable care.   Federal tax-exempt financing is part of what continues to help health  care providers and hospitals serve our nation and support rural  communities.   The Texas Organization of Rural & Community Hospitals opposes removal  of tax-exemption for PABs and urges Republicans to stop threatening  small and rural hospitals.   The Republican Tax plan amends Title 26 of the United States Code 529  that deals with Qualified tuition programs.   The Code was intended to encourage persons to attain higher education  and provide incentives for persons who pursue doctorates.   Most people know that going back to school to obtain a degree is a  difficult choice to make with full time jobs and family obligations.   Having a degree can substantially increase income and provide choices  that would otherwise be unattainable to the recipient of advanced  degrees.   The benefit to the economy and our nation's leadership in the  sciences rests with the number of people who attain undergraduate and  graduate degrees.   The Republicans have gone into this section 529 of the tax code and  extended the tax write-offs to those sending their children to K-12  private schools.   Other ways the Republican Tax bill hurts tax payers who pursue  college educations for themselves or their children.   Repeal of Lifetime Learning Credit;   Repeal of the Student Loan Interest Deduction;   Repeal of the qualified tuition reduction;   Repeal of educational assistance program;   Termination of private activity bonds; and,   Creation of a new excise tax on endowments at private colleges and  universities.   The Republican leadership of the House is also causing problems for  private sector investments in Colleges and Universities.   The tax bill threatens tax write offs for donations to colleges and  universities and will limit tax credits associated with university- industry partnerships.   The Republicans claim that their Child Tax Credit proposal would help  working families, but it simply does not do enough.   The House tax plan proposes a nonrefundable $600 increase in the  Child Tax Credit (CTC), and would make more families earning six  figures eligible to claim the CTC.   This proposal wouldn't help the women who need it most.   In addition, whatever benefits this CTC proposal would provide pales  in comparison to those that would be received by the wealthy and  corporations under this tax plan.   The bill cuts taxes for major corporations who already pay far less  than their fair share.   Republicans claim that economic growth will more than pay for the  lost revenue but we've tried this before.   When trickle-down economics fails again and this bill explodes the  nation's deficit, Republicans will call for huge spending cuts to  critical programs that hardworking Americans depend on to make ends  meet.   The plan's negative impact on the Lone Star state would be  particularly hard.   Independent analyses show the Republican plan would actually raise  taxes on about 1.5 million Texas households, or 12.4 percent of  households next year.   On average, families earning up to $86,000 annually would see a  $794.00 increase in their tax liability, a significant burden on  families struggling to afford child care and balance their checkbook.   According to the IRS, 23 percent of tax filers, or 2.8 million Texas  households, deduct their state and local taxes with an average  deduction of $7,823 in 2015.   The Ryan-McConnell plan eliminates this deduction, which would lower  home values and put pressure on states and towns to collect revenues  they depend on to fund schools, roads, and vital public resources.   Placing further strains on middle-class Texans is the elimination of  the personal exemption, which deducts $4,050 for each taxpayer and  dependent on a return from taxable income.   In 2015, roughly 9.3 million dependent exemptions were claimed in the  Lone Star State.   The GOP's reckless and irresponsible tax plan is made all the more  obscene by its disproportionate and immoral handouts to the wealthiest  few.   According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy,  millionaires in Texas, 0.31 percent of filers in 2015 would receive  almost 57 percent of the benefits from the tax plan.   Texans deserve a tax plan that puts working and middle class families  first, not more deficit-exploding tax cuts for millionaires and  billionaires.   We need bipartisan tax reform that creates jobs, fuels economic  growth, and puts more money into the pockets of hard-working American  families.   A recent Pew Research Center report found little support for cutting  taxes for high-income households, which is defined as more than  $250,000 or large businesses and corporations.   In fact, 43 percent favored raising taxes on high-income households  and 52 percent said corporate taxes should be raised.   The Republicans persist with their scheme of raising taxes on hard- working middle class families to pay for tax cuts for the rich.   It is reckless to explode our deficit which according to the Tax  Policy Center, would skyrocket by $2.4 trillion over the first decade.   The wealthy must pay their fair share, but the GOP tax scheme offers  them a free lunch at the expense of those who are most in need of a  helping hand.   The power of the purse rests with the House of Representatives and it  is our job to make sure that the American People are treated fairly.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House Committees on the  Judiciary and Homeland Security Committee, I also rise today to express  my strong objection to the announced intention by the Trump  Administration not to extend Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for  Haiti, Honduras, and El Salvador.   On May 24, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  redesignated Haiti for 6 months of Temporary Protected Status (TPS),  rather than the full 18 months requested by the Government of Haiti,  Haiti experts in the United States, and the Congressional Black Caucus,  among others.   DHS' decision did not reflect the realities on the ground in Haiti,  which include Haiti's food scarcity crisis, cholera epidemic, and the  ongoing challenges posed by the unprecedented 2010 earthquake.  [[Page H9163]]    In a letter sent on November 3, 2017, the Congressional Black Caucus  urged DHS, once again, to fully extend Haiti's TPS designation for 18  months by the November 23, 2017 deadline in light of the aforementioned  conditions in Haiti, as well as the exarcerbated damage caused by  Hurricanes Irma and Maria.   In a report published in October 2017, the highly regarded Global  Justice Clinic concluded that conditions justifying Haiti's  qualification for TPS in 2011 remain as acute today as they were then.   The study also found that 40,000 Haitians uprooted by the 2010  earthquake are officially displaced and that many more likely remain  unofficially displaced in dangerously inadequate shelters.   The cholera epidemic that was tragically caused by international  efforts to aid Haiti in 2010 more than doubled following Hurricane  Matthew and is expected to directly affect more than 30,000 people by  the end of 2017.   Hurricane Matthew also exacerbated the food insecurity crisis in  Haiti, placing 2.4 million Haitians--22 percent of its population--in  the grips of an acute food insecurity crisis.   The Haitian government has been working diligently for years to  improve its economy, public health conditions, and infrastructure in  coordination with the United States government and international  community.   In order to accomplish this task, Haiti relies in large part on  remittances that its citizens receive from TPS beneficiaries in the  United States.   Therefore, the negative consequences of terminating Haiti's TPS  designation would be twofold.   It would end essential remittances that significantly contribute to  Haiti's recovery while also forcing the poorest republic in the Western  Hemisphere to absorb the cost of reintegrating thousands of citizens  all at once.   Such actions could be catastrophic to Haiti's recovery efforts and  run counter to Congressional efforts to improve American relations in  the region through the recently-passed United States-Caribbean  Strategic Engagement Act (Public Law 114-291).   Finally, it is essential to note that Haitian TPS beneficiaries  directly contribute to the United States.   They pay taxes, spend money, contribute to Social Security and  Medicare, and help promote American prosperity in numerous sectors,  such as the restaurant and food service, construction, and hospitality  industries.   About 30 percent of TPS beneficiaries are homeowners, stimulating the  real estate industry and contributing to the local property tax base.   Also, one in nine TPS beneficiaries in the labor force is self- employed, meaning they not only create jobs for themselves, but also  create jobs for others.   A recent report found that the expiration of Haitian TPS would cost  the United States economy more $2.8 billion over a decade in lost gross  domestic product.   Mr. Speaker, we need to be both smart and compassionate when it comes  to extending TPS for Haiti.   The compassionate thing to do is extend TPS for Haiti.   But just as important, extending TPS for Haiti is the smart thing to  do because it strengthens the American economy and advances the  national interests of the United States.   Mr. Speaker, here are the top reasons why temporary protect status  (TPS) for Haiti should not be revoked:   1) Trump Administration Actions:   The DHS termination of TPS decision threatens families and key  industries in the United States and threatens the stability of nations  in our region.   On November, 2017, the Washington Post reported that the State  Department irresponsibly recommended that Temporary Protected Status  (TPS) be revoked for over 300,000 Honduran, Nicaraguan, Haitian and  Salvadorans living and working in the United States.   This is paving the way for the mass deportation of over 300,000  individuals who are legally in the US--many of whom have children who  are US citizens.   It was an inhumane, foolish and terrible decision to make, given TPS  holders' contributions to our economy including critical hurricane  recovery efforts, to say nothing of the national security and  humanitarian implications of kicking these individuals out.   That's why everyone from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, to national  security experts, to Catholic bishops has expressed strong support for  extending this vital program.   These nations are in no condition to receive 300,000 returnees.   In Haiti, forcing the return of 50,000 people would disrupt the  fragile recovery, exacerbate the food, housing, and public health  crises, and potentially destabilize the new government.   In El Salvador and Honduras, the return of over 250,000 people would  strain government services and lead to job displacement in countries  besieged by violence, narcotics trafficking and weak institutions.   The revocation of TPS will further destabilize fragile countries in  our neighborhood. With remittances making up more than 15% of the GDP  of TPS-designated countries, the sudden loss will put an added strain  on the U.S. foreign aid budget while families who have long relied on  this source of income will have no other option than to attempt to come  to the U.S. as undocumented workers.   That's why Congress must act without delay to pass CHC-endorsed bill  by Rep. Nydia Velazquez--the American Promise Act--would ensure  individuals who have resided in the U.S. under these programs for a  period of three years can remain in the country and pursue a path to  naturalization.   2) TPS Revocation Is Not in America's National Interest:   Americans with Temporary Protected Status (TPS) are hardworking  individuals who are contributing to our economy, our communities and  our industries.   TPS recipients have passed numerous criminal background checks and  have often been living in the U.S. for over a decade.   With more than 300,000 TPS beneficiaries expecting a Trump  Administration decision on their fate, and some 800,000 DACA  beneficiaries depending on Congressional action to shape their futures,  we are entering a stretch of time that will be of huge consequence to  1.1 million immigrants who are deeply rooted and legally present in  America.   Regardless of how you might feel about the policy, TPS holders from  these countries have been in legal limbo for at least 16 years.   They are perhaps the most vetted, legally present, and work  authorized community in our country.   They have submitted to numerous criminal background checks, once  every 18 months.   Life has gone on for these folks--they have families here, are  contributing to our economy, and our communities.   There are an estimated that 273,000 U.S.-born children in the country  have parents with TPS.   Economic, legal, and policy experts have highlighted the disastrous  economic impacts of revoking Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for  hundreds of thousands of Americans, as country-specific deadlines loom.   3) Positive Economic Impacts of TPS   Approximately 250,000 TPS recipients are currently employed-- approximately 94% of men and 82% of women.   The average TPS recipient works between 40-45 hours per week.   Given the length of time on the job, many of these workers are  senior, specialized and not easily replaceable such as construction  site supervisors and nursing home professionals.   The five leading industries that would face mass layoffs are  construction (50,000+), restaurants and other food services (32,000+),  landscaping services (15,000+), child day care services (10,000) and  grocery stores (9,000+).   The mass layoffs of 250,000 TPS recipients would cost employers  approximately $967 million in immediate turnover costs.   The revocation of TPS status would cost the U.S. an estimated $164  billion in Gross Domestic Product.   Revocation of TPS status would result in a loss of $6.9 billion in  Social Security and Medicare payments over a decade.   Given that 30% of TPS recipients are homeowners, the consequences of  simultaneously dumping 60,000 mortgages could disrupt housing markets  across the country including Texas (13,000 mortgages), Florida (5,000+  mortgages) and Virginia (4,100 mortgages).   Mass deportations of TPS recipients would cost taxpayers more than $3  billion dollars.
