 Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my home team, the  Seattle Seahawks, for joining nearly 200 NFL players across the country  who exercised their First Amendment right to protest during the  national anthem. I fully support their right to do so.   These players used their platform to draw attention to the racial and  social injustices of our time and to condemn the racism and divisive  rhetoric coming from President Trump.   Athletes practice unity in a way that few others do, coming from  every walk of life and pulling together to model unity every single  game.   Let us be very clear: these protests are not about disrespecting the  flag or our country's brave men and women in uniform. They are about  the oppression of people of color, the number of black men gunned down  by police, and the school-to-prison pipeline. These protests are about  speaking out about unacceptable behavior and rhetoric and fighting for  justice.   I thank our players and the Seahawks for addressing these issues with  unity, compassion, and truth. I thank Colin Kaepernick for starting  this important conversation.                            ____________________
