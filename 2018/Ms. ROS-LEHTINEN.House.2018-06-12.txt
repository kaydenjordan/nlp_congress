 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to recognize an  innovative journalist, Jamie Dupree, who is an example of perseverance  in the face of adversity.   Jamie is a familiar face to all of us in the Capitol, covering the  goings-on and not-goings-on of Congress. However, he was stricken with  Tongue Protrusion Dystonia, which left him unable to speak--a radio  reporter unable to speak.   Never one to let adversity get him down, Jamie enlisted the help of a  company named CereProc, which, using his old audio archives, built a  Jamie Dupree voice app. When paired with a text-to-speech program,  Jamie will be able to type a radio story, and the program will generate  a recorded report in his new voice.   Mr. Speaker, Jamie Dupree is an example for every American who has  been afflicted with disease. Tenacious, intelligent, determined, he is  a credit to his esteemed and essential profession, the media, and to  his organization, the Cox Media Group.   Way to go, Jamie Dupree. We are all with you, buddy.                            ____________________
