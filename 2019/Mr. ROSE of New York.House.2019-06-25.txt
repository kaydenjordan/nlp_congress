 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the  appropriations bill on the floor this week that would implement split  tolling on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge.   This legislation is common sense. It is nonpartisan, and it  represents a massive win for all New Yorkers. It addresses the  unintended consequences of an archaic 30-year-old piece of legislation  that singled out Staten Island and South Brooklyn with the only bridge  in the country whose technology is controlled by Congress.   Split tolling removes an obsolete mandate that cars on the  Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge only be tolled as they arrive in Staten  Island, meaning that eastbound drivers across the bridge move across  toll-free. Thousands of cars each day take advantage of this free ride  and cause unnecessary congestion on Staten Island, in Brooklyn, and in  Manhattan.   Split tolling cuts the toll in half and collects it in both  directions, closing the loophole, and at no cost to commuters in  Brooklyn or on Staten Island.   Cutting down on out-of-State toll shopping will also generate  revenues for New York to invest in mass transit projects on Staten  Island and in South Brooklyn, two places that all levels of government  have consistently ignored or ripped off for a generation now.   Finally, my constituents are starting to see a new day after a long  commuting nightmare: fewer cars on our streets, better buses, more mass  transit options, and credible alternatives to reach the other boroughs.   This is commonsense legislation, and we are going to get it done.                            ____________________
