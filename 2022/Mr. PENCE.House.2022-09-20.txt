 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor fallen Richmond Police  Officer Seara Burton.   Officer Burton was an exceptional law enforcement officer who never  failed to answer the call with bravery. Our Richmond police officer  passed away Sunday night, September 18, with her family and loved ones  close by. Her Richmond community proudly knows her as a fighter and a  warrior--a title she very much deserved.   She was well-loved and will be well-remembered by all whose lives she  touched.   Mr. Speaker, I ask everyone to pray for her loved ones and fellow  officers as they grieve during this difficult time.                      Honoring Corporal Kelsee Lainhart     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Corporal Kelsee  Lainhart. Corporal Lainhart was one of the U.S. servicemembers injured  by the Kabul Airport bombings a little over 1 year ago in Afghanistan,  but today, I am here to provide a more hopeful update.   Though she spent many weeks in the hospital, our brave young marine  from Dearborn County never lost hope. This August Corporal Lainhart  participated in the Chicago Paratriathlon and finished fifth.   So, Madam Speaker, I would like to honor Corporal Kelsee Lainhart  today for her strength in recovery and her bravery and diligence during  her difficult times.                           Honoring Peter McDaniel     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and recognize the late  Peter McDaniel. Peter McDaniel's legacy and the lives that he touched  will live on in his community.   After serving his country for 4 years in the Marine Corps, Mr.  McDaniel served his community in many capacities, including 22 years  with the Richmond Fire Department. Peter McDaniel was not just a public  servant but also a son, husband, father, and grandfather. His  selflessness and dedication will serve as an example and a legacy to  uphold. We are proud to honor his life today.                          Little League World Series     Mr. Speaker, this summer our pride and excitement rose as  we beheld the events of this year's Little League World Series.   Indiana's own Hagerstown in the Indiana Sixth District represented  the Great Lakes region in this year's games. Indiana has celebrated  this team from the beginning, and we couldn't be prouder for their  success.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to simply say thank you to these  outstanding young Hoosiers who took their Hagerstown team to the 2022  Little League World Series.                                 Proxy Voting     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on the Speaker of the  House to end proxy voting once and for all.   Just this Sunday, President Joe Biden took to prime-time television  to declare the COVID-19 pandemic over, thank God.   In any other job in America, if you don't show up, you get fired. I  proudly say today that I never once proxy voted. It is not fair to our  constituents who send us here to be their voice or to the taxpayers  whose hard-earned dollars we are supposed to be responsible stewards of  to not show up here.   We all know why proxy voting keeps getting extended. It is so the  majority leadership can control its members and limit the effectiveness  of this people's House.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter stating that it is time  to end proxy voting, return to regular order, and get back to work on  behalf of the American people.

Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi: I write in support of President       Biden's recent declaration that the COVID-19 pandemic has       come to an end. In accordance with this important       announcement, I formally request the Speaker bring an end to       the House proxy voting system and all pandemic related House       rules enacted as part of House Resolution 8. It is far past       time this legislative body returns in person to fulfill our       constitutional duties on behalf of our constituents.        As you are aware, House Resolution 8 provided unprecedented       authority for Members of Congress to designate a colleague as       a proxy to cast votes on the House floor on their behalf. For       the first time in our nation's history, this body allowed a       sitting Member of Congress to defer their constitutional       responsibilities to a Representative of another district.       Since then, more than six thousand letters designating a       proxy voting member have been submitted to the House Office       of the Clerk bearing an official statement of a member's       inability to physically attend proceedings in the House       chamber due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since President Biden       rightfully declared an end to the pandemic, it seems fit to       end a practice specifically put in place to accommodate the       logistical challenges posed by COVID-19.        The voting card entrusted to us here in Congress belongs to       the people we represent. Over the course of one hundred and       fifteen sessions of Congress, this body convened in times of       war, pandemics, and national crises alike to fulfill our       constitutional duties. Since the start of the COVID-19       pandemic two and a half years ago, essential workers, blue       collar employees, first responders, food and restaurant       industries, and many more have shown up to work each and       every day to do their job. We in Congress should find the       courage to do the same.        Thank you for your attention to this important matter.            Sincerely,                                                        Greg Pence,                                                Member of Congress.                                   ____________________
