 Mr. Speaker, here in Washington, we are in the midst of  a major debate on tax reform, tax simplification, and tax cuts.   The plan unveiled by House Republicans today is a tax cut plan for  middle-income, middle class families in America. If you are a family of  four making $59,000, which is the median family income in America, you  will receive a $1,200 tax cut as a result of the plan that we unveiled  today.   That is real money for middle class families in North Carolina. Maybe  it is not real money in Washington, D.C., but it is real money in  western North Carolina.   We need tax cuts. We need tax simplification. We need economic  growth, more American jobs, and a more competitive environment in  America so that we can keep jobs here in the United States and not  offshore those jobs. We need middle class families to win. Our plan  does that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support our efforts.                            ____________________
