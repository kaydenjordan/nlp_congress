 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the Senate has just a few more days  this week to pass legislation to lift the budget caps and extend the  debt ceiling before the summer State work period. As the minority  leader, I don't have control over the schedule here on the floor, much  to my dismay. So I am left to ask my friend, the majority leader, who  does control the floor schedule: Why don't we vote on the caps deal  today?   Four congressional leaders and the White House reached an agreement 2  weeks ago. The President supports it. The House has already passed it.  Secretary Mnuchin has said we need this legislation urgently before the  State work period because he can't guarantee that we will not hit the  debt ceiling before Congress reconvenes. The majority leader spoke  about the importance of moving the budget agreement back in mid-May.  Now the clock is ticking.   I make clear to the leader and to all of my friends on the other side  of the aisle, as well as all Americans: Democrats are ready to vote on  the House bill today so it can get to the President's desk and we can  avoid even a glimmer of default.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, last week former  Special Counsel Mueller testified that Russian interference in our  democracy ``wasn't a single attempt. They're doing it as we sit here  and they expect to do it in the next campaign.''   The Russians, he said, interfered in the last election and are trying  to interfere again. Mueller said: ``Much more needs to be done in order  to protect against these intrusions, not just by the Russians but by  others as well.''   It was not just Mueller who said these things or agreed with these  ideas and sentiments. FBI Director Wray, appointed by President Trump,  has shared similar sentiments. Departing DNI Director Coats--lifelong  Republican, former member of this body, well respected by all, and  appointed by President Trump--has repeatedly warned about the threat  posed by Russia. The Senate Intelligence Committee, chaired by a  Republican, Senator Burr, did the same.   It is with these facts as the backdrop--the testimony of prominent  Republicans, allies of President Trump and friends and allies of our  colleagues here--that Democrats have been pushing for election  security--so far, to little avail. Leader McConnell and the Republican  majority have not allowed a single election security bill to reach the  floor of the Senate. We haven't had a single bill open for amendment  all year.   So, last week, understandably frustrated at the lack of progress,  Democrats asked unanimous consent to pass House legislation to  safeguard our elections. Leader McConnell blocked that request saying  yesterday: ``I am not going to let Democrats and their water-carriers  in the media use Russia's attack on our democracy as a Trojan horse for  partisan wish list items.''   ``Partisan wish list items''--really? What are these items on our  partisan wish list, you might ask? Using paper ballots--that is  partisan? Using paper ballots is widely agreed upon as a reform to  protect our elections from manipulation. Does Leader McConnell object  to paper ballots? Does Leader McConnell believe paper ballots are  partisan? They are part of our elections, whoever wins.   How about this one: We want the postelection audits to make sure the  [[Page S5153]]  Russians or any other foreign power didn't interfere. Does Leader  McConnell object to auditing our elections to make sure the outcomes  are accurate? Are election audits partisan?   Making sure the States and localities have adequate resources to  update and maintain election infrastructure--does Leader McConnell  oppose that, when 21 attorneys general have said they don't have enough  money now to guard their election processes and machines from  manipulation by Russia or others?   So that is ``our partisan wish list''--paper ballots, election  audits, and money to protect us from the Russians. If Leader McConnell  opposes these policies, fine, but let him say so. I repeat, protecting  our election from Russian interference is not a Democratic issue or a  Republican issue or an Independent issue, and it is not a liberal issue  or a conservative issue. It is not a moderate issue. It is an issue  that goes to the wellspring of our democracy and something the Founding  Fathers warned about--foreign interference. James Madison, Thomas  Jefferson, George Washington, and Benjamin Franklin all were worried  about foreign interference in our elections, and now Leader McConnell  calls it partisan to worry about it? Please.   If Leader McConnell wants to debate other legislation than what we  propose and what has passed the House--legislation like the FIRE Act or  the Duty to Report Act or the Prevention of Foreign Interference with  Elections Act--bring it on. Let's do it. If Leader McConnell wants to  address election security in the appropriations process, we would  welcome his support on an amendment to send more funding to the States.  We want to get something done on election security because this is not  about party. This is a matter of national security. This is about the  sanctity of elections, something for which Americans have died for  generations. It is not partisan at all. It is the wellspring of our  democracy.   But so long as the Senate Republicans prevent legislation from  reaching the floor, so long as they oppose additional appropriations to  the States, so long as they malign election security provisions as  ``partisan wish lists,'' the critics are right to say that Leader  McConnell and Republican Senators are blocking election security  because, at the moment, that is true.                            ____________________     Madam President, on one last subject, after I conclude  my remarks, I will yield to my friend, colleague, and former roommate  from Illinois, who will ask this body to take up and pass what I  believe is a very important measure, temporary protected status for  Venezuelans currently residing in the United States.   Last week, the House passed bipartisan legislation that would grant  these protections--a lifeline to families who are facing a forced  return to unstable and dangerous situations in their country.   Few nations, outside wartime, have endured the economic,  humanitarian, and political devastation that Venezuela endures today.  Hospitals and pharmacies lack basic medicines. The rate of violent  crime has risen sharply, and 300,000 children are at risk of dying from  malnutrition. Venezuela clearly meets the standard for temporary  protected status. The situation is too dire and too dangerous for  Venezuelan nationals to return to the country.   So I am glad the House has taken action to pass these temporary  protections on a bipartisan basis, and the Senate should follow suit.  The President could have acted on his own to help Venezuelans living in  America, but he has repeatedly denied congressional requests to extend  TPS relief for them during this critical time of transition from the  despotic regime of Nicolas Maduro. President Trump's inaction has  compelled Congress to act.   So I salute my friend, Senator Durbin, as well as Senator Menendez,  our two leaders on this issue, as they ask the Senate to take up the  House-passed TPS bill. I hope, earnestly, that our friends on the other  side will let it go through.   I suggest the absence of a quorum for a moment so I might confer with  the Senator from Illinois.    Madam President, today I join my friend the majority  leader in offering a heartfelt thank you, congratulations, and happy  retirement to the principal of the Senate Page School, Ms. Kathryn  Weeden. She leaves the Senate and the Page School after 26 years of  illustrious service. In that time, she has transformed the lives of  countless young men and women interested in the workings of government.   The Senate Page School is an institution unlike any other on Capitol  Hill and very different from most schools in America. Every semester,  some of the most accomplished young men and women come to Washington  from across the country to learn about our government. In short order,  they are thrown into a routine that includes classes early in the  morning, classes late into the night, and a full-time job in the Senate  in between. When you consider the additional demands of homework,  getting acclimated to a new city, and new peers, you realize just how  important it is for these young men and women to have someone they can  trust, rely on, and go to for support and guidance. For the last 26  years, that person has been Ms. Weeden. With her at the helm, I have  always had confidence that the Senate's pages were getting the learning  experience of their lives.   For the minds she has inspired, for the institution she has shaped,  and for the Nation she has served, I want to say thank you and my best  wishes to Ms. Weeden. May others follow in the example of selflessness  and civic duty that she has gracefully set.                            ____________________
