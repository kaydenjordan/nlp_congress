 Mr. Speaker, in March, Speaker Pelosi called me a  dangerous nuisance for insisting that at least half of Congress come  back to vote on a $2 trillion bailout bill. This week, she has called  Congress into session to vote on a post office bill that is nothing but  political posturing.   Now, Speaker Pelosi told us we would probably be back in August to  vote on a PPP bill. What she didn't tell us is that the PPP would stand  for Pelosi's political posturing.   Let me read a quote from the chief operating officer of the U.S.  Postal Service that might explain what is going on. ``The decision to  consolidate mail processing facilities recognizes the urgent need to  reduce the size of the national mail processing network to eliminate  costly underutilized infrastructure.'' That was the chief operating  officer under Obama and Biden. In fact, that is from a press release in  2012 when they announced they were closing nine processing facilities  in the State of Kentucky. In fact, they didn't remove the equipment,  they locked the doors and turned out the lights and shut it down  forever, even in Lexington, Kentucky, our second biggest city in  Kentucky. A year earlier they closed down a processing facility in my  district, the Obama administration did--Obama/Biden.   I include those press releases in the Record.                              [Feb. 23, 2012]                Kentucky Mail Processing Closings Announced         Kentuckiana District--As a result of studies begun five       months ago, the Postal Service has made the decision to move       all mail processing processing operations from:        Bowling Green, KY Processing and Distribution Facility       (P&DF) to the Nashville, TN, Processing and Distribution       Center (P&DC).        Campton, KY, Customer Service Mail Processing Center       (CSMPC) to the Louisville, KY, P&DC.        Elizabethtown, KY, CSMPC to the Louisville P&DC.        Hazard, KY, CSMPC to the Knoxville, TN, P&DC.        Lexington, KY, P&DC to the Louisville P&DC and the       Knoxville P&DC.        London, KY P&DF to the Knoxville P&DC.        Paducah, KY, P&DF to the Evansville, IN, P&DF.        Somerset, KY, CSMPC to the Knoxville P&DC.        Once the transfers are completed, the mail processing       operation at the closing sites will cease. There will be no       change to any of the retail units, business mail entry units       or vehicle maintenance facilities at these locations at this       time.        It also has been determined as a result of the study of the       Louisville, KY, Annex, that there was no significant       opportunity to improve efficiency or service through       consolidation of mail processing operations, and no changes       will be made at this time.        The Postal Service has experienced a 25 percent decline in       First-Class Mail volume since 2006, and receives no tax       dollars for its operations, relying instead on the sale of       postage, and postal products and services.        ``The decision to consolidate mail processing facilities       recognizes the urgent need to reduce the size of the national       mail processing network to eliminate costly underutilized       infrastructure,'' said Chief Operating Officer.       ``Consolidating operations is necessary if the Postal Service       is to remain viable to provide mail service to the nation.''        Specific dates have not been set for the transition. Until       a specific date has been announced, residential and business       mailers will continue to be served through the current       facilities.        In December 2011, the Postal Service agreed to impose a       moratorium on closing or consolidating post offices and mail       processing facilities prior to May 15, 2012, to give Congress       and the Administration the opportunity to enact an       alternative plan.        This delay was designed to allow Congress sufficient time       to enact comprehensive postal legislation. In the meantime,       the Postal Service continued all necessary steps required for       the review of these facilities, including public       notifications, public input meetings and consideration of       public comments.        Implementation of this consolidation is contingent upon the       outcome of pending rulemaking for a proposal to revise       existing service standards. This announcement is provided in       advance so that appropriate planning and notification can be       made in accordance with existing employee agreements.        A list of mail processing studies and their status is       available at usps.com/ourfuturenetwork. Specific information       about individual studies, including public meeting summaries       and summary briefs, is posted on the website, usps.com/      areamailprocessing, as it becomes available.                                   ____                               [Apr. 28, 2011]        Ashland Mail Processing Operations Moving to Charleston, WV         Ashland, KY--As a result of a study begun in September       2010, the Postal Service has  [[Page H4274]]       made the decision to move mail processing operations from the       Ashland Processing and Distribution Facility to the       Charleston WV Processing and Distribution Facility.        Kentuckiana District Manager James W. Kiser said, ``Given       the drastic 20 percent decline in mail volume the Postal       Service has experienced since 2007, we must take action to       reduce the size of our mail processing network. Consolidating       operations and placing our people where we need them is       necessary if the Postal Service is to remain viable to       provide mail service to the nation.''        I understand our employees' concern over this move,'' Kiser       added, ``but the consolidation makes sense given the fiscal       realities. The Charleston facility has the capacity to handle       the additional workload and we can realize significant       savings by shifting operations there.''        The transition is expected to be completed by January 2012.       Some employees may be reassigned to the Charleston facility       or to other vacant positions as a result of the move.        This move will not cause any changes in local mail       delivery,'' said Kiser. ``Letters mailed to local addresses       will be delivered the next day, the same as before. I am       confident the transition will be smooth and transparent to       our customers and they will continue to receive the same       excellent service they always have.''        There will be no change in service standards for 96.3       percent of mail. However, as a result of the consolidation,       service to 403-406, 413-414, 417-418, 430-432 and 456 will       change from overnight to 2-day. Service to 246-248, 250-253,       258-259 and 261-266 will improve from 2-day to overnight.       ``The significant cost savings and productivity gains       expected from this consolidation were deciding factors in       making this very difficult decision,'' said Kiser.        Full retail services will still be available at the Ashland       Post Office.        The Ashland Business Mail Entry Unit will remain open for       large volume business mailers. Large volume business mailers       will be able to bring their mail to the Ashland Business Mail       Entry Unit at 1140 Carter Ave.     Mr. Speaker, my mail, if I send it to my neighbor, goes  to Charleston, West Virginia, before it comes back to Kentucky. Is this  part of some vast conspiracy? No. It's part of a decade's long  realignment process where the post office is trying to match the needs  of the consumers to the post office infrastructure.   These voter suppression conspiracies, who knows what the Democrats  will blame next. Last month they were blaming the Census, this month  they are blaming the post office, probably next month they will blame  Amtrak.
