 Mr. Speaker, I want every American to look at this  picture of what, sadly, has become ``the new normal'' in many cities  across our great Nation. The one common thread for all of these cities  is that they are run by liberal Democrats who tolerate these criminal  activities: buildings deliberately being set on fire, department stores  being looted of merchandise, police cars, as you see here, being bashed  and torched, and our brave law enforcement officers being executed in  broad daylight.   Imagine, if you are an owner of these businesses who invested a  lifetime of savings, waking up to their places of work being destroyed  through no fault of their own.   Here is my question: Why have Democrats remained silent on condemning  these acts of violence?   Is it any coincidence that there is not one Democrat standing with us  tonight? Where are they? They are not here.   I would submit that this is a preview of coming attractions to cities  and towns all across our great country if this lawlessness is allowed  to continue.   Now is the time to support law enforcement, not defund law  enforcement.   Now is the time to enforce our laws and put those criminals behind  bars if they destroy private property.   Now is the time to get back to we, the people, not we, the criminals,  not we, the government, not we, the politician.   In closing, you do not build up America by tearing down America.
