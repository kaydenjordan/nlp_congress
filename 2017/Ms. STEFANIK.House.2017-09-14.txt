 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of half a million  students across the country who will lose access to critical financial  aid without action by Congress.   Perkins loans are an important resource for low- and middle-income  students. A majority of those receiving this aid come from families  with household incomes less than $30,000 a year. In my district alone,  this program is used by students at Clarkson, Paul Smith's College, and  SUNY Potsdam, SUNY Canton, and SUNY Plattsburgh.   Without congressional action, these students will lose access to  these important loans after September 30 when this program expires. I  have introduced H.R. 2482, the Perkins Loan Program Extension Act, that  will reauthorize this aid for two more years. I have been grateful to  receive support from 160 bipartisan cosponsors.   Mr. Speaker, we must ensure that low-income students have access to a  quality education, and the Perkins Loan Program is a critical tool to  help them succeed. I urge the House to swiftly pass my bill before the  end of the month.                            ____________________
