 Mr. Speaker, I was awakened today to the news of a  gentleman from South Africa, who was one of the great historic men I  have experienced in my life, an antiapartheid activist and a blessed  man, Ahmed Kathrada, known as Kathy, passed away.   Kathy was an Indian gentleman who went to Johannesburg with his  family as a young man and found that, at age 8, he had to move there  because there were no Indian schools in South Africa. He became, at a  very early age, an activist for social reform and against apartheid,  first for Indian rights and then against apartheid and for South  African rights.   He was arrested, along with Nelson Mandela, Walter Sisulu, Mbeki,  Goldberg, and other leaders of the ANC, tried in the famous Rivonia  trial in 1963, and convicted as they all were. He spent 18 years in  prison on Robben Island, with Nelson Mandela and others, and 8  additional years in prison. But when released from prison, he didn't  see bitterness, he saw only peace and a period of commitment to  resolving race relations in South Africa.   He befriended the people who had been his guards and who had  subjected him to minority rights. He was elected to the African  National Congress party as a delegate to parliament and served as one  of Nelson Mandela's aides. He received four honorary degrees in his  life, one from the University of Kentucky, one from Michigan State, and  one from the University of Missouri. He moved back to Robben Island,  lived there, and gave tours of the museum.   On my second trip to South Africa, where I met him on a second  occasion, he led our group on our tour. It was remarkable to see the  prison guards hand  [[Page H2505]]  the key to the prison to the former prisoner.   Kathy was a great human being and a humanitarian individual who  served the Indian people, the South African nation, and humanity in a  superb fashion. His was a life well-lived. I was fortunate to have met  him, and I am sorry for his loss.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join you today in this 1-hour  session.   I am the co-chair of the Medical Research Caucus. As the co-chair, I  am most aware of the need for research and how much it has helped our  country and how much it has helped many cities and universities in  their efforts to save us.   For a long time, I have realized that my enemy--and I am not  suggesting to anybody, or I don't want anybody to get the wrong  impression that I don't think that we need a military, and a strong  military, but I have known that the odds of me dying from something  that happens initiated by North Korea or Iran or ISIS is about nil. But  I also know that the odds of my dying from heart disease, stroke,  diabetes, Alzheimer's, cancer is likely. So my enemy is disease.   And who is working to protect me and be my defense department? The  National Institutes of Health. That is my defense department. That is  all of America's defense department, for we all have, as an enemy,  disease. Cures and treatments will be found through grants and research  coordinated through the National Institutes of Health.   Francis Collins, the genius who is the Director of the NIH, is really  our secretary of defense because he is fighting to find cures and  treatments not just for us, but more so for the next generation and the  next generation.   So it is a perfect situation for us to act to protect our  constituents against their most serious enemy, and that is disease, and  to protect them no matter how we fund it. For the deficit hawks who  might suggest that some of the expenses be paid for by future  generations, that is who is going to get the treatments and the cures,  and people not even born yet.   In 1954, my father was a pediatrician, and he gave the Salk vaccine  to second grade children for polio. He didn't give it to me in the fall  of 1954 or the spring of 1954 because that wasn't his charge; it was to  give it to second graders in a test of the Salk vaccine.   I came down with polio in September of 1954. And but for medical  research not being a year earlier when the Salk vaccine became  available to everyone in the spring of 1955, I would not have had  polio.   It affected me as a young person. I spent 3 months in a hospital,  lots of time with physical therapists, had surgeries, and today wear a  brace because, without it, I wouldn't be standing here.   My future, I am not sure what it will be, but it would have been a  lot better if we had the Salk vaccine a year earlier. For every cure  and treatment that comes a little later and a little later are that  many more people that will suffer from it.   So this nearly $6 billion cut is going to affect people's lives in a  meaningful way. For that reason, I am proud to join Mr. Garamendi and  my other colleagues here to oppose this $6 billion cut and also to  advocate for increases in funding to the National Institutes of Health,  our real defense department fighting for all Americans against the  number one enemy we all have, which is catastrophic illnesses and  diseases.
