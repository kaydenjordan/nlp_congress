 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1 because  I want America to live up to its democratic principles, and that means  having a government that really is for the people and not just for  those with the means. This bill is about ensuring that all voters,  regardless of ZIP Code, race, or party, can participate in our  democracy.   I am proud that H.R. 1 includes a bill I introduced, the Same-Day  Voter Registration Act, which will increase access to the ballot box  across the country.   Same-day registration already exists in 17 States and the District of  Columbia. In those locations, more people, not fewer, participate in  elections.   I spent nearly two decades organizing to make sure New Mexicans,  including those in Indian Country and in rural America, have access to  our democracy.   This commonsense provision gets rid of arbitrary registration  deadlines, which often fall long before the real time needed to process  voter registration applications. Same-day voter registration is one of  many provisions in H.R. 1 that will make elections more accessible.
