 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and  work of my dear friend, Mrs. Mary E. Wheeler of Yorkville, New York.   I came to know Mary in a role no one ever wishes to have, that of a  Gold Star mother. Mary's son, Private First Class Joseph Keith Wheeler,  a United States marine, was killed in combat on March 31, 1968, in  Quang Tri Province in Vietnam, at just 18 years old.   Mary and her family were devastated by the loss of Joseph. But  through Mary's pain, she found great purpose to support other Gold Star  mothers and their families, as well as Active-Duty members, veterans,  and their loved ones.   Mary was active until the day she passed in the American Gold Star  Mothers Chapter 56 in Utica, New York. This led to Mary being national  president of the American Gold Star Mothers from 1999 through 2000,  meeting Gold Star mothers and families from across this Nation and  interacting with political leaders of both parties in Washington for  commonsense policy to support veterans and their families, especially  those who paid the ultimate sacrifice, like her dear son, Joseph.   Mary was heavily involved in other veteran service organizations,  such as The American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Military Order  of the Purple Heart Auxiliary, and countless other organizations in our  community, including the Whitestown Senior Center and the Salvation  Army, which she supported her entire life.   Mary was also dedicated to her family: her late husband, Charles; her  children; grandchildren; and great-grandchildren. Mary's great- grandson, Shaun, and her great-granddaughter, Skylar, have a special  place in my heart as Skylar's grandmother, Felicia, was my longtime  administrative assistant for over 25 years. They all were a very  important part of my life, and I considered them family. So I had  another connection to Mary through her great-grandchildren.   Words cannot do justice to the many contributions by Mary throughout  her  [[Page H5743]]  great life, the many lives she has touched, including the mothers and  the families she supported. It was an honor and a privilege to get to  know Mary, not only through the great work she has done, but to know  what a genuine person and kind soul she was and a wonderful mother,  grandmother, and great-grandmother.    Mary will be an inspiration to all of us for so many years to come,  and her hard work and dedication will be felt by veterans and their  families for generations not just in our community, but throughout the  Nation for her great work and devotion to this cause.   My sincerest condolences to Mary's family and her friends, and  everyone in our community for this difficult time in losing Mary, who  was a wonderful, honored member of our community.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize National Dairy  Month, which we celebrate each June.   The dairy industry is a major force in our economy. It is the largest  single segment of New York's agricultural industry. There are more than  3,500 dairy farms across New York. This month and every month, we  celebrate their contributions to communities across America.   Many of the dairy farms in the 22nd District are family owned and  operated. As they continue to recover from the disruptions of the  pandemic, I will work tirelessly to support our local dairy farmers the  same way they worked tirelessly to deliver for our communities and our  Nation.   People of all ages, especially children, receive crucial nutrients to  grow healthy and strong by drinking milk. That is why I have  cosponsored bipartisan legislation like the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids  Act to ensure that every child will have access to nutrition-rich milk  in school cafeterias, just like the awesome chocolate milk that I got  when I was growing up. As Elon Musk said, ``Chocolate milk is insanely  good.''   As we celebrate National Dairy Month, we appreciate the dairy farmers  who both drive our local economies and ensure our communities are  healthy. Let's put milk, whole milk, and chocolate milk back in our  schools.                            ____________________
