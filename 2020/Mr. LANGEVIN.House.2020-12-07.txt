 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the Conference  Report to accompany the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal  year 2021 that we will be considering tomorrow.   Mr. Speaker, this is my 20th NDAA, and as ever, I am incredibly proud  of the bipartisan work that went in to creating it. Amidst all the 1300  provisions, however, I want to focus on section 1752.   Section 1752 is based on my bill, H.R. 7331, the National Cyber  Director Act, and it is the result of more than 10 years of  deliberative thought and advocacy. The provision is simple enough. It  creates an Office of the National Cyber Director within the Executive  Office of the President. The office is led by a director who will be  Presidentially appointed and confirmed by the Senate.   The National Cyber Director is charged with being the President's  principal adviser on matters of cybersecurity policy with developing  and overseeing implementation of the national cyber strategy. He or she  will  [[Page H6900]]  also be responsible for coordinating government response to serious  cyber incidents. And as I said, simple enough, but this represents a  complete sea change in the way cybersecurity is handled in the Federal  Government.   The need could not be more urgent. Of course, cyber operations,  whether carried out by criminals or nation states, continue to threaten  us as a Nation. Hardly a day goes by where we don't read about a new  ransomware attack taking down an entire hospital system or shutting  down businesses. Our adversaries target our elections to strike at the  heart of our democracy. They target our defense industrial base that  gives us our competitive edge. They are even targeting vaccine research  that may be the key to ending the terrible pandemic that we are living  through.   Mr. Speaker, cyberspace is a new domain, and the first that has been  created entirely by humankind. We would not expect that emerging  security challenges in cyberspace would be easy to tackle, and, of  course, they have proven to be quite difficult.   After all, many security paradigms that developed about borders are  virtually meaningless when it is as easy to attack a computer across  the room as it is to attack one half a world away. While decidedly  thorny, these challenges are not insurmountable.   However, the Federal Government has not risen to the challenges as  well as we could hope. There are many reasons for this, but probably  the most important of which is that nobody really is in charge.  Cybersecurity is often passed off as an IT problem, best left to the  geeks to handle, instead of being recognized as an operational risk  that needs attention from senior leadership.   Most Federal agencies do not have cybersecurity in their core  missions, so investments in cyber capabilities can fall by the wayside.  Computer systems also pervade every aspect of the Federal Government's  work, so coordination is required across the entire interagency.   The failures to rise to address these challenges poses real risk to  the government. Sensitive government data, such as clearance  information stored at the Office of Personnel Management, has been  stolen. U.S. corporations suffer billions of dollars in damages each  year from cyber incidents, and other adversaries increasingly view the  cyber domain as ideal for conducting asymmetric warfare in the ``gray  zone,'' below the level of armed conflict.   Mr. Speaker, for more than a decade, I have been involved in numerous  efforts to root out underlying causes of the government's inability to  get its arms around the cybersecurity problem. Most recently, I had the  distinct privilege of serving on the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, a  14-member body chartered by Congress to develop a strategic approach to  protect the United States from cyber incidents of significant  consequence.   One of the things that these efforts have universally uncovered--a  finding endorsed recently by the Government Accountability Office--is  that a lack of centralized leadership in the White House is holding the  government back.   Mr. Speaker, only the White House has the ability to compel  interagency cooperation and ensure that cybersecurity efforts are  synergistic and deduplicated.   Only the White House can ensure that budgets are adequate, both for  internal cyber defense and external cybersecurity programs aimed at  protecting the private sector.   Only the White House can effectively coordinate incident response  across two dozen agencies with some cybersecurity responsibility.   Now, Presidents Bush and Obama both made strides in improving  cybersecurity policy coordination within the White House, changes that  were at first carried forward by President Trump and his Homeland  Security adviser. But none of them gave the position they created the  gravitas and authority it needed to be successful. And eventually,  then-national Director John Bolton, eventually eliminated the  cybersecurity coordinating position altogether.   Congress needed to step in and provide strategic direction with the  National Cyber Director Act that we have here. Finally, we will have  the accountability that comes from having a leader within the Executive  Office of the President that we can interrogate about cyber strategy  writ large, and that we, as the Congress, will in turn be accountable  to our constituents for ensuring the strategy is executed and resourced  properly.   This NDAA will be an incredibly important bill in the history of  cybersecurity legislation, and I am honored to have played a key role  in advancing it.                                time  1800    Mr. Speaker, like any bill a decade in the making, many hands have  gotten us to this point with the National Cyber Director Act. First  off, I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to Speaker Nancy Pelosi for  appointing me as her designee to the Cyberspace Solarium Commission.  Developing and implementing the commission report has been one of the  highlights of my congressional career, and much of the progress that we  have made on the National Cyber Director is due to my fellow  commissioners.   I want to start with Congressman Patrick Murphy as my original ally  on this proposal, based on his experience in these Halls and in the  executive branch.   Tom Fanning brought his expertise as a major utility executive in  crafting a recommendation that ensures accountability.   Frank Cilluffo focused relentlessly on appropriately scoping the  authorities of the office, while Suzanne Spaulding fought to ensure  that the National Cyber Director will have insight into all U.S.  operations in the cyber domain.   Dr. Samantha Ravich's initial scepticism was essential to making sure  the final recommendation reflects the realities of working within the  Executive Office of the President.   Finally, Chris Inglis's invaluable feedback means that the bill we  vote on tomorrow will fit squarely within the strategic vision laid out  by the commission. Despite my years working on this proposal, I was  always impressed by Chris's ability to elegantly connect the National  Cyber Director recommendation with our broader mission.   I would never have been exposed to the idea of a stronger  coordinating authority within the White House were it not for my time  on the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Commission on  Cybersecurity for the 44th Presidency, which I was proud to co-chair.  My fellow co-chairs, General Harry Raduege, Scott Charney, and  especially Congressman   Michael McCaul, all helped shape my thinking  during my first deep dive on this topic. And, of course, we would have  been lost without the expert guidance of CSIS's Jim Lewis, the  commission's executive director.   After 9 years of trying to pass a bill to codify a cybersecurity role  within the White House, what changed this year?   Well, quite frankly, John Bolton and his poor decisionmaking changed  the equation. Given the ever-increasing threat in cyberspace, I don't  think anyone realistically thought that somebody would dare eliminate  the cyber coordinator at the White House. Yet, in one of the worst  cybersecurity policy moves ever seen, Bolton did just that, making  clear the need for congressional action to establish a permanent cyber  director.   That need was well understood by Chairman Adam Smith, who has backed  the inclusion of Solarium recommendations in the NDAA since day one and  who has consistently supported the National Cyber Director Act.   Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney also provided vital support. When I first  spoke to her about the Solarium report, she immediately got why  leadership in the White House was so important. In addition to joining  the National Cyber Director Act as an original cosponsor, she convened  a legislative hearing that teed up consideration on the House floor.  The witnesses at that hearing--former House Intelligence Committee  Chairman   Mike Rogers, former Obama Cybersecurity Coordinator Michael  Daniel, Tenable CEO Amit Yoran, and Suzanne Spaulding--made a clear and  compelling case for an expedited consideration of the bill.   Chairman  Jim McGovern and his Rules Committee colleagues took up  this charge, ruling in order an amendment consisting of the text of  H.R. 7331 during our floor debate on the NDAA.  [[Page H6901]]    As my colleagues well know, passing the House is only half the  battle. Here is where my fellow legislative commissioners really  carried the day:   Senator Ben Sasse, who authored the legislation to create the  Cyberspace Solarium Commission, made more efficiently organizing the  government a central part of his push for improved cybersecurity.   Our colleague and Solarium co-chair, Congressman   Mike Gallagher,  has been with me every step of the way, on the National Cyber Director  and the 16 other Solarium provisions we moved through the NDAA process.   Anyone who claims bipartisanship is dead in Washington has not met  these two exemplars of comity and serious policy deliberativeness.   In the Senate, my counterpart, the chair of the Senate Armed Services  Committee's Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Senator Mike Rounds, has  been a negotiating partner without equal. Senator Rounds came to the  table with an open mind, asked tough but fair questions, requested  additional information about our proposal, and, at the end of the day,  helped to strengthen it and push it through the conference process.   I also thank Congressman Katko, who went to bat for the National  Cyber Director in conversations with the White House.   A special note of thanks is reserved for our other Solarium co-chair,  Senator Angus King. Senator King has been the soul of the Solarium  Commission, and I continue to be in awe of his steady leadership  throughout the process. Senator King's maxims--whether that ``sloppy  structure leads to sloppy policy'' or that we needed ``one throat to  choke'' in the executive branch--perfectly encapsulate the central  theme and issues at stake. I can say for a fact that no one fought  harder to ensure that the Senate accepted a strong version of the  National Cyber Director Act in the conference process.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, as all of my colleagues know, we would be lost  in this institution without the staff that supports us. I never would  have begun this journey in cybersecurity policy if it were not for Jake  Olcott, my former staff director on the Committee on Homeland  Security's Subcommittee on Emerging Threats, Cyber Security, and  Science and Technology.   Likewise, my then-MLA Davis Hake helped draft and introduce the  Executive Cyberspace Authorities Act of 2010 that provided the  scaffolding for the National Cyber Director Act; and his successor,  Michael Hermann, further refined the concept.    The Solarium Commission staff has been, frankly, extraordinary to  work with and a great testament to the commission's executive director,  Admiral Mark Montgomery. From day one, Mark challenged us to draft a  report that would be actionable, not just a doorstop, and this NDAA is  a realization of his vision and his unflagging work ethic.   My fellow legislators' Solarium liaisons--Steve Smith on Senator  King's staff, Chas Morrison on Congressman Gallagher's, and Brett  Fetterly on Senator Sasse's--stepped up to ensure that all of the oars  stayed rowing in the same direction, no matter how choppy the waters.   We would never have had a hearing on the bill were it not for Emily  Burns of Chairwoman Maloney's staff. Lori Ismail was our critical link  at the Rules Committee to ensure the bill would have the opportunity to  be debated and voted upon.   On the Senate side, Jeff Rothblum from Ranking Member Peter's staff  helped us navigate the jurisdictional hurdles that come with any piece  of cybersecurity legislation and offered insightful comments and  guidance throughout the process.   During the conference process itself, we relied heavily on Katie  Sutton and Kirk McConnell, two true pros on the Senate Armed Services  Committee staff; and Eric Snelgrove, staff lead for Ranking Member  Elise Stefanik.   Lastly, but surely not least, I want to acknowledge my own staff. My  MLA, Caroline Goodson, ably assisted by our defense fellow, Captain  Mike Lake, thrived in her first NDAA and expertly balanced the many  priorities I have within my IETC portfolio and for my constituents in  Rhode Island.   My cybersecurity fellows David Wagner, Eric Saund, and particularly  Allison Browning, have all been brilliant minds and wonderful team  players who have helped me get the most out of the Solarium Commission.   At the end of the day, though, this bill never would have gotten done  without my IETC cyber lead, Josh Stiefel. Josh immediately understood  the importance of the National Cyber Director, based on his time  working on cybersecurity in the interagency. Using that experience and  his skill at negotiating, he definitely steered the National Cyber  Director Act--and more than two dozen other Solarium recommendations-- through the NDAA. One of the hardest things to do is to entrust someone  else with something of great value to you, but I never had any  hesitation letting Josh work the staff-level discussions. I am  incredibly lucky to have him on my team.   Finally, and most importantly, the National Cyber Director Act, the  dozens of other Solarium recommendations, and countless other cyber  initiatives that I have developed over the years would never have  existed were it not for my legislative director, Nick Leiserson. Nick  has been the engine on my cyber policy work for 6 years. His  legislative expertise and commitment to advancing effective  cybersecurity policy have elevated the cyber discussion on Capitol Hill  and kept our country safer. He has worked tirelessly for many years,  and I am deeply grateful for how he has turned the National Cyber  Director idea into legislation and finally into reality.   Mr. Speaker, this year's NDAA is one of the most important pieces of  cybersecurity legislation ever to be considered by Congress. There are  so many cyber provisions--from creating the Joint Cyber Planning Office  at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to requiring a  cyber force structure assessment--that we had to create a new title for  the bill. But the crown jewel is the National Cyber Director Act.   I look forward to working with President Biden, Vice President  Harris, and the new administration to stand up this office. I have  often said that there are no silver bullets in cybersecurity  policymaking, and I still believe that. But I know that I will sleep  more soundly knowing that there is a central coordinating figure in the  White House empowered to protect the country. I hope that the legacy of  this bill will be safety, security, and stability in cyberspace for  decades to come.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
