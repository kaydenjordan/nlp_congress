 Madam Speaker, the new GDP numbers announced  this morning confirm that Washington Democrats' reckless spending has  sent our Nation into a recession. On top of paying an extra $5,200 this  year because of the President's inflation crisis, Americans are now  having to live in fear that they will see their paychecks cut or they  will lose their jobs.   This incredibly troubling news comes just 1 day after the Federal  Reserve hiked interest rates, which means more Americans won't be able  to afford to buy a car or a new home.   Forty-year high inflation, skyrocketing interest rates, and now a  recession--these are the disastrous consequences of one-party Democrat  rule in Congress and in the White House.   What is their predictable reaction?   Yesterday, they announced a bill to increase taxes and to spend  hundreds of billions of more dollars. It is shameful. I will fight  tooth and nail to protect Americans from the left's out-of-control  spending.                            ____________________
