 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the remarkable life  and legacy of a young constituent, Gabriella Miller, who passed away on  this day 8 years ago due to an inoperable brain tumor.   Gabriella was a fierce fighter not just in her own battle with  cancer, but as an advocate on behalf of the millions of other children  who have suffered from this disease. In the months following her  terminal diagnosis at age 9, Gabriella became a national force for  change, urging Congress to grant increased funding and to develop  better treatments and cures for childhood cancer.  [[Page H5878]]    Her passionate plea for lawmakers to ``stop talking, start doing''  helped deliver a successful push to pass the Gabriella Miller Kids  First Research Act, bipartisan legislation named in her honor.  Gabriella's family joined sponsor Representative Eric Cantor from  Virginia and President Barack Obama in the Oval Office in 2014 for the  bill signing.   The Kids First program established a 10-year Pediatric Research  Initiative Fund and led to the creation of the National Institutes of  Health Kids First Pediatric and Data Resource Center. It has allocated  millions of dollars to research grants looking into pediatric cancer  and rare diseases, supporting over 60 research projects.   I am honored to carry on Gabriella's mission by sponsoring the  Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act 2.0, which would deliver a new  sustained and expanded funding source for this lifesaving program.   It has been 8 years since we lost Gabriella, and there is still a  long fight ahead to better understand, treat, and ultimately cure  childhood cancer. The 2.0 bill would give a dramatic boost to that  fight and help demonstrate that Congress is serious about ensuring that  no other family has to go through what the Miller family has.   Madam Speaker, I share Gabriella's story today so that her legacy  continues to live on. May Congress have the courage to answer  Gabriella's call to ``stop talking, start doing'' and deliver the  resources needed to treat and cure childhood cancer.                            ____________________
