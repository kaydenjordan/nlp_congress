 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Fiscal State of the Nation Resolution, H. Con. Res. 44, which the House  will consider later today.   When I came to Congress, I promised my constituents that we would  make responsible decisions about our Nation's fiscal future. It is  extremely difficult, however, to make good decisions without good  information.   The Fiscal State of the Nation Resolution will require the  Comptroller General to provide an annual assessment of our Nation's  finances to Congress, a small but important first step in getting our  fiscal house in order.   Similarly, my bipartisan bill, the Duplication Scoring Act, would  ensure  [[Page H6131]]  Members are aware when new bills potentially duplicate existing  programs in areas which have already been identified by the GAO.   I urge all Members to support passage of the Fiscal State of the  Nation act today and renew our commitment to putting our Nation on a  sustainable fiscal trajectory.                            ____________________
