 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the impact of  the broad-brush cuts in Speaker McCarthy's plan, a plan that would hurt  Virginians, including $30 billion in cuts for veteran spending that  would hurt the veterans I represent and cuts to the vital Meals on  Wheels program that would hurt seniors across Virginia's Seventh  District.   To hear about the impact of this incredibly important program, I  reached out to Virginians I serve to talk about the program, and I  heard from hundreds of seniors, volunteers, doctors, and caregivers,  who have seen the benefits of Meals on Wheels.   Carolyn from Woodbridge, who lost her husband a year before breaking  her hip and turning to Meals on Wheels for support, called this service  ``a true blessing as I heal.''   Anita from Fredericksburg whose 94-year-old aunt relies on the  program said: ``Please vote against defunding Virginia's senior meal  delivery services.''   When Shawn from Caroline County's grandmother suffered a stroke,  Meals on Wheels made sure she had lunch so his parents would not have  to quit their jobs to care for her.   At a time when thousands of Virginia seniors are at risk of hunger,  the Meals on Wheels program should not be on the chopping block. I urge  my colleagues to vote against this legislation.
