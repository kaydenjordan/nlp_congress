 Mr. Speaker, last week, I had the great honor to be  joined in this Chamber by many brave Americans and their family members  who were held hostage when student militants stormed the U.S. Embassy  in Iran on November 4, 1979.   For 444 days, 52 brave Americans were held hostage and held captive  against their will. On behalf of those brave Americans, I rise in  support of my bipartisan, bicameral legislation that would award the  Congressional Gold Medal to the 52 hostages of the Iran hostage crisis.   As it currently stands, almost 300 Members of this Chamber have  pledged their support for this legislation, a showing of true  bipartisanship in an oftentimes divided Chamber, and the bill has  received overwhelming support in the Senate, as well.   Despite mock firing squads, beatings, solitary confinement, lack of  food, and psychological torture, these American hostages maintained  their strength and resilience. Back at home, we remember  [[Page H9817]]  that Americans remained united in their support for these hostages,  with many tying yellow ribbons around trees in signs of solidarity.   I was 17 years old in 1979, and I well remember, as many Americans  do, that the Iran hostage crisis was a painful time in our history, but  that pain cannot stop us from recognizing the true pain and sacrifice  by these special Americans.   On behalf of the entire Congress, I give special thanks to the  chairman of Commission 52, Brock Pierce, and Ezra Friedlander, the  project manager, for helping to gather support for this bill. It is  truly a public service.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the swift passage of this bill so we can  immediately send it to the President's desk to be signed into law.
