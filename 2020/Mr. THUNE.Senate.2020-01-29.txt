 I have a question for the President's counsel.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. To the President's counsel:         Would you please respond to the arguments or assertions the       House managers just made in response to the previous       question?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, a couple of points  that I would like to make.   Manager Schiff suggested that there was no evidence the President was  actually interested in burden-sharing because he didn't, apparently,  according to David Hale, raise it in the telephone conversation he had  with Gordon Sondland that Hale seems to have overheard in a restaurant  in Kiev.   Let's look at the real evidence.   As we explained, on June 24, there is an email in the record. It is  an email from one person at the Department of Defense to another, with  the subject line: ``POTUS' follow-up''--President of the United States'  follow-up--asking specifically about burden-sharing.   It reads: ``What do other NATO members spend to support Ukraine?''   That was what they were following up on for the President.   In the transcript of the July 25 call itself, the President said:         We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time on Ukraine, much       more than the European countries are doing, and they should       be helping you more than we are. Germany does almost nothing       for you. All they do is talk, and I think it is something you       should really ask them about.    He goes on to say that he talks to Angela Merkel about it and that  they are not really doing as much as the United States is doing. He is  raising burden-sharing, and President Zelensky agreed with him.   Manager Schiff also suggested that there is evidence of some  connection  [[Page S647]]  between the military assistance and investigations into 2016 election  interference because of a statement that Acting Chief of Staff Mulvaney  made at a press conference, but that has been made clear in the record,  since that press conference, that what he was saying was garbled and/or  misunderstood. He immediately clarified and said on that date: ``The  President never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did  anything related to the server.''   Similarly, he issued a statement just the other day, making clear  again--this is from his counsel; so it is phrased in the third person:  ``. . . nor did Mr. Mulvaney ever have a conversation with the  President or anyone else indicating that Ukrainian military aid was  withheld in exchange for the Ukrainian investigation of Burisma, the  Bidens, or the 2016 election.''   That was Mr. Mulvaney's statement.   Lastly, as to the point of whether this Chamber should hear from  Ambassador Bolton--and I think it is important to consider what that  means, because it is not just a question of, well, should we just hear  one witness? That is not what the real question is going to be.   For this institution, the real question is, What is the precedent  that is going to be set for what is an acceptable way for the House of  Representatives to bring an impeachment of a President of the United  States to this Chamber, and can it be done in a hurried, half-baked,  partisan fashion?   They didn't even subpoena John Bolton. They didn't even try to get  his testimony. To insist now that this body will become the  investigative body--that this body will have to do all of the  discovery--then, this institution will be effectively paralyzed for  months on end because it will have to sit as a Court of Impeachment  while now discovery will be done. It would be Ambassador Bolton, and if  there are going to be witnesses, in order for there to be, as they  said, a fair trial, fair adjudication, then, the President would have  to have his opportunity to call his witnesses, and there would be  depositions. This would drag on for months. Then that will be the new  precedent. Then that is the way all impeachments will operate in the  future, where the House doesn't have to do the work--it does it quickly  and throws it over the transom--and this institution gets derailed and  has to deal with it. That should not be the precedent that is set here  for the way this body will have to handle all impeachments in the  future, because, if it becomes that easy for the House to do it, it  will be doing it a lot.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Massachusetts.    Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from South Dakota.    I have a question to send to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Thune's question is for counsel for the  President:         Would you please respond to the arguments or assertions the       House managers just made in response to the previous       questions?    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S666, January 29, 2020, first column, the following  appears: Would you please respond to the arguments or assertions  the House Managers just made in response to the previous  questions?      The online Record has been corrected to read: Would you please  respond to the arguments or assertions the House managers just  made in response to the previous questions?    ========================= END NOTE =========================       Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice.   Thank you, Senator, for the question.   I haven't read recently the case that was cited about the missing  witness rule. So I can't say specifically what is in it, but I am  willing to bet that the missing witness rule does not apply when there  has been a valid assertion of a privilege or other immunity for keeping  the witness out of court. For example, if they tried to subpoena the  defendant's lawyer and the defendant said, ``Wait, I have attorney- client privilege; you can't subpoena him,'' they are not going to be  able to get an adverse inference from that.   That is critical because, as I have gone through multiple times--and  you know, we keep going back and forth on this--they keep representing  that there was a blanket defiance and there was no explanation and  there was no legal basis for what the President was doing. And it is  just not true. There were letters back and forth. I put them up on the  screen. There were specific immunities asserted. There were specific  legal deficiencies in the subpoenas that were sent.   This is important because if you are going to impeach the President  of the United States, turning square corners and proceeding by the law  matters. For the House managers to come here and say it was blanket  defiance, it was unprecedented, you have to draw an adverse inference  against them because they didn't respond to any of our document  subpoenas--all the document subpoenas were issued without  authorization. Maybe they disagree with us, but they can't just say we  provided no rationale and you have to draw an adverse inference. There  is a specific legal rationale provided.   They didn't try to engage in the accommodation process, and they  didn't try to go to court. And now, yes, it is true that our position  is that when they go to the court, article III courts don't have  jurisdiction over that. Their position is, article III courts do have  jurisdiction over that.   They believe that they can get a court order to require us to comply  with a valid subpoena, but they never tried to establish in court that  their subpoenas were valid. We have an assertion of a legal deficiency  on one side. They think it is different. They don't want to go to court  to get it resolved.   We have the assertion of absolute immunity from congressional  compulsion for senior advisers to the President. It has been asserted  by virtually every President since Nixon. They try to say: Oh, it is  preposterous. It is irrelevant. We don't have to worry about that.   Every President since Nixon, virtually, has asserted that. It has  only been addressed by two district courts--trial-level courts. The  first one rejected it, and its decision was stayed by the appellate  court, which means the appellate court thought probably you got it  wrong or, at a minimum, it is a really difficult question; we are not  sure about that. And the second district court decision is being  litigated right now. They are litigating it. And when Charlie Kupperman  went to court, they were trying to do something reasonable to say: Oh,  well, we don't want to litigate this with you; you should just agree to  be bound by the McGahn decision. What is the saying? Every litigant  gets his day in court. Why shouldn't Charlie Kupperman get to have his  counsel argue that issue on his behalf? That is what he wanted. He  didn't want to say: I am going to trust it to the other people  litigating the other case. I've got my case. I want to make the  arguments.   But they wouldn't have that. So they mooted out the case. They  withdrew the subpoena to moot out the case because they didn't want to  go to the hearing in front of Judge Leon on December 10.   They have also pointed out, as if it is some outrage, that documents  have been more readily produced under FOIA than in response to their  subpoenas. But what that actually shows is that when you turn square  corners and follow the law and make a request to the administration  that follows the law, the administration follows the law and responds.  And that is right. The documents were produced. Information came out.  But they didn't get it because they issued invalid subpoenas, and they  didn't try to do anything to establish the validity of their subpoenas.   If you are going to be sloppy and issue invalid subpoenas, you are  not going to get a response. But if some private litigant follows FOIA  and submits a FOIA request, they get a response.   To act like the Trump administration has done some blanket denial of  everything simply isn't accurate, and there is no basis for any adverse  inference because there is a specific privilege or basis for every  reason not to produce something.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.
