 Mr. Speaker, this picture accurately  captures the administration's definition of a navigable waterway. This  child playing with a paper boat in a puddle created by a rainstorm  would be subject to the almost comical definition of navigable  waterways this bill would amend.   This child's family--if they had saved enough money to build their  first home on this site with this rain puddle--could find themselves at  the mercy of the impersonal, bureaucratic, and deliberately ambiguous  rules of the EPA. Very quickly, this child's family would be drowned by  the costs, paperwork, and Byzantine rules of a faceless bureaucracy.   Stop using EPA bureaucrats as agents against the American people:  homeowners, small business owners, farmers, rural communities, and many  others. These WOTUS rules are designed to give nearly unlimited power  to EPA field agents to further control our delicate economy.   Nobel Prize-winner humanitarian Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, a victim of  the cruel Soviet system, warned us with these words: ``Unlimited power  in the hands of limited people always leads to cruelty.''   Protect American families and support this bill.
