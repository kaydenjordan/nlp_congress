 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the VA MISSION Act of 2018.  This important legislation secures veterans' ability to access quality  healthcare and ensures that we are fulfilling our promise to care for  them following their service to our Nation.   It builds on the success of the Choice Program by streamlining  community care programs so a veteran can access care from a provider  outside of the VA when they need to. It also expands caregiver benefits  for seriously injured pre-9/11 veterans and for their families.   The VA MISSION Act includes two healthcare initiatives from  legislation that I have introduced that protects our veterans receiving  organ transplants and also helps with the opioid crisis.    Currently, there are only 13 facilities in the Nation where a veteran  may receive a transplant in the VA healthcare system, and none of these  facilities performs all types of transplants. Timely organ transplants  are often the difference between life and death.   The transplant language from my bill included in the VA MISSION Act  eliminates the roadblocks that veterans face and increases the access  to care for our veterans, the care that they have earned by their  service to our Nation.   We are also fighting the opioid epidemic among veterans. My  legislative initiative increases transparency in opioid prescribing at  the VA by allowing doctors to identify high users of controlled drugs  who are therefore at risk for addiction. My language in the VA MISSION  Act instructs the VA to do what most private doctors already do:  connect to the prescription drug monitoring databases nationwide so  that no one slips through the cracks.   Mr. Speaker, we are standing up and fighting for those who fought for  our freedoms. As a surgeon and a veteran, I believe the VA MISSION Act  is good medicine and good public policy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  legislation.
