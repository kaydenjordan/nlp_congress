 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a man who  devoted his life to the service and protection of our Nation, Judge  Harold Murphy.   Born in Felton, Georgia, in 1927, Judge Murphy attended West Georgia  College before serving in the Navy toward the end of World War II. He  resumed his studies at the University of Mississippi and the University  of Georgia's School of Law, where he graduated in 1949. He began a law  practice in Haralson County, Georgia, and in 1950 was elected to the  Georgia House of Representatives as the youngest member at that time.   Judge Murphy served five consecutive terms before stepping down in  1961 to focus on practicing law. In 1971, Judge Murphy was appointed by  Governor Jimmy Carter to the Superior Court for the Tallapoosa Judicial  Circuit. Following his election in 1976, President Carter nominated  Judge Murphy to the United States District Court for the Northern  District of Georgia. He was confirmed by the Senate on July 28, 1977.   For 45 years, he served his country on the Federal bench and became  an acclaimed jurist and legal icon with a stellar reputation that  extended far beyond Georgia. He always displayed a quick wit and a keen  sense of humor, was kind and empathetic, and treated all those who  appeared before him with courtesy and respect.   Judge Murphy once subpoenaed a talking myna bird who had  ``witnessed'' a store robbery to testify in court. Judge Murphy's humor  was only surpassed by his fairness and prudential impartiality. In  fact, he is the only judge that was known to receive Christmas cards  from inmates in prison that Judge Murphy himself had put away.                                time  1030    He was so excruciatingly fair and impartial that during one case he  even talked the defendant out of a guilty plea. Judge Murphy worked  tirelessly and carried a full docket until the age of 90, when he took  senior judge status in the Northern District of Georgia. He continued  to preside over cases until his death on December 28, 2022.   Judge Murphy received many professional awards and recognitions,  including from the State Bar of Georgia and the University of Georgia  School of Law.   In 2014, Alabama State University renamed its graduate school after  Judge Murphy in recognition of his landmark ruling in Knight v.  Alabama, a long-running case that the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals  asked him to handle involving the vestiges of racial segregation then  present in the Alabama University system.   Above all else, Judge Murphy was a loving and devoted husband and  father, and a strong role model who made everyone who knew him in  northwest Georgia proud.   The daily sight of Judge Murphy leading his gaggle of clerks to lunch  on Broad Street will be deeply missed by the community in Rome that he  loved so much and that loved him back.   The people of the 14th District of Georgia therefore urge the House  to  [[Page H343]]  pass this bill to name the building at 600 East First Street in Rome,  Georgia, the Harold L. Murphy Federal Building and United States  Courthouse.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have amendment No. 2 at the desk.    Mr. Chair, before I discuss the details of my  amendment, I want to applaud the new Republican majority for giving  Members the opportunity to offer amendments in a more open process. The  people's House has been broken for far too long, and I look forward to  working with my colleagues in an open process for the remainder of this  Congress.   I also want to thank Chairwoman McMorris-Rodgers for her leadership  on this issue to put American energy first. I cosponsored this  legislation because I believe it puts America back on track to regain  energy independence.   This is such an important issue and critical piece of legislation  that I believe we cannot stop short. We need to chart a path back to  energy independence and ensure President Biden is not able to sell our  critical oil supplies to China or any other rogue nation. President  Biden used emergency authorities to sell hundreds of millions of  barrels of oil to our enemies.   My amendment would prevent President Biden from claiming an emergency  to further reduce our strategic oil supplies. This is why I filed  impeachment articles last Congress against President Biden on the  grounds that he endangered, compromised, and undermined the energy  security of the United States by selling oil from the United States'  Strategic Petroleum Reserve to foreign nations. President Biden has  demonstrated that he will remain a threat to the national security of  our country.   No President in the history of the United States has ordered a  liquidation of the SPR on this scale. He sold 40 percent of our  critical oil supply to trick and deceive the American people before the  election. Rather than unleashing American energy here at home, he has  robbed our country.   When President Biden took office in 2021, the SPR contained 638  million barrels of oil. Since then, he has slashed our oil inventory to  371 million barrels. He has decimated the SPR to the lowest level since  December, 1983, before some Members of this body were even born. He  shredded the offers from oil companies to resupply the reserve. He gave  away 7 million barrels of our oil to a Communist Chinese state-run  energy firm. The CCP had 1.2 billion barrels when Biden took office,  they have even more now.   I cannot believe our President did that.   If we let President Biden continue to run our oil this way, we will  have nothing left.   This has destroyed America's oil production. President Biden shut  down the Keystone XL pipeline, destroying hundreds of thousands of  American jobs.   President Biden has allowed the least amount of federal land for  drilling since the end of World War II.   We are now producing 1 million barrels of oil less every day compared  to when President Trump was in office.   Every country faces natural disasters.   Where will we get our oil next time we are in crisis?   Whom will we have to beg to get our oil?   China?   Iran?   The Saudis?   Venezuela--like the Biden administration has already done?   Or maybe even Russia?   President Biden's actions prove an intentional plot to destroy  America's oil industry and usher in the climate cult's Green New Deal.   My amendment would simply strike the exceptions that Biden used to  sell our oil.   The American people don't believe that the President should have the  authority to declare an emergency for any reason and then sell our oil  to our enemies.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
