 Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to expand the  NATO alliance to include Sweden and Finland. A crucial question that  should be answered is whether Sweden and Finland's accession to NATO is  in America's best interests and whether their joining will cause more  or less war.   Well, for every action, there is a reaction. What do our adversaries  say? Putin's immediate response to it was that Russia ``does not have a  problem'' with Sweden or Finland applying for NATO but that ``the  expansion of military infrastructure into this territory will of course  give rise to reaction and response.'' So from Russia's perspective,  they likely will tolerate Sweden and Finland in NATO but likely will  not tolerate certain weapons systems in Finland or Sweden.   Advocates of NATO expansion said we can't be held hostage to Russia's  threats. Perhaps. But if a country announces they will do X if you do  Y, shouldn't someone at least contemplate the potential scenarios? The  Russians have already announced that placing certain weapons systems in  Finland is a redline. Whether the redline is justified is not the  issue. The issue is, knowing your adversary's position, is it worth the  risk of pushing missiles into Finland?   The world has changed since Putin invaded Ukraine. Arguments that  admitting Sweden and Finland to NATO could provoke Russia are less  potent now since Putin's war shows he can be provoked by actions short  of Ukraine's actual admission to NATO.   Diplomats, though, should try to envision how the Ukraine war might  end. One possible end would be, as Zelenskyy has stated, a neutral  Ukraine not militarily aligned with either the West or the East.  Neutrality doesn't have to always be a weakness. Neutral nations can  serve as intermediaries in conflict resolution. Often, our discussions  with Iran use neutral Sweden as a conduit. When all nations are  aligned, who will be the mediators? The world will soon lose the  important roles played by a neutral Finland and Sweden.    But Putin's invasion in Ukraine has changed the world. In this new  world, I am less adamant about preventing NATO's expansion with Sweden  and Finland, but I am still adamant about the reality that NATO's  expansion will come at a cost.   I am here today to propose a reservation to ensure that this  expansion will not come at the expense of losing our ability to  determine where and when the United States goes to war. My reservation  merely reasserts that article 5 of the NATO treaty does not supersede  Congress's constitutional responsibility to declare war before the  United States commits troops to war.   The Founders designed the separation of war powers to ensure that the  decision to engage in hostilities would be made only after serious  deliberation. According to our Constitution, the United States would  resort to war only after the collective wisdom of the people's elected  representatives determine war is in the best interest. We know this  because our Founders told us so.   At the Pennsylvania ratifying convention, James Wilson stated that  the proposed Constitution would not allow one man or even one body of  men to declare war.   In Federalist No. 69, Alexander Hamilton explained that the President  would be restricted to conducting the armies and navies, which Congress  alone would raise and fund.   The Father of our Constitution, James Madison, argued:         In no part of the Constitution is more wisdom to be found       than in the clause which confides the question of war or       peace to the legislature.    Some have argued that a vote for my amendment is to go wobbly on  NATO's article 5 commitment. I would argue that the Gold Star parents  and our men and women in the field don't want Congress to go wobbly on  the Constitution.   There is no more serious question that we are entrusted to answer  than whether to commit the men and women of the armed services to war.  We cannot delegate that responsibility to the President, to the courts,  to an international body, or to our allies. This is our constitutional  responsibility, one that we have freely taken and one that our  constituents expect us to uphold.   I also want to assure my colleagues here that adoption of my  reservation will not jeopardize the NATO treaty. Some will argue that  while the substance of my reservation is unobjectionable, the process  of adopting the reservation threatens the expansion of NATO. Nothing  could be further from the truth.   It is true that reservations must be accepted by the other parties,  but the other parties are NATO allies. The other parties are NATO  allies who are all dependent on us to come to their rescue. Do you  think they are going to lecture us on obeying our own Constitution? We  should expect those allies to respect article 11 of the NATO treaty,  which states that the provisions of the treaty are to be carried out in  accordance with each country's respective constitutional process.   Additionally, my reservation does not require any other country to  take action or renegotiate the treaty. The reservation will be deemed  accepted if our allies do not object after a period of 12 months.   I call on my colleagues to support my proposal to reaffirm that our  Constitution and the NATO treaty are abundantly clear: Our  international obligations do not supersede Congress's responsibility to  declare war. It is in our Constitution. It is the supreme law of the  land, and we should today reassert that we will obey the Constitution  above all else.
