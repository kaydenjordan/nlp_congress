 Mr. Speaker, less than a year after the first  disastrous tax bill, here we are voting on another bill that will  double down on this betrayal and put hardworking families who are  working every day to make ends meet even further into debt.   As my constituents remember, the first tax law cost us $2.3 trillion.  Those working to reach the middle class will see less investment in  their communities; will see their Social Security, Medicare, and  Medicaid shrink; and will see the costs of healthcare insurance rise.   It is unconscionable that Republicans are trying to pass another  batch of tax cuts that will add another $650 billion to the $2.3  trillion they have already spent through the Tax Code. This will end up  costing us $5 trillion over the next 20 years.   Vote ``no'' on this reckless tax cut.
