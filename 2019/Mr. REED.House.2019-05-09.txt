 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to the bill before  us but, as the father of a type 1 diabetic, agree with the basis of the  law of the Affordable Care Act that says preexisting conditions must be  protected in every health insurance plan going forward. We should be  celebrating together that that reform is now the law of the land, and I  would hope my colleagues would take ``yes'' for an answer.   But what is being proposed today potentially jeopardizes that  protection,  [[Page H3525]]  because what you are proposing today is to take away the ability of the  States to comply with the law of the land to protect those preexisting  conditions in a way that allows the States to innovate, to drive health  insurance premiums down as the law protects those with preexisting  conditions.   This is not a political game. You are talking about real Americans.  You are talking about kids, like my son, who is a type 1 diabetic. And  if this law, as proposed, becomes the law of the land, you potentially  increase insurance premiums on millions of Americans because you take  away that innovation ability of the States to deliver the protections  of preexisting condition reform but lower premiums at the same time.   So I stand in strong objection to this political effort from my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and rather than engage in  politics, I join with the silent majority of Americans who say: You  know what? Enough is enough of politics. Get to the real work of the  people and lower healthcare costs for everyone.
