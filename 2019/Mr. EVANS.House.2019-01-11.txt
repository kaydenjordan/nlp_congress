 Mr. Speaker, the government shutdown is hurting people in  Philadelphia right now.   I met a HUD employee this week who is tired of being used as a pawn.  She said: ``I'm ready to go back to work. I'm ready to serve the  people.''   Instead, she has to worry about her mortgage and student loans.   She said: ``My American Dream is slipping through my fingers. It's  really not fair.''   Mr. Speaker, she teared up. I understand why.   For the 800,000 Federal workers and Federal contractors, this is not  some reality TV show. This is real life.   The workers and citizens served by the government need the President  and the Senate to reopen the government first, and then we can have a  debate about border security.   The Senate should join the Democratic House in passing the spending  bills to reopen the government, bills  [[Page H512]]  that they have already passed last year. And we all need to keep  foremost in our minds that this debate about the wall--we should be  talking about the real people and getting to work now, Mr. Speaker.                            ____________________
