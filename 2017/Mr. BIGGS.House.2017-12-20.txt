 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the lives of two Navajo  Code Talkers, George B. Willie Sr. and Teddy Draper Sr., who recently  both passed away in my home State of Arizona.   While both young men, Mr. Willie and Mr. Draper enlisted in the U.S.  Marine Corps and valiantly served in World War II in the Battles of  Okinawa and Iwo Jima.   The Navajo Code Talkers used the Navajo language to transmit and  receive messages that could not be translated or intercepted by the  Japanese. This unique skill was a great advantage for the United  States' victory in the Pacific theater.   In 2001, both Mr. Willie and Mr. Draper were awarded the  Congressional Silver Medal for their service and selfless devotion to  duty. The sacrifices of Mr. Willie and Mr. Draper and their families  during World War II will be remembered for generations. We will be  forever grateful for their dedication to our Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Georgia for yielding.   This is a very important topic. I am going to touch on this by  beginning with this idea of the distinction between the current  administration and its foreign policy as outlined in the recent  statement from President Trump and that of the previous administration.   The distinction is very clear. The previous administration basically  clung to an idea of neo-liberal institutionalism. That is to say, where  there was a vacuum of power, we did not set the stage. America did not  fill it. It remained a vacuum, with the idea being that an institution  would fill that. Maybe the United Nations, maybe some other regional  institution. But in doing so, we ceded over much of our sovereignty and  failed to act to preserve and protect America's best interests.   The current administration has taken a more realistic point of view.  They are realists. That is, America's interests will be first and  paramount. We will see to it, we will foster alliances, and we will  foster participation with our fellow nations to preserve America's best  interests.   When America is strong, there is a greater chance for peace in the  world. I believe that. That is the position of realists all the way  back to Hans Morgenthau. Even neo-realists like Kenneth Waltz might  agree.   One thing that we know is that this particular episode that unfolds  is a scandalous episode that put America in greater danger, probably,  and perhaps, in order to foster political gains by the previous  administration.   One Treasury Department official who served in the Obama  administration testified to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs  that, under the Obama administration, these Hezbollah-related  investigations were tamped down for fear of rocking the boat with Iran  and jeopardizing the nuclear deal.   That becomes the heart and the rationale for how the previous  administration handled a political decision instead of a foreign policy  national security decision.   We know a number of things that took place, and this is why the House  needs to conduct its own investigation: so we can know how this played  out, why this played out, who is responsible, and we can resolve never  to do this again.   We had Project Cassandra. This was a DEA campaign designed to expose  a money laundering scheme in which Latin American drug-running was  being funneled to Hezbollah.    Hezbollah is a pro-Iranian Lebanese malitia and has been a foreign  terrorist organization since 1987, and so designated. It fosters  alliances with rogue nations such as North Korea, Iran, and is  violently anti-Israel and anti-United States.   It has become a player in international cocaine trafficking--using  the proceeds of that drug trafficking to purchase explosives, EFPs,  which is the deadliest type of IED used against American soldiers in  Iraq.   EFPs killed hundreds of American soldiers, and they were supplied by  the Iranian Government and its Hezbollah allies. EFPs were literally  ripping M1 Abrams tanks in half. It is a weapon that makes all the  armor protection they have irrelevant. Mere threats of EFPs shut down  all ground supply routes near American bases on the Iranian border.   The result: cut off the head or the financing of Hezbollah through  these international cocaine distribution routes.   Project Cassandra was born in 2008. It found clear evidence that  Hezbollah had grown from a Middle East-focused military and political  organization into an international crime syndicate, likely collecting  somewhere in the neighborhood of $1 billion a year from drug and  weapons trafficking, money laundering, and other criminal activities.   For 8 years, DEA agents conducted high-stakes investigations-- dangerous investigations--using technology as well as undercover  operations and informants. That type of capital is expensive and  dangerous.   The result was to map these illicit drug networks. They did this with  the help of 30 U.S. and foreign security agencies. They saw worldwide,  far-flung international drug trafficking from South America to Africa,  from Europe to the Middle East, and in the United States, where drug  funds were funneled through an array of businesses, including used car  lots.   What happened?   As we saw the previous administration's desire and design to leave a  signature legacy foreign policy win, the negotiations for the Iran  nuclear deal got going and were in place. Project Cassandra's agents  say the Justice and Treasury Departments repeatedly hindered their  attempts to pursue these investigations--the prosecutions, arrests, and  financial sanctions against the key figures in this far-reaching drug  scheme.   This was a policy decision. It was a systematic decision.   David Asher is quoted as saying: ``They serially ripped apart this  entire effort that was very well supported and resourced, and it was  done from the top down.''   They didn't bring criminal charges. They didn't continue to pursue  these Hezbollah members or the banks that were laundering those  billions in drug profits. Instead, they tore down the apparatus that  was working on apprehending the head of the snake.   Well, we are going to go on with this. We need to go on with this. We  need to investigate this further. This type of political decision that  impacts and actually works cross-wise to our very purpose in the Middle  East must be stopped, and we must find out why that happened. Those who  allowed our men and women to be put in harm's way for a political  decision need to be held accountable.   So, Mr. Speaker, those who cling to the neo-liberal institutionalist  mantra, who rely on multilateral institutions rather than putting  America first, are the ones who produced this result.   We are going to find out more in the coming weeks. My request is that  the leadership in Congress, in this House of Representatives, instigate  and prosecute an investigation to get to the bottom of this very  heinous and very wrongheaded and dangerous decision.   I thank the gentleman for allowing me to participate and for his lead  on this tonight.
