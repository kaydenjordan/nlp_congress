 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for yielding  time.   Mr. Chair, the 115th Congress has been a landmark time for the  Committee on Education and the Workforce. Committee members have come  together to build the case for historic postsecondary education  reforms.   With more than $1.4 trillion in student debt and a skills gap that  has resulted in more than 6 million unfilled jobs, we have recognized  that restoring the promise of postsecondary education isn't simply a  good idea; it is our responsibility.   The Empowering Students Through Enhanced Financial Counseling Act  recognizes that students and families are the most important players in  reforming postsecondary education. Giving them all the information they  need to make wise Federal financial aid decisions can put a dent in all  this debt. Better financial education before a borrower signs on the  dotted line will help students and protect taxpayer dollars.   Knowledge really is power, especially in how we make practical  financial decisions. Student borrowers and parents, if they are trying  to help, should understand and control their financial situation; their  financial situation should not control them.   As chair of the Higher Education and Workforce Development  Subcommittee, Representative Brett Guthrie has been a champion for  commonsense reforms, and this legislation is the result of his  leadership. I commend his work, as well as Representative Bonamici and  her many Democrat colleagues for joining in this effort.   Mr. Chair, I urge every Member of this body to support this  legislation and make sure students and families in their districts know  about it.
