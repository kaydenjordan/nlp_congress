 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4038, the DHS Accountability  Enhancement Act. H.R. 4038, or the DHS Accountability Enhancement Act,  strikes section 872 of the Homeland Security Act. Section 872 grants  the Secretary of Homeland Security unilateral authority to reorganize  the Department as long as the Secretary notifies Congress 60 days in  advance.   H.R. 4038, this bill, rescinds this unilateral authority. As  authorizers of the Department of Homeland Security, the Committee on  Homeland Security is ultimately responsible for reorganization of the  Department. H.R. 4038 reinforces this responsibility.   The separation of powers doctrine compels the elimination of the  provision, which gives the Department of Homeland Security unilateral  decisionmaking authority to reorganize the Department.   Moreover, it should be noted that this bill is not without precedent.   While considering H.R. 2825, the Department of Homeland Security  Authorization Act of 2017, in June, the Committee on Homeland Security  unanimously approved eliminating the language found in section 872 of  the Homeland Security Act of 2002.   I believe that this legislation not only ensures this committee's  involvement in reorganizations at DHS, but affirms the responsibility  of Congress as authorizers.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge support of this bipartisan legislation.  H.R. 4038 is necessary, commonsense legislation. An action as  significant as the reorganization of an entire department and its  components should be subject to the appropriate vetting and approval  measures of this Congress.   I thank Chairman McCaul for working with Ranking Member Thompson on  this issue both during the consideration of the DHS Authorization Act  and now on this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 4038, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 4038.   I will say that this committee has passed over 50 bills out of the  House that are currently sitting in the Senate waiting action. I urge  the Senate to take action on this important legislation, all 50-plus  bills, that will help better protect the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, H.R. 4038.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3328, the Cuban Airport  Security Act.   The United States and the global aviation community face an adaptive  and agile enemy. Terrorist groups continue to target passenger aircraft  and pursue new attack methods.   With those threats in mind, the legislation before us today focuses  on raising the level of security in Cuba. H.R. 3328 will ensure that  Congress is able to continue its oversight of the TSA's efforts to  ensure the Cuban Government adopts aviation security initiatives and  makes important security advancements. It is critical that the gains  achieved are not eroded.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the House Homeland Security Committee passed H.R. 3328,  the Cuban Airport Security Act of 2017, by voice vote in September.  While the legislation is focused on raising the level of aviation  security in Cuba, it has broader implications.  [[Page H8052]]    H.R. 3328 includes a provision requiring the TSA to develop a  template for agreements with foreign partners for Federal air marshals  to carry out security operations on flights departing or arriving on  foreign soil.   As Mr. Katko mentioned, just last week there were news reports that  the DHS and the TSA had acknowledged that intelligence indicates that  terrorists are plotting another massive attack on U.S. aircraft.   In the current climate of aviation security threats, the United  States has a critical role to play in raising the baseline of global  aviation security to keep the traveling public safe, in coordination  with our international partners.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for H.R. 3328, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
