 Madam Speaker, almost 11 years ago today, I spoke on the  anniversary of two Chicago treasures: Radio station WXRT and one of its  beloved hosts, Lin Brehmer.   This weekend, we lost Lin at the age of 68 after a long battle with  cancer. Lin was a Chicago icon, a poet, a Renaissance man, and a  friend. For my colleagues who have not lived in Chicago, let me  explain.   In the movie, ``Almost Famous,'' there is a scene where the  protagonist's oldest sister has left her record collection, and she  tells him, ``Look under your bed. It will set you free.'' That is what  XRT did for us in Chicago and that is what Lin did for me and so many  Chicagoans.   Before XRT, AM radio, a dry, repetitive desert was our only option  for music. After XRT, we were transformed. It became a 24-hour station  in 1976, demonstrating our city's unique commitment to independent  thinking and an unbridled celebration of art and music.   Like many others, XRT linked us to a new world. XRT encouraged me to  leave my sterile environment and travel to the Earl of Old Town to see  Steve Goodman and my first concert at the Aragon Ballroom to see Mott  the Hoople and the New York Dolls, not to mention other famous haunts  like the Metro, the Vic, Checkerboard Lounge, to see greats like Iggy  Pop, David Bowie, Muddy Waters, Frank Zappa, Roxy Music, and so many  others.   When Lin became the music director at WXRT in 1984, he helped  introduce us to new music, new genres, and new emotions. Today, when so  much of music is driven by algorithms and data, it can be difficult to  imagine a time when a station could often be steered by a single man's  eclectic tastes, but that is what Lin did. He played what he wanted to  hear, and somehow, he always knew what the city needed to hear.   He opened my eyes to the true power of music. He taught me that music  can show you new worlds, can help you understand new perspectives. It  can often soothe during difficult times and inspire you to explore what  you never considered exploring before.   Lin Brehmer was my friend, but I recognize that I am far from the  only one who could claim that coveted title. He was born a New Yorker  and began his radio career filling in at his university's student-run  station during the summer.   The first song he ever performed was The Beatles' ``Within You  Without You.'' Later, he would explain that he chose it because ``I  have always felt that life flows within you, but most of all without  you.''   At Albany's WQBK-FM, he became known as the ``Reverend of Rock `n'  Roll'' for his penchant for reciting poetry during song introductions.  Lin came to Chicago in 1984 to become the music director, and his taste  left an indelible mark on the station and on the entire city.   He hosted the morning drive for more than 30 years talking to  thousands of Chicagoans over the years on their daily commutes. He  loved the Cubs, Chicago's music, theater, and dining, and he shared  those loves with us.   From Lin, we learned about the best restaurants in the city. We  shared in the Cubs' wins and often losses, and gained new perspectives  from his essays in ``Lin's Bin,'' a rare combination of nostalgia,  humor, empathy, kindness, and spirituality.   I was honored to have lunch with Lin at some of Chicago's most iconic  locales like Manny's and Ann Sather's, and to have spent a memorable  Cubs' game at his side.   As he himself described, he regularly went out in his ``eating  pants,'' an outfit with enough give to accommodate another Chicago meal  at places like the Wiener's Circle.   Last July, he shared with his listeners that he had been diagnosed  with prostate cancer and began a leave of absence to undergo treatment.  This November, I know I wasn't the only Chicagoan who was delighted  when he briefly returned to the airwaves.   Now, during his time at WXRT, he was named music director of the year  three times and was voted the music director of the decade by readers  of the  [[Page H284]]  Hard Report. He was so much more than a radio host. He was Chicago's  best friend in the whole world.   When something big happened, Chicago would turn to Lin for his take  on the events. Whether celebration or tragedy, he knew what to say. Now  in the wake of his loss, we turn to the dial wanting.   He was married to his college sweetheart, Sara, and they shared a  son, Wilson. They were both by his side in his final moments. My  thoughts and deepest condolences are with his family and with all  Chicagoans as we mourn his loss.   In closing, as Lin always reminded us, never take anything for  granted. It is great to be alive.                            ____________________
