 Mr. President, let me say to Senator Warner, my good  friend from Virginia, who has an incredible empathy for the Federal  workforce, we have the same thing in New Mexico, and to our good friend  Senator Bennet from Colorado, we have Federal employees throughout this  Nation that really give the extra bit. They go the extra mile. I am  going to talk a lot about that, the same way Senator Warner is and with  the same kind of passion he has.   Today is day 24 of the Trump shutdown. Federal Government employees  are furloughed, and others are working but did not get paychecks.  Federal contractors have already received stop work orders. Not only  are they not getting paid, but they will never receive backpay for work  lost.   This Trump shutdown is now the longest shutdown in U.S. history.  History will show this shutdown to be a political and financial fiasco  of the President's making.   You can see in this map, published by the New York Times--and I am  sure our Presiding Officer will see--that as you get more green on this  map, you are hurt more by this shutdown.   You can see Alaska, Maryland, Virginia, New Mexico, Montana, and  Colorado, and there are a lot of States that are really hurt. We have a  large workforce in some of the Federal agencies that are currently shut  down, including the Department of Interior, the Homeland Security  Department, and the Department of Agriculture.   My staff estimates, conservatively, that we have at least 10,800  Federal employees affected, not counting law enforcement. We are a  small State. This has a big impact. There are no good estimates of the  impact on many New Mexicans employed by or under contract with Federal  contractors.   Federal employees are true public servants who often forego jobs that  pay more because they believe in public service. These men and women  have families. Some don't have much in the way of savings. Some live  paycheck to paycheck. One of those individuals is a Border Patrol agent  from Las Cruces, in southern New Mexico, who has worked for Customs and  Border Protection for 18 years. He tells me:         I live paycheck to paycheck. If I don't get paid the money       that I earn, I AM NOT GOING TO MAKE IT! Creditors are not       forgiving any debts. I am asking you to please try and help       me and all federal workers get paid. I feel stressed and       helpless, please help.    This is from a Border Patrol agent--the folks we rely on to keep our  Nation safe, which the President claims is his aim. This agent is  hurting. The President is devastating these agents and their families.   While Border Patrol agents may or may not support a wall, they do not  support going unpaid for the difficult and dangerous work they do in  service to our Nation, in service to keeping our borders safe, which we  all know is the President's claimed goal.   The President's unconvincing claim that he can ``relate'' to Federal  workers not getting paid was belied by his completely out-of-touch  statement that they can ``make adjustments'' and be just fine.   This President cannot relate to the professional support employee in  the Las Cruces FBI office whose mortgage company, gas company, and  credit card companies are giving her no leeway--making no  ``adjustments''--while she goes without pay. She says she is ``a REAL  human [being] who is being held hostage.'' She has worked for the FBI  for 21 years, but she will probably leave Federal service early so that  she has the financial security she needs to pay her bills.   She and the other 800,000 other Federal workers are being held  hostage by a President who is willing to wreck American families for  his vanity wall.   An occupational therapist with the Indian Health Service at the  Gallup Indian Medical Center in northwestern New Mexico tells me,  emphatically and in all capital letters: ``I AM NOT WITH THE PRESIDENT  ON THIS ISSUE.''   She is working hard, providing needed services to Native communities,  but providing for herself and with no pay, she is beyond stretched. She  was helping her son pay off college loans. She has had to tell him that  she can't help right now. She has an elderly mother she visits in Las  Cruces. She can't plan a trip now.   In fact, Indian Health Service healthcare providers all over the  country provide services essential to the health and wellness of nearly  2.2 million American Indians and Alaska Natives in over 800 hospitals  and clinics in 37 States. These Federal employees and medical  professionals--including over 2,000 nurses and nearly as many doctors,  pharmacists, dentists, and physician assistants--aren't getting paid.  They are forced to work without pay, and there is no end in sight.   Federal contractors really feel the brunt of the shutdown. Their  contract payments are stopped. Contractors have never received back  payments after a government shutdown.   We have a Federal contractor in Albuquerque, ADC LTD NM--a minority,  woman-owned company that has 2,600 employees and contractors  nationwide--with 330 employees in Albuquerque. The company conducts  background check investigations for, ironically enough, the Department  of Homeland Security and other Federal Agencies. This company's work  has come to a complete stop. This slows down DHS's ability to hire  qualified employees, inhibiting its mission to keep our borders and  Nation safe.   This company is losing tens of thousands of dollars a day. This, you  can imagine, really hurts my State. Its loss in revenues translates  directly to a loss in State tax revenue. The multiplier effect of the  shutdown on New Mexico and the Nation will ripple throughout the  economy.   This privately held company, owned by New Mexicans, whose lineage in  our State goes back more than 300 years, is currently paying its  employees, even though its revenue has stopped. The owners are  sacrificing to do so, but they can't continue for the months or even  years the President says his shutdown could last.  [[Page S179]]    Federal employees will not stay in their jobs without pay for months  or years. They have to feed their families and pay their mortgage or  their rent. Last week, the Senate passed S. 24, sponsored by 43  Democrats and one Republican, by voice vote. The bill guarantees that  furloughed Federal workers would be paid from retroactively as soon as  possible. This is the least Congress can do for these workers. It does  not resolve, however, the pain Federal workers endure through a  shutdown or guarantee that their homes will not be at risk during a  shutdown or guarantee that food will be on their table or ensure that  the Federal workers will stay in their jobs during a prolonged shutdown  like the one this President apparently foresees. The solution is to  shut down the shutdown--to do it now, to do it immediately.   This Trump shutdown doesn't only affect Federal employees and  contractors. It affects the tens of thousands of Americans who rely on  government services or need approval for projects. A local Sante Fe  small business--a construction company, Sarcon Construction  Corporation--is ready to begin an $8.4 million project to build two new  hangars at the Sante Fe Municipal Airport. This 32,000-square-foot  project will generate $650,000 in local tax revenue, and it will employ  75 to 100 people. Many of those people are unemployed now, waiting for  this project to begin. This project is a big deal for my home city of  Sante Fe.   Do you know why the project is stalled?   Sarcon can't get the necessary approval from the Federal Aviation  Administration because of the Trump shutdown. The FAA personnel  responsible for approval are furloughed. As we can see, the shutdown  has real consequences for real people, especially for people like those  unemployed construction workers in New Mexico, ready and eager to go to  work but unable because of our President's inability to do his job.   The President's ridiculous claim that many Federal employees who are  not getting paid support his shutdown has no basis in reality. The  Federal workers in New Mexico who are furloughed or are working without  pay and the Federal workers we have heard from do not support this  shutdown.   An employee with the Department of Interior in Albuquerque writes:         While I am not sure how much good it would do, I emailed       the White House to go on record that I am not one of the       Federal employees the President is touting as wanting to be       out of work without a paycheck until he gets his wall. I just       want to go on record . . . that no, Federal employees do not       want to stay out of work; we want to go back to work and get       paid. This is not our fight, just his.   A husband and wife from Las Cruces who both work for the  Environmental Protection Agency are also among the many Federal workers  who did not support the Trump shutdown. They have three children, and  they need their paychecks. They don't support Trump's wall either. As  EPA engineers, they understand and oppose the environmental destruction  it will cause.   A scientist for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration at  White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico is one of the hundreds of  thousands of Federal workers who are essential and working without pay.  He is working on critical space infrastructure and testing related to  the Space-X launch scheduled for later this month. There is no good  reason why this important work is not being paid for right now.   There is no good reason why any Federal employee is not getting their  salary today. There is no good reason why Federal contractors'  contracts are not being honored. This Federal shutdown hurts American  families across my State and the Nation. It hurts our economy.   One Federal employee in New Mexico wanted to tell their story but was  banned by their employer on the ground it would represent illegal  lobbying of Congress. That is patently false. Federal employees  contacting their elected representatives about this shutdown and its  impact on their work and lives is not prohibited lobbying. The Trump  administration has not only put these people out of work, it is now  gagging them and denying them their free speech rights.   I call upon the President to end this terrible shutdown. He should do  so immediately.   I yield the floor.
