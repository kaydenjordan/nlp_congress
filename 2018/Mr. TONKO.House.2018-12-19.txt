 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 1222,  the  [[Page H10279]]  Congenital Heart Futures Reauthorization Act led by Congressman  Bilirakis and Congressman Schiff.   This legislation builds on the success of current efforts by the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to improve and expand  research, surveillance, and public outreach and education programs  relating to congenital heart disease.   Each year more than 40,000 babies are born in the United States with  a congenital heart defect, and 1 million children and 1.4 million  adults are currently living with congenital heart disorders.   Even though congenital heart disease is the most common birth defect  in America, there are still many unknowns surrounding the condition.   This legislation will help expand our understanding of congenital  heart disease across the lifespan, and has the potential to improve the  lives of the millions of children and adults living with congenital  heart disease.   Mr. Speaker, I therefore urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I echo my support for the Senate  amendment to H.R. 1222, it is worthy of our support. We will continue  to build on the research and education concerning birth defects, and,  most importantly, we will enable individuals and families who live with  birth defects to have more hope.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 6615,  the Traumatic Brain Injury Program Reauthorization Act of 2018, led by  Congressman Pascrell and Congressman Rooney.   This legislation would reauthorize programs at the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention that would work to reduce the incidence  of traumatic brain injury in the United States.   These programs also help improve our understanding of the prevention  and treatment of traumatic brain injuries through surveillance efforts.   This reauthorization would expand upon existing efforts to  reauthorize CDC to establish a new national concussion surveillance  system to determine the prevalence and the incidence of concussions in  the United States. I commend the sponsors of this bill and the work  they have done.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), who has done tremendous work  on this issue.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I again encourage Members to  support this legislation. As was indicated, it has taken a long 20  years to achieve this success. Hopefully, we can support this and  provide, again, a great initiative on behalf of those who suffer from  traumatic brain injury.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the BOLD Infrastructure for  Alzheimer's Act, legislation that I have introduced with my good friend  and fellow Energy and Commerce Committee member, Congressman Brett  Guthrie.   I thank both Chairman Walden and incoming Chair Pallone for their  support of this particular legislation, and I greatly appreciate the  partnership with Congressman Guthrie and his staff for helping to get  this important legislation over the finish line today.   Alzheimer's is a brutal, devastating disease. Anyone whose life has  been touched by Alzheimer's or related dementias knows the heart- wrenching toll that these diseases can and most often do take on an  individual, on a family, and on a community.   Since first coming to Congress, I have been laser-focused on how we  can reduce the devastating burden that Alzheimer's disease has on our  families and our Nation. We have had great success, many successes in  recent years with legislation such as the National Alzheimer's Project  Act and the Alzheimer's Accountability Act helping to coordinate our  medical research agenda and strengthen our case for the unprecedented  investments that Congress has appropriated to effectively treat and  find a cure for Alzheimer's.   With the HOPE for Alzheimer's Act, we were able to get CMS to provide  coverage for comprehensive care planning services to Medicare  beneficiaries and their caregivers following a diagnosis of Alzheimer's  disease. These care planning visits are a critical tool for families  struggling for answers and help to lessen the burden of this disease.   Now we are taking another huge step forward with the passage of the  BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act, legislation that will invest  in public health-oriented strategies for tackling Alzheimer's disease  and related dementias.   We know that in 2018, Alzheimer's and related dementias will cost our  country $277 billion. By smartly investing in a public health  infrastructure for this disease, we can reduce this cost burden on the  local, State, and Federal Government, and improve care for those who  have received an Alzheimer's diagnosis.   The BOLD Act will enhance our public health infrastructure in three  main ways:   First, it will create Alzheimer's disease and related dementias  public health centers of excellence. They will be dedicated to  promoting effective Alzheimer's disease and caregiving interventions,  as well as educating the public on Alzheimer's disease, cognitive  decline, and brain health. These centers will implement the CDC's  healthy aging public health road map and will take key steps to support  health and social services professionals, as well as families and  communities.   Second, the legislation will allow for State and local cooperative  agreements with HHS that will be awarded to State health departments,  subdivisions of States, or Tribal entities to develop and carry out  Alzheimer's interventions. These awards will help States build a  foundation and also help those States that are already investing in a  public health approach to Alzheimer's to amplify their initiatives  through public-private partnerships.   Finally, the BOLD Act will create data analysis and reporting  cooperative agreements with HHS that will ensure that data on  Alzheimer's, cognitive decline, caregiving, and health disparities are  analyzed and disseminated to the public in a timely manner.    We need this legislation more than ever. The burden of Alzheimer's  disease does not take a day off, and Congress cannot afford to either.   In closing, I again thank Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone,  House leadership, our Senate sponsors, and everyone who had a hand in  this success today. Without such dedicated bipartisan Alzheimer's  champions throughout Congress, we would not be making this strong step  forward. It is mighty progress.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters). Representative Waters  is from California's 43rd Congressional District and has invested a lot  of time and work on the Alzheimer's issue, especially in her role as  co-chair of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer's Disease.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge passage of this legislation. The BOLD  Act is another bit of foundation that we have done to move forward and  conquer Alzheimer's and related dementias.   Those of us who function in government understand full well that our  Federal, State, and local budgets have been impacted severely by  Alzheimer's disease, but, most importantly, families have been burdened  by this disease. So it is so important for us to move forward with this  legislation that provides, again, hope to those families and  individuals living with Alzheimer's disease.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for support of the legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2278, the State Offices of Rural  Health Reauthorization Act of 2018. I thank Chair Walden and incoming  Chair Pallone, along with Congressman Schrader and Congressman Mullin,  for their work on this important legislation.   This legislation would reauthorize the Federal grant program that  supports Offices of Rural Health in each State, including the Charles  D. Cook Office of Rural Health with the New York State Department of  Health for the first time.   These offices assist States in strengthening rural health delivery  systems and improving access to quality services in rural areas. This  work is particularly important because patients and providers in rural  communities can face obstacles that can: result in reduced access to  care, increase health disparities, and inhibit individuals from  experiencing optimal health.   To ensure that States can continue to meet the requirements of this  grant program, this reauthorization legislation provides new  flexibility for State offices to meet their Federal match requirements,  as well as to request a waiver that would allow the State office to  continue to receive Federal funding if an office faces an extreme  hardship in meeting that requirement.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 2278, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Schrader), who represents Oregon's Fifth  Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support, again, of the legislation before us.   I want to commend Congressmen Schrader and Mullin for their great  work on this important legislation. It shows great sensitivity to the  healthcare needs of rural America and to the corresponding health  delivery systems. For that reason alone, this is worthy of our  unanimous support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate an accomplished  composer, educator, and music innovator from New York's capital region,  Professor Evan Mack, recently named a Musical America 2018 Professional  of the Year.   Professor Mack's first major opera premiered at New York's  Baryshnikov  [[Page H10323]]  Center in May of 2011, an impressive achievement for a first-time  composer.   Since then, he has composed numerous operas, including a grand opera  based on William Kennedy's 2014 novel, ``Roscoe,'' that received a  concert performance with the Albany Symphony featuring Deborah Voigt in  2016.   He also cowrote one of the first-ever operas for Twitter,  #IsOperaDead, a five-act opera performed in the span of 1 minute and 40  seconds.   He also serves on the faculty at Skidmore College and was a resident  artist at the prestigious Yaddo.   Professor Evan Mack, on behalf of all of your many fans and  supporters in upstate New York, congratulations on being named a 2018  Professional of the Year by Musical America.                            ____________________
