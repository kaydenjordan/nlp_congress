 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of S. 765 and  the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The clerk will report the bill by title.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         A bill (S. 765) to amend title 18, United States Code, to       provide for penalties for the sale of any Purple Heart       awarded to a member of the Armed Forces.    There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Perdue  substitute amendment be considered and agreed to, the bill, as amended,  be considered read a third time and passed, and the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   The amendment (No. 767) in the nature of a substitute was agreed to,  as follows:                  (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)         Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the       following:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Private Corrado Piccoli       Purple Heart Preservation Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The Purple Heart medal solemnly recognizes the great       and sometimes ultimate sacrifice of American servicemembers       like Private Corrado Piccoli.        (2) The Purple Heart medal holds a place of honor as the       national symbol of this sacrifice and deserves special       protections.       SEC. 3. PENALTY FOR SALE OF PURPLE HEARTS AWARDED TO MEMBERS                     OF THE ARMED FORCES.         Section 704 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--        (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``Whoever'' and       inserting ``Except as provided in subsection (e), whoever'';       and        (2) by adding at the end the following:        ``(e) Purple Heart.--        ``(1) Penalty.--Whoever willfully purchases, attempts to       purchase, solicits for purchase, mails, ships, imports,       exports, produces blank certificates of receipt for,       manufactures, sells, attempts to sell, advertises for sale,       trades, barters, or exchanges for anything of value any       Purple Heart awarded to a member of the armed forces or       former member of the armed forces by the Secretary of the       military department concerned, except when authorized under       regulations made pursuant to law, shall be fined under this       title, imprisoned not more than 6 months, or both.        ``(2) Limitation on regulations.--Regulations described in       paragraph (1) may not authorize the sale of any Purple Heart       awarded to a member of the armed forces or former member of       the armed forces by the Secretary of the military department       concerned, unless the sale is conducted by the member or       former member to whom the Purple Heart was awarded.        ``(3) Definition.--In this subsection, the term `willfully'       means the voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal       duty.''.    The bill (S. 765), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a  third reading, was read the third time, and passed.    Mr. President, this legislation is important because it  will offer the Purple Heart the same types of legal protections  currently in place for the Medal of Honor and help put an end to  profiteering off of the sacrifice of our great American heroes.   I would like to thank those Senators who have cosponsored this bill,  as well, and the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee  for persisting to get this bill on the floor.   There is no higher honor that we have in the Senate than to honor our  veterans and the people who put their lives on the line every day for  their country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if the Senate  receives H.J. Res. 76 from the House, and if the text of H.J. Res. 76  is identical to the text at the desk, that the joint resolution be  considered passed, the preamble be considered agreed to, and the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.                            ____________________
