 Mr. Speaker, as the chief sponsor of this  legislation, as well as the chief sponsor of the original Adam Walsh  Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006, I rise in support of this  legislation and hope that it is swiftly enacted.   The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, enacted in 2006, is  landmark legislation intended to keep our communities, and, most  importantly, our children safe from sex offenders and other dangerous  predators.   This bipartisan bill strengthened the sex offender registry  requirements and enforcement, extended Federal registry requirements to  Indian Tribes, and authorized funding for Federal programs intended to  address and deter child exploitation.                                time  1615    The centerpiece of the Adam Walsh Act is the national Sex Offender  Registration and Notification Act, or SORNA for short. SORNA's goal is  to create a seamless national sex offender registry to assist law  enforcement efforts to detect and track offenders. SORNA provides  minimum standards for State sex offender registries and created the Dru  Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Website, which allows law  enforcement officials and the general public to search for sex  offenders nationwide from just one website.   H.R. 1188, the Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act of 2017, reauthorizes  two key programs from the original Adam Walsh Act: grants to the States  and other jurisdictions to implement the Adam Walsh Act's sex offender  registry requirements and funding for the U.S. marshals to locate and  apprehend sex offenders who violate registration requirements. These  programs are crucial to efforts to complete and enforce the national  network of sex offender registries, particularly in light of the  already passed deadline for States to come into compliance with SORNA.  [[Page H4399]]    Based on feedback from the States, H.R. 1188 makes targeted changes  to the SORNA sex offender registry requirements. The bill changes the  period of time after which juveniles adjudicated delinquent can  petition to be removed from the sex offender registry for a clean  record from 25 to 15 years, and provides that juveniles do not need to  be included on publicly viewed sex offender registries. Instead, it is  sufficient for juveniles to be included on registries that are only  viewed by law enforcement entities. I believe these provisions strike  an appropriate balance between being tough on juveniles who commit  serious sex crimes and understanding that there can be differences  between adult and juvenile offenders.   The bill also recognizes the unique challenges that tribes face in  implementing SORNA. H.R. 1188 provides technical assistance to tribes  so they can access, and enter information into, the Federal criminal  information databases.   Finally, H.R. 1188 amends the statute of limitations to allow  individuals who were victims of exploitation or trafficking as  juveniles to have 10 years after becoming an adult to file suit for a  civil remedy. It is my hope that, with these commonsense changes, more  States will come into compliance.   With the passage of this legislation, Congress can send a strong  message to all Americans about our continued commitment to keeping our  Nation's children safe. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume to close.   First of all, we will be doing a series of bills that are extremely  important, and I will make note of my interest in protecting children,  but as well to broaden our work as we work in the Committee on the  Judiciary on matters dealing with criminal justice reform and  specifically dealing with the issue of solitary confinement,  alternative sentencing for young people, and Ban the Box. I also hope  that we will work on issues dealing with criminal justice reform  sentencing reduction that are crucial and prison reform. There is a lot  of work for us to do as we do the work on the floor today. People are  waiting, and in some instances languishing, in the Nation's juvenile  detention centers and various juvenile justice courts for a statement  to be made by the Federal Government on seeking a second chance for  those who are in the juvenile justice system.   As relates to the Adam Walsh legislation, I thank the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner) and the other cosponsors of H.R. 1188 for  their steadfast work on these issues. Nevertheless, as I indicated,  let's do more with respect to dealing with the registration of juvenile  offenders in terms of attempting to ensure that they will have an  opportunity for rehabilitation.   While I hope we may still work to make additional improvements to  this legislation, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I urge my colleagues to again consider the importance of our duty to  protect children from sexual predators in as efficient and broad-based  manner as we possibly can.   I want to thank the continued service of John Walsh and offer again,  as we all do, our deepest expression of remorse for the loss that he  and so many families tragically have experienced at the hands of  horrific sexual predators and those who would attack our children.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
