 Madam Speaker, November is Lung Cancer Awareness Month,  an important time for us to highlight the need for more research and  better community awareness on this disease.   The statistics surrounding lung cancer are astounding. Approximately  541,000 Americans living today have been diagnosed with lung cancer at  some point in their lives. While the rate of new lung cancer cases over  the past 4 decades has dropped 36 percent for men, it has risen 84  percent for women.   That is why I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 2222, the Women and Lung  Cancer Research and Preventive Services Act. This bill would evaluate  and identify opportunities for more research, preventive services, and  public awareness campaigns.   Research shows that there is a disparate impact of lung cancer on  women, especially women who have never smoked. More research is needed  to understand why this is happening and what can be done to stop it.   Preventing cancer should never be a partisan issue. We should be  working together to combat the scourge of cancer for the benefit of  patients, families, and survivors. H.R. 2222 is a bipartisan effort  that would do just that.                            ____________________
