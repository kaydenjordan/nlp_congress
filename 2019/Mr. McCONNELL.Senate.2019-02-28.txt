 Madam President, I would like to begin with a few  words on President Trump's Hanoi summit with North Korea. The President  should be commended for his personal commitment to persuading Kim Jong  Un to pursue a different path.   By January 2017, it was clear the prior administration's policy of  strategic patience had not worked. In retrospect, it was not very  strategic to sit patiently while North Korea dramatically expanded its  nuclear and missile capabilities. The Trump administration, in taking a  different path, moved quickly to adopt the policy of maximum pressure,  rallying international partners to respond firmly to North Korea's  provocations. The President also demonstrated a willingness to engage  the North Korean leader directly, breathing new life into our diplomacy  to solve this seemingly intractable problem.   The President has gone the extra mile to demonstrate his sincerity in  wanting to resolve this issue. It was smart to bring Kim Jong Un to  Singapore and to Vietnam to expose the North Korean delegation to the  kind of economic prosperity that could be possible if he were to choose  a new path.   High-level diplomacy can carry high-level risk, but the President  should be commended for walking away when it became clear insufficient  progress had been made on denuclearization. Kim Jong Un now has a long  train ride home, and he will have time to reflect on the future that is  still within North Korea's grasp, but the President has demonstrated  that such a future must be accompanied by real denuclearization.   Every country has a stake in North Korea's denuclearization. I hope  China and other countries with influence over Kim Jong Un will do their  part to urge him to return to the negotiating table and seize the  opportunity to bring prosperity to the people of North Korea and peace  and stability to the Korean Peninsula and to the region.
