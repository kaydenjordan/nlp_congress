 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the FIRST STEP  Act. I think this is a very important bill and important legislation. A  lot of people have worked very hard on it, and there are only good  intentions behind this legislation. I know it is an attempt to improve  our criminal justice system generally, to reduce recidivism among  offenders, and to increase public safety. Those are the goals. I am  sympathetic to all of those goals, and I am seriously considering  supporting this act. I want to see how this amendment process plays  out, but I recognize that a lot of good work has been done here.   I want to begin by saying that I am also sympathetic to the  legitimate concerns that have been raised about this legislation by law  enforcement officers. I have spoken with people across  [[Page S7758]]  Pennsylvania who protect us every day who have some concerns about  this. I am glad to see there were changes made along the way--changes  that address some of the serious concerns I and others have raised. I  think there is still room for more improvement. That is why I support  the three modest amendments Senators Cotton and Kennedy have proposed.   One of the amendments will simply ensure that all violent felons-- such as carjackers and criminals who assault law enforcement officers  and sex offenders--will not be eligible for the earned time credit.  That is a good amendment, in my view.   A further feature is to notify victims of crimes before the prisoner  who committed the crime is released. I think that is a reasonable  provision for victims, to give them a chance to have their voice heard  before the perpetrator is released.   Finally, another feature is to simply require the Department of  Justice to track the outcomes. Let's make sure we know a few years from  now, if this passes and is signed into law, whether we have reduced the  recidivism rate. We should have that information.   These are commonsense amendments. I support them and urge my  colleagues to do likewise. My real purpose is to highlight one of the  amendments I have filed and hope I am going to be able to get a vote  on. My amendment concerns especially victims of crime but specifically  victims of child abuse, sexual assault, domestic violence, and other  violent crimes, and the need to end Congress's longstanding injustice  to these victims.   The FIRST STEP Act does a lot, especially for people who have  committed crimes. Unfortunately, it doesn't do anything that I am aware  of for the victims of crimes. These two things are not mutually  exclusive. We have an opportunity here with this amendment to address  something very substantive we can do for crime victims. Specifically,  Congress should stop what I think is an unconscionable annual raid on  the Crime Victims Fund. Since fiscal year 2000, Congress has diverted  literally billions of dollars from the Crime Victims Fund by using a  budget gimmick to withhold money from victims and the organizations  that help victims. Here is how it works:   Every year, the Crime Victims Fund collects money from Federal  criminal fines and penalties. There is no taxpayer money involved.  These are criminal fines that result from convictions.   The fund was created in 1984 with a very simple principle in mind;  that is, the money the Federal Government collects from those convicted  of a crime ought to be used to help those who are victimized by the  crime. Under the Federal statutes, the money collected in 1 year is  supposed to be disbursed to victims of crime the next year.  Unfortunately, starting in 1999, Congress began to systematically  withhold some of the money that is supposed to go to the victims,  effectively shortchanging the victims--people who, through no fault of  their own, were victims of a crime.   You might ask, why would people do a thing like that? The reason it  is done is because the Federal Government has bizarre and ridiculous  budgetary rules. One of them holds that when you shortchange victims of  crime this way, when you refuse to allocate the criminal penalties to  victims as you are supposed to, you get to pretend for budgetary  purposes that you are saving taxpayer money. It is totally untrue. It  is not factually saving taxpayer money at all, but you get to pretend  that it is. So in pretending that those savings have been achieved, it  allows you to spend more money elsewhere, and there are few things  Congress likes better than spending money. So this money, which is  supposed to go to victims of crime, is instead spent on completely  unrelated discretionary items in appropriations bills year after year.   How much, you might ask, does this matter? Does this actually add up  to anything meaningful? Astoundingly, over the last two decades of this  practice, Congress has used this gimmick to add $82 billion in  unrelated Federal spending that has all gone to increase our deficit  and our debt, all because every year they withheld money that was  supposed to go to victims of crime.   Where did it go? The money could go to anything that Congress decides  to spend it on, anything in the Commerce-Justice-Science approps bill.  I will give one example. In 2014, Congress gave victims less than 6  percent of the money they were supposed to give to victims of crime-- again, not taxpayer money; criminal penalty money. It used the  remaining $11.8 billion for other spending. That year, the CJS bill  funded $360,000 for a NASA study that paid individuals $18,000 to lie  in bed for 70 days, $1.75 million for a PBS documentary to promote a  New York Times bestselling book, and $150,000 so that a game designer  could develop a zombie-fighting web game. These are just a few  examples. This is beyond egregious.   Because of this disgraceful behavior on the part of Congress, it has  been much more difficult for victims of crime to receive the services  they are supposed to get. A lot of the Crime Victim Fund goes to people  who are helping some of the most vulnerable in our society. Now, in  part because this money is not fully allocated as it should be, abused  children sometimes have to wait weeks before they can receive the full  medical and emotional services and care they need. There are rape  victims who are not able to obtain the prophylactic medications they  need to prevent them from contracting HIV/AIDS. Victims fleeing  domestic violence are often unable to find a bed for themselves and  their children. This is all because Congress refuses to allocate the  money it is supposed to allocate to these victims. We can fix this. We  can fix it. We can fix it this afternoon.   In fairness, in the past few years, the extent of this gimmickry,  this terrible practice, has diminished, and I give a lot of credit to  Senator Shelby. The chairman of the Appropriations Committee has  decided to increase the appropriations in recent years to something  approximating where it should be. But still there are billions that  have not been allocated to victims, and there is no guarantee  whatsoever that the next year, the year after, or at any point in time,  Congress won't resume massively shortchanging victims as it has in the  past.   What I think we need is a permanent solution to this, and my  amendment will provide the fix we need. It is identical to a bill I  have already introduced, which is called the Fairness for Crime Victims  Act of 2018. This bill is endorsed by many, many victim advocacy  groups. Last year, virtually identical legislation was unanimously  passed out of the Budget Committee. Let me say that again. Not a single  Republican, not a single Democrat opposed my legislation in the Budget  Committee. All it does is returns honesty to the Crime Victims Fund by  ensuring a steady stream of funds--the very funds from criminals that  are supposed to go to victims and their advocates. It would simply  ensure that they get what they are supposed to get.   As the Senate considers the FIRST STEP Act, I think we should take  this opportunity to end this unconscionable raid on the Crime Victims  Fund. If we are going to do something to help criminals, we should also  do something to help victims.   All I am asking for is that we have a vote on this. If people  disagree with me and they think we should continue this practice, OK,  vote no, but let's have a vote. At a moment when we are doing so much  for criminals, I think it is reasonable to do something for victims.                Unanimous Consent Request--Amendment No. 4120    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending  amendment and call up amendment No. 4120.    Mr. President, I am not shocked, but I am extremely  disappointed. One of the things that is so disappointing and  frustrating about serving in this body is, it was once a body where a  difference of opinion would be litigated on the Senate floor, including  culminating in a vote, and we would decide as a body whether we wanted  to proceed in a certain direction. Now, our friends in the minority are  refusing to even allow the vote to occur.   I am not asking for a guaranteed outcome. I am not asking for any  outcome. I am simply asking that we have a chance to debate and vote on  whether victims of crime across America are going to get the allocation  they are supposed to get.   In recent years, the situation has improved. If that is the  commitment of my friends on the other side, they should be willing to  enshrine that improvement in law, but they are not, which might speak  volumes about where this is headed.   I am very disappointed that we are not going to get a vote on this  amendment today. I do, however, hope we will be able to vote on and  pass the Cotton and Kennedy amendments.   With that, I yield the floor.
