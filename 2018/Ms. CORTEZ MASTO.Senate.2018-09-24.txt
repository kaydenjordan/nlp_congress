 Mr. President, for 25 years the Gay and Lesbian  Community Center, ``the Center,'' of Southern Nevada has served as a  vital resource for the LGBTQ community and their allies in and around  Las Vegas. The Center offers essential services such as comprehensive  sex education and college and career readiness, all while fighting to  end discrimination against and further the well-being of the lesbian,  gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer community.   In 1993, the Gay and Lesbian Community Center of Southern Nevada  purchased a building and opened its doors, becoming the first safe  public space in Las Vegas for LGBTQ people. That year, the Nevada  Legislature repealed sodomy laws and the Center hosted its first LGBTQ  rights celebration.   Since then, the Center has continued to grow with the city and has  hosted many more events, including to celebrate the Supreme Court  decision instituting marriage equality nationwide. The Center also  celebrated the opening of a new building in 2013 named after Las Vegas  philanthropist Robert Forbuss. The Center has increased its services,  outreach, and membership throughout the years and has formed valuable  community partnerships with government entities, private companies, and  other nonprofits in order to maintain its no-cost community  programming.   For two and a half decades, the Center has been unwavering in its  commitment to the people of southern Nevada. The Center will continue  to be on the leading edge of advocacy for the human rights of gay,  lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer individuals. I ask my  colleagues to join me in thanking the Gay and Lesbian Center of  Southern Nevada for its dedication to ensuring all Nevadans are treated  equally and for its service to the community over the past 25 years.                            ____________________
