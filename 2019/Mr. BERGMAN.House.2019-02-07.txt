 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment to H.R.  840, the Veterans' Access to Child Care Act.   My amendment is simple. It prohibits VA from constructing new  childcare facilities using funds made available by this bill. It does  not prohibit the VA from using existing facilities.   While I support the underlying bill and believe something as simple  as childcare services can greatly improve veterans' access to care, I  also understand how bloated VA's infrastructure portfolio has become.   Just last year, Congress passed the VA MISSION Act, which included  language to establish the Asset and Infrastructure Review Commission.  This commission is designed to assess areas in which the VA can  modernize and realign its existing infrastructure portfolio to save  valuable money and refocus on its core mission of caring for our  veterans.   Madam Chair, offering childcare services has the potential to make VA  benefits more accessible and convenient for all families. H.R. 840  allows VA to provide childcare services via private centers and through  collaboration with other Federal agencies, thus utilizing already  existing facilities.   Until the asset and infrastructure review is complete, it would be  irresponsible to allow VA to invest more limited resources in new  construction when positive, viable alternatives are available.   I appreciate the work our committee has done to help improve access  to care, and I look forward to our continued efforts to realign VA's  priorities and its unused or underutilized assets.   Mr. Chair, I urge support of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. David P. Roe).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.  [[Page H1426]]
