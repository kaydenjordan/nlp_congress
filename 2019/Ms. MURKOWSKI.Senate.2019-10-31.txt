 Mr. President, I know that several of my colleagues  have had an opportunity to take to the floor this week and today to  speak to the memory of a woman, a Senator, and a friend--certainly a  friend of mine--former Senator Kay Hagan from the State of North  Carolina.   Kay was one of those women whom you naturally gravitated to. She was  kind. She was generous in her southern manner and in her charm.   I rarely use the word ``delightful'' to describe people, but Kay was  a delightful woman. She was a friend to so many of us, and she was a  good colleague in the Senate.   We had an opportunity to work together on different legislative  matters, whether it was initiatives I was leading on mineral security  or initiatives she was working on with regard to small business and  HUBZones, but the one area we really did connect on for a couple years  was what we were trying to do with our sportsmen's bill.   We were successful in passing that through the Senate a couple years  ago, but we worked on this back in 2014, and it gave us an opportunity,  as two women from States where hunting and fishing and being engaged  with the outdoors is something that Alaskans and North Carolinians do  and enjoy. We shared stories. We shared just discussion about how we  were able to reach common ground. We figured if these two women from  these two parts of the country could figure this out and make it  happen, that would really be a good day, a positive day.   Well, it didn't happen at that particular time, but I am pleased to  say we were successful some years later, and I think much of that was  due, in part, to the good work of Kay Hagan.   I know there have been references to her legislative work, to her  quality as a woman and a leader. My heart is really with the Hagan  family, with her husband, Chip, and her extended family who truly loved  her and were very protective of her in so many ways. I know their loss  is a significant one.   I want them all to know that this Senator from Alaska shares that  love, shares that loss for a woman who served us all well. I wanted to  make sure that my comments were included among the many who have spoken  on Kay's life.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to speak to another matter this  afternoon, a matter that as I think about my tenure in the Senate and  those initiatives I have been engaged with that have really touched me  in a way that make me want to work all that much harder because it is  so challenging, it is so difficult, and in many, many ways, it is so  dark that anything I can do to shine a light on it, I will do so.   I came to the Senate floor 2 years ago, joined by my former colleague  from North Dakota, Senator Heidi Heitkamp. Heidi was on the floor  speaking about a bill she had introduced, Savanna's Act, but together  we were really working to speak to the urgency of addressing this  epidemic, if you will, this growing number of missing and murdered  Native women across America.   The awful truth in this country is that Native women are victims of  violence in unprecedented proportions.  [[Page S6359]]    When I say unprecedented, I will give you some of Alaska's numbers  just to kind of put it into perspective.   This month, October, is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, and so in  many of the communities in States across the country, we have been  focused on these issues of domestic violence and what more we can do to  address these issues of concern and safety.   Well, on October 1, the first day of this month where we are raising  this awareness, the headlines in the State's largest newspaper stated  that the rate of rape in the State of Alaska was up 11 percent between  2017 and 2018--an 11-percent increase in 1 year.   We are a State where, unfortunately, Alaska Native women are 2\1/2\  times more likely to be a victim of domestic violence. In Tribal  villages and Native communities, domestic violence rates are up to 10  times higher than the rest of the Nation--10 times higher.   So think about as bad as it is in areas that you are in, in our  Tribal villages and some of the Native communities, these rates are  staggering.   In 2015, it was estimated that 40 percent of sex trafficking victims  were Native Americans. Now, I know 2015 was a few years ago, but 40  percent of the victims who have been sex trafficked were Native  Americans.   The rate of sexual violence victimization among Alaska Native women  is at least seven times greater than non-Native females in the State.  So think about that. There is an unprecedented level of victimization,  of assault, of violence, of murder that is experienced by Alaska Native  women.   These are statistics that really should shock the conscience. I know  they shock mine. I have been exposed to them for so many years, but it  continues to shock.   We all know these are not just statistics. These are mothers, these  are sisters, these are aunts, these are cousins, these are friends, and  these are women who are being violated at rates that are unacceptable  anywhere in any State.   Now, I mentioned that some of the statistics are old, and that is  part of the problem, trying to understand what it is that we don't  know, so we need to get updated data, but what isn't old--and,  unfortunately, seemingly, every day we get new statistics that are  added to what we have already known.   It was just last week family and friends packed an Anchorage  courtroom for the arraignment of a man who had been charged with  murdering 52-year-old Veronica Abouchuk. She was a Native woman  originally from the village of St. Michael. She had been in Anchorage  for a period of time. She had been reported missing earlier this year,  and then she was found dead near the Old Glenn Highway in April.   It was just a few weeks ago now--maybe about 3 weeks ago--the Alaska  community was just horrified as we learned through the news of a video  cartridge that had been found on a street, and what was revealed was a  tape of torture and abuse of a Native woman.   That tape ultimately led to the arrest of this same man who is  accused of killing Veronica. That video showed the torture and the  murder of 30-year-old Kathleen Jo Henry. She was originally from a very  small village, the village of Eek.   These are stories of women. We read about what they have experienced,  what they have endured, and we think about their families who no longer  have these women in their lives. You just can't view them in the  abstract as statistics. What are we doing to respond to them as women,  women who are vulnerable and are being preyed upon? What are we doing  to act, to help?   I mentioned this is Domestic Violence Awareness Month. In Alaska, we  have started calling it Domestic Violence Action Month. Going from  awareness to action is really the key because I am here to tell you, in  Alaska, we are very aware of how severe the problem of violence against  Native women is--whether it is domestic violence, an assault, to them  being trafficked and murdered. We know the statistics.   When I am talking with Alaskans about what we are seeing with missing  and murdered indigenous women, the subject of trafficking keeps coming  into every conversation because that is, seemingly, what is happening  to so many who unfortunately go missing.   There are far, far, far too many stories that we then hear they were  trafficked and then ultimately murdered. This nexus is what is really  frightening.   I mentioned the data and understanding what it is that we know and  what we don't know--how big is the problem, what is happening with our  Native women that they are being victimized to the extent and to the  level we see. We are beginning to make some progress. We are beginning  to gather more data and understanding.   There is a lot we know we have to learn, but one thing that has  become clear is that these crimes are permeating cities across America.  They are in the cities, but they are also in our small, remote, and  rural communities.   There is really no geographic boundary that we are talking about  here. Initially, we had thought the problem of missing and murdered  indigenous women and girls was primarily a problem on the remote Indian  reservations, but we had some good, strong reporting from the Seattle- based Urban Indian Health Institute. We learned a lot there about the  gaps in the data. We learned that the number of Native women who go  missing in urban centers is as significant as those who go missing on  reservations or in rural areas.   In fact, last year there were 507 cases of Native women killed in  urban areas. Of those, 282 were confirmed murdered, 127 were confirmed  missing, and 98 cases are still listed in an unknown status. These  cases exist across 71 urban areas selected for the study--from  Baltimore to Orlando in the east coast and all the way up to the North  Slope in the community of Utqiagvik.   According to the report, Anchorage was among the top 10 cities  identified in this study, coming in at No. 3, with 21 cases of missing  and murdered indigenous girls. Overall, Alaska was the fourth highest  State in the Nation with 52 cases. Keep in mind that these are just the  cases that have actually been reported.   Making sure that we are understanding the extent of the problem and  the issues we are dealing with, the spotlight we are shining on the  issue of murdered indigenous women is growing, but we need to answer  those questions so we can move from awareness to action.   What are we doing? How are we doing? We are keenly focused--I am,  certainly, keenly focused--on what we can do to improve public safety  in Alaska. As shocking as many of these statistics are that I have  shared with you, what we know is that in far too many communities in  our State we lack law enforcement presence. These are remote  communities. These are small communities, maybe 300 people. When you  don't have law enforcement, when there is nobody there who can  administer justice, who can be the law, it is a safe place for bad  people to go and do bad things.   What we do to address this is on all of us. So as we are looking at  public safety in rural Alaska, I reminded Attorney General Barr when he  participated in a video conference at the Alaska Federation of Natives  convention a couple of weeks ago--he made the comment that we want to  make sure we have public safety throughout Alaska and that a woman  shouldn't have to move to the city to feel safe, and I had to remind  him--that in the cities, unfortunately, we are not seeing the level of  safety that we would seek.   But we are making some headway, and I want to share with colleagues  what we have just done in this Interior appropriations bill that we  moved through in the full Senate just this afternoon, and I thank  colleagues for that support.   For the first time, we are directing real dollars to prioritize the  crisis of missing and murdered indigenous women. We have included a  specific focus there within the Interior approps bill for FY 2020. We  provide funding to address the crisis with support for cold case  investigations, equipment, training, and background checks. This will  be an effort where we will work with the Department of Justice, with  the BIA, with the administration, with the State, and with the Tribes.   We also encourage the Indian Health Service to look at programs that  can help educate community health aides  [[Page S6360]]  on trauma informed care, which also includes collecting medical  evidence. Through the CJS approps bill that we passed, we build upon  efforts to address the high rates of violence that are experienced in  far too many Alaskan communities.   We have been advocating for the largest possible Victims of Crime Act  fund set aside for Native communities that disproportionately face  violence and have oftentimes extremely limited access to service.   We also secured significant funding for the Violence Against Women  Prevention and Prosecution Programs, and for State and local law  enforcement and Tribal assistance, we provide additional resources, as  well as resourcing for the COPS, or the Community Oriented Policing  Services Program, which is an initiative to increase the number of  police officers and ensure they are properly trained.   So I think we are making some headway on the appropriations side, but  I think we know there is more that we can do. We know there is more  that we must do.   I thank Attorney General Barr, who came up to the State of Alaska in  May at the invitation of Senator Sullivan and myself and many of our  leaders around the State, including our Tribal leaders, and he was able  to sit down at roundtables in Anchorage and was able to get up to Fort  Yukon, on the Yukon River, and come down to Bethel and to go out to the  small village of Napakiak, a community of about 350 people.   Following his visit, he was so struck by what he had heard and what  he had seen, and truly what he felt in his heart, that he moved forward  with a designation of a public safety emergency in the State of Alaska.  He has been working with us to help specifically address how we can  make these rural communities safer and what we can be doing with  everything from training to basic infrastructure. It is something we  are working collaboratively on.    We are also seeing so many individuals, organizations, and  communities really speaking up about this issue. Again, it is like the  data. If you don't know it, you can't respond to it. If the stories  aren't shared, as hard and awful as they are, it is difficult to know  how we respond. There are so many who are speaking up in different ways  to bring light to the fact that so many Native women have not received  justice.   There is a woman by the name of Amber Webb that I met when I was in  Fairbanks for the AFN conference. She has created this really powerful  visual symbol to honor missing and murdered women. She sketched the  faces of more than 200 missing and murdered indigenous women from  across North America. She sketched them on a giant white qaspeq. Qaspeq  is the traditional garb of a woman. She chose the qaspeq because it  symbolizes the adaptability and the strength of Native women. It is  pretty impressive. It is about 15 feet high. But, again, it is a white  qaspeq, with the portraits, the sketches, of these women.   In the center is the face of not a woman but a young girl, Ashley  Johnson Barr. She was a 10-year-old girl who was kidnapped and killed  in Kotzebue last year.   Being at Ashley's memorial services with the entire community of  Kotzebue--it probably felt like the whole region--grieving the loss of  that child in that brutal and awful murder in her home was something  that never leaves you.   On one sleeve of the qaspeq is sketched the face of Sophie Sergei.  Sophie was killed in 1993. She was at the University of Alaska  Fairbanks in one of the dorms. Her case was cold for 25 years. For 25  years, her family had no idea who brutally killed her and left her in a  bathtub of blood in a campus dorm room. That case broke loose with some  DNA testing not too many months ago. Her family is hoping that one day  there will be justice for their daughter, but the faces on that qaspeq  represent way too many lives lost.   Some of what we are facing in Alaska, when it comes to public safety,  is the lack of public safety in rural areas and an inability to ensure  that people are safe in their homes. When you look at the statistics  that we have, when you look at the issues you face, sometimes you have  to say: Maybe the way we have been doing things for this long just  isn't working out in these areas. Maybe there needs to be a different  dynamic.   I recently introduced what we are calling the Alaska Tribal Public  Safety Empowerment Act. It builds on a legislative provision that  Congressman Young has introduced. It is a pilot for Alaska Tribes to  address violence against Native women. In that bill, we empower Tribes  to exercise domestic violence criminal jurisdiction on a pilot basis,  similar to what we did in VAWA 2013 for those in Indian Country. We  allow Tribes to assume local control over local public safety matters.  We cannot deny safety or justice to an individual based on  jurisdictional issues. This addresses one critical piece, and that is  the Tribal empowerment.   There is another very important element, and that is coordination  among law enforcement agencies. I hear way too often from Alaskans who  tell me that they don't actually count a missing Native woman as  missing because the last time anybody saw her, she met somebody, she  left a village, she went to Anchorage, and nobody really heard of her  again. But what we know is that one of the most vulnerable times for  these young women is the transition from a village to a hub community  or to a city. We have heard from law enforcement that Native people,  especially these young Native girls, are targeted by traffickers when  they first arrive in Anchorage or Fairbanks or a hub community. It is  important that we both understand the scope of the problem and address  coordination between our State, our Federal, and our Tribal  governments. That is what Savanna's Act and this counterpart  legislation, the Not Invisible Act, do together.   I reintroduced Savanna's Act with Senator Cortez Masto earlier this  year. This was an effort where I was proud to carry the torch for  Senator Heitkamp, who has truly been a leader on this issue. Our bill  combats the epidemic of murdered and missing Native women and girls by  improving the Federal Government's response to addressing the crisis.  Savanna's Act increases coordination among all levels of law  enforcement, increases data collection in information sharing, and  empowers Tribal governments with the resources they need in cases  involving missing and murdered indigenous women and girls wherever they  occurred.   This second bill that I mentioned, with Senator Cortez Masto, is the  Not Invisible Act. What we have seen for far too long is that Native  families and communities mourn the loss of family members, sometimes  with the resolution of their cases of a murdered sister or a missing  loved one, but often the cases remain unsolved.   As I mentioned earlier, we were shocked in Alaska by the case of  Kathleen Jo Henry and the related case of Veronica Abouchuk. But what  is just as shocking is that the Abouchuk family has already--already-- experienced the loss of one of their sisters, Martha Toms, who was  killed in 2005 and whose case is still unsolved. So they have had  tragedy compounded upon tragedy.    These bills, Savanna's Act and the Not Invisible Act, attempt to  bring the issue of violence against Native women and the ongoing  epidemic of missing and murdered Indians to the attention of the  Nation. These families have faced unspeakable loss and, until recently,  have felt almost invisible, frustrated, and really just let down by  this system--the complex system that was supposed to protect them.   But to truly honor the memory of Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind and  acknowledge her family's loss, we have to close the jurisdictional  loopholes that criminals exploit. We have to improve the coordination  among law enforcement at all levels of government, and we have to  provide the necessary resources.   The Not Invisible Act designates an official in BIA to coordinate  violent crime prevention efforts across Federal agencies. It also  establishes a commission of local, Tribal, and Federal stakeholders to  make recommendations to the Department of the Interior and the  Department of Justice on how to combat this epidemic of disappearances,  homicides, violent crimes, and trafficking of Native Americans and  Alaska Natives.   We know we have a trust responsibility to our Native people, but also  we  [[Page S6361]]  have a duty of moral trust when we talk about keeping all Americans  safe. We all have to be part of the solution. By passing these bills,  we are saying that we are not going to accept what we have dealt with  and what we have faced for far too long.   I think we have to have a sense of urgency to keep Native women and  girls safe. It shouldn't be anything that is partisan. There is nothing  partisan about trying to protect women. There is nothing partisan about  trying to protect Native women. There is nothing Republican or  Democratic about the reality that we all deserve to have the same level  of protection and justice as every other woman in this country.   So I am back here on the Senate floor with the same message I had a  couple of years ago with Senator Heitkamp, and that is to urge  colleagues to move beyond awareness to action. Let's take up Savanna's  Act. Let's take up the Not Invisible Act. Let's act. Let's provide for  the safety that all these women should expect.   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
