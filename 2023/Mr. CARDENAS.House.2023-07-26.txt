 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Gloria  Molina, a trailblazer for Latino politicians.   Gloria fiercely served and advocated for the communities she  represented, for the city of Los Angeles, the County of Los Angeles,  and the State of California. She passed away in her home, surrounded by  her loving family, on May 14, at the age of 74.   Gloria was raised in an immigrant household with her nine siblings.  Her father, Leonardo, was a construction worker born in Los Angeles but  raised in Casas Grandes, Mexico. Her mother, Concepcion, was a  homemaker from Mexico. Together, her parents immigrated to the U.S. in  the 1940s. Gloria was the oldest of 10 children. As she did everything  in life, she led by example and helped wherever and whenever she could.   Gloria's commitment to public service began during President Jimmy  Carter's administration, where she served as a deputy for Presidential  Personnel and soon after that with the San Francisco Department of  Health and Human Services.   Gloria's activism was sparked by the Chicano movement, as she was a  woman of firsts. Gloria was first elected to office in 1982, when she  became the first Latina elected to the California State Assembly. Some  people made the mistake of underestimating Gloria's commitment to her  community and her tenacity. She beat the establishment candidate.  [[Page H3957]]    In 1987, Gloria ran for the Los Angeles City Council seat that had  been redistricted, becoming the first woman councilmember of Mexican  ancestry to serve on the Los Angeles City Council.   In 1991, she was elected and became the first Latina member of the  Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. She was known as a fiscal  watchdog committed to governance reforms, protecting public healthcare,  and fighting for quality-of-life issues for millions of residents.   Throughout more than 30 years as an elected official, Gloria changed  the landscape of Los Angeles, putting an end to a 100-year pattern of  dumping negative land-use developments on the east side of Los Angeles.  Her work in East LA resulted in the Los Angeles Metro Board of  Directors naming a train station in her honor.   Gloria worked with Mothers of East Los Angeles, a group that  organized against and successfully defeated the proposal to build a  prison in East Los Angeles.   Gloria valued the power of storytelling through art. She founded the  historical LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes and the Eastside Arts  Initiative, which provides financial support to community-based  organizations.                                time  1015    Thanks to her love of quilting, Gloria founded the quilting group the  East L.A. Stitchers, so that others could express themselves through  this art form.   Gloria successfully advocated for increased access to parks and green  spaces, as well as culturally engaging recreational areas. The motion  to rename Grand Park to the Gloria Molina Grand Park was approved and  will allow Gloria's legacy and impact to live on in projects that she  fought so hard to create.   On top of green and recreational spaces, Gloria constantly fought for  the improvement of women's rights and representation. She would  regularly fight against the construction of projects that would disrupt  predominantly Chicano and Mexican neighborhoods.   On top of her work in politics in the mid-2000s, she would drive  around through Skid Row in her free time looking for children living in  unsafe conditions so that she could call the Department of Family and  Children Services to find them a home.   She led a program that was later named the Gloria Molina Foster Youth  Education Program, with the sole purpose of being able to increase the  high school graduation rates of students in foster care systems.   As its leader, she and the program did just that and elevated  graduation rates from the national average of 58 percent to an amazing  80 percent. One of her final statements as she retired was that she  only regretted not being able to raise the average even more.   Gloria stood as a constant beacon of hard work, perseverance, and  strength--a role model to Latinas looking to succeed in politics, and a  role model to everyone.   Gloria taught us all to fight for those without a voice and to let  our passion drive our success. Her impact will be felt for generations  to come.   Gloria is survived by her daughter, Valentina; son-in-law, Brendan;  grandchildren, Santiago and Ximena; nine siblings; nieces; nephews; Ron  Martinez; and many die-hard Molinistas.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I grew up in Pacoima, California, a  working-class neighborhood that was unjustly targeted by the justice  system. It is a community that I am proud to currently represent.   There are kids like Jerome Dixon, who was wrongfully incarcerated as  a child and locked up for 20 years because he was pressured into giving  a false confession after 25 hours of interrogation without having an  adult or a parent present with him. He spent 20 years of his life  behind bars for a crime that he did not commit.   For over 25 years, I have worked to fix a broken system that has  prioritized stuck-on-stupid incarceration over proven, effective  rehabilitation. That is why, last week, I announced the ``Second Chance  for Justice Package'' with my colleagues, Congresswoman Kamlager-Dove  and Senator Cory Booker.   These bills further invest in youth development and crime prevention  programs. They will make our communities safer, reduce expenses for  taxpayers, and demonstrate a real commitment to treating children with  dignity.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting these  commonsense bills. We owe our children a system that works with them,  not one that is out to get them.                            ____________________
