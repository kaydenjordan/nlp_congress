 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 6, which we are voting on here today. H.R. 6 includes my  legislation, the Caring Recovery for Infants and Babies Act, known as  the CRIB Act.   The most innocent victims of the opioid crisis are the precious  newborn babies that were exposed to drugs during pregnancy. It simply  breaks your heart.   Three years ago, I helped start Lily's Place in my hometown, a  healthcare facility that has provided compassionate, loving healthcare  to more than 200 newborn babies going through the ravages of withdrawal  after birth.   Passing the CRIB Act today will allow this one-of-a-kind program to  be replicated around the country so every child gets the best possible  chance for a healthy start in life.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my fellow Members to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 6,  the CRIB Act.                            ____________________
