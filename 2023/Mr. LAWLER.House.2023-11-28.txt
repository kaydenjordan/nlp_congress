 Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, I was in Israel with Chairman  McCaul, Ranking Member Meeks, and a bipartisan delegation. We met with  Prime Minister Netanyahu, and we watched 21 minutes of unedited, raw  footage of the October 7 terrorist attack. We watched Hamas terrorists  indiscriminately kill women, children, and babies. We watched them take  innocent civilians hostage, including Doron Katz Asher and her two  daughters, Raz and Aviv. Doron's uncle is a constituent of mine in the  17th Congressional District of New York.   We met with families of the hostages, including the brother of Emily  Hand. I sat next to him as he tearfully told his sister's story,  bringing the rest of us to tears as he talked about the fact that his  8-year-old sister would spend her ninth birthday--the Friday after our  meeting--alone, held captive by Hamas terrorists.   A few weeks ago, in New York City, I met with the mother of Or Yaakov  and Yagil Yaakov, 13- and 16-year-old young men who were held captive.  All of them have since been released.   I thank the administration for negotiating to get their release, but  let's be clear: Hamas is a vile, barbaric terrorist organization.   We hear Members calling for a cease-fire. There was a cease-fire on  October 6. In fact, there have been eight cease-fires in 15 years, each  time violated by Hamas. In this most recent one, the biggest  slaughtering of Jews since the Holocaust, 240 innocents were taken away  from their families.   While they are releasing hostages, it is not enough. I have a simple  way for this to end. If people want a cease-fire, Hamas must surrender.  It is that simple. We want these hostages home, and we want to make  sure that the innocent lives lost are not in vain.    Mr. Speaker, we saw news reports that Hamas would not  release a 10-month-old baby and, in fact, was turning that baby over to  another terrorist organization. That is the type of people, if you can  even call them that, who you are dealing with.   The United States must do everything it can to stand by its greatest  ally in the Middle East and, indeed, across the world, the State of  Israel. We will vote on a resolution that makes it clear that not only  does Israel have a right to exist, but they have a right to defend  themselves, and the only way that this ends peacefully is for Hamas to  surrender.     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 888) reaffirming the State of Israel's right to  exist.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 888         Whereas the Jewish people are native to the Land of Israel;        Whereas throughout history and across the reign of multiple       kingdoms, the Jewish people were persecuted and expelled from       the Land of Israel, forced to live as minority diaspora       communities in other lands;        Whereas Jewish diaspora communities were historically       violently persecuted in, and in some cases expelled from,       other countries throughout the Middle East, Europe, Africa,       and Asia due to their religion;        Whereas the Nazis attempted to annihilate the entire Jewish       population of Europe during the Holocaust, murdering       6,000,000 Jews during this time;        Whereas this genocide provided new urgency to re-establish       a Jewish homeland for the Jewish people following the       Holocaust, where they would not be a vulnerable minority,       where they could freely practice their faith, and where       something like the Holocaust could never happen again;        Whereas the modern State of Israel was established on May       14, 1948;        Whereas even after the establishment of the State of       Israel, other countries and terrorist entities continued to       attack Israel, reject its right to exist, and call for its       destruction; and        Whereas Israel is the only Jewish State, and therefore,       despite persistent external threats, the existence of Israel       provides Jews a place to live free from persecution and       discrimination: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) reaffirms the State of Israel's right to exist;        (2) recognizes that denying Israel's right to exist is a       form of antisemitism;        (3) rejects calls for Israel's destruction and the       elimination of the only Jewish State; and        (4) condemns the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Israel.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H5924]]  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to urge the House to agree to my resolution  that reaffirms Israel's fundamental right to exist.   This is a pretty simple and straightforward resolution. Israel has a  right to exist. You either believe that or you don't. The American  people should see very clearly whether or not the Members of Congress  affirm Israel's right to exist.   President Harry Truman recognized Israel 11 minutes after its  founding. America was the first country to recognize the State of  Israel, and for good reason.   Over the last 75 years, Israel has become the greatest ally of the  United States--our shared values, shared heritage. The relationship  between our two Nations is unbreakable.   I fundamentally believe that the terrorist attacks of October 7  perpetrated by Hamas are about one thing: Hamas does not believe Israel  has the right to exist. Hamas wants to eradicate the Jewish people from  the face of the Earth. They say so.   Other bad actors like Hezbollah share that perspective. Iran, the  greatest state sponsor of terrorism in the world, the backer and funder  of Hamas, has been calling for the eradication of the State of Israel  for millennia. They don't believe they have the right to exist.   This resolution seeks to reaffirm the commitment made by President  Truman upon Israel's founding. We not only recognize Israel, we  reaffirm Israel's fundamental right to exist.   In the wake of the horrific October 7 attacks on Israel, we saw  Members of this body and other opponents of Israel call for the  elimination of Israel. When they chant: ``From the river to the sea,  Palestine shall be free,'' they mean that Israel will not exist.   I want Palestinians to be free. I want them to be free from their  oppressors: Hamas and the Palestinian authority.   Hamas has used Palestinians as human shields even until today. As  Israel prosecutes this war against this terrorist organization, Hamas  uses Palestinians as human shields, camping out in hospitals and  schools, launching missiles, shooting innocent civilians.   I watched in horror the 21-minute unedited, raw footage of the  October 7 terrorist attack. Every Member of Congress was offered the  opportunity to watch a 45-minute viewing of that attack.   Nearly half of Congress chose not to come, including some of the  Members who have made it clear that they don't support Israel's right  to exist.                                time  1800    On college campuses and city streets, we see people calling for an  intifada, actively promoting the destruction of the Jewish state.  Everyone has a right to say what they want about a foreign government,  to say what they want about war, but they don't have the right to  delegitimize the very existence of the Jewish state to justify terror.   The State of Israel was created 75 years ago to reestablish the  native homeland of the Jewish people. For centuries, Jews were  discriminated against and persecuted wherever they went. This  culminated in the attempted genocide of European Jews during the  Holocaust; 6 million Jews slaughtered.   This most recent genocide provides new urgency to reestablish the  Jewish homeland where the Jewish people were displaced, and we wanted  to create a homeland where they weren't a vulnerable minority, where  they could freely practice their faith, and where something like the  Holocaust could never happen again.   Yet, on October 7, we saw the largest slaughtering of Jews since the  Holocaust. Yet, still today, many Jews view Israel as the safest place  for them to live, even as rockets and missiles come from all sides.   Denying Israel's right to exist is denying the Jewish people the  right to self-determination. It is denying the Jewish people's historic  ties to the land. It is justifying war crimes against babies, and let's  call it what it is, it is anti-Semitic.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this commonsense resolution  that makes one thing fundamentally clear: Israel has a right to exist.  Congress must never stop pushing back against Israel's opponents, and  we must reject biased attempts to destroy our greatest ally.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on  Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   It should be clear by now to each and every Member of this body on  both sides of the aisle and every American that Israel has a right to  exist. This sentiment is unequivocal and is a critical point to  unequivocally voice now in our ally's time of need.   Harry Truman recognized the State of Israel 11 minutes after its  founding. For 75 years, the United States and Israel have had a special  bond. Israel is the only multiracial, multiethnic, multireligious  democracy in the Middle East. It is a beacon of hope, of freedom, and  of opportunity.   If anyone in this body believes that they do not have the right to  exist, please explain to us and the American people what nation does.   This is a simple vote, and every Member should be on record in  support of Israel's right to exist. If they cannot muster the courage  to support Israel's right to exist at this moment, they don't belong in  Congress, period.   This is a simple vote, and I encourage all of my colleagues to stand  with Israel, to defend and reaffirm their very right to exist, and to  defend the right of the Jewish people to practice their faith.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 683) expressing support for the diplomatic  relations required to encourage the Government of Mexico to fulfill its  water deliveries on an annual basis to the United States under the  treaty between the United States and Mexico regarding the utilization  of the Colorado and Tijuana Rivers and of the Rio Grande.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 683         Whereas the treaty between the United States and Mexico       regarding the utilization of the Colorado and Tijuana Rivers       and of the Rio Grande, signed at Washington, February 1944       (59 Stat. 1219), commits the Government of Mexico to send an       average of not less than 350,000 acre-feet of water annually       over a 5-year cycle to the United States;        Whereas Mexico repeatedly waits until the end of this 5-      year cycle to fulfill such water commitment; and        Whereas each year, farmers in south Texas are experiencing       water shortages: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) supports the diplomatic relations required to encourage       the Government of Mexico to fulfill its water deliveries on       an annual basis to the United States under the treaty between       the United States and Mexico regarding the utilization of the       Colorado and Tijuana Rivers and of the Rio Grande, signed at       Washington, February 1944 (59 Stat. 1219);        (2) encourages Mexico to fulfill such commitments on an       annual basis;        (3) acknowledges that farmers in south Texas are       experiencing water shortages;        (4) supports negotiations on a Minute that will ensure more       predictable and reliable water deliveries to users in the       United States; and        (5) encourages new commitments to ensure that the United       States receives annual deliveries of at least 350,000 acre-      feet of water under such treaty.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H5927]]    Mr. Speaker, stretching from the mountains of Colorado to the Gulf of  Mexico, the Rio Grande River also forms over 1,200 miles of the  international border between the United States and Mexico.   The Treaty on Utilization of Waters of the Colorado and Tijuana  Rivers and of the Rio Grande, signed in 1944, secures consistent and  dependable water supplies for both countries, which is critically  important in our desert Southwest.   The treaty obligates Mexico to make available to the U.S. not less  than 350,000 acre-feet of water per year from the main channel of the  Rio Grande, averaged over a consecutive 5-year period. However, since  1994, Mexico has, on multiple occasions, failed to fulfill its Rio  Grande water delivery commitments.   The latest data indicates that we have now moved into year 4 of the  5-year cycle, and Mexico is in arrears of over 680,000 acre-feet of  water, nearly two full years' worth. Mexico's recurring failure has  reached real-world repercussions, especially for American farmers and  ranchers, who have suffered devastating crop and cattle losses.   U.S. diplomats and officials must urge Mexico to honor its  commitments and establish regulations to regularize water deliveries.   With this resolution, the House of Representatives affirms its  support for the United States to use its resources to secure compliance  by the Mexican Government.   I thank my colleague from Texas, Congresswoman Monica De La Cruz, for  introducing this bipartisan measure, which received unanimous support  in the House Foreign Affairs Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. De La Cruz), the author of this resolution.   Ms. De La CRUZ. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H. Res. 683.  This is a matter of utmost importance that impacts the lives and  livelihoods of families in south Texas and across all of America.   The ongoing drought and resulting water scarcity in the Rio Grande  Valley represents a crisis for our farmers and our communities. Under  the 1944 water treaty, our neighbors in Mexico have pledged to supply  the United States of America with an average of 350,000 acre-feet of  water annually over a 5-year cycle.   Unfortunately, there have been consistent delays in meeting these  obligations that have severely affected American agriculture.   The absence of adequate water threatens to drastically reduce their  yields, potentially cutting their usual production in half. This  situation poses a threat not only to local communities but also to our  national food security, escalating the costs for American families, and  increasing our reliance on imported produce.   This shortfall is also leading to stringent water restrictions in our  community, further burdening families and businesses. It is, therefore,  incumbent upon the Mexican Government to fulfill their treaty  obligations. It is not fair for American families, American farmers,  and ranchers to be penalized due to noncompliance by Mexico.   In response to this pressing issue, I introduced this bipartisan  House resolution that expresses support for the diplomatic relations  necessary to ensure Mexico adheres to the 1944 water treaty.   This resolution emphasizes the need for consistent water delivery to  the United States and encourages renewed commitments to uphold the  annual water deliveries.   Mr. Speaker, I express my sincere thanks to the bipartisan coalition  of House Members, including my esteemed colleague, Henry Cuellar, for  their support in bringing the resolution to the House floor.  Additionally, I thank the chairman, my fellow Texan (Mr. McCaul), for  his efforts with this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this bipartisan House resolution. It is crucial that the 1944  water treaty be honored as it provides vital support for American  farmers who are pivotal in sustaining our Nation's food supply.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my community and all of south Texas, we are  thankful for the attention given to this urgent matter.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.
