 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I also  thank him for his great leadership working with Ranking Member Katko on  bringing this bipartisan legislation to the floor for a bipartisan  commission.   Let's talk about where we are. Here we are in the Capitol of the  United States. The dome of the U.S. Capitol has always been a beacon of  democracy and hope to America and to the world. Under this dome, our  Nation has abolished slavery; secured equal protections for all; ended  a civil war; enfranchised women; established Medicare and Medicaid,  voting rights and civil rights; and met the needs of the American  people.   Under this dome, schoolchildren learn about their country's history  and what we are doing to advance their future. They come here and see  us honor those who have contributed to the success of our country:  Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson, et cetera. But they know that our  Founders, those patriots, wanted us to be working for a better future  as we honor our history.   Under this dome, when children learn about our country's history,  they also learn about what we are doing for their futures. Legislators  pass laws. The press engages with our democracy, reporting on it. Staff  and workers enable all of this to happen.   This dome is a symbol of the determination of America. But this was  not always so. Let us recall that the dome of the Capitol was built  during the Civil War as our country was riven by brutal conflict. At  the time, many said the iron and steel used for construction were  needed for the war effort. They urged the President not to continue the  work on the dome. President Lincoln said no. He knew that our country  needed a symbol of strength and unity, a reminder of the shared ideals  and common purpose that built our Nation.   It was a beacon of hope to guide us through times of darkness, and he  knew that the work must continue as a sign of our strength and the  unity of our country.   Mr. Speaker, on January 6, and in the days, weeks, and months after,  the Capitol dome was, once again, such a beacon.   Would we prevail?   January 6 was the day called for in the Constitution to validate the  Presidential election. It was not just another day in the life of  Congress. That day, one of the darkest days in our history, our temple  of democracy was under assault by insurrectionists.   The gleeful desecration of our Capitol resulted in multiple deaths  and physical harm to over 140 members of law enforcement and terror and  trauma among staff, workers, and even Members.   The insurrection was called for to impede our constitutional mandate,  but the Congress returned to the Capitol that night to accomplish our  purpose. We agreed in a bipartisan way that day that we would return to  the Capitol, and that sent an important signal to the world.   The insurrection called for people to impede our constitutional  mandate,  [[Page H2584]]  but we returned to the Capitol. Thanks to the courage of the Capitol  Police, Members, and support workers, we showed the country and,  indeed, the world that we would not be diverted from our duty and that  we would respect our responsibility to the Constitution of the United  States.   We take that oath to protect and defend the Constitution. Again, in a  bipartisan way, we agreed to come back to the Capitol.   Today, over 4 months later, many questions regarding the  circumstances of this assault on our democracy and response to it  remain. It is imperative that we seek the truth of what happened on  January 6.   To do that, Congress must, in a spirit, I believe, of bipartisanship  and patriotism, establish an independent and bipartisan 9/11-type  commission. Today, thanks to the leadership of Chairman Bennie Thompson  and Ranking Member   John Katko, legislation to create such a  commission is on the House floor.   It is important to note, Mr. Speaker, that this is happening 4\1/2\  months after the January 6 insurrection. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues  know, but many were not here at the time, legislation establishing the  9/11 Commission, 9/11/2001, was not signed into law until the end of  November 2002, over 14 months after the attacks.   So, people have been saying: How come we don't have a commission?   It takes time to build bipartisanship and come to agreement. Let us  hope that the leadership that Mr. Thompson and Mr. Katko have  demonstrated will be leadership that we will follow and that we will  continue in the most bipartisan way in order to seek the truth.   Today, 4 months later, many questions regarding the circumstances  still exist. This commission is designed to be impartial and  experienced. The legislation requires that the commissioners be  ``prominent United States citizens with national recognition and  significant depth of experience.''   It also indicates that they should not be Members of Congress or  elected in another capacity. Commissioners will be appointed from the  highest echelons of government service; law enforcement; civil rights,  civil liberties, and privacy; Armed Forces; intelligence;  counterterrorism; cybersecurity; technology; and law.   The commission will be, again, bipartisan and bicameral, with  commissioners appointed by the majority and minority leadership in the  House and Senate. It will be actionable and effective, culminating in a  final report on the facts and causes of January 6, along with  recommendations to prevent further attacks on our democratic  institutions.   I heard earlier Chairman Thompson acknowledge the support and  endorsement of the previous chairs of the 9/11 Commission, Governor  Kean and Chairman Lee Hamilton from Congress, the co-chairs of the 9/11  Commission. They had written to us earlier about the need for such a  bipartisan commission, but they also wanted not only to find out the  truth so this doesn't happen again, but also to reinforce our  commitment to democracy and take us on a path that is better and more  unifying.   That is a responsibility we have, and that is a hope that I have  emerging from this debate and this vote today, that we will be able to  have a strong bipartisan vote that takes us down a path more unifying  for our country. We have this opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, the press says to me: Why don't you just go do your own  task force and your own select committee to investigate this? You have  the votes, you have subpoena power, and you have this or that.    I said: I don't want to do that. We want this to be as it is shaped,  bipartisan with shared responsibility and shared staff in a way that  the public will have respect for the outcome.   To that end, 140 national security leaders have called for such a  commission. This is what they have said: ``The events of January 6  exposed severe vulnerabilities in the Nation's preparedness for  preventing and responding to domestic terrorist attacks. The immediate  security failings that permitted a lethal breach of the Capitol complex  by armed extremists raise serious questions and demand immediate  solutions. . . . A failure to deploy the full suite of tools available  to fully understand January 6 and address its causes will leave the  Capitol, and the Nation, vulnerable to future attacks.''   This list is nonpartisan, 140 Democrats and Republicans. I don't even  know what party some of them are.   I include their statement in the Record, Mr. Speaker.    Letter From Former Senior National Security, Military, and Elected    Officials Calling On Congress To Create a Bipartisan 1/6 Commission         Dear Members of Congress: We are former senior national       security, military, and elected officials who have       represented or served Democrats, Republicans, or       administrations of both parties. We write to encourage this       Congress to establish an independent and bipartisan national       commission to investigate the January 6th assault of the U.S.       Capitol Complex and its direct causes, and to make       recommendations to prevent future assaults and strengthen the       resilience of our democratic institutions.        We also write to you with great urgency in light of what we       collectively see as an exigent and growing threat. The events       of January 6th exposed severe vulnerabilities in the nation's       preparedness for preventing and responding to domestic       terrorist attacks. The immediate security failings that       permitted a lethal breach of the Capitol Complex by armed       extremists raise serious questions and demand immediate       solutions.        But January 6th was also the result of complex national       security threats. These include coordinated disinformation       campaigns, nontransparent financing of extremist networks,       potential foreign influences, and white supremacist violent       extremism, which the Department of Homeland Security       identified in an October 2020 report as among ``the most       persistent and lethal threat[s] in the Homeland.'' As FBI       Director Christopher Wray testified to you recently,       ``January 6th was not an isolated event. The problem of       domestic terrorism has been metastasizing across the country       for a long time now and it's not going away anytime soon.''       Understanding how these forces culminated in an attack on the       infrastructure of our democracy is critical to preventing       future attacks.        In the wake of September 11th, the administration and       Congress jointly acknowledged that the attack's causes were       complex and that an independent and well-equipped national       commission was an essential tool to aid the federal       government. Congressional inquiries, law enforcement       activities, and a national commission not only worked in       parallel, but critically complemented each other's necessary       work. An independent commission should not supplant the       ongoing work by the legislative and executive branches, but       it can uniquely support them by providing comprehensive and       expert recommendations for Congress to act upon.        Commissions--properly empowered, resourced, and led--can       establish a full picture of events and an analysis of their       causes, from which nonpartisan recommendations can       authoritatively flow. With dedicated time, resources, and       expert staffing, they can also exclusively focus on the       matter at hand over an appropriate time horizon. Given the       gravity of January 6th as a national security matter--the       violent disruption to the transition of power and the       continuing threat of future attacks--a national commission       examining the lead up to the January 6th assault, and the       attendant security lapses, is not only appropriate, but a       critical component of the national response.        A failure to deploy the full suite of tools available to       fully understand January 6th and address its causes will       leave the Capitol, and the nation, vulnerable to future       attacks. In bipartisan fashion, we have successfully       marshaled these tools before, and we implore you to do so       once again.            Sincerely,        (Note: All titles are former positions or military ranks       held prior to retirement.)

After the bipartisan agreement on this commission was  reached, the respected bipartisan chairs of the 9/11 Commission, Thomas  Kean and Lee Hamilton, endorsed it, as was mentioned by the chairman  and as I referenced earlier.   I want to repeat it because I think it bears repetition:         We very strongly urge House Members to support H.R. 3233,       the bipartisan National Commission to Investigate the January       6 Attack on the United States Capitol Complex bill that would       create a 9/11-style commission to investigate the January 6       assault on the U.S. Capitol. That was a dark day in American       history, one of the darkest.        As chairman and vice chairman of the 9/11 Commission, unity       of purpose was key to the effectiveness of the group. We put       country above party, without bias, the events before, during,       and after the attack. We sought to understand our       vulnerabilities in order to prevent future acts of terrorism.    The chair and vice chair went on to say:         Today, democracy faces a new threat. The January 6 attack       on the U.S. Capitol was one of the darkest days in the       history of our country. Americans deserve an objective and       accurate account of what happened.    Mr. Hamilton and Governor Kean said:         As we did in the wake of 9/11, it is time to set aside       partisan politics and come together as Americans in common       pursuit of truth and justice.    As I said earlier, Mr. Speaker, the Capitol of the United States has  always been a glorious beacon of democracy for the American people and  for the world.   This legislation is about something larger even than the commission,  vital as the commission is. This legislation is about our democracy,  about ensuring that the Capitol dome remains a symbol of freedom and  about preserving America's role as an emblem of resilience,  determination, and hope to the world.   Indeed, creating this commission sends a resounding message to  terrorists both at home and abroad: The commitment of the United States  Congress to the Constitution and to the American people is unshakeable.   In establishing the truth of January 6, this commission will protect  our temple of democracy and our democracy itself. It will ensure that  such an attack shall never happen again.   Can we just not wait, Mr. Speaker, for a time very soon when children  come here to learn, where the press can cover in a more open way, and  where the American people can come into the people's House?   That is what this Chamber has been called, the people's House. They  come to witness the debate that affects their lives. And whatever our  disagreement about policy, they are assured that we are unified in our  commitment in honoring our Constitution and respecting the institution  in which we serve.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong bipartisan vote for H.R. 3233 to  establish the national commission to investigate the January 6 attack  on the United States Capitol complex. I do so with the greatest  appreciation and respect to Chairman Bennie Thompson and to Ranking  Member Katko, and I hope, again, that the spirit of bipartisanship that  they engendered in bringing this legislation to the floor will only  grow as we go forward with the commission and with its recommendations.
