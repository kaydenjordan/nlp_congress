 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   It is not often that the NDAA includes various provisions on advanced  nuclear, however, these times are changing.   The U.S. military is interested in advanced nuclear reactors to  provide clean, baseload power for energy operations, hence why I  offered an amendment that expresses support for Project Pele, a DOD  program to develop and deploy a portable nuclear microreactor, which  will ultimately bolster American national security.   Additionally, one of my amendments calls for the development of a  strategy to deploy microreactors for natural disaster response.  Representing Florida's 19th District, which was hit by Hurricane Ian,  we do know the devastation that can occur when you need to access power  quickly. These microreactors can help areas do that.   Moreover, one of my amendments addresses the potential for the U.S.  Space Force to utilize nuclear-powered space vehicles, and another  evaluates American national security risks associated with Chinese and  Russian interest in space.   Congress must recognize the importance of the U.S. military's  interest in this innovative technology, and I urge my colleagues to  support these six amendments.
