 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank all members of the  conference committee for their record-breaking work on this National  Defense Authorization Act. This bill supports the national security, so  I am pleased to support it.   I would particularly like to thank my good friend, Chairman Rogers,  for his bipartisan leadership of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee.   In addition to authorizing core missions of our nuclear forces to  provide a strong deterrent, this defense authorization bill mandates an  independent study on increasing the decision time before the President  can use nuclear weapons; allows negotiations for extending the New  START treaty to maintain binding limits on the number of strategic  weapons that Russia can deploy; drops a provision that would have all  but separated the Nuclear Security Administration from the Department  of Energy, in direct contradiction of expert recommendations; and  allows the Department of Energy to continue terminating the failed and  unaffordable MOX boondoggle.    The bill supports effective missile defense efforts, including  pressing for near-term solutions such as boost-phase missile defense  using kinetic interceptors, increases accountability of the acquisition  of expensive interceptors, and, of course, supports U.S.-Israeli  missile defense.   Finally, I strongly commend Chairman Rogers' leadership in  strengthening our ability to defend our assets in space against  increasing threats.   The bill creates a sub-unified command for space and continues  oversight of warfighting readiness, presses for a more rapid and agile  acquisition process, and mandates a plan for improving our space  capabilities.   I look forward to continuing to work with Chairman Rogers and others  toward establishment of a true space corps or space force. I urge  support for this bill.
