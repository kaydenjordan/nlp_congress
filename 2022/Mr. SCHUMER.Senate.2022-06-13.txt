 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday, Democratic and Republican  negotiators announced an agreement on a framework for bipartisan gun  safety legislation, bringing the Senate one step closer to finally-- finally--responding to the plague of gun violence that afflicts our  Nation and terrorizes our children.   For the first time in a long time, the Senate has a path forward on  legislation that will save lives, reduce gun violence, and keep our  communities safe.   Make no mistake about it, we have a lot of work left to do before we  actually pass a bill, but yesterday's announcement was a positive and  necessary step in the right direction.   Now comes the important work of turning this framework into  legislation and legislative language that can pass Congress and be  signed by the President. We must continue working with the urgency that  this moment demands because, if we can save even one life from gun  violence, it will well be worth it.   Once the text of this agreement is finalized, and I hope it will be  as soon as possible, I will put this bill on the floor, quickly, so the  Senate can move quickly to make gun safety reform a reality.   As I said, I will put this bill on the floor as soon as possible once  the text of the final agreement is finalized so the Senate can act  quickly to make gun safety reform a reality. So I urge my colleagues to  continue working with the same good faith and urgency that has brought  us to this point.   Certainly, yesterday's agreement does not have everything Democrats  wanted, but it nevertheless represents the most significant reform to  gun safety laws that we have seen in decades. If enacted, this  legislation will make it harder for mass shooters to access assault  rifles by enhancing background checks for those under 21. It will  prevent tragedies before they happen by helping States with their red  flag laws. It will prevent gun violence at home by closing the so- called boyfriend loophole and establish new penalties for gun  traffickers. It will make our neighborhoods safer by investing in  mental health and community violence intervention programs. The lion's  share of gun violence happens outside the national spotlight, and these  intervention programs are some of the most effective ways to reduce  crime and make our communities safer.  [[Page S2900]]    Altogether, this framework is a good and necessary first step towards  changing the reality of gun violence in America. It will lay the  foundation for future action. Most importantly, this legislation will  go a long way toward saving lives.   I want to thank Senators Murphy, Sinema, Cornyn, and Tillis for  working assiduously on this framework.   Senator Murphy asked me for space to let the negotiators do their  work, and I was glad to give it to them because we knew that any chance  of getting something real done on gun safety was worth the effort.   I also want to thank my colleagues who were part of the bipartisan  guns working group, including Senators Blumenthal, Manchin, Coons,  Heinrich, and others.   I want to thank all the advocates, families, and volunteers who lost  loved ones, who shared their stories, who marched to make a change.  Without the advocates, the families, and the volunteers who lost loved  ones, this bill wouldn't have happened because year after year after  shooting after shooting, they didn't give up. They persisted, and it  helped bring us to this important moment.   For decades, families across the country have seen the same dismal  pattern play out whenever a mass shooting strikes the Nation--tragedy  followed by inaction. From Columbine to Virginia Tech, to Sandy Hook,  to Las Vegas, to Parkland, to Buffalo, to Uvalde, and to so many  others, gridlock has prevented Congress from bringing solace to  families in grief.   But no matter how many shootings have traumatized this Nation, these  families have never given up in their hope of making change happen.  Rather than curse the darkness, these families have responded to  tragedy by lighting candles. They have shared their stories, they have  marched for change, and they have done everything in their power to  make sure no other parent, spouse, or sibling has to suffer the pain  they have felt and live with every day.   The same is true for all the advocates, and there are so many groups  who have worked on gun safety. Many members of these groups are  survivors of gun violence. I have a person on my staff who is a  survivor of Aurora. They all worked tirelessly for years to enact  commonsense gun safety laws.   Despite decades of frustrating gridlock, I hope that yesterday's  announcement brings some sense of accomplishment to these grieving  families and to all of those who have marched and protested and written  letters and tweeted because it is thanks to them we are at the  threshold of progress.   Nearly 30 years ago, I was the author of the Brady background checks  bill, and that was the last time Congress took meaningful action to  address gun violence. It was a different era back then, but the lesson  of that experience remains relevant today: The right law can decrease  gun deaths. I believe that there are tens of thousands of people alive  today because the Brady law was passed in 1994. They don't know who  they are, we don't know who they are, but it is virtually certain that  that law saved thousands and thousands of lives.    I urge my colleagues to think of all the lives we can now save by  turning this framework into law. Americans have waited long enough for  us to take action. Too many lives--too many--have been already lost.  Too many families--too many--have been left grieving.   While we can't undo the tragedies of the past, we can act now to make  them less likely in the future. If this framework is enacted into law,  it will do precisely that, and I urge all of us to continue working to  pass gun safety legislation soon.                        Honoring our PACT Act of 2021    Madam President, now on the PACT Act, as negotiations continue off  the floor on gun safety reform, today, the Senate will move forward  with the most significant expansion of veteran healthcare benefits in  decades--in decades. In a few hours, the Senate will vote on cloture on  the substitute amendment for the PACT Act, which Chairman Tester and  Ranking Member Moran have been working on for months. It is my hope  that we can finally pass this legislation in the next few days, well  before the week is out.   The changes outlined by the PACT Act are long overdue. It would make  sure any veteran suffering from toxic exposure in the line of duty  could get the VA benefits they deserve. It would end the indignity that  too many veterans face right now of carrying the burden of toxic  exposure on their own and being forced to jump through hoop after hoop  after hoop by the VA before they can get any benefits, and many of them  never get them. As many as 3\1/2\ million veterans could benefit from  the reforms brought about by this bill.   I urge my colleagues to keep working so we can push this bill over  the finish line A-S-A-P because both sides want it, our veterans  deserve it, and the veterans service organizations--the VSOs--have been  telling Congress for years that change is needed at the VA. So before  the week is out, the Senate should do its job and pass this bill.                               Shipping Reform    Madam President, now on the shipping bill, a few months ago, the  Senate unanimously passed legislation to fight inflation by fixing  unfair shipping practices that are clogging our ports and straining our  supply chains. Tonight, the House will finally act on that bill and  send it to the President's desk.   Inflation is the greatest frustration America has right now, and  backlogs at our ports are one of the biggest drivers of price hikes  that we will address through this bill.   By now, we have all seen pictures of scores of ships lining up in  ports from Las Vegas to Savannah, to Seattle, to New York and New  Jersey. These backlogs have not only caused great harm for American  exporters trying to send their products out into the world, they have  also skyrocketed the price of goods coming into this country. The  backlogs create a brutal double whammy that ultimately leaves American  families paying the price.   I applaud Speaker Pelosi and all of my House colleagues for taking  action on this shipping reform bill, and I want to thank my colleagues  here in the Senate--Senators Klobuchar and Thune, the authors of the  legislation; Chairwoman Cantwell, who shepherded it through; and others  for their leadership when this bill was before the Senate.   By reforming unfair shipping practices, Congress is taking a much  needed step to lowering costs, clearing our ports, and relieving supply  chains. I thank all of my colleagues for a job well done.                            ____________________     Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 969.
