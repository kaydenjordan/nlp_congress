 Mr. Speaker, I stand here today saddened, but, quite  frankly, not shocked, at the irresponsibility of my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle. I guess their giveaway to the ultrawealthy  wasn't enough last time around, so they have come back for round two: a  fake tax reform 2.0.   When the bill for this new gimmick eventually comes due, I am  terrified Republicans will pay for it by gutting Social Security and  Medicare, two earned benefit programs on which my constituents rely.   I have heard a lot of rhetoric about how today's bill will help the  middle class, but the only thing that today's legislation guarantees is  adding at least $3 trillion more to the deficit over just a period of  10 years.   And who picks up the tab? Middle-class Americans, that is who. They  are working families who are being priced out of home ownership, saving  for retirement, or trying to put their kids through school.   I urge my colleagues to vote down this terrible bill and let common  sense reign.
