 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a very heavy heart.   As a parent, my 11-year-old son is with me today on the House floor  because it is spring break. I cannot imagine the pain and suffering  that those parents in Nashville are experiencing.   As a Member of Congress, I can say that this is something that we can  stop. It is complicated. We have a mental health crisis, and that is  going to take a lot of time, a lot of money, and a lot of energy, but  the guns, that is one vote to ban assault weapons, to tell the Defense  Department, hey, buy all these assault weapons, these 20 million  assault weapons. Give them to the military where they belong, and pass  criminal background checks for all the other guns.   That is it. One vote. We are Congress. We can do it with a single  vote. We just need more of us.                            ____________________
