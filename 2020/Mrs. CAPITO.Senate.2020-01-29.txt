 Mr. Chief Justice.  [[Page S662]]    The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from West Virginia.    Thank you. I send a question to the desk for the  President's counsel.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Capito's question is for counsel for the  President:         You said that Ukrainian officials didn't know about the       pause on aid until August 28, 2019, when it was reported       in POLITICO. But didn't Laura Cooper, the deputy assistant       secretary of defense for Russia, say that members of her       staff received queries about the aid from the Ukrainian       Embassy on July 25? Does that mean that Ukrainian       officials knew about the hold on aid earlier than the       POLITICO article?    Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate,  Senator, thank you for your question.   It does not mean that. As we explained on Saturday, the overwhelming  body of evidence indicates that the Ukrainians, at the very highest  levels--President Zelensky and his top advisers--only became aware of  the pause in the security assistance through the August 28 POLITICO  article.   I addressed this on Saturday--and so those comments will stand--the  emails that Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Laura Cooper  testified about previously. What she had said was that she--her staff-- had gotten emails from someone at the State Department who had had some  sort of conversation with Ukrainian officials here that somehow related  to the aid at a time prior to August 28. She did not know the substance  of the emails or whether they mention ``hold,'' ``pause,'' ``review,''  or anything of that nature. And she even said herself that she didn't  want to speculate as to what the emails meant and cannot say for  certain what they were about.   I presented on Saturday the evidence, which, again, is referencing  the common sense that would be in play here. This was something that on  August 28 caused a flurry of activity among the highest ranking  Ukrainian officials. Never before did they raise any questions at any  of the meetings they had with the high-ranking U.S. officials through  July and August. There were meetings on July 9, July 10, July 25 call,  July 26, and August 27. At none of those meetings was the pause on aid  revealed or inquired about. However, as soon as the POLITICO article  came out on August 28, within hours of that POLITICO article coming  out, Mr. Yermak texted the article to Ambassador Volker and asked to  speak with him. That is consistent with someone finding out about it  for the first time. The Ukrainians have also made statements that they  learned about it for the first time.   And then Mr. Philbin just referenced an article that came out  yesterday in the Daily Beast, which is an interview with Mr. Danyliuk,  who was, at the time, a high-ranking defense official with the  Ukrainians. This is interesting, and I am going to read this article  because I think it is important, and I suggest it to the Senate if they  wish to have something to consider further on this.         Danyliuk said he first found out that the U.S. was       withholding aid to Ukraine by reading POLITICO's article       published Aug. 28. U.S. officials and Ukrainian diplomats,       including the country's former Foreign Minister Olena Zerkal,       have said publicly that Kyiv was aware that there were       problems with the U.S. aid as early as July.    That is the article that they have mentioned in the statement that  the House managers have mentioned.   Here is Mr. Danyliuk:         ``I was really surprised and shocked. Because just a couple       of days prior to that . . . I actually had a meeting with       John Bolton. Actually, I had several meetings with him. And       we had extensive discussions. The last thing I expected to       read was an article about military aid being frozen,''       Danyliuk said. ``After that . . . I was trying to get the       truth. Was it true or not true?''        Danyliuk said that ``it was a panic'' inside the Zelensky       administration after the initial news broke, saying Zelensky       was convinced there had been some sort of mistake.    That is President Zelensky.         Danyliuk put in calls to the National Security Council and       asked other officials in Washington what to make of the news.    Again, this is on August 28, or right after August 28.         ``The next time we met in September . . . it was in Poland       for the commemoration of the beginning of the Second World       War''--    The Warsaw meeting we discussed previously--         Danyliuk said, adding that he met with Bolton on the       sidelines of the commemoration. ``I had my suspicions. There       was a special situation with one of our defense companies       that were acquired by the Chinese. And the U.S. was concerned       about this. Bolton actually made the public comments about       this as well. So somehow I linked this to things and tried to       understand. OK, maybe this could be related to this.''    So not only did they not know until August 28--when they did find  out--but they didn't link it to any investigation. Where is the quid  pro quo? If it is such at the forefront of their minds, such pressure  on them that the Ukrainians have to do these investigations to get the  aid, when the aid was held up, they didn't think it was connected to  the investigations.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Maryland.
