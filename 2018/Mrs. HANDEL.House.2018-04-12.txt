 Mr. Speaker, let me first begin by commending Chairman  Goodlatte and my colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee for their  hard work on this important issue.   I have been in Congress just 10 months, but I have already seen  firsthand that the budget process is fundamentally broken.   While I supported the funding measures under this broken process, I  did so with reluctance. But both parties--both parties--have brought us  to this place with the severe fiscal challenges that we face today. But  balancing our budget is not, should not be, a partisan issue.   Across the country, virtually every State has a balanced budget  requirement, and Governors and legislatures of both parties meet that  requirement. Congress should too.   Ultimately, balanced budgets are about accountability. We must hold  the Federal Government and Congress accountable and insist that the  overall budget be managed in a fiscally responsible way. The status  quo, the same old kick-the-can-down-the-road, we-will-get-to-it-next- time approach is simply no longer an option.   Big problems require tough choices. Every day that we continue to  borrow and assume more debt, our decisions get all the more difficult,  and the solutions all the more catastrophic.   This balanced budget amendment is only a first step, but a much- needed step, to improving the fiscal state of our Nation.   Our current path is unsustainable. Sooner than most realize, this  path will not even allow us to continue to meet the promises already  made to the American people.   ``Don't spend more than you earn.'' That is what I was taught. And  that is what families across this country do every single day.   It is time for Congress to do the same, Mr. Speaker. I ask my  colleagues to support this balanced budget amendment, not for the sake  of politics, but rather for the sake of the future of this country and  generations to come.
