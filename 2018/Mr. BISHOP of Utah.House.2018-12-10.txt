 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 5513) to provide for an exchange of lands with San  Bernardino County, California, to enhance management of lands within  the San Bernardino National Forest, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

The map and       legal descriptions shall be on file and available for public       inspection in appropriate offices of the Forest Service.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from California (Mr. Cook), the sponsor of this piece  of legislation, to explain why we should actually deal with this  particular piece.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is a perfect example of how to do something well. I  commend Congressman Cook for listening to his local constituents,  trying to get their input, and getting a bill that has total local  support. It is the way things should be done, solving a problem for  both the Forest Service, as well as San Bernardino County.   Not only will the Forest Service get a small parcel of land which  solves the problem of in-holdings within their property, but San  Bernardino County gets the ability of solving significant problems they  have in the area of public safety. This is one of those things that is  a win-win situation: a win-win situation which actually provides  safety, as well as the changing of that trail, if absolutely necessary,  but that has to be worked out before any of this is concluded.   The bottom line here is that we have realized there is a significant  problem, we have recognized this is a significant problem, and, by  working with local communities to get their input trying to come up  with a locally-driven solution to that problem, this is the way  government should operate. Unfortunately, it doesn't operate that way  all the time, but Congressman Cook has worked very hard to make sure  that this is one of those positive efforts. This bill is one of those  things that is a win for all of us.   Mr. Speaker, I heartily ask my colleagues to vote in favor of this,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 6108) to provide for partnerships among State and local  governments, regional entities, and the private sector to preserve,  conserve, and enhance the visitor experience at nationally significant  battlefields of the American Revolution, War of 1812, and Civil War,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6108         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Preserving America's       Battlefields Act''.       SEC. 2. CIVIL WAR BATTLEFIELD PRESERVATION ACT OF 2002.         Section 2 of the Civil War Battlefield Preservation Act of       2002 (Public Law 107-359) is amended to read as follows:       ``SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.         ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        ``(1) Battlefields of the American Revolution, War of 1812       and the Civil War--        ``(A) provide a means for the people of the United States       to understand our Nation's turbulent first century;        ``(B) serve as living memorials to those who fought and       sacrificed in these conflicts to establish and maintain our       freedom and liberty;        ``(C) serve as training grounds for our Nation's Armed       Forces; and        ``(D) serve as heritage tourism destinations, generating       revenue for local economies.        ``(2) According to the Report on the Nation's Civil War       Battlefields, prepared by the National Park Service and       updated in 2010, of the 383 Civil War battlefields identified       as national preservation priorities--        ``(A) only at 31 battlefields is more than half of the       surviving landscape permanently protected;        ``(B) at 227 battlefields, less than half of the surviving       landscape is permanently protected;        ``(C) 65 battlefields have no protection at all; and        ``(D) 113 battlefields have been severely hampered by       development since the Civil War or are on the verge of being       overwhelmed.        ``(3) According to the 2007 Report to Congress on the       Historic Preservation of Revolutionary War and War of 1812       Sites in the United States, prepared by the National Park       Service, of the 243 principal Revolutionary War and War of       1812 battlefields identified as national preservation       priorities--        ``(A) almost 70 percent lie within urban areas as denoted       in the 2000 U.S. Census;        ``(B) 141 are lost or extremely fragmented, with       residential and commercial development being the chief       threats;        ``(C) 100 other battlefields retain significant features       and lands from the period of battle, although on average       these battlefields retain only 37 percent of the original       historic scene;        ``(D) of these 100 surviving but diminished battle       landscapes, 82 are partially owned and protected by public       and nonprofit stewards, although the extent of that       protection varies from site to site;        ``(E) 18 are without any legal protection;        ``(F) the condition of two battlefields is unknown, with       additional research and survey being required to determine       their exact location and condition; and        ``(G) the paucity of existing battlefield landscapes       necessitates preservation and maintenance of what precious       little remains today.        ``(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--        ``(1) to act quickly and proactively to preserve and       protect nationally significant battlefields of the American       Revolution, War of 1812, and Civil War through conservation       easements and fee-simple purchases of those battlefields from       willing sellers; and        ``(2) to create partnerships among State and local       governments, regional entities, and the private sector to       preserve, conserve, and enhance the visitor experience at       nationally significant battlefields of the American       Revolution, War of 1812, and Civil War.''.       SEC. 3. PRESERVATION ASSISTANCE.         Section 308103(f) of title 54, United States Code, is       amended to read as follows:        ``(f) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized       to be appropriated to the Secretary to provide grants under       this section $15,000,000 for each fiscal year through 2025,       of which not more than 10 percent may be used each fiscal       year as follows:        ``(1) Not more than $1,000,000 for projects and programs       that modernize battlefield interpretive and educational       assets through the deployment of technology, disbursed       through the competitive grant process to non-profit       organizations.        ``(2) Not more than $1,000,000 for grants to organizations       described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code       of 1986 and exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of such       Code to be used for projects that restore day-of-battle       conditions on land preserved through Battlefield Land       Acquisition Grant Program funds.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice), the sponsor of this  excellent piece of legislation that protects our heritage and our  battlefields.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is one of those bills that makes an old history  teacher's heart fill with joy. It is one of the right things to do. We  are talking about areas that are living memorials to the heroism and to  the sacrifice of those people who made this country what it is.   This bill is about preserving our history, helping us know,  understand, and retain the story of who we are as a nation, and also  how we arrived there as a nation. All of that is significant.   It is significant in that it will reauthorize the program through  2025, it is significant because it also will reauthorize an  authorization level, which is, in practicality, what we have available  to spend on this particular program, but, more importantly, it also  involves the private sector becoming involved in this. Indeed, if our  history is to be maintained, it is not going to be done simply by the  government mandating it. We have to involve the private sector to  become part of understanding why these areas are significant and what  is the lesson to be learned there.   Not only will his bill talk about acquisition of land for these  battlefield areas, but also about how we restore this land to the way  it was at the time that history was being made on these properties,  and, more importantly, how do we improve the education resources. So  the story of what we are as a Nation, the story of what this specific  site meant as we become a unified Nation as we move forward, that is  retained and passed on from generation to generation. That is a  significant issue and is a significant process.                                time  1545    Mr. Speaker, I commend the gentleman from Georgia for his commitment  to understanding how important battlefields are to the history of this  country and how important it is that that history is passed on to  future generations. That is why this is a significant program that  needs to go forward.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of  this particular legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 3008) to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to  conduct a special resource study of the George W. Bush Childhood Home,  located at 1412 West Ohio Avenue, Midland, Texas, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 3008         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``George W. Bush Childhood       Home Study Act''.       SEC. 2. SPECIAL RESOURCE STUDY.         (a) Study.--The Secretary of the Interior shall conduct a       special resource study of the George W. Bush Childhood Home,       located at 1412 West Ohio Avenue, Midland, Texas (referred to       in this section as the ``site'').        (b) Contents.--In conducting the study under subsection       (a), the Secretary shall--        (1) evaluate the national significance of the site;        (2) determine the suitability and feasibility of       designating the site as a unit of the National Park System;        (3) consider other alternatives for preservation,       protection, and interpretation of the site by Federal, State,       or local governmental entities, or private and nonprofit       organizations;        (4) consult with interested Federal, State, or local       governmental entities, private and nonprofit organizations or       any other interested individuals;        (5) determine the effect of the designation of the site as       a unit of the National Park System on existing commercial and       recreational uses, and the effect on State and local       governments to manage those activities;        (6) identify any authorities, including condemnation, that       will compel or permit the Secretary to influence or       participate in local land use decisions (such as zoning) or       place restrictions on non-Federal land if the site is       designated a unit of the National Park System; and        (7) identify cost estimates for any Federal acquisition,       development, interpretation, operation, and maintenance       associated with the alternatives.        (c) Applicable Law.--The study required under subsection       (a) shall be conducted in accordance with section 100507 of       title 54, United States Code.        (d) Study Results.--Not later than 3 years after the date       on which funds are first made available for the study under       subsection (a), the Secretary shall submit to the Committee       on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate the       results of the study and any conclusions and recommendations       of the Secretary.   [[Page H9777]]      Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway), the sponsor of this bill, to  explain the significance of this study.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, once again, we have a situation here where there is  already a museum that is run by a nonprofit entity in this area. What  is being asked here is for a study to be done by the National Park  Service to find the significance of including this as part of the  National Park Service's portfolio of properties.   It is fitting that we try to do this, for, indeed, in American  history, there have been only two times when there has been both a  father and a son who have served as President of the United States,  once with the Adams and now with the Bushes.   So having a home where they, as well as the future Governor of  Florida, actually resided is one of those things that clearly is a  unique sense of history. It is a unique property that provides that  sense of history. So for a study to be done on whether it should be  added to the National Park Service repertoire of sites is a proper  thing to do.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Congressman Conaway's efforts to recognize and  honor two of our country's Presidents, and I urge my colleagues, once  again, to adopt this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 6118) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to  annually designate at least one city in the United States as an  ``American World War II Heritage City'', and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6118         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. AMERICAN WORLD WAR II HERITAGE CITIES.         (a) Designation.--In order to recognize and ensure the       continued preservation and importance of the history of the       United States involvement in World War II, each calendar year       the Secretary of the Interior (referred to in this section as       the ``Secretary'') may designate not less than one city       located in one of the several States or a territory of the       United States as an ``American World War II Heritage City''.       Not more than one city in each State or territory may be       designated under this section.        (b) Application for Designation.--The Secretary shall--        (1) establish and publicize the process by which a city may       apply for designation as an American World War II Heritage       City based on the criteria in subsection (c); and        (2) encourage cities to apply for designation as an       American World War II Heritage City.        (c) Criteria for Designation.--The Secretary, in       consultation with the Secretary of the Smithsonian       Institution or the President of the National Trust for       Historic Preservation, shall make each designation under       subsection (a) based on the following criteria:        (1) Contributions by a city and its environs to the World       War II home-front war effort, including contributions related       to--        (A) defense manufacturing, such as ships, aircraft,       uniforms, and equipment;        (B) production of foodstuffs and consumer items for Armed       Forces and home consumption;        (C) war bond drives;        (D) adaptations to wartime survival;        (E) volunteer participation;        (F) civil defense preparedness;        (G) personnel serving in the Armed Forces, their       achievements, and facilities for their rest and recreation;       or        (H) the presence of Armed Forces camps, bases, airfields,       harbors, repair facilities, and other installations within or       in its environs.        (2) Achievements by a city and its environs to preserve the       heritage and legacy of the city's contributions to the war       effort and to preserve World War II history, including--        (A) the identification, preservation, restoration, and       interpretation of World War II-related structures, facilities       and sites;        (B) establishment of museums, parks, and markers;        (C) establishment of memorials to area men who lost their       lives in service;  [[Page H9778]]         (D) organizing groups of veterans and home-front workers       and their recognition;        (E) presentation of cultural events such as dances, plays,       and lectures;        (F) public relations outreach through the print and       electronic media, and books; and        (G) recognition and ceremonies remembering wartime event       anniversaries.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer), the sponsor of this  piece of legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, during World War II, our cities built armaments; they  had war bond drives; and they grew victory gardens. They did what they  could to support our troops who were fighting abroad in a two-front  war.   It is significant and important that we recognize the efforts that  went into that part of our history and also that we reward, in some  way, the efforts to protect that history so that we will always  remember the sacrifices that were made by the Greatest Generation and  recognize their efforts on the field of battle, as well as back home,  to preserve that and support that.   The past will not be forgotten. This part of our American history  will be remembered going forward.   Mr. Speaker, this is a wonderful effort to do that, to actually  provide, once again, for the history of this country, for the symbols  of this country, for the future of this country, to remember how we got  to the position in which we are.   This bill authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to designate at  least one city a year, each year, as an American World War II Heritage  City. It is appropriate that we go forward on this.   Mr. Speaker, I fully support its efforts, and I urge the adoption of  this bill by my colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 6665) to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to  apply to territories of the United States, to establish offshore wind  lease sale requirements, to provide dedicated funding for coral reef  conservation, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6665         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 5. ESTABLISHMENT OF CORAL REEF CONSERVATION FUND.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to read this part.   From the whooshing in the western Pacific to the windswept waters of  the Atlantic, a wonderful wealth of offshore wind exists. While this  wonderful resource weapon withstood the tests of time in Europe, we  have waffled in our worldview on wind power.   But worry not. With this worthy bill, we will warrant our Nation's  territories--from Guam to Puerto Rico--will no longer be wasting their  overwater reward and will be powered with the waterproof windmills.   Now I have to stop because I did that for the staffer who wrote it.  Obviously, I don't do this kind of stuff, and I lost the bet.   However, despite the alliteration that went there, this is still a  good bill which will move us forward in energy production, especially  in our territories of the United States.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I obviously urge my colleagues to support it  and move us forward, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman could at least put  some kind of rhyme in there.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico  (Miss Gonzalez-Colon) to speak on this particular bill.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the  honorable Delegate from Guam (Ms. Bordallo) for taking this initiative  to present H.R. 6665, and Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva  for having moved this legislation to continue to extend equal treatment  to the American community of citizens in the territories.   It has been a privilege to join in on bipartisan proposals for  applying, uniformly, the Federal laws for the benefit of the people of  our territories. Equal treatment for all American communities is a goal  that should be shared by all in this Congress, and we will continue to  seek it.   America's continued prosperity requires a modernized energy system  that makes the best use of all the domestic resources available,  including expanding use of wind in our domestic waters.   Puerto Rico has directly experienced the need to have better energy  infrastructure in place. Today, only 2 percent of our energy in Puerto  Rico comes just from renewable sources. Our plans for long-term  recovery of our electric grid include a much higher reliance on  renewable energy to reduce environmental impact and increase  efficiency.   Since, today, many of the territories rely on expensive diesel- or  fuel oil-generation systems, an integration of greater diversity of  generating sources will provide them greater flexibility in their  development plans.   At the same time, however, this upgrade on our generation's sources  should be conducted in each jurisdiction based on its technical,  economic, and environmental viability and rely more on private  investment participation instead of taxpayer funding.   This legislation will direct the Department of the Interior to study  what is the viability of Continental Shelf wind resources off the shore  of the territories. If the result is positive, then the Department of  the Interior will initiate the process of auctioning the leasing rights  for such projects on the same basis as for the waters outside the  States. If such development proceeds, 2.5 percent of the revenues  collected will be reserved for coral reef protection and 37.5 percent  for the respective territory for environmental remediation uses.    This way is the better way to develop energy resources and provide,  also, funding for the territories to take their own measures for  securing better environmental conditions. I expect the House will  support this effort to bring uniform treatment to all jurisdictions  under the American flag in an important area of policy, which is  energy, and open up investment and development opportunities to all of  us.   Once again, I want to thank my colleague from Guam (Ms. Bordallo) and  the chairman of the committee for having this bill, and, of course, for  their support and legacy on behalf of equal treatment for Puerto Rico  and the territories.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Will the gentleman yield?    Yes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate those who have spoken on this particular  piece of legislation.   Mr. Graves, I didn't want to be too flippant, although I was, does  raise a major point of concern that, on Federal lands and on Federal  waters, how we deal with the resources that are there is significant,  and they play a role in the entire Nation.   But we also have to recognize the role that those States and  territories play where we find those particular resources, whether it  be offshore on Federal waters or onshore on Federal lands. For us to  review that policy is a wise thing we should do.   I also am appreciative of the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico  for explaining the significance this has for all those areas that have  not yet been considered as we deal with a new kind of alternative  energy, in this case, wind power. That is significant, and it plays a  significant role in the future development of those territories that  are using and in which the energy and the cost of energy is more  significant than you find on the mainland, and yet we need to find a  way to build their economies by having an affordable and renewable and  reliable energy source coming in the future.   Because of that, I find this to be a significant piece of  legislation. I urge adoption, Mr. Speaker, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 792) urging the Secretary of the  Interior to recognize the historical significance of Roberto Clemente's  place of death near Pinones in Loiza, Puerto Rico, by adding it to the  National Register of Historic Places, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 792         Whereas Roberto Clemente was an American baseball legend       who embodied the values of a model citizen;        Whereas Roberto Clemente won two Major League Baseball       World Series Championships, was named World Series Most       Valuable Player, and was an All-Star for 12 seasons;        Whereas Roberto Clemente served this Nation as a United       States Marine Corps Reservist;        Whereas Roberto Clemente was the first Puerto Rican       inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame;        Whereas Roberto Clemente was inducted into the Marine Corps       Sports Hall of Fame;        Whereas Roberto Clemente was committed to caring and       helping those in need, regardless of their location;        Whereas Roberto Clemente selflessly chose to travel to an       earthquake-ridden Nicaragua to provide humanitarian aid;        Whereas Roberto Clemente's plane crashed shortly after       taking off from Isla Verde International Airport/Aeropuerto       Internacional de Isla Verde on December 31, 1972;        Whereas Roberto Clemente was only 38 years old when he       tragically passed away;        Whereas Roberto Clemente's passion and advocacy       demonstrated the positive influence that professional       athletes could have in improving the lives of others;        Whereas Roberto Clemente challenged the stereotypes that       had marginalized native Spanish speakers in this Nation and       remains an icon to many Puerto Ricans and Latinos in the       United States and Latin America;        Whereas Major League Baseball presents an annual Roberto       Clemente Award to the player that best embodies Roberto       Clemente's value of service to others and represents the game       of baseball through extraordinary character, community       involvement, philanthropy, and positive contributions, both       on and off the field;        Whereas Roberto Clemente was posthumously awarded the       Presidential Medal of Freedom, Presidential Citizens Medal,       and the Congressional Gold Medal for his civic and charitable       contributions; and        Whereas the crash site in the adjacent area to Playa       Aviones in the municipality of Loiza, Puerto Rico, was the       last place where Roberto Clemente graced this world: Now,       therefore be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives requests that       the Secretary of the Interior recognize the crash site of       Roberto Clemente's airplane and the adjacent land by adding       such site to the National Register of Historic Places.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this has been, for me, an exciting day, as we have  talked about bills that provide for the history of this country and  move it forward; as we talked about energy, which I find significant,  especially for my State, which has so much Federal land and energy  available to it; and now you are coming into one of the heroes of my  childhood with Roberto Clemente.   Mr. Clemente won 12 Gold Gloves; 4 National League batting titles; 12  All-Star Game selections; 2 World Series Championships--although the  1961 still pains me to no end, but he still had two championships--and  reached the 3,000-hit milestone. He was the first player born in Latin  America to be inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and was  posthumously awarded both the Congressional Gold Medal and the  Presidential Medal of Freedom.   I still have his baseball cards, and I cherish them. He was a special  person not necessarily on the field--he was unique and wonderful--but  even off the field he was an even greater individual. His  accomplishments off the field speak to the quality of man Roberto  Clemente was.   He spent his time in the off-season involved in charity work. He also  spent his time in the off-season helping the game of baseball in his  home in Puerto Rico. He made people's lives better. He ended his life,  once again, trying to head a relief effort for Nicaragua. He gave his  life in defense of other people. He is definitely someone who is worthy  of being remembered in what he did on the ball field, which was  spectacular, but what he did at home with real people, which was even  better than what he did on the ball field.   I am proud to be here and wish to add my support to this resolution  to recognize a great, great American hero.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume  to the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman  for allowing me to speak on behalf of this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I really believe this is important. Puerto Ricans feel  very proud of the legacy of Roberto Clemente. He was not just a local  hero, but a national hero, both in the arena and in his life. Actually,  that is the reason, when Puerto Rico becomes a State, it will be the  recommendation for one of his statues to be sent to the capital. He is  a figure that united Puerto Rico.   I rise today to express my strongest support for H. Res. 792,  introduced by my good friend and colleague, Jose Serrano. This  resolution will urge the Secretary of the Interior to recognize the  significance of the place of death of Puerto Rican baseball star  Roberto Clemente, located near Pinones in Loiza, Puerto Rico, by adding  it to the National Register of Historic Places.   Roberto Clemente, as I said, was a hero and role model in Puerto Rico  and across the nation. Throughout his distinguished career, he won two  Major League Baseball World Series Championships, was named Most  Valuable Player, and was an All-Star for 12 seasons. Clemente also  served this Nation as a United States Marine Corps Reservist.   Roberto Clemente was committed to caring and helping those in need.  In the aftermath of a devastating earthquake in 1972, he decided to  travel to Nicaragua to provide humanitarian aid. His plane crashed  shortly after departing Puerto Rico, and he tragically passed at the  age of 38.   That is the reason his family, still in Puerto Rico, started a  foundation. Many schools have his name on it, but he also has the  legacy of supporting young people to play baseball and commit to their  communities and be better in society. Clemente was that role model.   He was a great humanitarian and great athlete. He was the embodiment  of a baseball legend who contributed to the betterment of society. I am  glad that this House is honoring his legacy by considering H. Res. 792.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I  thank Congressman Serrano for allowing this recognition that unites  hundreds of people not only in Puerto Rico, but for sports all over. I  also thank Chairman Bishop for supporting this, although I was  expecting him to have the numbers of his baseball career.    Mr. Speaker, this is a good piece of legislation.  I just wish that when the Dodgers left him vulnerable in 1966, the  Cubbies had picked him up, instead of the Pirates.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 245) to amend the Indian Tribal Energy Development and  Self Determination Act of 2005, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 245         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young). Much of his bill is  incorporated in this. He has been a long-time champion and supporter of  this effort.   (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I want to do two motions  simultaneously here. I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers), and I ask unanimous consent that  the remainder of the time be managed by the gentleman from Alaska (Mr.  Young).    Mr. Speaker, section 202(b) of S. 245, the  ``Tribal Biomass Demonstration Project Act,'' amends the Tribal Forest  Protection Act of 2004 (TFPA) to include new authority that directs the  Secretary (of Agriculture or the Interior) to enter into a minimum  number of contracts or agreements with Indian tribes to enable the  tribes to carry out various activities on Federal land. Unlike the  current TFPA, which is discretionary, the Secretary must enter into  agreements with tribes under this new authority. These activities will  benefit the Indian tribes that enter into the agreements as well as the  surrounding communities, and they will promote healthy forests to stem  the plague of wildfires afflicting many Western communities, tribal and  non-tribal alike.   As an initial matter, Section 202(e) requires the Secretary to  consult with tribes and tribal organizations in developing the  eligibility criteria and to make the criteria public within 120 days of  enactment. It is critical that the Secretary meet this deadline to  ensure that tribes are able to submit applications for projects in the  remainder of fiscal year 2019.   As provided in the bill, in evaluating tribal projects, the Secretary  is directed to weigh several factors. Given the severe impact of  wildfires over the past decade, the importance of one of the factors,  improving the forest health of Federal land, cannot be emphasized  enough. For example, in August of 2015, two wildfires burned more than  255,000 acres of the Colville Indian Reservation in Washington State.  The fires burned nearly 20 percent of the reservation land base and  more than 800 million board feet of timber, making it the most damaging  fire event in history in terms of board feet of timber lost on any  Indian reservation. As noted in a November 8, 2015, column in the  Seattle Times by then-Colville Chairman Jim Boyd and the Gentlelady  from Washington, the Honorable Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the damage to  the Colville Reservation was amplified because major fire-suppression  resources were tied up suppressing fires on undermanaged areas of  nearby National Forest land, leaving the Colville Reservation with  little protection. The Secretary should, accordingly, give strong  weight to tribal proposals that will improve the forest health on  Federal land and protect tribal lands.   Finally, Section 202(b) requires the Secretary to incorporate, at a  tribe's request and to the maximum extent practicable, the tribe's on- reservation management plans in the contracts or agreements under which  the tribe will perform the activities on Federal land. The requirement  that on-reservation management plans be incorporated into tribal  activities on Federal land is an extension of what Congress has already  required. For example, since its enactment in 1976, Section 202(b) of  the Federal Land Policy and Management Act has required the U.S. Forest  Service to coordinate the lands use plans for National Forest System  lands with tribal management practices.   As highlighted over the years in numerous Committee on Natural  Resources hearings, tribal land management practices are widely  acknowledged as more flexible and as having forest health outcomes  superior to those in effect on non-tribal Federal land. The Committee  on Natural Resources examined this at an April 10, 2014, oversight  hearing on tribal forest management. Compared to federal land managers,  tribes find increased forest management efficiencies in the tiered  environmental compliance afforded by tribal Integrated Resource  Management Plans and the limitation on third party appeals in Bureau of  Indian Affairs forestry regulations (which are incorporated into tribal  forest management plans). These and other on-reservation management  practices could and should be included in agreements under Section 202  at a tribes' request.   On a final note, nothing in the TFPA or the amendments made to the  TFPA under Sec. 202 of S. 245 provide, or imply a provision, for tribal  management of non-tribal interests in Federal land (and non-tribal  users of such land) beyond the specific forest management-related  functions set forth in the Act.
