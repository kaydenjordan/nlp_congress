 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1,  particularly division C, which was introduced in the House as H.R.  1152, and was marked up by the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure with strong opposition from my Democratic colleagues.  The polluters over the people act let polluters off the hook for  harmful actions and damaging impacts to our rivers, lakes, and our  streams that our local communities rely on for clean, safe drinking  water.    Division C is an attack on section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which  is a key mechanism for States and Tribes to evaluate projects that  cross within their borders and have an impact on their waters and  environment for decades.   Section 401 has been a successful example of cooperative federalism,  while preserving State authority to manage their natural resources.  Section 401 has been a well-supported, effective tool since the  beginning of the Clean Water Act, but the Trump administration found a  way to make it a scapegoat for the failure of senseless and harmfully  polluting mega-projects.   The provisions in the polluters over people act will tie the hands of  States and Tribes seeking to preserve stream flow for their water  supplies, to prevent runoff and water pollution, and to minimize  impacts to flood-preventing wetlands. It goes against the Clean Water  Act's rights of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution.   First, in California, this bill would have huge impacts. For one,  limiting analysis to only discharges would mean the State would be  unable to consider the impact of the whole project, such as increasing  impervious surfaces, or considering downstream effects. Our State is  trying to preserve every drop of water we can get. Yet, this bill would  stop my State from protecting its water supply from the adverse impacts  of projects pursued by out-of-State interests.   Second, this bill places arbitrary, and likely impossible timelines  on the States to act on permit requests. Despite how complicated or  huge the project might be, this bill will severely limit the time  allowed for a State to review its impact. My friends across the aisle  may not realize this, but this bill may lead to greater numbers of  project rejections as the State is pressured to respond without the  time to fully analyze the project.   This bill is another attempt to gut--really gut--the Clean Water Act  and allow pollution and industry to act without repercussion. We must  defend human health, our economy, and the natural environment, and  oppose the damaging bill that will harm local communities.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from the State of  California, State of Washington, and the State of New York in strong  opposition to H.R. 1152, which is the bill that became division C, H.R.  1.                                                 February 28, 2023.      Hon. Chairman Graves,      Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Graves: As the water quality certifying       agencies for California, New York, and Washington, we write       to underscore the importance of existing law in protecting       state waters from water pollution associated with federally       licensed projects. On February 24, 2023, Representatives       Rouzer and Graves introduced H.R. 1152--Water Quality       Certification and Energy Project Improvement Act of 2023, to       amend section 401 of the Clean Water Act that would, among       other things, revise section 401 to: (1) reduce the scope of       states' and tribes' 401 water quality certification authority       to apply only to the discharge to a water of the United       States, rather than the whole of the activity; (2) narrow       states' and tribes' section 401 water quality certification       authority to exclude much of what is required to comply with       water quality standards and implementation plans under       section 303 of the Clean Water Act; (3) remove the states'       and tribes' authority to ensure compliance with ``other       appropriate requirement[s] of State law''; (4) replace       references to an ``application'' for certification with a       ``request'' for certification; and (5) impose a time       requirement on states and tribes to identify information       needed before taking an action on a certification request,       (6) make other changes to the law that introduce substantial       uncertainty about the scope of section 401 for project       proponents and state and tribes. Each of these changes would       undermine states' abilities to protect water quality within       their states and erode five decades of successful,       cooperative federalism. We ask that Congress preserve the       existing state authority in the Clean Water Act to       substantively review a project's effects on water quality       before a federal permit or license is issued.  [[Page H1510]]           Background        Under section 401 of the Clean Water Act, a federal agency       may not issue a permit or license to conduct any activity       that may result in any discharge into waters of the United       States unless a section 401 water quality certification is       issued, or certification is waived. The State Water Resources       Control Board (``State Water Board'') and the nine California       Regional Water Quality Control Boards (collectively, ``Water       Boards''), [NY Signatory], [WA Signatory] are certifying       agencies pursuant to section 401 of the Clean Water Act. In       all three states, the most common federal licenses subject to       section 401 are Clean Water Act section 404 dredge or fill       permits issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and       licenses for hydropower facilities issued by the Federal       Energy Regulatory Commission.        During the five decades since Congress enacted section 401       in the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970, state water       quality agencies diligently processed thousands of section       401 requests each year with little controversy. The vast       majority of section 401 certifications were issued promptly       and most section 401 certifications were granted, with only a       handful of denials issued each year. Beginning around 2016,       prompted by a handful of high-profile section 401 denials,       some project applicants and industry lobbyists began claiming       that states were ``abusing'' their section 401 authority.       Such claims of abuse are not, and never have been, true. In       the handful of cases when project applicants have alleged       improper certification decisions or delay by state agencies,       they have been fully capable of protecting their rights under       section 401 through the traditional framework of       administrative and judicial review.      Section 401 is a cornerstone of the cooperative federalism           principles enshrined by the Clean Water Act        Cooperative federalism is a foundational component of the       Clean Water Act. As set forth in Clean Water Act section 101       (b), ``[i]t is the policy of the Congress to recognize,       preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights       of States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution'' and       ``to plan the development and use . . . of land and water       resources.'' Section 510 further specifies that except as       expressly provided, nothing in the Clean Water Act shall       preclude or deny the right of any State to adopt or enforce       any standard or limitation respecting discharges of       pollutants or any requirement respecting control or abatement       of pollution.        The section 401 certification program is an embodiment of       these cooperative federalism principles. A state       certification is the mechanism of ensuring that a federal       license or permit is not used as an excuse to violate state       or federal water quality standards. As currently written, the       language in section 401 acknowledges that states are in the       best position to understand their own laws and that       additional conditions may be necessary to ensure compliance       with state law and applicable Clean Water Act requirements.       As the federal permitting or licensing agency is often not an       agency primarily tasked with managing environmental issues,       the federal agency may in fact be reliant on the       certification authority's expertise regarding water quality.       To prevent a section 401 certification from becoming a rubber       stamp, any revision to the section 401 language must preserve       an expansive view of the cooperative federalism principles       originally envisioned by the Clean Water Act and repeatedly       affirmed by the Supreme Court. PUD No. 1 of Jefferson Cnty.       v. Washington Dep't of Ecology, 511 U.S. 700 (1994); S.D.       Warren Co. v. Maine Bd. of Env't Prot., 547 U.S. 370 (2006).      The Clean Water Act should continue to protect the whole           range of water quality effects resulting from the           proposed activity        We strongly support the existing statutory language, which       gives states and tribes the authority to regulate the       potentially water-polluting activity as a whole, rather than       being limited to a strict interpretation of effects from only       the discharge, because regulation of the activity as a whole       protects waters from the widest range of impacts. States       should be able to protect water quality regardless of whether       the pollution or other water quality impacts would be       specifically attributable to a discharge or from some other       aspect of the activity being permitted. States should be able       to use the certification process to address impacts to       groundwater, impacts to isolated surface waters, or impacts       from non-point sources, all of which are likely not directly       attributable to the discharge to a water of the United       States, because these are water quality impacts that would       not occur without issuance of the federal permit or license.        The problems with limiting certifications to the discharge       rather than the whole of the activity would be particularly       impactful on the states' ability to protect water quality       during the decades long term of Federal Energy Regulatory       Commission (``FERC'') licenses in the hydropower licensing       context. States and tribes must be able to fully address the       water quality impacts of such activities as a whole during       the 30- to 50-year term of the FERC license to reduce       water quality impacts that, depending on the       circumstances, may not be attributable to a point-source       discharge, but result from the activity's construction,       operations, and facilities. Common water quality impacts       associated with hydropower activities include changes in       turbidity, sediment, siltation, temperature, habitat loss,       alterations to stream geomorphology, dissolved oxygen,       algal productivity and algal-produced toxins, erosion,       barriers to fish passage, alterations to stream       geomorphology, and reductions in stream flow. Each of       these impacts can have profound, generational impacts on       the state's water resources.        To prevent or minimize these potential impacts, states have       imposed, or considered the need for certification conditions       to protect water quality on project activities that fall       outside the typical understanding of point-source discharges,       such as requirements for minimum instream flows and ramping       rates; temperature management; aquatic invasive species       management; plans for gravel replenishment, large woody       material placement and other habitat measures; reservoir       operation plans; erosion and sediment management plans; and       monitoring and management of dissolved oxygen, mercury,       pesticides, and other constituents of concerns. Previously       issued certifications have typically included management,       monitoring, and reporting measures to ensure compliance with       water quality measures and to identify potential       modifications if circumstances change. Revising the statutory       language to contradict longstanding interpretations would       introduce confusion and invite arguments about the nexus       between the discharge and the impact, when a state or tribe's       focus should more appropriately be on all water quality       impacts resulting from the project. Introducing the concept       of whether the activity will ``directly result'' in a       discharge in subsection (a)(1) and (a)(4) would inject       additional uncertainty and potentially further limit the       certifying authority's ability to protect water quality.        Although the states would rely on their state authority to       continue to preserve robust protection of water quality       whenever possible, state authority would not be an available       remedy where state law is preempted by federal law. Because       the Federal Power Act preempts the field of hydropower       regulation absent an express exception to preemption, and       FERC project licenses are valid for a fixed period of up to       50 years, water quality certifications for FERC license       applications provide the states with a singular opportunity       to ensure compliance with the state's water quality standards       and other requirements. If the states' ability to regulate       FERC licensed projects to the same extent that it has been       able to for decades is significantly weakened, other, non-      FERC projects would be subject to more stringent requirements       to compensate for the failure of FERC-licensed projects to       contribute what would otherwise be their allocated       responsibility.      The Clean Water Act should continue to authorize           certifications to implement water quality standards and           implementation plans adopted or approved under section           303 of the Clean Water Act        Under section 401 of the Clean Water Act a water quality       certification implements the applicable provisions of       sections 301, 302, 303, 306 and 307 of the Clean Water Act       and any other appropriate requirement of state law. The most       important of the enumerated provisions of the Clean Water Act       is section 303, which provides for water quality standards       and implementation plans. Section 303 requires development       and approval of water quality standards, which consist of       designated uses, criteria, and anti-degradation policies;       establishment of total maximum daily loads, which allocate       responsibility for meeting standards that cannot be met       solely through compliance with the technology-based       requirements of the Clean Water Act; and implementation of a       continuing planning process.        In 1994, the Supreme Court upheld state authority to set       conditions of certification to protect uses designated as       part of the water quality standards under section 303. PUD       No. 1, 511 U.S. at 700. The Court rejected an argument that       certification is limited to implementing the criteria       component of those standards. Consistent with the Supreme       Court's ruling, states have made effective use water quality       certification authority to protect water quality needed for       commercial, tribal, and recreational fisheries and other       important uses of state waters.        The proposed revision to limit ``applicable provisions'' of       section 303 to ``requirement of state law implementing water       quality criteria under section 303 necessary to support the       designated use or uses of the receiving navigable waters''       could strip the states' authority to use their certification       authority to protect the uses of waters of the United States       designated as part of water quality standards under section       303. By inexplicably omitting any reference to federal       requirements that implement section 303, it would also create       substantial uncertainty about states' and tribes' ability to       enforce water quality criteria, total maximum daily loads,       and antidegradation requirements adopted by U.S. EPA.      Congress should not remove the states' authority to require           compliance with state water quality requirements        We strongly oppose the bill's proposed revisions that would       limit the certifying authority to ensuring compliance with       only specific sections of the Clean Water Act by deleting the       existing reference to ``any other appropriate requirement of       State law'' set forth in section 401 subsection (d). Such a       revision would disregard a state's right to impose more       stringent water quality requirements and be contrary to the       protective goals of  [[Page H1511]]       the Clean Water Act. As is accounted for and endorsed by the       Clean Water Act, many states have state-based programs and       attendant requirements that arguably or explicitly expand       beyond the state's Clean Water Act authorities. The Clean       Water Act expressly contemplated a state's authority to       establish and enforce more stringent state requirements       beyond the Clean Water Act. For example, certifications may       include monitoring and reporting requirements that arguably       go beyond ensuring compliance with specific sections of the       Clean Water Act, and instead help determine whether water       quality is being degraded or to shape the development of       future actions to protect water quality.        We urge Congress to refrain from making an unwarranted       intrusion into a state's authority to impose stricter       conditions to protect the quality of waters within its       borders.      Section 401 should preserve the certifying authority's           ability to define the contents of a request for           certification and create submission procedures        The bill proposes revising references to ``application'' to       be ``request.'' Although the intention behind that revision       is not clear, we support language that recognizes that the       certifying authority may define the contents of a request for       certification and create submission procedures. The state's       ability to define what is required for a request for       certification is significant because a receipt of such a       request is the trigger for the beginning of the reasonable       period of time for a certifying authority to act on the       request. The bill proposes an addition requiring certifying       authorities to ``publish requirements for certification,''       but it is not clear whether this language is an indirect       reference to a certifying authority's ability to define       required information for applications and submittal       procedures. To the extent that ``requirements'' were intended       to require the enactment of new state regulations, 30 days is       insufficient time to comply with public notice and comment       requirements for State Water Board adoption.      Section 401 should not impose an arbitrary time limit on the           certifying authority's ability to request information        The bill proposes revisions to subsection (a)(1) that       specify that by 90 days after request for a certification,       the certifying authority must inform the applicant if any       additional information is necessary for the certification       authority to take an action on the request. As explained       above, to the extent that the language requires the       certifying authority to identify what, if any, information is       necessary to submit a complete application for water quality       certification, many state laws, including California's, do       this. But the revised language may be construed as preventing       the states from requesting that the applicant clarify,       amplify, correct, or supplement information required in the       application, which is permissible under state law.        For these reasons, we write to ask that Congress preserve       the existing state authority in Clean Water Act Section 401       to substantively review a project's effects on water quality       before a federal permit or license is issued, and protect       five decades of successful, cooperative federalism.            Sincerely,      Eileen Sobeck,        Executive Director, California State Water Resources       Control Board.      Basil Seggos,        Commissioner, New York State Department of Environmental       Conservation.      Laura Watson,        Director, Washington State Department of Ecology.     In this letter, the States highlight how this  legislation will undermine States' ability to protect water quality  within their States, and erode five decades of successful, cooperative  federalism.   Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose H.R. 1, the polluters over people act,  and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
