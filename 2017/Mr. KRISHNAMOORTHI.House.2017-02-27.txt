 Mr. Speaker, my guest for the President's speech  tomorrow is my constituent, Debbie Trueblood. Debbie reached out to my  office to support the Affordable Care Act because she knows firsthand  the difference the law can make in people's lives.   Debbie suffers from a rare, potentially life-threatening genetic  condition. The only treatments for the condition are a handful of  specialized drugs that can cost more than $100,000 per year.   Before the Affordable Care Act, Debbie could have been denied  coverage because of her preexisting condition, and she would have faced  medical bills greatly exceeding her salary. Because of the Affordable  Care Act, Debbie is able to afford the treatment she needs to work,  support her family, volunteer in her community, and be of service.   Repealing the Affordable Care Act without effectively replacing it  would rob millions of people like Debbie not only of their access to  health care but also of their ability to contribute to our great  Nation.                            ____________________
