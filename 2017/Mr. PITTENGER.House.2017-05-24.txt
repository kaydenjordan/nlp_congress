 Mr. Speaker, this weekend, America pauses to honor the  patriotic men and women who sacrificed their lives in support of our  liberty.   For many, perhaps, Memorial Day has become just another reason for a  cookout. But for more than 11,000 families in North Carolina, Memorial  Day is very real. Their son or daughter or spouse or parent is among  the 11,000 North Carolinians who died during World War II, Korea,  Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan.   Remembering the price of freedom makes me all the more grateful for  the 17 students from my district who this year received appointments to  West Point, the U.S. Air Force Academy, and the U.S. Naval Academy.  These students, many of them at or near the top of their class, are  volunteering to dedicate at least 9 years to defend America. They know  the potential risks and the ultimate sacrifice required by many.   To the families of those who died in service to our Nation, we extend  our deepest sympathy and gratitude. May God bless you.                            ____________________
