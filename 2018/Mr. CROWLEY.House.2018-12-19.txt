 Mr. Speaker, this evening I say goodbye to the House of  Representatives after 20 years of service. Thank you to the people of  Queens and the Bronx. It has been the honor of a lifetime to be the  voice of many people from New York City.   Mr. Speaker, as a son and grandson of immigrants from Ireland, more  specifically, as a son of a New York City cop, as a husband and a  father, I can only hope I have made my family proud. My family is  everything to me. They taught me to pursue fairness and justice, to use  my power--and my size and my voice--for good, and to give back. I hope  I have done that. I hope my colleagues will keep working together to do  the same.   We all have different backgrounds, but we are all united by our  shared dreams for this great land. I believe in the best of America,  its people, and its public servants.   Again, thank you to my family for the love and support you have  always shown to me: to my mom, who was not able to be here tonight; to  my brother, Sean; my sisters, Eileen and Maura; my brother's wife,  Maureen, and their boys; my sister's children and their families; my  children, Cullen, Kenzie, and Liam. I won't tell you their ages,  because they can't be on the floor.   And, of course, my wife, Kasey, is with us as well. Thank you, Kasey.   To my staff, the greatest staff a person could ever have, all of you  have made this such a great journey. From the darkest days of my life  of 9/11 to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, a very special  moment for me, it has been great to be a part of this amazing ride.   I thank you all very much, and God bless you all.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to say goodbye to the House of  Representatives.   To say goodbye after 20 years of service to the people of New York  and to the country. To say goodbye to what's been the honor of a  lifetime.   I have been grateful every day for this opportunity--to come to work  in this chamber, to walk beneath the Capitol dome, to stand in the  footsteps of the giants who came before us.   And I will forever be thankful for having had the chance to represent  my hometown community.  [[Page H10321]]    All four of my grandparents, and my mother, were immigrants from  Ireland.   They left behind everything they knew, in search of a better life for  not just themselves, but for their future generations.   I doubt they ever pictured that someday their grandson would serve in  the United States Congress, but I hope I have done them proud.   My dad was the oldest of seven, who first became a New York City cop,  then went to college and law school on the GI bill.   My mom didn't go to college, but she worked as a legal secretary,  raised four children, and gave us every opportunity she could.   My family instilled in me the values that I hold dear to this day-- the importance of hard work, building strong communities, and ensuring  opportunity for all.   They taught me to stand up for the little guy, to pursue fairness and  justice, to use my power--and my size, and my voice--for good.   And I've tried to incorporate those lessons throughout my work.   My family also taught me the importance of service--of giving back.  Of being part of something that's bigger than yourself.   That's what I've been thinking about as I say farewell to my time in  Congress. Our time here isn't about any one of us--it's about what's  best for the country.   I think sometimes we lose sight of that in the day-to-day--the  legislative deadlines, the political positioning.   Our jobs here tend to be partisan--there's no escaping that.   But we can't--we shouldn't--let that blind us to what we're sent here  to do.   Yes, I'll remember the day we passed the Affordable Care Act to bring  health care to millions more Americans.   I'll remember marching for fair, humane immigration reform with Luis  Gutierrez. I'll remember ``sitting in'' for sensible gun violence  prevention.   But I'll also always remember walking across the Edmund Pettus Bridge  with John Lewis, and watching my 13-year-old son hug John after the  Chief of the Montgomery Police Department apologized for his treatment  there so many years ago.   I'll remember welcoming Pope Francis, alongside Nancy Pelosi, John  Boehner and the whole congressional leadership, many of whom I'm proud  to call friends.   I'll remember fighting for sustainable peace in Ireland, for progress  in Burma, for a stronger relationship with India all of which require  cooperation on both sides of the aisle.   I'll remember returning to the Capitol after the September 11  attacks, after the worst day of my life when my cousin John was  declared among the lost firefighters, and the way I was welcomed, and  embraced, and loved by members of every political persuasion.   I think about those experiences when I'm wondering how we can get  back to the days of working together, and seeing each other as people,  not political opponents.   But I believe we can find our way again.   Because I do believe that government can do great things.   I believe that we can create good-paying jobs, and a vibrant and  strong economy that works for all.   I believe that we can lead the world in innovation, and lead the  world, period. But those aren't Republican or Democratic goals.   In my neighborhood, they're shared by the shopkeeper, the taxi  driver, the firefighter. And here, they're shared by every one of us  who walks into this chamber.   We all have our own backgrounds and our own family folklore, but  we're united by our shared dreams for this country.   So I always believe in the best in this country, its people, and its  public servants.   Part of what helps me to keep that optimism is the love and support  I've always gotten from my family, many of whom are here today.   My mom, my brother and sisters, and their families.   My children, Cullen, Kenzie, and Liam.   And of course my wife Kasey, whose support has allowed me to  participate in this great arena. It's been quite a ride.   And while I'm sad to be leaving, I follow that old Irish tradition of  keeping your chin up, keep smiling.   I think you all know that I'm a little bit of a Bruce Springsteen  fan. One of my favorite songs, Rosalita, has a line I can't help but  think about: ``Someday we'll look back on this and it will all seem  funny.''   I will seem funny. But it will also seem meaningful, it will seem  compelling, it will seem historic.   And it will always stand out to me as the greatest professional  experience of my life.   So thank you to my constituents, my friends, my family, my staff, and  all of you who made this such a great journey.                            ____________________
