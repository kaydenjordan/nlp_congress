 Mr. President, I rise to discuss President Trump's ongoing  shutdown of the Federal Government--how we got here, the impact on the  people of my State, and how we can make some progress.   It is past time for the President to stop holding the American people  for ransom through this government shutdown. It is past time to stop  the misinformation campaign and to stop making unwarranted demands for  the ill use of American taxpayers' dollars. The President needs to open  the government.   The Senate did its work on the budget. We have bipartisan, compromise  bills that are ready for the President's signature. Chairman Collins  and I worked together, on a bipartisan basis, to develop the fiscal  year 2019 Transportation-HUD bill, which was reported out of committee  unanimously. Our bill was then approved by the full Senate as part of a  package that included three other bipartisan appropriations bills-- Agriculture, Financial Services, and the Interior. Together, these  bills passed by a veto-proof margin of 92 to 6.   I am very proud of the work that Chairman Collins did and that I was  able to assist with during this process to provide an additional $10  billion to rebuild our roads, our bridges, and our  [[Page S98]]  airports and to develop new affordable housing opportunities to more  than 5 million low-income Americans who strive to make ends meet. These  investments will grow our economy, spur job creation, and improve  communities across America.   The T-HUD bill--on an issue that both Chairman Collins and I care  deeply about--will continue to make a major commitment to address  homelessness among youth, veterans, and survivors of domestic violence.  We are making real progress through the HUD-VASH Program, which has  brought down homelessness among veterans by 49 percent since 2010 and  is helping 64 communities in 3 States effectively end homelessness  among veterans.   In September, a Senate-House conference committee that I served on  had essentially reached an agreement on a final version of these four  bills. They could have been passed and signed into law by the start of  the fiscal year last October 1. It would have been a victory for the  American people--both for the smart investments these bills would make  and for the restoration of good government and regular order, which  Chairman Shelby and Vice Chairman Leahy have both made it a priority to  achieve. Instead, a final agreement was slow-walked and stalled by the  House leadership and then the White House in order to give the  President greater leverage for the shutdown he had been angling for  over many months.    Here we are, 3 months into the fiscal year and 3 weeks into a  shutdown, and 800,000 Federal employees have either been furloughed or  forced to work without pay. Thousands of Federal contract employees are  also out of work and may never be compensated. Trash is piling up at  national parks, and damage is being reported. Employers can't access  the government's E-Verify system to assure that they are hiring legal  residents. Soon, the shutdown may prevent HUD from renewing project- based rental agreements. Press reports indicate that the shutdown is  causing States to scale back in awarding highway and transit contracts.   Starting as soon as this Friday, many Federal district courts will  start feeling the Federal shutdown pinch more acutely, with just  skeleton crews or just a few people working without pay, making it  harder for Americans and businesses to get their day in court.   Like everyone else, Federal employees--from Coast Guard officers and  enlisted personnel to FBI agents, to air traffic controllers--have  rent, mortgages, student loans, childcare, and healthcare bills to pay.  Many work paycheck to paycheck.   The President has said that he is willing to continue this shutdown  for months or even years without a care about the effect it will have  on their lives. Indeed, during his speech last night, the President  didn't even mention these Federal employees. In Congress, we hear their  stories.   On Monday, air traffic controllers from T.F. Green Airport visited my  office. They explained that this shutdown not only creates financial  hardships for them, it also clogs the pipeline for the hiring and  training of new controllers who are desperately needed to replace those  who are eligible for retirement.   I am hearing from other constituents too. A USDA meat inspector from  Chepachet, RI, sent me an email over the holidays saying:         I'm one of the Federal employees that will be impacted by       the government shutdown/impasse. . . . I'm required to report       to work without pay for the duration. I have 3 children under       5 and a stay-at-home husband, with no contingency plan for       lack of pay, especially during the holiday season. I realize       it's Christmas, and you all have families too. The holidays       are stressful enough without additional financial stress.    I hope the President will act and reopen the Department of  Agriculture, the FDA, and other Agencies that keep our food and  medicine safe.   A Coast Guard lieutenant from Westerly, RI, also wrote me to say:         I respectfully implore you to represent the needs and       values of servicemembers such as myself, as well as the hard-      working Coast Guard civilians who work alongside me. During       the shutdown, our missions are stunted and our dedication is       disrespected. As the only household income and as I continue       to fulfill my commitment to active duty service, my ability       to meet financial obligations for myself and my two young       children is at great risk if the shutdown continues.       Likewise, the government is not living up to its end of the       contract made with my crew of both active duty and civilian       members. Please share this plea with your fellow Congress       members.    Lieutenant, thank you for your service and for the additional  sacrifice you and your colleagues are making today.   As we think about border security, let's remember the important job  the Coast Guard is doing to protect our border, particularly to prevent  illegal drugs from entering the United States. In 2017 alone, the Coast  Guard seized illegal drugs valued at $6.6 billion wholesale and  detained 708 suspected smugglers for prosecution. So it is interesting  to have the President talk about drug smugglers coming across our  Mexican border while the Coast Guard is out there, unpaid, protecting  us on all of the seas and oceans that abut the United States.   It is not just Federal employees. An executive at a small shipyard in  North Kingstown, RI, wrote to me this week to say:         We do a great deal of work for the U.S. Coast Guard, and       for the last three weeks, we have not been paid. We currently       have about a half a million dollars due with an additional       $200,000 going in for review and payment in the next week or       so. This situation is beginning to hinder our ability to pay       our vendors, and it's created a cash flow deficiency that, if       not resolved soon, will be difficult and costly to manage.       Please feel free to share this message with whoever needs to       hear about this.    This is a small business in Rhode Island, repairing ships for our  Coast Guard, that is facing financial distress--in fact, perhaps,  disaster. Those are the people who are being harmed by this shutdown.   Certainly, I hear this message, and I know my colleagues are  listening, but for whatever reason, the President doesn't seem to be  listening.    So how does this get resolved? Democrats have offered several paths  forward, but now the President--the person who caused this shutdown,  who proudly declared on television he would take full credit for it-- needs to commit to reopening the government without precondition.   I know that many people say: Why can't you just make a deal with the  President? Unfortunately, the President can't stick to basic facts,  numbers, or a bargain.   Originally, Mexico was going to pay for his border wall. Then he  decided that American taxpayers should pay for it, so he asked Congress  for $1.6 billion to build 65 miles of wall. Last Sunday, his request  became $5.7 billion for more than 230 miles of wall. By Monday, he was  considering declaring a national emergency and using national defense  dollars without congressional approval.   To the idea that the President would use defense dollars to build a  border wall, let me say that his proposed wall has no core defense  function. We are not at war with Mexico.   In fact, the Pentagon's most recent national defense strategy doesn't  mention the southern border as a national defense priority. Meanwhile,  the Pentagon has billions of dollars in infrastructure backlogs,  ranging from military construction projects for new missions to  deferred maintenance in facilities sustainment, restoration, and  modernization. There is no credible argument that a border wall takes  priority over any of these.   Of course, the President doesn't have a real plan for building the  border wall. In July, the Government Accountability Office warned that  the Trump administration's approach increased risks that the wall--in  their words--``will cost more than projected, take longer than planned,  or not fully perform as expected.'' Is there any wonder congressional  GOP leaders rejected his wall when they controlled every branch of  government in the last 2 years?   The President has not been honest with the American people. He hasn't  even been straight with members of his administration or Members of his  own party in Congress, who are often hung out to dry.   In fact, 2 days before the shutdown, the then-Senate majority whip  told CNN, after a meeting with Vice President Pence, that the President  would sign a clean continuing resolution to keep the government open  until after Christmas. Less than 24 hours later, that position was  reversed by a Presidential tweet.   Even when the President makes a deal, he has trouble keeping it,  especially when he is under criticism from  [[Page S99]]  rightwing talk radio and TV personalities. After negotiating overall  funding levels for defense and nondefense spending last year, the  President nearly vetoed the final 2018 Omnibus appropriations bill  because he was criticized for the size and scope of the bill. Secretary  Mattis had to be summoned to the White House to explain how important  the bill was to the Pentagon before the President grudgingly agreed to  sign it.   Now there is no Secretary Mattis or anyone of his stature to give the  President good counsel. If the President remains implacable about his  wall, it will be up to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  join with Democrats to pass the bipartisan bills we have already agreed  on together and reopen the government.   I hope they do so, and soon, as the lives of our constituents and the  health and businesses of our States are at stake.   The answer we have to give is not to the President. The answer is to  that young woman working every day without pay to protect the American  public by inspecting foods that we eat. The answer we have to give is  to that young Coast Guard officer who is working every day, trying to  pay for and to afford things for a young family without being paid. The  only answer we can give them is that we are opening up this government  immediately.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Dimitrios  Meritis, a fellow in my office, be granted privileges of the floor for  this session of Congress.
