 Madam Speaker, as usual, Trump says one thing here and  does another. He continues his assault on healthcare--no protection for  preexisting conditions, nothing done to lower prescription price- gouging, and even considering potential cuts to what they call  ``entitlements'' and we call Medicare.   Trump supports only junk insurance and junk ideas, like this crazy  idea to block-grant Medicaid, which is a truly block-headed approach  that will jeopardize insurance coverage for 1 in 5 Americans.   In Texas, Medicaid is a safety net with more holes than net through  which many needy Texans regularly fall. Much of the available  assistance is critical to our seniors. Already slashed to the bone,  Texas Medicaid does not have any more room for the kind of cuts that  Trump is urging. Hospitals are struggling to stay afloat in many parts  of the State. Healthcare providers, some of them go out of business.  And to the disgrace of the Lone Star State, we have almost 1 million  children, more than in any other State in the Union, who lack any  insurance access.   Indeed, it is the Affordable Care Act that actually slowed Medicaid  spending, but Republicans will have none of that. This landmark  legislation tried to patch the holes in the safety net, but even when  Texas was offered 100 cents on the dollar from the Federal Government  to extend Medicaid to some of its citizens, Texas refused to do that,  and has continued to do so.   Now this Trump block-headed approach would widen the coverage gap for  5 million people with disabilities and millions of children who suffer  when their parents cannot get care.    One of the advantages of the Medicaid program is if more  people require coverage during an economic downturn, or if costs go up  because of a public health emergency, like coronavirus or an opioid  epidemic, the Federal funding automatically increases. If you have a  stingy State Republican government that caps it, that coverage will go  down instead of up. What is out of control in America today is not  Medicaid spending, but this unhinged President's attempts to undermine  healthcare access for as many Americans as he can do.   Madam Speaker, let's oppose it.                                time  1330
