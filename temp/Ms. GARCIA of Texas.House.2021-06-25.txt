 Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention  to the crisis caused by the lack of childcare in my district and across  the country. Access to affordable childcare is critical for working  families across the country and in my district.   We all have heard of places without grocery stores referred to as  food deserts. Well, half of American families live in areas lacking  childcare facilities. They are living in childcare deserts.   The situation is even worse in Latino communities, as 78 percent live  in childcare deserts.   As you can see on this chart by my side, this is my district. The  orange and the dark colors represent areas that have no access to  childcare. Eighty-two percent of the children in my district have no  access to childcare. This is a childcare desert. This impacts  disproportionately communities of color. This is unacceptable.   As a Nation, we must invest in childcare. High-quality childcare  improves outcomes for children, parents, and neighborhoods. We must act  and we must act now.                            ____________________
