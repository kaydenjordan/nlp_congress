 Mr. Speaker, the continuing attacks on Israeli civilians  by Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip are a shocking reminder that  Israel's very existence has been threatened throughout its seven  decades as a nation. We strongly condemn these attacks and the terror  campaign being waged against our Israeli allies.   As a sovereign country, Israel not only has the right but the  responsibility to protect its own citizens. No nation could be expected  to withstand these assaults without acting in its own defense.   Even in its military response, under constant threat of further  attacks, with air raid sirens driving hundreds of thousands of Israelis  to bomb shelters, Israel has shown remarkable restraint. Hamas has  certainly not.   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government should have the full  support of this Congress and this President as it works to end the  waves of terror coming out of Gaza. As the Prime Minister said in this  Chamber 10 years ago, ``Israel is the one anchor of stability'' in the  Middle East.   Mr. Speaker, we must continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with  Israel, united against all threats to its peace, stability, and its  very existence.                            ____________________
