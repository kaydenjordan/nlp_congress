 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in overwhelming support for the  officers who carry out the important mission of Immigration and Customs  Enforcement, better known as ICE.   These brave individuals are saddled with the responsibility of facing  some of the world's most dangerous and violent criminals, like MS-13  and many who traffic drugs and humans, and others who wish to do us  harm.   Yesterday, 35 Members voted against supporting this important area of  our law enforcement. Not supporting our law enforcement and ICE is just  plain wrong and endangers American lives. ICE ensures the defense and  security of the United States through the identification,  investigation, apprehension, and deportation of foreign nationals that  pose a threat of any kind to U.S. national security.   We are a country of laws, and they must be enforced. I will vote time  and again to support these brave officers, and I stand here today to  thank them for their service and for the sacrifice that they and their  families make each and every day as they keep our communities as safe  as possible.                            ____________________
