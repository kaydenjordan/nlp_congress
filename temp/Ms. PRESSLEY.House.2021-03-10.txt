 Mr. Speaker, I rise to reintroduce the People's Justice  Guarantee, a bold, progressive vision to transform our criminal legal  system from what it currently is to what it ought to be.   For far too long, Congress has enacted policies that failed millions  of men, women, and children by expanding our carceral system and  divesting from Black and Latinx communities.   Growing up with an incarcerated parent, these failures are personal  to me. I worked with folks in communities that have been marginalized  and ignored, like the incarcerated brothers of the AACC in the  Massachusetts Seventh, to craft a resolution that confronts the  systemic injustices that destabilized families and traumatized  generations.   We should provide care for those in crisis, not confine them in  solitary.   We should house our immigrant neighbors, not deport them from their  communities.   We should counsel our kids, not lock them up in prison.   The People's Justice Guarantee offers these solutions and many others  in a robust framework for a humane, equitable, and just legal system.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to reintroduce the People's Justice Guarantee  so America can finally fulfill its promise of justice for all.                            ____________________
