 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the  INVEST in America Act.   This bill makes long overdue investments in the Nation building here  at home and would deliver for my community in Buffalo and western New  York.   It includes funding to convert the historic DL&W train station into a  multiuse transportation hub. It supports the transition of a North  Tonawanda highway near the Erie Canal into a walkable neighborhood. And  it will transform an abandoned rail line in Buffalo into the vibrant  Riverline trail.   The INVEST in America Act will add more than $400 million in annual  funding to New York to fix bridges and roads, an increase of over 30  percent.   This bill does not, however, fix neighborhoods destroyed by highway  building in the decade of the 1950s. We need to do more to restore  those communities in those neighborhoods that were destroyed many years  ago.   Now is the time to invest in America.                            ____________________
