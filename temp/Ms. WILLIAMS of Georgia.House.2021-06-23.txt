 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act and my amendment to  the bill.   For older job seekers and workers, age discrimination remains a  barrier to both getting employed and staying employed. According to an  AARP survey released in 2019, three in five older workers report that  they have seen or experienced age discrimination on the job.   Age discrimination should have no place in decisions about an  employee. It doesn't matter if age is one factor or the only factor in  these decisions. Discrimination is still wrong.   Under current law, an older worker must prove that a negative action  was taken against them solely because of their age to pursue legal  remedy for age discrimination. That leaves out a lot of workers who  have been marginalized because of their age.   The bill before us would create a reasonable burden of proof under  the law to allow more workers who have faced age discrimination to  pursue relief.   Enacting this legislation would be a monumental step, but we have  more to do to ensure that all older workers are served well by  protections under law because the circumstances facing older workers  are not all the same.   Many older workers face intersectional discrimination based not only  on their age, but also due to factors like their race, their gender, or  disability status. For example, in a 2017 experimental study published  by the Federal Reserve Bank, researchers found that older women  encounter more age discrimination in the hiring process and callback  process than men.   To ensure equitable protection for individuals experiencing  intersectional discrimination, we have to understand any disparities  they may face in pursuing relief from discrimination as this  legislation is implemented.   My amendment tasks the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission with  completing a study on these disparities and reporting back to Congress  within 2 years. This analysis will be crucial to ensuring our laws are  serving all of us and that we are truly reaching the ideal of equality  for all.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and the  underlying legislation.                                time  1545
