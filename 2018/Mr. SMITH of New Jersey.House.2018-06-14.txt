 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  congratulate four exceptional students from New Jersey's Point Pleasant  Borough High School--Luke Boylan, Theresa Cardone, Jaspreet Kaur, and  Adrian Wittmann--for their amazing app designed to ensure that their  classmates with special needs have a lunch buddy to build friendships,  share conversation, laugh, or talk about each other's hopes and dreams.   Lunch Buddy app helps make all participating students more  understanding, knowledgeable, kind, and empathetic. Lunch Buddy app  helps all participating students see the world from each other's eyes.   Everyone has good days and bad, strengths and weaknesses, and things  we want to talk about to a friend. For many, high school can be  difficult and lonely. Lunch Buddy app recognizes this and enables  participating students to better grasp the God-given worth, inherent  value, and innate goodness of everyone and says with neon lights: You  are welcomed and cherished here.   Working together, under the incredible guidance of their advanced  software engineering teacher, Mr. Nick Gattuso, Luke, Theresa,  Jaspreet, and Adrian created a Lunch Buddy app  [[Page H5160]]  which earned them the top prize in New Jersey's Fourth Congressional  District App Challenge.   Several weeks ago, the team came to the Capitol, where they were  nationally recognized.   Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege of seeing the app in action when I  visited the high school in February and was struck by the extraordinary  care and kindness of the winners and, frankly, all the students in the  class. These young people are truly amazing.   Allow me, Mr. Speaker, to say a brief word about the teacher, Nick  Gattuso.   After the terrorist attacks of 9/11, Mr. Gattuso was so inspired by  the selflessness of so many that he left a highly successful career at  Bell Labs and took an early retirement and huge pay cut to teach  because he said he just wanted to give back to others. He said he was  too old to be a firefighter and too old to be a cop, but he chose the  noble profession of teacher.   Today, with great skill, energy, and passion, Mr. Gattuso teaches his  students, in his words, ``how to use their programming, engineering,  and problem-solving skills for good.'' Lunch Buddy app epitomizes that  good.   Lunch Buddy app, Mr. Speaker, sprang out of a broader initiative to  create a better learning environment for students with disabilities. In  2012, Point Pleasant Borough High School established The Panther  Assisted Learning Software, or PALS, with the stated goal of  ``providing students with multiple disabilities differentiated  assistive learning technologies and to promote increased independence  and vocational sufficiency.''   Additionally, PALS was created to overcome specific barriers to  learning and to facilitate increased interaction between special needs  students and their nondisabled peers. It is a wonderful program that  teaches important lessons that last a lifetime, and I believe this  program needs to be replicated in every high school in the country.                                time  1045    The Lunch Buddy app is one of several real-world, operational apps  that are enhancing the learning and community environment at Point  Pleasant. Other apps, for example, assist students with their class  schedules, money management, and resume building and are developed in  close collaboration with special needs students in the life skills  class.   As you know, Mr. Speaker, the Congressional App Challenge itself was  created to allow students in STEM fields who also work in computer  programming an opportunity to showcase their software application  achievements. These STEM fields are central to the global workforce of  the future, and it is critical for our students to have opportunities  like this challenge to further develop expertise in computer  programming and work with teammates to enhance their collective  creativity.   We all know that integrating into the academic and social  environments at school can be difficult for many students, especially  and including those with a disability. As the founder and co-chair of  the Congressional Autism Caucus, I have heard stories from countless  families with children with autism who struggle.   So I am especially grateful to our four designers of the Lunch Buddy  app who showed both great technical skill and compassion. They put  their expertise toward the service of others.   Mr. Speaker, the world awaits what they and other students in that  class have to offer.                            ____________________
