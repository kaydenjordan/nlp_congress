 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida for the  recognition. She does a great job for the Congress, and we are all so  grateful to have her here.   Madam Speaker, this is such an important topic tonight. Ranking  Member Katko delineated the number of law enforcement jurisdictions who  have seen funding cut and the unfortunate consequences that occurred on  the populations that they serve. Did you ever stop to think of what  would happen if there were just an absolute defunding of the police  department?   Well, unfortunately, we only need to look about a hundred years past  to see such an example. It happened in Boston, Massachusetts, in  September 1919. The police force was unfunded, and the city was  unprotected. This was documented in a book by a gentleman named Francis  Russell. The book is called ``A City in Terror.''   What was startling to me when I read the book was not that there was  a gradual descent into lawlessness, but it happened like turning a  switch. Police were not on the job. The city sunk into chaos-- robberies, beatings, assaults, looting. And it went on for several days  until the Governor of that State called up the National Guard and  reasserted authority.   Who was that Governor? It is kind of a rarity to stop and think about  it now, but it was a Republican Governor of Massachusetts named Calvin  Coolidge. It was that activity of restoring order in the city that  catapulted him to fame and caused him to receive the Vice Presidential  nomination in the Republican Convention of 1920. And as they say, the  rest is history.   Please, let us not forget our history. Defunding the police does not  lead us to a better place. It does not lead us to a more just and civil  society. It invites chaos.                                time  2120
