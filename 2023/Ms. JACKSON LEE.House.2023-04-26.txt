 Mr. Speaker, no American, no patriot would stand on  this floor representing the American people and argue for the default  on America legislation.   To refuse to pay our bills is an insult to the men and women who  swore to die for this country. You want to know why? Because it would  cut 30 million visits from veterans at the veterans' hospitals and  81,000 jobs from the Veterans Health Administration.   It would increase the wait times for benefits like pensions and  jeopardize the National Cemetery Administration caring for our  cemeteries.                                time  1500    If you are in retirement, $20,000 could be lost out of your  retirement. Is that patriotic?   In addition, you would cut grants for low-income students. You would  cut and cause the expense of colleges to go up in Texas and around the  Nation. In the 18th Congressional District you would jeopardize Social  Security payments from $61,000, put public health benefits at risk for  242,000 people, and increase lifetime mortgage costs. You would raise  the debt $1.74 trillion.   This is unpatriotic. It is not representative of what America stands  for. Vote against a bill that strips food assistance from 4,000 Texans.   Mr. Speaker, as a Senior Member on the House Budget Committee, I rise  today in strong opposition to H.R. 2811, the Limit, Save, Grow Act.   This reckless proposal would painfully impact the lives of millions  of Americans by making disastrous cuts to programs that workers and  families count on every day and by risking the full faith and credit of  the United States.   The outrageous proposal sets the FY 2024 discretionary spending  levels at no more than the FY 2022 level, which would require a total  cut of at least $142 billion from the FY 2023 appropriations Act.   Cutting FY 2024 discretionary spending back to FY 2022 levels would  endanger public safety, increase costs for families, undermine American  workers, hurt our seniors, and weaken our national security.   Instead of investing in America, Republicans would rather focus on  holding our economy hostage to advance unpopular and dangerous right- wing priorities.   The Republican default package is playing a brinkmanship game using  the threat of economic catastrophe to try to force cuts in green energy  investment, a rollback in enforcement against wealthy tax cheats, a war  on poor people, and service cuts for taxpayers and Social Security  beneficiaries.   Breaching the debt limit would provoke unprecedented economic damage  and instability in the U.S. and around the world.   Every single American would feel the effects of a first-ever default:   An estimated 800,000 plus people would be out of work and the  unemployment rate would double;   Social Security checks would be halted to 67 million Americans;   Medicaid services would be in peril, affecting 75 million people's  health coverage;   The average worker close to retirement could see their retirement  savings decrease by $20,000 due to Republican brinksmanship impacting  the stock market.   Republicans suspended the debt ceiling three times under President  Trump.   In fact, the massive Republican tax cuts over the last 25 years have  cost $10 trillion to date and are responsible for 57 percent of the  increase to the debt ratio since 2001.   Specifically, this extreme and reckless plan would have devastating  impacts on thousands of hardworking families across Texas.   This plan would:   Strip food assistance from 994,000 Texans.   Republicans are threatening food assistance for up to 855,000 Texans  with their proposals for harsh new eligibility restrictions in SNAP.  This proposal would also mean 139,000 women, infants, and children  would lose vital nutrition assistance through the Women, Infants, and  Children (WIC), increasing child poverty and hunger.   Make college more expensive for 587,900 Texans.   This proposal would not only eliminate Pell Grants altogether for  6,800 students in Texas, but it would also reduce the maximum award by  nearly $1,000 for the remaining 581,100 students who receive Pell  Grants--making it harder for them to attend and afford college.   Raise housing costs for 39,700 Texans.   Under this proposal, 39,700 families in Texas would lose access to  rental assistance, including older adults, persons with disabilities,  and families with children, who without rental assistance would be at  risk of homelessness.   Worsen Social Security and Medicare Assistance wait times for million  Texas seniors.   Under this proposal, people applying for disability benefits would  have to wait at least two months longer for a decision. With fewer  staff available, 5 million seniors and people with disabilities in  Texas would be forced to endure longer wait times when they call for  assistance for both Social Security and Medicare.   Threaten medical care for Texas Veterans.   This proposal would mean 46,100 fewer veteran outpatient visits in  Texas, leaving veterans unable to get appointments for care like  wellness visits, mental health services, and substance disorder  treatment.   Eliminate 27,400 preschool and child care slots in Texas.   The proposal would mean 17,500 children in Texas lose access to Head  Start slots and 9,900 children lose access to childcare--undermining  our children's education and making it more difficult for parents to  join the workforce and contribute to our economy.   Deny 1100 Texans admission to opioid treatment.   The proposal would deny admission to opioid use disorder treatment  for more than 1,100 people in Texas through the State Opioid Response  grant program--denying them a potentially life-saving path to recovery.   More specifically, the impacts on my home district, Texas-18, would  be catastrophic. The passage of this proposal would:   kill 7,300 jobs in TX-18;   Jeopardize Social Security payments for 61,000 families in TX-18;   Put health benefits at risk for 242,000 people in TX-18 who rely on  Medicare, Medicaid, or Veterans Affairs health coverage;   Increase lifetime mortgage costs for the typical homeowner in Texas  by $50,000;   Threaten the retirement savings of 81,400 people near retirement in  TX-18, eliminating $20,000 from the typical retirement portfolio.   The proposal in front of us here today is not a reasonable middle  ground, nor is it even a starting point for discussion.   There never has been and never will be anything fiscally responsible  about refusing to pay America's bills, risking millions of jobs, or  threatening economic ruin.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a report from the U.S. Congress  Joint Economic Committee titled: ``The  [[Page H2017]]  Steep Costs of a Republican Default Crisis.''         Raising the debt limit in a timely manner is about meeting       existing obligations and is the only option to avoid economic       chaos. The effects of failing to raise the debt limit would       likely be felt economy wide: From drastically increased costs       for mortgages, credit card payments, and other borrowing, to       disrupted payments for Social Security recipients, veterans,       service members, and hospitals, to far-reaching effects in       the financial system. As the 2011 debt ceiling crisis showed,       even narrowly avoiding a default cost the country billions of       dollars.    Republicans' default crisis will push up costs for families and small                                 businesses         Debt-limit threats increase costs for families and small       businesses. While breaching the debt limit would be       catastrophic, the threat of breaching the debt ceiling alone       can have serious economic consequences. As 2011 and 2013       Republican debt-limit brinkmanship showed, reckless talk       about letting the U.S. breach the debt limit has a real       impact on the economy, working families, and small       businesses. These threats create uncertainty that the U.S.       government will pay its bills, pushing up interest rates and       undermining confidence worldwide in the U.S. economy.        The average worker close to retirement could take a $20,000       hit to their retirement savings. According to the non-      partisan think tank Third Way, the debt limit crisis of 2011       led to a significant decline in the stock market and the       impact would be even more dire if the U.S. defaulted on the       national debt. They find that a typical worker nearing       retirement could lose about $20,000 from their 401(k) if       debt-limit brinkmanship causes the S&P 500 to drop by 22       percent.        Small business loans could go up $44 a month, costing about       $2,500 more over the course of the loan. If, as happened in       2011 with mortgage loans, small business loans see an       interest rate increase of 70 basis points due to debt-limit       brinkmanship, an entrepreneur taking out a new startup loan       with fixed interest would see a significant increase to their       loan. About 20,000 businesses took out new loans each quarter       in 2022. Similarly, an established small business owner with       a variable rate loan will see their monthly payments rise by       $53 per month. About 46,000 businesses had outstanding       variable interest loans in the third quarter of 2022.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a report from  Moody's Analytics titled: ``The Debt Limit Drama Heats Up.''         Speaker McCarthy's proposed legislation would increase the       debt limit by $1.5 trillion or until March 31, 2024,       whichever comes first. In exchange, it would cut government       spending by $4.5 trillion over the next decade and implement       a number of consequential changes to fiscal policy (see Table       1 and Chart 3). The most significant spending cuts would come       by setting fiscal 2024 discretionary spending equal to fiscal       2022 spending levels.     Mr. Speaker, when I was in my district,  commemorating and celebrating Eid, of course, with my many constituents  who have just had Ramadan, I met one of the leaders of the Sudanese  community.   Clearly, this crisis in Sudan deserves our attention. I rise today to  express great concern for the people of Sudan and the peace that they  were attempting to implement.   I ask for the United States to be diligent in seeking a cease-fire, a  permanent cease-fire, between two fighting generals who have nothing to  do but to fight over power. We must be concerned about women, children,  and families.   I have been to Sudan during the horrible genocide in Darfur. I know  that they have overcome much. I have been to South Sudan with the right  to return.   Now it is time for peace. We have brought out our foreign officers,  but we must also try to secure the Americans that are there. Sudan  deserves peace, and the United States must be engaged in peace efforts.                            ____________________
