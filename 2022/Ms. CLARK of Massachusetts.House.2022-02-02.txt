 Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking  Chairwoman Johnson for all of her leadership and her diligence in  bringing the America COMPETES Act to the floor.   Once again, Democrats are answering the economic challenges we face  with real solutions. What we didn't hear in the last 20 minutes or so  was anything about how this act is going to strengthen our supply  chain, it is going to create American jobs, and it is going to bring  families lower costs and fully stocked shelves. It will improve our  national security and global competitiveness by reducing our reliance  on semiconductor production abroad and supporting innovation and  research right here at home.   What is more, this act not only creates great jobs but invests in our  STEM workforce, helping it to better represent the diversity of our  Nation and create better outcomes for everyone.   With this bill, Americans will feel the benefits of our work in  Washington at the gas pump, the car dealership, and the grocery store.  I am proud to vote ``yes'' for this act that will turbocharge our  economy and national security.
