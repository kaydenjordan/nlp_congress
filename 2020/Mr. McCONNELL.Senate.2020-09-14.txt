 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, when I address the situation in the  Middle East, it is often to discuss instability, terror, or other  threats to the United States and its partners, like Israel. Those  threats still exist, but I am very glad to be speaking today about  peace breaking out, and it is breaking out more quickly than we can  even stage the official ceremonies to memorialize the diplomatic  achievements.   A few weeks ago, with major help from the United States and the Trump  administration, Israel and the United Arab Emirates reached the first  Arab-Israel peace deal in 26 years. The Abraham Accord is named for the  shared religious roots that Christians, Jews, and Muslims all hold in  common. It will make the UAE just the third Arab nation, and the very  first in the gulf, to normalize relations with Israel. In the words of  Prime Minister Netanyahu, ``full and official peace, full diplomatic  agreement, with embassies, investment, commerce, tourism, and direct  flights between Tel Aviv and Dubai and Abu Dhabi.''   We have come a long way--a long way indeed. What a moment.   Farsighted leaders in both countries made sacrifices to make this  deal possible. Prime Minister Netanyahu and Sheikh Muhammad bin Zayid  understand that both Arabs and Israelis will benefit from the peace and  prosperity that tearing down barriers can bring. America will also  benefit from these two regional friends working more closely together  and reducing tensions across the challenging region.   Now, to be sure, work is not finished, and no single step like this  should be confused for an overnight miracle. In this case, we in  Congress have an obligation to review any U.S. arms sales package  linked to the deal. As we help our Arab partners defend against growing  threats, we must continue ensuring that Israel's qualitative military  edge  [[Page S5564]]  remains unchallenged. But the winds of change are blowing, and they are  bringing good news for peace all across the region.   Of course, a few extreme voices, perhaps correctly sensing that their  moment is slipping away, are not at all happy. A predictable cast of  characters wasted no time condemning the agreement and branding the UAE  as traitors to the Arab or Muslim world.   Unlike Iranian clerics or al-Qaida terrorists, everyone who is  actually living in the 21st century is celebrating this major progress.  This major step forward is being documented in a signing ceremony at  the White House tomorrow. But in just the couple of weeks that have  elapsed between the announcement of the Abraham Accord and the official  ceremony tomorrow, another Arab state has joined the parade toward  peace. On Friday, September 11, Israel and Bahrain announced their  agreement to open formal diplomatic relations. After Egypt, Jordan, and  the UAE, this makes the fourth historic step toward normalization by  Israel's Arab neighbors.   Along with President Trump, Prime Minister Netanyahu and King Hamad  of Bahrain called the agreement ``a historic breakthrough to further  peace in the Middle East.'' Indeed, reports suggest that still more  Arab states may not be far behind. This is a new course with the  potential to fundamentally--fundamentally--change the Middle East.   Dennis Ross, former senior diplomatic adviser to President Obama and  a longtime practitioner of the peace process, wrote just yesterday that  these agreements are bona fide ``breakthroughs'' that are changing  ``the political landscape of the Middle East'' and the Israel-Palestine  stalemate for the better. That is Dennis Ross, from the Obama  administration. That is how former Obama administration officials are  praising the Trump administration's successes.   I am grateful for this administration's work to encourage peace. I am  proud of this historic opportunity that American leadership and  diplomacy has made possible.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on a totally different message, I  had hoped, Republicans had hoped, and the American people had hoped  that the Senate would be spending this week finishing up another  bipartisan agreement on coronavirus relief. We want to get hundreds of  billions more dollars into the pipeline for kids, for jobs, for  healthcare.   Unfortunately, Senate Democrats chose to block it all. Our Democratic  colleagues voted against hundreds of billions of dollars to help  Americans fight the virus. This wasn't even a vote on final passage,  just a procedural vote to break the Democratic leader's filibuster and  move forward with something. Senate Democrats, nevertheless,  filibustered the aid.   Then, just a few short days later, they went right back to signaling  that a Democratic Senate majority paired with a President Joe Biden  would abolish the filibuster and permanently vandalize this institution  to more easily force radical change on the country. This threat to  permanently disfigure the Senate has been the latest growing drumbeat  in the modern Democratic Party's war against our governing  institutions.   There was former Senator Reid starting the ``nuclear'' exchange back  in 2013. There have been years of unprecedented tactics to try and deny  President Trump the government the people elected. There has been the  least fair, least thorough, and most rushed impeachment inquiry in  modern history.   Now, the most shameless--the most shameless--hypocrisy: Senate  Democrats happily use the filibuster to block coronavirus relief and  Senator Tim Scott's police reform bill at the very same time they are  conspiring to destroy that very tool so they can ram through their  radical agenda if they ever win power. Grade A hypocrisy and nothing  more.   We have had former President Obama call for ``eliminating the  filibuster, another Jim Crow relic,'' about 1 month after his own party  used it to kill Senator Tim Scott's police reform bill. We have some of  former Vice President Biden's allies in the Senate daydreaming about  ending the filibuster even as they themselves use the filibuster to  kill pandemic relief for working families.   Democrats want completely different sets of rules depending on  whether they hold power--different sets of rules depending upon whether  they hold power. They want to assert minority rights when they have the  minority and steamroll them if they get a majority.   Here is NBC News:         Democratic insiders are assembling a coalition behind the       scenes to wage an all-out war on the Senate filibuster. . . .       Veteran party operatives, activist groups and supportive       Senators are coordinating message and strategy.    This takes measuring the drapes to a new level. The Democratic leader  and his colleagues aren't just measuring the drapes; they are  calculating how much kerosene it would take to burn the drapes down.   They aren't just threatening to pass radical policies like Medicare  for none or the Green New Deal--no, no, no. The far left wants to hot- wire democracy itself--things like packing the Supreme Court with new  seats or packing the Senate by handing out new statehood to one  individual city.   I said it a few months ago. Today's Democrats have lost patience with  playing by the rules and want to wage war on the rule book itself. They  are saying as much out loud.   Perhaps our colleagues think promising a shameless power grab is the  only way to energize their radical, far-left base, but the real  effect--the real effect--is to make the stakes in these issues  completely and totally clear to the American people.   The Framers designed the Senate to be the country's firewall against  ill-considered and radical change. That is what the Senate was all  about in the beginning. If our Democratic friends have concluded their  worst ideas could never clear the high bar--if they think their ideas  could never clear the high bar, it is their bad ideas that need to be  scrapped, not the core checks and balances of our government.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, the confirmation vote with  respect to the Scarsi nomination occur at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow; further,  if cloture is invoked on the Blumenfeld nomination, the postcloture  time with respect to the Blumenfeld nomination expire at 2:15 p.m.  tomorrow, the Senate vote on confirmation of the nomination, and  following disposition of the Blumenfeld nomination, the Senate vote on  the motions to invoke cloture on the Holcomb and Robinson nominations  in the order listed; further, if cloture is invoked on the Holcomb  nomination, the postcloture time with respect to the nomination expire  at 5:15 p.m. tomorrow and the Senate vote on the confirmation of the  nomination.

Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:45 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, September 15, 2020, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
