 Madam Speaker, I rise for a point of personal privilege  to address the House for 5 minutes.    Madam Speaker, I rise to address what happened in this  Chamber today and where do we go from here.   The violence, destruction, and chaos we saw earlier was unacceptable,  undemocratic, and un-American. It was the saddest day I have ever had  serving as a Member of this institution.   The Capitol was in chaos. Police officers were attacked. Guns were  drawn on this very floor. A woman tragically lost her life.   No one wins when this building and what it stands for are destroyed.  America, and this institution, is better than that.   We saw the worst of America this afternoon. Yet, in the midst of  violence and fear, we also saw the best of America.   It starts with our law enforcement--the Capitol Police, the National  Guard, the FBI, and the Secret Service--who faced the most difficult  challenges but did their duty with confidence and strength. Many  of them are injured right now.    It also extends to this Chamber, where both Democrats and Republicans  showed courage, calm, and resolve.   I would like to recognize the Members now who helped to hold the  line: Markwayne Mullin, Tony Gonzales, Jason Crow, Pat Fallon, and Troy  Nehls. Working with the Capitol Police, they ensured the floor of this  Chamber was never breached. These are the heroes among us. Thank you  for the show of courage.   Looking back on the past few hours, it is clear this Congress will  not be the same after today, and I hope it will be the better. I hope  not just this institution, but I hope every American pauses for that  moment and thinks among themselves that we can disagree with one  another but not dislike each other; we can respect the voices of  others.   There are many times we debate in this body, and we should. There are  many times we can get heated. I still consider Steny Hoyer a very good  friend. There are times I get upset, and I will call him at home to  express the things I may not see fair or just, but that is the way we  should handle things.   The majority leader is right: We are all Americans first.   But we should also think for a moment: What do we put on social  media? What do we convey to one another? Just because you have a  personal opinion different than mine, you have a right to say it, but  nobody has a right to become a mob. And we all should stand united in  condemning the mob together.   We solve problems before our Nation, not through destruction, but  through debate. That is the heart of this democracy. I know what we  debate today is tough, but it is just; it is right.   This isn't the first side of the aisle that has ever debated this  issue. I thought of what Madam Speaker said back in 2005, ``this is  democracy at its best,'' when they talked about a Presidential election  in Ohio.   These are the moments that we should raise the issue about integrity  and accountability and accuracy in our elections. But you know what we  should do, the next difference? Not just raise the issue, but work  together to solve the problems.   Now is the moment to show America we can work best together. I will  tell you, the size of the majority is slim, so it gives us the  opportunity to make that happen. The only thing that can hold us back  is the will of one another to do it.   This side of the aisle always believes in working with anybody who  wants to move it forward. That does not mean that we are going to agree  100 percent of the time. That does not mean our voice cannot be heard.  That does not mean we cannot be treated fairly; we should be. That may  mean on the size of committees, that means on our ability to offer an  amendment, that means on our ability to have our voice. But at the end  of the day, it helps us come to a better conclusion.   By returning here to complete the work we were sent to do, we are  proving that our democracy cannot be disrupted by criminal behavior. We  will not falter; we will not bend; and we will not shrink from our  duty.   Let me be very clear: Mobs don't rule America. Laws rule America. It  was true when our cities were burning this summer, and it is true now.   When Americans go to bed tonight, their lasting memory should not be  a Congress overrun by rioters. It must be a resolute Congress  conducting healthy debate.   We may disagree on a lot in America, but tonight we should show the  world that we will respectfully, but thoroughly, carry out the most  basic duties of democracy.   We will continue with the task that we have been sent here to do. We  will follow the Constitution and the law and the process for hearing  valid concerns about election integrity. We will do it with respect.                                time  2130    We will respect your opinion, we will respect what you say, and we  are willing to listen to it. I think the Nation will be better for it  on both sides of the aisle. Let's show the country the mob did not win.  We have a job to do. Let's do it with pride and let's be better when  the sun rises tomorrow.
