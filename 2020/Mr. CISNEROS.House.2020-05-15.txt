 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the HEROES Act. The  mayors and local leaders in California's 39th and across America are  asking for Congress to help their cities and towns. The HEROES Act will  do that by providing $870 billion in direct funding to States, cities,  and counties, and it will give them the flexibility to use the funding  where it can do the most good.   This is what our leaders in the 39th are asking for, because it will  allow them to maintain crucial programs and adequately fund public  safety in order to protect our citizens.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
