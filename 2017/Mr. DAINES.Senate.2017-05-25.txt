 Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct  honor of recognizing William ``Bill'' Ausmus of Hardin, a World War II  Army veteran who celebrated his 100th birthday earlier this month. Bill  has been involved with a variety of community organizations in Big Horn  County for many years, helping countless Montanans along the way. His  accomplishments are something we can all celebrate.   After his World War II military service concluded, Bill spent almost  seven decades serving in his local American Legion Post 8 and remained  in an active capacity with the post into his nineties. His professional  vocation was serving as the Big Horn County surveyor and, for a time,  the assessor. These vital positions afforded him the opportunity to  interact with and provide useful help to many in his local community.  Bill developed a reputation for accuracy and customer service in his  professional work. He was also integral in the formation of his local  Methodist Church and is known for his volunteerism and generous  donations to community projects and causes.   The longevity of his many endeavors and willingness to help others  along the way serves as an inspiration to us all. When looking back  through the history of Big Horn County during the past century, it is  clear that Bill has been key contributor. Congratulations, Bill, on  your recent 100th birthday, and thank you for your service.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.

A bill to preserve State, local, and tribal authorities and  private property rights with respect to unmanned aircraft systems, and  for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and  Transportation.    Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the  commitment to duty and personal courage of three Montanans by  introducing a bill to redesignate three Department of Veterans Affairs  facilities in their honor. Through their distinguished service to our  Nation, the actions of these three gentlemen have earned the respect  and gratitude of the Treasure State.   Under this resolution, the Community Based Outpatient Clinic on  Palmer Street in Missoula will be designated in honor of David J.  Thatcher. Mr. Thatcher was an outstanding Montanan. The humble  circumstances of his upbringing in rural, eastern Montana helped him  develop a strong work ethic. In 1940, with war raging across Europe and  the clouds of war on the horizon for the United States, he enlisted in  the U.S. Army Air Corps.   Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, he volunteered to serve as a  tail gunner for a high risk mission to attack targets deep within  Japanese controlled territory. This counterattack would be known to  history as the Doolittle Raid. After finishing the bombing mission and  running low on fuel, his aircraft crash landed near the coast of China.  Mr. Thatcher was instrumental in helping the crew reach safety  following the crash and for his actions during the Doolittle Raid, he  was awarded the Silver Star. A few years later, the actor Robert Walker  portrayed Corporal Thatcher on the silver screen in ``Thirty Seconds  Over Tokyo.'' After the war, Mr. Thatcher embarked on a career with the  U.S. Postal Service and married his sweetheart Dawn. Their marriage  spanned seven decades until he passed away last June at the age of 94.   In Billings, the Community Based Outpatient Clinic on Spring Creek  Lane will be designated in honor of Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow. Dr.  Medicine Crow was an accomplished warrior and esteemed historian. He  was born on the Crow Indian Reservation in eastern Montana and traveled  across the U.S. while pursuing his education. In 1939, Dr. Medicine  Crow earned his master's degree from the University of Southern  California, becoming the first member of the Crow Tribe to attain that  credential. In 1943 he joined the United States Army. While serving as  an Army scout during World War II, Dr. Medicine Crow fulfilled the four  requirements to become a war chief. While fighting against the German  forces he led a war party, stole an enemy horse, disarmed an enemy, and  touched an enemy without killing him. Later in life he served as the  Crow tribal historian, received multiple honorary doctorate degrees,  and spoke at venues across the Nation. He was the last Crow war chief,  and his passing last April, at the age of 102, was a loss to our  Nation. For his lifetime of service to the Crow Tribe, the State of  Montana, and to United States, Dr. Medicine Crow was awarded the  Presidential Medal of Freedom.   The Billings Community Based Specialty Clinic located on Majestic  Lane will be designated in honor of Benjamin Charles Steele. Mr. Steele  is remembered by Montanans as a ranch hand, teacher, artist, and Bataan  Death March survivor. Born and raised in Montana, he joined the U.S.  Army Air Corps in 1940. After he was captured by the Japanese, Mr.  Steele's sturdy fortitude helped him endure a 66-mile trek in the  Philippines, a prisoner ship, and a forced labor camp. He was a  prisoner of war in the Pacific Theater of World War II for a total of  1,244 days. Using charcoal to sketch on concrete, he withstood the  harsh treatment in captivity and honed his artistic talents. His  artistic expressions were captured on contraband paper, and some of the  works he created in captivity were preserved and went on tour through  the Nation after the war. In August of last year, we lost a warrior- artist when Mr. Steele passed away at his home in Montana at the age of  98.   The World War II generation produced many heroes. In 2016, Montana  lost three of our greatest heroes when Thatcher, Medicine Crow and  Steele completed their earthly tours of duty. In 2017 it is fitting  that we honor their service and their remarkable lives by naming three  Veterans Affairs facilities in their honor. Each generation of veterans  using these facilities will help keep their memories alive. Their  unique stories will inspire the future generation of warriors to defend  our  [[Page S3222]]  Nation and preserve our cherished individual liberties.

The amendments made by this Act shall take effect on       October 1, 2017.                                  ______    Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the  commitment to duty and personal courage of three Montanans by  introducing a bill to redesignate three Department of Veterans Affairs  facilities in their honor. Through their distinguished service to our  Nation, the actions of these three gentlemen have earned the respect  and gratitude of the Treasure State.   Under this resolution, the Community Based Outpatient Clinic on  Palmer Street in Missoula will be designated in honor of David J.  Thatcher. Mr. Thatcher was an outstanding Montanan. The humble  circumstances of his upbringing in rural, eastern Montana helped him  develop a strong work ethic. In 1940, with war raging across Europe and  the clouds of war on the horizon for the United States, he enlisted in  the U.S. Army Air Corps.   Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, he volunteered to serve as a  tail gunner for a high risk mission to attack targets deep within  Japanese controlled territory. This counterattack would be known to  history as the Doolittle Raid. After finishing the bombing mission and  running low on fuel, his aircraft crash landed near the coast of China.  Mr. Thatcher was instrumental in helping the crew reach safety  following the crash and for his actions during the Doolittle Raid, he  was awarded the Silver Star. A few years later, the actor Robert Walker  portrayed Corporal Thatcher on the silver screen in ``Thirty Seconds  Over Tokyo.'' After the war, Mr. Thatcher embarked on a career with the  U.S. Postal Service and married his sweetheart Dawn. Their marriage  spanned seven decades until he passed away last June at the age of 94.   In Billings, the Community Based Outpatient Clinic on Spring Creek  Lane will be designated in honor of Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow. Dr.  Medicine Crow was an accomplished warrior and esteemed historian. He  was born on the Crow Indian Reservation in eastern Montana and traveled  across the U.S. while pursuing his education. In 1939, Dr. Medicine  Crow earned his master's degree from the University of Southern  California, becoming the first member of the Crow Tribe to attain that  credential. In 1943 he joined the United States Army. While serving as  an Army scout during World War II, Dr. Medicine Crow fulfilled the four  requirements to become a war chief. While fighting against the German  forces he led a war party, stole an enemy horse, disarmed an enemy, and  touched an enemy without killing him. Later in life he served as the  Crow tribal historian, received multiple honorary doctorate degrees,  and spoke at venues across the Nation. He was the last Crow war chief,  and his passing last April, at the age of 102, was a loss to our  Nation. For his lifetime of service to the Crow Tribe, the State of  Montana, and to United States, Dr. Medicine Crow was awarded the  Presidential Medal of Freedom.   The Billings Community Based Specialty Clinic located on Majestic  Lane will be designated in honor of Benjamin Charles Steele. Mr. Steele  is remembered by Montanans as a ranch hand, teacher, artist, and Bataan  Death March survivor. Born and raised in Montana, he joined the U.S.  Army Air Corps in 1940. After he was captured by the Japanese, Mr.  Steele's sturdy fortitude helped him endure a 66-mile trek in the  Philippines, a prisoner ship, and a forced labor camp. He was a  prisoner of war in the Pacific Theater of World War II for a total of  1,244 days. Using charcoal to sketch on concrete, he withstood the  harsh treatment in captivity and honed his artistic talents. His  artistic expressions were captured on contraband paper, and some of the  works he created in captivity were preserved and went on tour through  the Nation after the war. In August of last year, we lost a warrior- artist when Mr. Steele passed away at his home in Montana at the age of  98.   The World War II generation produced many heroes. In 2016, Montana  lost three of our greatest heroes when Thatcher, Medicine Crow and  Steele completed their earthly tours of duty. In 2017 it is fitting  that we honor their service and their remarkable lives by naming three  Veterans Affairs facilities in their honor. Each generation of veterans  using these facilities will help keep their memories alive. Their  unique stories will inspire the future generation of warriors to defend  our  [[Page S3222]]  Nation and preserve our cherished individual liberties.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1282         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
