 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about rising inflation  and the burden this is having on American taxpayers.   President Biden promised not to raise taxes on middle-class  Americans, but the rising price of essentials like groceries, gas, and  appliances are making our paychecks worth less.   Gas prices are up 45.1 percent.   In my home State of California, gas is more than $1 higher than the  national average. We already pay some of the highest taxes in the  country.   And make no mistake, this inflation is a hidden tax on every single  American.   Despite these rising costs that American families are paying the  price for, President Biden has insisted that the solution is to spend  trillions more.   American families are going to continue feeling the consequences as  long as President Biden's reckless tax-and-spending spree continues. We  need to rein in spending and lower taxes for  [[Page H3826]]  those we serve, not spend trillions and leave future generations in  debt.                            ____________________
