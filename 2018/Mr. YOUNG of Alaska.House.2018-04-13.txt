 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewomen from Hawaii  (Mses. Hanabusa and Gabbard). I am privileged to stand on this floor  because of them and honor, to me, a great friend.   I know that we are saying we are honoring Senator Danny Akaka, or  Daniel. I would like to refer him to the higher body as Congressman  Akaka.   Thirteen years we served together. I have never found a gentleman, as  you said before, one that loved and remembers better than he.   He worked with me, and I probably knew Danny better than anybody  else. I call him Danny because we were friends. I knew him probably  better than anybody else because his locker was right next to mine down  in the gym.                                time  1315    We would have conversations about Alaska and about Hawaii, and how we  worked together with Danny Inouye, Senator Stevens, and myself. It was  a marvelous combination. And I believe that Alaskan combination with  Hawaii still exists today because of the two congressional ladies. We  work together. We have a unique difference from all of the other  States.   We are not contiguous to the big body of the United States. We are  actually scattered far north and far west, but we work together.  Although they have a tropical climate and we have a frozen climate, we  have the comradeship that is necessary to work together, and we  continue to do that.   Danny was a soldier, a teacher, and, yes, a great Congressman. I will  tell you that the people of Hawaii will miss him, but I hope he has  left a legacy that will continue to encourage young people to become  involved in the political arena to try to solve problems.   I can't agree more with what was said by the previous speaker about  the lack of aloha, the lack of recognition for one another in  differences of opinion. I do not think that you can accuse me of that  because I recognize each person elected in this House is elected by  730,000 people, and they represent those people. So recognize and  respect the beliefs, but work out and solve problems. Danny did that.   All the time that we worked together, there was never a Democratic  problem or a Republican problem. There was a problem, and we would  reach across the aisle, one another, with all of the chairmen that  served together collectively, and we would solve those problems. We  were able to legislate.   Somewhere along the line, the well was poisoned, and we no longer  legislate. I think Danny would be deeply disturbed by that. I think he  would wish us greater things. I believe he would understand that it is  time for us to work together as a nation.   I am proud to say that we still work together as Alaskans and  Hawaiians trying to solve those areas where problems exist in no other  place in the United States, and we do work together to solve them and  we do get it achieved.   Now, if we can just do that, maybe we ought to send the rest of the  Congress to Hawaii in the wintertime and bring the rest of them to  Alaska in the summertime, and everybody would love one another and we  would get a lot more done.   So, again, it was mentioned about Millie, his wife, and his family,  and he would be proud.   There are great people in our history, and I can tell you, I  considered Danny Akaka, Senator or Congressman, as one of the greater  ones. As we know, he is gone, and I know he will be looking upon what  we can achieve if we actually aloha one another.
