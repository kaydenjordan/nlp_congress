 Madam Speaker, right now, we are in the season where  folks are deciding where to go to college. A big factor in that  decision is their financial aid package.   The skyrocketing cost of college is saddling many with outrageous  student loan debt. The crippling debt of student loans is reaching  $1.56 trillion among 45 million borrowers. It is causing people to  delay homeownership, raising a family, and moving comfortably into the  middle class.   I have introduced the Understanding the True Cost of College Act. It  is to help students and families make informed decisions about  financing their education and their future by requiring the  standardization of communications and the definitions of financial aid  terms.   It is in the best interest of our country to start addressing this  issue in a bipartisan way.  [[Page H3913]]                                ____________________
