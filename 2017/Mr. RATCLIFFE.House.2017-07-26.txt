 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division C (before the short title) insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to propose, plan for, or execute a new or additional       Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Dent and the ranking  member for their hard work on behalf of the 63,000 veterans in my  district, as well as servicemembers and veterans from all across the  country.   I am also grateful for the support of Congressman Shuster in offering  this amendment, an amendment which would simply prohibit any funds made  available in this division from being used to propose, plan for, or  execute a new or additional round of base realignment and closure, or  BRAC.   Mr. Chairman, I am honored to represent the Fourth Congressional  District of Texas, which is home to the Red River Army Depot. The Depot  has supported the warfighter since 1941. Although the Depot community  has weathered a lot of changes over the years, their commitment to  mission has always remained the same. On the placards inside each  vehicle there are the words: ``We build it as if our lives depend on  it. Theirs do.''   The Red River Army Depot is a vital job creator for northeast Texas  and my district, and it is a critical component to our national  defense. And as we continue our constitutional obligation to  appropriate money, we have to be careful stewards of taxpayer dollars,  and focus our limited resources on addressing the critical national  security objectives and military readiness.   Having another round of BRAC, Mr. Chairman, won't help us achieve  this goal. According to the Government Accountability Office, the last  round of BRAC in 2005 actually cost the American taxpayers $35.1  billion, which is 67 percent more than the original cost estimate. At  the same time, the expected savings from the last round of BRAC have  been reduced by 73 percent.   Starting another BRAC would weaken our capabilities, and it would  increase our vulnerability in the face of critical threats that face  this Nation right now.   I thank my colleagues who have supported this important amendment for  the past 2 years, and I look forward to having this amendment included  in this year's Military Construction and VA Appropriations bill.    I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for accepting the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Florida is recognized for 5  minutes.   Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I, like many Members, have  concerns regarding another round of BRAC. I realize that this is a  complicated issue for all Members of Congress, especially those with  military facilities in their congressional districts.   I have had this conversation with my chairman, Mr. Dent, several  times. And while we both share the concerns of those Members with  military bases in their district and other military facilities, the  gentleman is right. We are going to need to address that we have  facilities all across the country that really need to be evaluated  because they are, essentially, maintaining infrastructure that is no  longer needed.   For example, the estimate of excess capacity for the Army is 22  percent. The Air Force's estimate of excess capacity is roughly 30  percent. Both the Army and the Air Force are strong supporters of  another BRAC round.   While this amendment really has no effect because we don't actually  have any funding in this bill for another BRAC round, it does send the  message that Congress is unwilling to tackle what is arguably a tough  issue.   This amendment would be, essentially, an abdication of our duties as  Members of this House to ensure that taxpayer resources are being used  in a wise and fiscally responsible way, and  [[Page H6423]]  that is something that we hear from our friends on the other side of  the aisle regularly.   And given that we have a very significant increase in the defense  appropriations bill, when we have resources that we are expending or,  essentially, wasting by not having a BRAC round, then we are,  essentially, leaving that money on the table when we could provide it  for our national defense.   So I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. And I recognize  that the chairman is willing to accept it, but we should underscore  that there are no funds in this bill for a round of BRAC, so,  essentially, the acceptance of this amendment adopts the same posture  that this bill already holds.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe).   The amendment was agreed to.                     Amendment No. 21 Offered by Mr. Brat    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 21  printed in House Report 115-259.
