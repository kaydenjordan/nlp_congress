 Madam Chairwoman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan and the gentlewoman from  California for sponsoring this amendment. This is needed.   I just want to remind this body of a couple statements. One was made  by Attorney Emmet Flood talking about what took place with the  President of the United States, and he said this:         We would all do well to remember, if it can happen--talking       about the FISA issue--if it can happen to a President,       imagine what they can do to you and I. Imagine what they can       do to you and I. We need reform in this program.    Second, Chuck Schumer. When the leader in this Congress, leader in  the Senate was on the Rachel Maddow Show on January 3 talking about  what took place with the President----    Madam Chair, Mr. Schumer said this, about the President.  He said: ``Let me tell you: You take on the intelligence community-- they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.''   That is not how it is supposed to work in this country. That is not  how it is supposed to work. The unelected people answer to the elected  individual. This is about reforming this program, making sure it  respects our fundamental liberties. I respect the gentleman for  bringing the amendment forward.
