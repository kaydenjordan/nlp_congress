 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor Dr. Don Harp, who passed away on April 20 at the  age of 82.   Dr. Harp was born in Inman, Georgia, where he had a humble upbringing  as a farmer. He went on to become a baseball star and student leader at  Young Harris College and Huntington College. He was also dedicated in  his pursuit of ministry, going on to earn a doctorate from the  McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago.   Dr. Harp's accolades are impressive, but his greatest legacy was his  gift of connecting with people. He could always find good in any  situation and gave unselfishly to his alma mater and friends.   As a husband, father, and grandfather, many say that his greatest  love was his family, and those who knew him best know his greatest love  was also the Lord.   Mr. Speaker, I had the honor and privilege of serving with Dr. Harp  on the Young Harris College board of trustees. Don Harp loved Young  Harris College, and Young Harris College loved Don Harp.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all who  knew him during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
