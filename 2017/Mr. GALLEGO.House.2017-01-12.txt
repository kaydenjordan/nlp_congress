 Mr. Speaker, I am a marine, just like James Mattis.  While I was a grunt and he was a general, we both fought in Iraq. He is  a man of social integrity and patriotism.   War shows the character of military leaders. Marines who served under  Mattis in Iraq speak in glowing terms about his strength, intelligence,  and ability.   Mr. Speaker, it is with sadness that I rise this evening to oppose  legislation that would allow General Mattis to serve as our 26th  Secretary of Defense. This might seem contradictory. It might appear  partisan or unpatriotic. In fact, the opposite is true.   My position is entirely straightforward, Mr. Speaker. When it comes  to something as basic as civilian control of the military, I believe  exceptions should be granted for extraordinary circumstances, not  extraordinary people.   For more than half a century, recently retired military leaders have  been barred from assuming the top post at the Pentagon. The Members of  Congress who enshrined this prohibition in law had fresh memories of  the Second World War. They are wary of a decorated general slipping off  his uniform and immediately stepping into a civilian role. They were  apprehensive about installing a Secretary of Defense who could be  perceived as partial to one service over others. They are also worried  about whether the reputation of our military as a nonpartisan  institution would suffer if its most respected leaders could transition  directly into political positions.   The last time a recently retired military man, the great George  Marshall, was permitted to lead the Pentagon, America was facing the  prospect of a humiliating defeat in the Korean war. Even then,  congressional leaders specified that his waiver was a one-time  exception to the rule.   While our country must confront an array of threats today, none of  our national security challenges remotely compares to a massive ground  war in the Far East.   Mr. Speaker, I understand that many of my colleagues are eager to  grant this waiver because they greeted the announcement of Mattis'  appointment with a sigh of relief, a sigh of relief because it meant  Donald Trump had picked someone who is known to be competent and  patriotic, and someone who doesn't have a cozy relationship with the  Russian Government.   That is an understandable reaction, and we are all extremely  confident that General Mattis will do a much better job than General  Flynn or some of the other alternatives.   We shouldn't let Trump's bad behavior and poor judgment compel  Congress to lower the bar. If anything, we should raise the bar for  Trump, not make exceptions just because we are glad he didn't go with  someone like Flynn.   Mr. Speaker, a simple set of rules and norms form the fabric of  American democracy. Since the founding of the Republic, leaders of  every party and political persuasion have upheld this basic framework.  For generations, American leaders have placed principle before party.   With remarkably few exceptions, Presidents from George Washington to  Barack Obama have valued our institutions and our democracy more than  private gain or personal advancement. Now, Mr. Speaker, we have a  President-elect who doesn't think the rules should apply to him. We  have a President-elect who is brazenly breaking norms left and right.  We have a President-elect who promises to make America great again, but  is dividing the country as never before.   Here in the United States, we believe every American is entitled to  equal justice under the law. But Donald Trump believes that a different  set of rules should apply to him than apply to President Obama or  President Bush or any of the other men who have held our highest  office.   Unlike his predecessors, Donald Trump has stubbornly refused to  release his tax returns. Unlike his predecessors, Donald Trump has  irresponsibly meddled in our foreign relations throughout the  transition. Unlike his predecessors, Trump has done nothing to diminish  massive conflicts of interest stemming from his complex business  dealings overseas.   Yet, instead of applying a check on this pattern of reckless  behavior, House Republicans have rolled over time and time again.   Mr. Speaker, the Republicans won't stand up to a President entering  office with just a 37 percent approval rating because it is precisely  that 37 percent of the public that scares them. In fact, that 37  percent has terrified them for 8 long years. It scared them into  turning a blind eye to the racist birther conspiracy theories. It  scared them into shutting down the Federal Government. That 37 percent  even scared them into risking a debt limit default which would have  immediately triggered an unprecedented economic meltdown.   Mr. Speaker, we need a President like Barack Obama who looks out for  100 percent of the American people. We need a President like Barack  Obama who abides by 100 percent of the rules. We need a House majority  that is willing to uphold its constitutional obligations 100 percent of  the time.   Moving forward in this Congress, the power to check Donald Trump is  in Republican hands and depends on Republican votes, but they have been  too scared, too cowed, and too unwilling to do what these tough times  demand.   If we, the Members of this great body, won't stand up for the norms  that have sustained this Republic for 238 years, then who will?   General Mattis is a patriot, but now is the time for all of us in  this Chamber to reiterate a basic truth in a democracy--rules matter.  They shouldn't be discarded at the first sign of difficulty. They  shouldn't be undercut by waivers. Important precedents must be upheld  in good times and bad.   This is America, Mr. Speaker, not some banana republic where the  incoming strongman gets to rewrite the rule  [[Page H468]]  book. Our principles are enduring. Our values are timeless. For more  than two centuries, our commitment to the rule of law has been  unshakable. That is why we should reject this waiver. That is why we  must hold Donald Trump to the same high standards as all of the 43  Presidents who came before him.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
