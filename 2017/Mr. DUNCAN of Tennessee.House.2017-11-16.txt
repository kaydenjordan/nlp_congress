 Mr. Speaker, my late father was the ranking  Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee when the last tax  reform was passed in 1986. I know personally how difficult it was then  to bring all the competing interests together. Everything looks easy  from a distance.   Everyone in this Congress would write a slightly different tax bill  if given the chance to do so, but we can't have 535 different tax  bills. Even Chairman Brady would probably change some things if he had  complete control over it. I would favor some slight differences, but  this is a great bill, overall, for middle-income people. We need to do  more in the future to cut spending along with it.   Kevin Brady is the right man at the right time. I think he has done a  masterful job in bringing this bill to the floor. No other bill will do  more to help keep jobs in this country. No other bill we can pass in  this Congress would do more to help more people than this one will.   I urge the bill's passage.
