 Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago, the Supreme Court rolled  back a fundamental individual freedom in overturning Roe v. Wade. Now,  abortion care is inaccessible in 14 States and heavily restricted in  many others, with one in three women now living in States without  access to abortion. That is unacceptable.   In restricting access, States are forcing women to seek dangerous  alternatives, undermining women's health and safety. Women should have  the freedom to make their own decisions about their health, not State  legislatures or the Federal Government.   At this critical moment, my Democratic colleagues and I are taking  action, despite the objections of Speaker McCarthy and the extremists  in his  [[Page H3076]]  party, to force a floor vote on the Women's Health Protection Act,  which would make Roe the law of the land.   I am thankful for the work of the Healey administration in my home  State to protect Massachusetts residents' healthcare, but I will not  stop fighting until women across the country have the same protections  to access safe and effective reproductive healthcare.                            ____________________
