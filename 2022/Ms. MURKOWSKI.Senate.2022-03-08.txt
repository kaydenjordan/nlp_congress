 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak in  support of the Postal Service Reform Act, which is now pending before  the Senate.   The mission of the U.S. Postal Service since the Continental Congress  appointed Benjamin Franklin as our Nation's first Postmaster General in  1775 has been to ``bind the Nation together.''   So it sounds kind of like a pretty quaint, outdated idea, but it is  actually serious; it is actually statutory.   And 39 U.S.C. tasks the Postal Service with binding our Nation  together by delivering all of our mail to every American promptly,  reliably, and efficiently, no matter where we live.   The Postal Service Reform Act will improve the Agency's ability to  meet that requirement, including in large, geographically remote  places, like Alaska, where it certainly has a significant impact on our  lives.   We count on the Postal Service to deliver not only the letters and  the magazines and the bills, but also necessities of life: food,  medicine, business inventory, spare parts. Just about anything you  could possibly think of for daily life comes to us in Alaska through  the mail service.   The Postal Service is unique in its universal service obligation and  the fact that it delivers both mail and packages to Americans in every  community, whether you live in Key West, FL, or Utqiagvik, AK. No other  Federal Agency or commercial enterprise does this.   But it is becoming more and more difficult for the Postal Service to  accomplish the swift completion of their appointed rounds, as we  recall.   And believe me, I certainly hear about the Postal Service's  decreasing ability to provide its services promptly, reliably, and  efficiently. I hear about it as soon as I get off the airplane when I  get back home. I hear from individuals all over the State, telling me  the concerns that they have about mail that is late or perhaps not  delivered at all.   Our phones ring in our offices around the State because a small post  office has been closed for a period of days because the postmaster has  left, and there is no replacement available.   I hear about the long lines to pick up mail, the long lines to just  even buy a stamp in some of our smaller communities that get inundated  by tourists in the summer.   So we know. We hear the strains on our Postal Service. Despite postal  workers' dedication, the fact of the matter is that the Agency is in  trouble, and it needs the reforms that are contained in the bill that  is pending before us.   While many Americans believe the Postal Service is supported by the  American taxpayer, that is not the case. Congress only reimburses it  for mailing audio books to the blind and ballots to overseas voters.  That is it.   The Postal Service has to meet its payroll and fund retiree health  benefits; maintain its facilities, equipment, and vehicles; deliver the  mail to its destination on time with its own revenue from the sale of  postage. But their financial instability is making those  responsibilities harder and harder to fulfill.   So we are debating this legislation on the floor today to give the  Postal Service the tools that it needs to be successful and to fulfill  its essential mission and to hold the USPS accountable for improved  performance because we all want to see that.   So this legislation that we will hopefully vote on later today is not  without controversy. Reform legislation is never without controversy,  but that is why I appreciate the opportunity to outline what I think  are some of the positive provisions.   Importantly, the bill increases the Postal Service's accountability  for on-time delivery and requires greater transparency in achieving the  goal. The bill requires that mail delivery not only be prompt and  economical but also consistent and reliable and provided in a manner  that increases operational efficiency.   It requires the USPS to develop a new, searchable public performance  dashboard that is updated weekly so both Congress and the public can  keep a close eye on whether or not they are living up to our  expectations.   It also requires new regular reporting to the Postal Regulatory  Commission, the PRC, and to Congress on a variety of indicators,  including the impacts of price changes and information about  reliability, efficiency, and cost effectiveness, Postal workforce  recruitment and retention, and how investments in equipment and  infrastructure are impacting service.   In addition, the PRC and the Postal Service's inspector general must  identify why there are inefficiencies in the collection, sorting,  transportation, and delivery of large envelopes, newsletters, and  magazines.   These findings will be reported to Congress and the Postmaster  General. USPS would then have 6 months to put in place PRC-approved  changes that will fix whatever faults may have been found.   The bill will also do what many of us have advocated for, which is  reform the cost of healthcare for USPS employees and their retirees.   So it provides needed stabilization for the USPS health benefits  system, and, hopefully, it will relieve the pressure on their budget  and support sustainable benefits for employees and retirees. This is a  key provision.    The bill also codifies an appropriations rider that has long required  the USPS to integrate the delivery of letters and packages for 6-day  delivery and includes a fair compromise on the attribution of costs for  processing and delivering packages.   One of the--I guess--top complaints that I hear from Alaskans is that  the cost of shipping via commercial package services is oftentimes more  than the price of the item itself. Integrated delivery of mail and  packages saves the U.S. Postal Service money by allowing it to be more  efficient.   And while UPS and FedEx charge most Alaskans extra for delivering  their packages, these companies then drop their packages off in  Anchorage at that hub and let the Postal Service take care of what we  call last mile delivery. Well, in Alaska, that often means the last  several hundred miles.   Now, some are concerned that USPS subsidizes the cost of packages  with revenue derived from delivering letters. But in fact, the law that  we passed in 2006, the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act,  forbids the Postal Service from cross-subsidizing revenue to make sure  that it is competing fairly with commercial package carriers.   Current law also requires that package delivery covers all of its  attributable costs, and while the Postal Regulatory Commission and the  Federal courts have examined and upheld the cost attribution  methodology, the Postal Service Reform Act requires yet another look,  which I think is probably a fair compromise.   Importantly for Alaskans and for me, this legislation will not result  in cost increases for the essential bypass mail program. This is what  it says it is. It is essential. It is a program that allows rural  Alaskans who live in communities that are not connected by roads--about  80 percent of our communities are in that situation--but allows them to  receive pallets of food, whatever necessary mailable matter that comes  from stores in Anchorage or Fairbanks, without millions of individual  boxes of goods going through Postal facilities. And that benefits the  consumer, and it saves the Postal Service tens of millions of dollars a  year in operating costs and untold millions in facility costs.   While the Postal Service Reform Act directs the PRC to engage in  another review of attributable costs, I have  [[Page S1029]]  been assured by both sides of the Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs Committee, by the PRC, and by the Postal Service that this  provision will not impact bypass mail, and I certainly intend to hold  them to their word.   Another concern that I want to address over this bill is allowing  USPS to partner with State, local, and Tribal governments to provide  nonpostal services. Now, I understand where this comes from, but this  legislation specifically requires that any nonpostal services must  cover their own costs without any degradation to regular Postal  services.   So, in my view, if the U.S. Postal Service can help deliver  additional services to the American public under these two caveats,  then they should be allowed to do so.   So H.R. 3076 is a big step forward in helping the Postal Service  achieve financial stability. It will enable the Agency to continue to  bind the Nation together with efficient and cost-effective universal  service and allow postal employees to achieve the swift completion of  their appointed rounds. It is supported by a wide array of businesses,  both large and small, all who rely on our Postal Service. It is  supported by Postal employees, by retired Federal employees, and the  Postal Service itself.   It has received overwhelming bipartisan support in the House of  Representatives. I certainly hope that it will draw the same here in  the Senate, and I want to commend the chairman of the Committee on  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, as well as Ranking Member  Portman, for the good work that they have done in bringing this bill to  us today.   (Ms. ROSEN assumed the Chair.)                          International Women's Day    Madam President, now, while I am still here on the floor, I want to  take just a moment and acknowledge that today, March 8, marks  International Women's Day.   This is a day for us to recognize the achievements and the  contributions that women are making in communities across the globe,  and, as an Alaskan, I am going to start local first, because I have got  so many, many phenomenal women in my State who are doing incredible  things, and I am exceptionally proud of them.   I was home over the weekend. We were celebrating the start of the  50th running of the Iditarod race. This is an extraordinary feat of  just strength and grit and determination and resilience.   There were 49 mushers that left Willow on Sunday; 17 of those mushers  who will make the trek to Nome are women--17 women. So we have got a  very, very strong field, but running a race like this, where it is the  musher and your team of dogs going through the wilderness of Alaska--we  have got deep snow throughout. The moose are not in a very cooperative  mood right now. There are dangers along the trail, and who knows what  the conditions are going to be like a week from now. And so it takes an  extraordinary individual.   And to know the strength of women, as they have taken on the  Iditarod--when award-winning or world-renowned winner Susan Butcher  first won that race--she has won that race four times--but when she ran  it about three decades ago, there was a popular bumper sticker that was  going around the State at the time. It was, ``Alaska, where men are men  and women win the Iditarod.'' We were pretty proud of Susan Butcher. We  are hoping that our women do well and all of our mushers do well.   But like these female mushers who are racing, women leaders are  virtually in every field, from healthcare to resource development, to  fishing, to our universities, and everything in between, and many of us  are very proud to know that they have become somewhat household names,  some of them.   This year, we were able to celebrate Emma Broyles, a young woman from  Anchorage, 20 years old. She became the first Alaskan and the first  Korean American to ever be crowned Miss America in the 100-year history  of that event. So we are very proud of her. I was able to celebrate  with her this weekend at the Iditarod itself.   Another young woman that we have celebrated this past year is Lydia  Jacoby. Lydia is from Seward, AK, and at 17, she competed in her first  Olympics. She brought home the gold medal for this country, winning the  100-meter breaststroke race. So we were all eyes on Lydia. So proud of  her.   And there are so many who deserve our thanks and our gratitude. I  always like to give a shout-out to an exceptional leader in our State,  who has provided critical leadership and guidance throughout the  pandemic, Dr. Anne Zink.   It is so important to know that it is not necessarily finishing at  the end of a race or a crown or a medal. It is just the endurance that  goes with the day-to-day completion of your work.   I was on the floor just last month to recognize the work of Native  civil rights advocate Elizabeth Peratrovich, who pushed the Territory  of Alaska, our legislature at the time, to pass the first  antidiscrimination act in the Nation. We did this in 1945. We are so  proud of how she, as a Native woman leader, made our State and our  Nation a more inclusive and more representative democracy.   So, today, on International Women's Day, it gives us an opportunity  to recognize the impressive feats that women have taken on and have  accomplished. It is a day to thank women for their daily  contributions--again, both big, where they win the awards and they make  the headlines, but also for those day-to-day contributions that they  make to raising healthy, strong children, to being the fabric in the  family, to being that contributor in the workplace.   But this isn't a day that we just look back and recognize those who  have made great accomplishments. It is also a day that we look ahead at  the work that we have to do to continue to advance equality and justice  for all women.   Just down the hallway from here in the Rotunda is the Portrait  Monument. We all see it; we walk by it; and maybe we don't even notice  it anymore but take a look at it next time. We know the pioneering  women who are represented on it: Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton,  and Susan B. Anthony.   But we need to look at it more carefully, and we need to remember  there is a fourth bust that Adelaide Johnson did not sculpt, and the  base of the monument is also unfinished. It is a reflection of the  unfinished struggle for women's rights and equality.   So for all the progress that we have made, and we know it has been  considerable, Madam President, as you are sitting in that chair and  this woman from Alaska is addressing you--we have made great progress,  but the struggle is unfinished.   The data documents the gaps in gender equality in our country, and  too many women feel it firsthand in their daily lives. So on  International Women's Day, I also want to remind the Senate of a couple  important ways that we can help further women's rights.   And I am pleased that my colleague Senator Cardin is on the floor at  this moment because we have been working together. We have been working  together to try to do this unfinished business when it comes to  ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, to ensure women's equality  is expressly recognized in our Constitution.   Three-quarters of the States have now ratified that amendment. Alaska  did it back in 1972, Virginia most recently in 2020. I am hopeful that  its time has come.   And to help facilitate that, Senator Cardin and I have introduced a  resolution to remove the arbitrary ratification deadline from the ERA  so it can finally take effect. I think the Senate needs to take this  resolution up and pass it like the House of Representatives did last  year.   Another step--a critical step--that we must take now is the  reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act to help ensure that  there is a path to justice for survivors of interpersonal violence.   I was very proud to introduce the new VAWA bill with Senator Durbin,  Senator Ernst, and Senator Feinstein last month. I am pleased--so  pleased--that we have 22 total cosponsors, 11 from each party.   Our bipartisan bill modernizes the nearly three decades' old Violence  Against Women Act, and it reauthorizes important programs that provide  services to survivors. It directs resources to prevent further violence  and hold perpetrators accountable for their  [[Page S1030]]  actions. And it takes needed and important steps to address domestic  violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking.   I mentioned dating violence. We have a provision that I have included  and we have named after an Alaskan victim of dating violence, and that  is Breanna Moore.   We focused on improving access to medical forensics for victims of  violence, including through training for medical professionals that  will allow them to provide evidence-based and trauma-informed care.   We have a strong Tribal title in this VAWA bill. It builds on VAWA  2013 by closing the gaps in the law to protect Native people. The  Tribal title also includes an Alaska pilot program which provides a  targeted solution to help empower Tribes in a way that recognizes the  unique and complex jurisdictional landscape that we have in my State.  It is a recognition that Tribes are valuable partners. They are  critical partners that can play a larger role in providing public  safety while reducing the burden on my State.   As I have said many times before, there should be nothing--nothing-- partisan about keeping people safe from violence. And our VAWA  reauthorization is a result of many years of hard work and negotiations  by advocates and stakeholders alike. I hope that we can consider this  and pass this very, very soon.   I recognize the great work of Senator Ernst on our side and Senator  Durbin and Senator Feinstein on the other side of the aisle. It has  been an effort that is timely, is needed, and is necessary.   So I am happy to be able to recognize, for just a few moments on this  International Women's Day--as we celebrate the many, many incredible  women in our lives and in our country, we also recognize that our work  for true equality remains unfinished, but we have got some good paths  forward if we can just try.   I yield the floor.
