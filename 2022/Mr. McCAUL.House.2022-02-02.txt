 Mr. Speaker, last year, the CCP's hypersonic weapons  program successfully launched a missile that traveled all the way  around the world. That program was built on the backbone of U.S.  technology.   And as we speak, the Chinese Communist Party is committing genocide  against their own people. Women are forced to abort their children.  Families are ripped apart. And all the while, American IP is being used  to build the CCP's police state to help the CCP surveil and imprison  the ethnic and religious minorities that they torture.   A substantive bill that counters the CCP isn't just a national  security issue; it is a moral issue. That is why any serious  legislation must include export controls to keep U.S. technology out of  the hands of the CCP's military and surveillance state.   The stakes could not be higher, and the outcome hinges on a  technology race. Unfortunately, this bill takes no meaningful step to  address this significant risk to U.S. national security. Instead, it is  a Trojan horse being used to inject $8 billion worth of taxpayer money  into an unaccountable United Nations slush fund.                                time  1445    That is more than double the amount of money authorized for actual  foreign policy programs. This U.N. slush fund has already provided at  least $100 million directly to China, U.S. taxpayer dollars to a  country that this Congress, that the former Republican President and  the current Democrat President have all agreed is committing genocide;  to a country that even Secretary Kerry admitted is using slave labor to  make green energy projects, like solar panels and batteries.   And for some unknown reason, Democrats rejected Republican efforts to  guarantee that the CCP could not access U.S. taxpayer money in this  bill.   But even worse, this legislation could send U.S. taxpayer dollars to  fund green energy projects built on the CCP's genocide program against  its own people, to fund their slave labor, to prop up their forced  abortions.   Shockingly, Republicans attempted to stop this from happening, to  stop U.S. taxpayers from funding slave labor, but we were outright  rejected by the Democrats.   Mr. Speaker, this is a moral issue. It is the test of our time. If we  allow this legislation to pass, we will be on the wrong side of  history. We will be helping the CCP build the future of global energy  on the foundation of slave labor and genocide.   And Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today both angry and  disappointed. This bill could have been the bipartisan crowning  achievement of this Congress and we could have worked together.   We could have shown the American people that when it comes to  generational threats posed by the CCP, that Republicans and Democrats  can put U.S. interests over special interests; that we can put national  security over party politics; that we can put morality over money.   Instead, the gentlewoman from California hijacked this legislation  that was bicameral, bipartisan; hijacked these negotiations, and threw  it together in this legislation that she well knew contained provisions  that Republicans could not support.   In other words, she chose to turn this into a partisan political  stunt. And she did it in secret, behind the backs of Republicans, while  many of us were still negotiating with our Democrat counterparts in  good faith to find a bipartisan agreement.   So, Mr. Speaker, the CCP is the most significant economic and  national security threat the United States faces. The American people  deserved better than this superficial partisan response.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this immoral bill and stand  with me against genocide.
