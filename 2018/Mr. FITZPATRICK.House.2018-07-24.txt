 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two  exceptional members of our community in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who  are working to make life better for homeless youth throughout our  community.   Thois Kiel and Margaret Yaeger, residents of Neshaminy Manor Nursing  Home, both decided to create a community outreach project in order to  give back to those in need. Working together, they knit a large red and  black afghan one square at a time before connecting them and presenting  it to Robert ``Woody'' Wood of the Synergy Project of Bucks County, an  organization that seeks to assist and counsel homeless youth and young  adults.   Mr. Speaker, we commend Thois and Margaret for their compassion for  our community's most vulnerable members and for their work to improve  lives with such a personal touch.   I would also like to thank Neshaminy Manor's assistant director of  activities, Heather O'Donnell, for all of her work in facilitating  outreach projects, and Woody Wood for his work in bettering the lives  of homeless youth in our community.                  Recognizing Backyard Beans Coffee Company     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a small  business in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, that was recently  recognized as Business of the Month by the Lansdale Borough Council.   Backyard Beans Coffee Company started in the backyard of co-owners  Matt and Laura Adams with only a Weber grill and one goal in mind: to  create high-quality, dynamic coffee and coffee products.   Located on West Main Street in Lansdale, Backyard Beans Coffee takes  community responsibility personally and works diligently to ensure it  is using products that are not only sourced responsibly and ethically  but that also promote sustainability.   To date, Backyard Beans' popular roasts, which source beans from  Central America, Africa, South America, and Asia, are sold in nearly  100 restaurants and retail locations, along with regional farmers'  markets.   I applaud Matt and Laura for contributing to an already thriving  community of businesses in Montgomery County, and we congratulate  Backyard Beans Coffee Company on their recognition as Business of the  Month.
