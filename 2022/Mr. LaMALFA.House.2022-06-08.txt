 Mr. Speaker, it is not just American oil and natural gas  energies that are under attack. Another one of the Nation's top sources  of energy, nuclear generation, has faced repeated operational obstacles  and is facing threats of extinction.   Nuclear power is one of the best choices for renewable energy we  have. It is consistent, it runs 24/7, and it isn't intermittent or  dependent on the weather like wind or solar. It takes up a small  physical footprint, such as California's sole remaining reactors at  Diablo Canyon, take up only 900 acres of land and provides nearly 10  percent of California's energy portfolio and 23 percent of our carbon- free generation that everybody is so worried about.   It is affordable. Although power plants are expensive to build, like  most things are, they are relatively cheap to run.   Interestingly, nuclear generation has recently garnered widespread  bipartisan support. Recently, last month, the Biden administration  launched a $6 billion Federal effort to keep nuclear power plants open  that are at risk of closing. Even California Governor Gavin Newsom  seems to have reversed his opinion on nuclear energy and has expressed  some level of support to keep Diablo Canyon open.   Nuclear energy has had an unfair bad rap from past incidents, most  notably Chernobyl. Well, this isn't the 1980s Soviet Union. This is the  United States. We have the innovation and technological advances to  make nuclear energy a cornerstone of our future in energy independence.  We need to hang on to it.                            ____________________
