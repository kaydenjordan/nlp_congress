 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Since President Trump's draconian budget was released, Democrats have  warned Republicans that a bipartisan budget agreement was needed to  adequately invest in American families and communities.   Without a budget agreement, programs as diverse as Head Start, job  training, and terrorism prevention grants are in danger of inadequate  funding at best, yet Republican leadership and the White House have no  appropriations strategy other than endless continuing resolutions.   Mr. Speaker, the most powerful country in the world now being  completely run by a Republican government can't keep the lights on  longer than 4 weeks at a time. How did we get here? If this bill  passes, is there any reason to believe we will not be back in the same  place next month?   Stumbling from one crisis to another is an irresponsible way to  govern. Attempting to avoid a shutdown every month denies Federal  agencies budget certainty and wastes taxpayer dollars.   Several of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have lamented  the damage that the CRs inflict on our military. I agree with them, yet  time after time, they vote for the exact same strategy they bemoan.   I encourage my colleagues to take action; hasten agreements on  immigration and spending caps that would lead to responsible funding  bills that keep Americans safe.   It is also unconscionable that, instead of helping advance a solution  to this impasse, the President personally reneged on his word and  rejected a bipartisan compromise on immigration. Protection of American  teens and young adults from impending deportation to a country they  don't know is the key to unlocking a responsible, bipartisan spending  agreement. How can we expect to ever fund the government responsibly  when the President cannot be trusted to keep his word?   The majority has failed to address a number of high-priority items,  like funding to combat the opioid epidemic, pension protections, and  funding for community health centers.   The continuing resolution lacks an important anomaly requested by the  administration to provide additional disaster loans for the Small  Business Administration while the disaster supplemental is stalled in  the Senate. Without this language, the Small Business Administration  will run out of funds by the end of January and will be unable to  continue approving loan applications from Puerto Rico.   Mr. Speaker, this is not how the appropriations process is supposed  to work. It is time to protect young Americans, lift budget caps, and  allow Chairman Frelinghuysen and all of our committee members to roll  up our sleeves and get to work.   Instead of wasting dollars on time, on further CRs, we should,  instead, immediately pass a budget agreement and help DREAMers, which  would facilitate full-year funding bills the committee could begin  writing today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H527]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.

Mr. Speaker, Congress has a responsibility to invest in initiatives  to defend the country and grow the economy. Instead of continuing down  a rudderless path of CR after CR, we must pass a bipartisan budget  agreement and protect DREAMers, which will enable the Appropriations  Committee to responsibly write full-year funding bills.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of my  time.                                time  1800
