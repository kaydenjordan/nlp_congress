 Madam President, I rise today in opposition to the  nomination of Mike Pompeo to be our next Secretary of State.   After considering his testimony before the Foreign Relations  Committee, his work as Director of the CIA, and his record as a  Congressman, I believe he doesn't possess the skillset necessary to be  our country's top diplomat.   The Secretary of State must be well-versed in the art of diplomacy.  They must possess a deft touch necessary to  [[Page S2456]]  operate on the world stage. Unfortunately, Mr. Pompeo's record and his  rhetoric show how ill matched he is for this position.   Above all, I fear that he would only reinforce President Trump's  worst impulses to lash out at our adversaries rather than pursue dogged  diplomacy. This is particularly concerning when it comes to Iran. The  Iran nuclear agreement is the strongest nonproliferation agreement ever  negotiated. It blocks Iran from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon,  protecting our security and the security of our partners in the region.  By all reports, it appears President Trump is set on walking away from  the Iran nuclear agreement next month, even though Iran continues to  abide by its strict terms.   If confirmed, I don't believe Mr. Pompeo would even try to walk the  President back from that foolish decision. Instead, he would most  likely feed the President's desire to leave, not because of its merits,  but simply because it was negotiated by President Obama.   To be clear, if the United States abandons the agreement, we will do  so on our own. Our international partners--including the United  Kingdom, France and Germany--have said they will remain in the  agreement so long as Iran complies with it. To date, the IAEA  inspectors and our own intelligence community have all said that Iran  remains in full compliance. When the nuclear agreement was signed, Iran  was less than a year away from acquiring a nuclear weapon.   Today, all of Iran's paths to a weapon--the plutonium, uranium and  covert--are blocked. The fact that today Iran cannot obtain a nuclear  bomb is in spite of Mr. Pompeo's efforts.   During the negotiations leading up to the agreement, then-Congressman  Pompeo not only called for the United States to abandon diplomatic  efforts, he encouraged us to attack Iran. He said, ``It is under 2,000  sorties to destroy the Iranian nuclear capacity. This is not an  insurmountable task for the coalition forces.''   During his recent confirmation hearing, he was unable to source that  claim or name which other nations would have joined our coalition. That  is an especially perplexing position since our strongest allies were  all negotiating alongside the United States at the time.   After the nuclear agreement came into effect, Mr. Pompeo continued  his campaign by sending the Supreme Leader a highly provocative letter.  He taunted Tehran, asking for a visa to inspect Iran's nuclear  facilities, monitor their elections, and receive a briefing on their  ballistic missile programs. His publicity stunt only served to further  inflame tensions between our countries.   Finally, shortly after our elections and the day before he was  nominated to be the Director of the CIA, he tweeted: ``I look forward  to rolling back this disastrous deal with the world's largest state  sponsor of terrorism.''   When asked about his position during his confirmation hearing, Mr.  Pompeo instead simply discounted the real and dangerous possibility  that Iran would restart its nuclear weapons program if we abandon the  agreement. I see no reason to believe his misinformed views have  changed in the past year.   As troubling as Mr. Pompeo's hostile view toward Iran is, I am  equally concerned by his divisive remarks about minority groups within  the United States. Following the Boston Marathon bombings, Mr. Pompeo  falsely suggested Muslim Americans were complicit in the attacks. The  following year, he characterized U.S. counterterrorism efforts as a  struggle between Islam and Christianity.   After the Supreme Court's landmark ruling legalizing same-sex  marriage, Mr. Pompeo said the court's opinion was a ``shocking abuse of  power'' that ``flies in the face of . . . our Constitution.'' He has  also claimed that the ``ideal'' family has a father and mother, a  shockingly outdated view of families here in the United States and  around the world.   Finally, the State Department plays a leading role in providing  family planning assistance abroad. Under Mr. Pompeo, I fear the State  Department will retreat from providing this vital assistance.   As a Member of the House, Mr. Pompeo repeatedly cosponsored  legislation to limit a woman's right to choose. Specifically, he  supported bills to make abortion illegal nationwide, even in the case  of rape.   He also repeatedly supported the ``global gag rule,'' known as the  Mexico City policy, which restricts U.S. funds to any foreign health  clinic that provides abortion services, even if it is legal in that  country.   All too often, rape is considered a weapon of war. Our global health  programming should not be restricted in a manner that ignores this ugly  reality.   The Secretary of State is charged with representing America's values  to the world and must be committed to exhausting all means of diplomacy  to avoid conflict. I don't believe Mr. Pompeo can do that and shouldn't  be confirmed as Secretary of State.   Therefore, I will vote no, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Driftnet  Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act. This legislation updates the  Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to phase out  the use of harmful drift gillnets and replace it with more sustainable  fishing gear.   Drift gillnets, which are approximately one to one and a half miles  long, are intended to catch swordfish and thresher shark. Tragically,  nearly 60 other species are accidentally caught and killed in the nets,  including dolphins, porpoises, whales, sea lions, and sea turtles.  These are known as bycatch.   While some of these species can be sold, most are wastefully thrown  back in to the ocean either dead or injured, making survival unlikely.   According to the National Marine Fisheries Service, gillnets account  for 90% of whale and porpoise species killed in West Coast Fisheries.   In the 1980s, Congress enacted legislation to end the domestic use of  driftnets approximately 1.5 miles long. Under President George H.W.  Bush, the United States entered binding international agreements  banning such nets worldwide. Driftnets are prohibited or not utilized  off the United States Atlantic and Gulf coasts or in Washington State,  Oregon, Alaska, or Hawaii. Mexico permanently banned the use of these  nets in 2017.   However, neither domestic nor international law, as currently  written, captures the drift gillnets used along the West Coast to catch  swordfish and thresher shark, despite their significant impact on  protected marine life. The California-based fishery is the last place  in the United States where these deadly driftnets are allowed.   The Driftnet Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act would completely  phase out the use of drift gillnets by 2020. The bill also authorizes a  program, directed by the Department of Commerce, to assist fishermen in  transitioning from driftnets to more sustainable gear types which  studies have shown actually increase profitability.   Updated fishing gear that could replace driftnets is available and  has been successfully deployed in the Atlantic Ocean and in trials in  the Pacific Ocean as well. Deep-set buoy gear, for example, allows  fishermen to more accurately target swordfish and other marketable  species in deep, cold water. The gear alerts fishermen immediately when  they have fish on the line, so the fish can be retrieved and delivered  to market quickly, fetching a higher price.   In a 2016 poll, California voters overwhelmingly supported ending the  use of drift gillnets to catch swordfish, with 87 percent of those  surveyed in a poll commissioned by The Pew Charitable Trusts agreeing  that fishermen should use less harmful gear.   The Driftnet Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act enjoys support  from a wide group of stakeholders. I ask unanimous consent that a list  of 40 supporting organizations and letters of support be included in  the record. The groups include: The Pew Charitable Trusts, Oceana, Sea  Legacy, Mission Blue, The American Sportfishing Association, The  International Game Fish Association, The California Department of Fish  and Wildlife, Coastal Conservation Association of California.
