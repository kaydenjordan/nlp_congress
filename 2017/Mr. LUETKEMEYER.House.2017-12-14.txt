 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan for  his diligent work on this issue. I also thank Chairman Hensarling from  Texas for all of the leadership that he has given us throughout the  year on this particular issue as well.   Several years ago, the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman) and I  introduced bipartisan legislation to require depository institutions to  provide privacy information to their customers only if they had changed  any policy or practice related to that customer's privacy. That bill  was ultimately signed into law by President Obama. It has eliminated  millions of confusing and often-ignored mailings that cost millions of  dollars to produce each year.   While our legislation provided relief to banks and credit unions, it  did not extend relief to other financial companies regulated under the  Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; namely, captive finance companies that operate  in a manner largely similar to depository institutions.   The safeguards featured in the bill from the 114th Congress and  codified into law are included in Mr. Trott's bill. This relief will  not be granted to a financial company that has changed its policies or  practices with regard to disclosure of nonpublic personal information;  only if it kept it the same.   There is also a requirement that the privacy notice must be made  available to consumers in a variety of ways. Consumers will continue to  have access to privacy notices through online resources and billing  statements.   Requirements for financial institutions to release annual privacy  notices to customers, even when no changes have been made, are both  redundant and a waste of resources. With the passage of this bill,  information included in these mailings would likely be more significant  to the consumer because they would only come after a change in privacy  policy.   Mr. Speaker, this is about accountability for the institution to  their customer for holding that information. It is about access for the  customer to their own information, with regards to privacy of it. A  good example, as pointed out by the ranking member, was Equifax. But  let's stop and talk about Equifax for a second.                                time  0945    What happened? They had, I believe, the largest breach in history,  150 million people.   Mr. Speaker, there is probably you and I and everybody in this room  and probably the 12 people watching right  [[Page H9910]]  now who are affected by this, but I guarantee you that you and I and  all in this room and the 12 people watching, nobody kept their privacy  notices that were sent out last year, did we? They are all in file 13  somewhere, long forgotten, and all of the information in those privacy  notices is forgotten about and not even probably read to begin with.   So it is important. The gentleman's bill here has in here that the  privacy notice can be accessed online. And in the Equifax breach,  anybody who was concerned could then go online and check for the  privacy policies of Equifax and see what the policies were and whether  they were adhered to by the company itself in notifying them, in taking  care of their concerns, in reimbursing them. Whatever was in the notice  was in that online notice as well. So it provided that access, which  the consumer is not going to have in a piece of paper. That is probably  going to get in file 13.   I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, when I was home last weekend, I got one  of those things. You know what, I looked at it, opened the envelope,  and said: ``I don't want to read this.'' I threw it away. This is  nonsense. This is a waste of time and resources.   And, in this situation with the Equifax breach, I think this bill  points out the great things that can happen if you enact this  legislation from the standpoint of allowing consumers to have access,  24/7, to the notifications and the privacy policies.   Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank the gentleman from Michigan for  picking up the mantle on this issue, and I ask my colleagues to join me  in supporting H.R. 2396. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  bringing the bill before us today.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I have heard, more than once, Members speaking for consumers, saying:  These privacy notices are not that important. Nobody reads them. They  throw them in the wastebasket.   Well, I don't know how Members would know that, and I don't think  that we should be satisfied that consumers are being represented that  way with indications that they don't really care about these notices  and the opportunity to opt out so that their information won't be  shared.   But let me tell you what consumers are saying to us. I have, here,  letters that have been sent by consumer organizations that really do  care about what is happening with this bill today, and I would like to  share that information with you.   Let me just tell you who these consumer organizations are and whom  they represent:   There is Americans for Financial Reform. Americans for Financial  Reform is a nonpartisan and nonprofit coalition of more than 200 civil  rights, consumer, labor, business, investor, faith-based, civic, and  community groups formed in the wake of the 2008 crisis, working to lay  the foundation for a strong, stable, and ethical financial system, one  that serves the economy and the Nation as a whole.   Then there is Allied Progress. Allied Progress is a consumer watchdog  organization that uses hard-hitting research to stand up to Wall Street  and powerful special interests and hold their allies in Congress and  the White House accountable.   Then there is Center for Digital Democracy. The Center for Digital  Democracy is recognized as one of the leading consumer protection and  privacy organizations in the United States; and since its founding in  2001 and, prior to that, through its predecessor organization, the  Center for Media Education, CDD has been at the forefront of research,  public education, and advocacy, protecting consumers in the digital  age.   Then there is Consumer Action. Through multilingual financial  education materials, community outreach, and issue-focused advocacy,  Consumer Action empowers underrepresented consumers, nationwide, to  assert their rights in the marketplace and to financially prosper.   There is the Consumer Federation of America. The Consumer Federation  of America is an association of nonprofit consumer organizations that  was established way back in 1968 to advance consumer interests through  research, advocacy, and education. Today, nearly 300 of these groups  participate in the federation and govern it through their  representatives on the organization's board of directors. CFA is a  research, advocacy, education, and service organization.   Then there is Consumer Watchdog. Consumer Watchdog is a nonprofit  organization dedicated to providing an effective voice for taxpayers  and consumers in an era when special interests dominate public  discourse, government, and politics, and they describe themselves as  deploying an in-house team of public interest lawyers, policy experts,  strategists, and grassroots activists to expose, confront, and change  corporate and political injustice in every way, every day, saving  Americans billions of dollars and improving countless lives. For  decades, Consumer Watchdog has been the Nation's most aggressive  consumer advocate, taking on politicians of both parties and the  special interests that fund them.   Then there is the National Association of Consumer Advocates. The  National Association of Consumer Advocates is a nonprofit association  of more than 1,500 attorneys and consumer advocates committed to  representing consumers' interests. Our members, they say, are private  and public sector attorneys, legal services attorneys, law professors,  and law students whose primary focus is the protection and  representation of consumers. They have represented hundreds of  thousands of consumers victimized by fraudulent, abusive, and predatory  business practices.   As a national organization fully committed to promoting justice for  consumers, NACA's members and their clients are actively engaged in  promoting a fair and open marketplace that forcefully protects the  rights of consumers, particularly those of modest means. NACA also has  a charitable and educational fund incorporated under 501(c)(3).    There is another very prominent consumer organization, the National  Consumer Law Center, working on behalf of low-income clients. Since  1969, the nonprofit National Consumer Law Center has used its expertise  in consumer law and energy policy to work for consumer justice and  economic security for low-income and other disadvantaged people,  including older adults in the United States. This organization's  expertise includes policy analysis and advocacy, consumer law and  energy publications, litigation, expert witness services, and training  and advice for advocates.   This organization works with nonprofit and legal services  organizations, private attorneys, policymakers, and Federal and State  government and courts across the Nation to stop exploitative practices,  help financially stressed families build and retain wealth, and advance  economic fairness.   Then there is Privacy Times. Privacy Times is the leading  subscription-only newsletter covering privacy and freedom of  information law and policy. It is read largely by attorneys and  professionals who must stay abreast of the legislation, litigation, and  executive branch activities, as well as consumer news, technology  trends, and business developments. Since 1981, Privacy Times has  provided its readers with accurate reporting, objective analysis, and  thoughtful insight into the events that shape the ongoing debate over  privacy and freedom of information.   Then there is the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse. Privacy Rights  Clearinghouse, a nonprofit consumer education and advocacy organization  located in San Diego, California, their mission is to engage, educate,  and empower consumers to protect their privacy. They engage in  outreach, provide educational materials and services to individuals  nationwide, and have an active media presence. The PRC uses the  information we learn directly, they say, from consumers to form the  basis of their advocacy work.   Then there is Public Citizen. Public Citizen has a team of  researchers. They uncover the facts. Their staff brings their findings  to the public through the media as well as one-on-one interactions.  Their advocates bring the voice of the public to the halls of power on  behalf of consumers.   Then there is Public Knowledge. Public Knowledge promotes freedom of  expression and open internet and access to affordable communication  tools and  [[Page H9911]]  creative works. They work to shape policy on behalf of the public  interest.   Then there is Reinvestment Partners. Reinvestment Partners' mission  is to advocate for economic justice and opportunity. They do this by  providing direct services to people, revitalizing places, and  advocating for just policies. Founded as a project of Legal Services in  1986 as the Community Reinvestment Association of North Carolina, the  agency has worked to ensure fair lending to underserved communities in  order to build and protect wealth. In 2012, they changed their name to  recognize the expanded diversity of their programs and their local and  State and national outreach.   And then there is U.S. PIRG. U.S. PIRG is an advocate for the public  interest, working to win concrete results on real problems that affect  millions of lives and standing up for the public against powerful  interests when they push the other way. They say: ``The problems we  face don't care if you are liberal or conservative, if you live in a  red or blue State. They affect each and every one of us.'' That is why,  for decades, they have taken a nonpartisan, facts-driven, results- oriented approach to their work.   Mr. Speaker, I do not like hearing that our consumers don't care,  that they don't need a yearly notification about their privacy rights,  that they simply throw this information that describes their rights  into the wastebasket; and I am so pleased that, over the years and  through the history of this Nation when too many consumers have been  ignored, taken advantage of, didn't know what their rights were, all of  these organizations that I have taken time to share with you today work  on behalf of consumers. They work not only in organizing and educating,  but they send this information to their Members of Congress. All of  these organizations have sent in this information not only about their  backgrounds, but about this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time
