 Mr. Chair, the unique circumstances of the Waters of the  United States (WOTUS) rulemaking warrant an expedited repeal of the  rule. In November 2016, the Committee released a staff report titled  ``Politicization of the Waters of the United States Rulemaking,''  detailing the findings of more than a year-long investigation in to the  Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rulemaking. The investigation  revealed widespread procedural violations, excessive unilateral and  politically driven decision-making, and persistent failures of  consultation and consideration of public comments.   The EPA's extraordinary efforts to push through this procedurally  deficient and roundly disliked rulemaking created an insurmountable  illegitimacy of the rulemaking that warrants immediate repeal. To  facilitate this necessary action, Congress is exercising its authority  to create exemptions to existing law in H.R. 3219, the Make America  Secure Appropriations Act, 2018. Section 108 of the bill provides a  single-use exemption from regulatory procedure and legal requirements  to allow EPA and the Secretary of the Army to immediately withdraw the  WOTUS rule. The immediate repeal of WOTUS will allow EPA and the Army  Corps of Engineers to start with a clean slate as they conduct a joint  rulemaking, between equal partners, with full consideration of the  comments and concerns raised by the American public.   In future rulemakings, including any WOTUS replacement, Congress  expects federal agencies to approach their mandate to consult with  state, local, and tribal governments and give full consideration to  public comments with a commitment to administrative procedure and  effective rulemaking.
