 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much  for yielding.   First of all, I want to thank Congressman Horsford for those generous  comments, but also for his leadership on so many fronts and for  constantly really looking out for the most vulnerable and for those who  oftentimes don't have a voice here.   I am really delighted that under the leadership of our fearless  chair, Congresswoman Karen Bass, who chairs the Congressional Black  Caucus, she asked Mr. Horsford to chair this Special Order tonight,  because it is so important that we talk about the budget cuts, and also  in the context of commemorating this anniversary, the 150th anniversary  of the ratification of the 15th Amendment.   We continue to be the conscience of the Congress, and it is so  important that we not only remember our history and educate those who  may have forgotten about it, but also talk about how we got to where we  are today.  [[Page H1004]]    With these budget cuts that are going to severely, disproportionately  impact the African American community, how can we not make the  connection between our history and what is taking place here with this  administration.   Let me just lay out a few more of the budget cuts very quickly.   I do serve on the Budget Committee with Mr. Horsford, and so we are  going to be dealing with this for the next few weeks and really lay out  how horrendous these cuts are.   I also serve on the Appropriations Committee as an appropriator.   We have to do a deep dive on this tonight, so let me just lay out a  few more of these horrific cuts.   There are cuts to lifesaving medical research. We're talking about  that this administration wants to cut the National Institutes of Health  by $3.3 billion and reduce the funding for the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention by $678 million.   Education: This administration wants to impose an 8.5 percent cut on  the Department of Education, which is a total cut of $6.2 billion,  which includes cuts to after-school programs, which we, of course, know  are extremely important in low-income communities and in the Black  community.   Infrastructure: This budget reduces the funding for the Army Corps of  Engineers, which fixes our Nation's crumbling water infrastructure, by  $1.7 billion.   There are cuts to community development. It eliminates the Community  Development Block Grant, making it harder for communities to address  needs like safe housing, economic opportunities, and public facilities  improvements.   It eliminates the HOME Program. Here we are trying to increase access  to affordable housing and eliminate homelessness, yet this  administration's budget presents a cut in terms of just zeroing out the  HOME Program. Of course, that is going to make it harder for low-income  individuals to access affordable housing programs.   It reduces rural broadband, cuts funding--this is hard to believe-- for small businesses. It cuts the funding for the Small Business  Administration's Entrepreneurial Development grants by $93 million,  making it harder for small businesses to grow and compete.   We can go on and on and on, but we see this budget as a budget that  we know is going to hurt those who don't have a lot of money, quite  frankly, and who are striving to take care of their families and to  live the quality of life that they so deserve as Americans.   So we are going to fight, and we are going to make sure that this  budget is dead on arrival, but we think it is important to lay out what  the values are that are in this budget.   It is an immoral budget, it is unethical, it is un-American, and I  hope that tonight people will really understand they need to sound the  alarm. It really is a budget that requires designating this as a state  of emergency.   With regard to 150 years ago: African American men were given the  right to vote with the ratification of the 15th Amendment, that was in  1870, but it was ratified, though, to ensure the freedoms outlined in  the 13th and 14th Amendments.   However, the promise of the 15th Amendment--going back now and right  up to today--the integral promise of the right to vote for Black  Americans was blocked, totally blocked until the Voting Rights Act of  1965, which I remember very well. I was in high school then.   It was just quite remarkable that in our lifetime, that the 15th  Amendment still wasn't actualized. Almost a century now after, here we  see still violence, racially charged State and local laws subjected  Black men to the use of poll taxes and literacy tests to prevent them  from voting.   Through these discriminatory tactics, we still kept fighting. These  tactics attempted to stop Black Americans from voting for our rights,  but we are still fighting.   It wasn't just Black men who were fighting for equality and fairness.   Black women were marching in the streets long after the ratification  of the 19th Amendment granting White women the right to vote. Black  women continued to face the same discrimination at the polls that Black  men had faced since 1870.   What is worse, Black women faced the compounded prejudices of anti- blackness and anti-women, but they were not deterred. They, we,  continued to fight for equality along with African American men.   Black women, like Mary Church Terrell, organized political  organizations and participated in political meetings. Black women were  involved in the U.S. political system long before they could legally  cast a vote.    Ninety-five years later, after decades of pressure and activism in  the midst of the civil rights movement, then in 1965 the Voting Rights  Act made voting more accessible to Black men and women. Despite the  protections that this law put into place, the Black vote is still  suppressed.   Now we have new barriers such as gerrymandering, voter ID laws, voter  purges, and the closing of polling locations in many minority  communities.   Now, instead of a poll tax, communities of color, especially African  American communities, are waiting in line for 7, 8, and even 10 hours  to vote.   Instead of making it easier to participate in our democracy, we have  States making it harder and pushing minorities out of reach.   So today, 150 years after the 15th Amendment passed, this fight for  the right to vote is more important than ever.   Again, as I close, going back to these budget cuts, we have to let  this administration know that there is power in the Black vote and that  Black lives also do matter and that these budget cuts that we are  talking about tonight, when you look at them, I am worried that they  would take us back, take us way back to the days of Jim Crow and the  days that we don't even want to remember.   So, Madam Speaker, to Congressman Horsford, this is very timely  tonight. I thank the gentleman for this Special Order, because the 15th  Amendment and what is taking place today are very, very connected, and  we need to remind our constituents of the risks and the dangers that we  face at this point in our history.                                time  1945     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  leadership.
