 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of  this strong NDAA. It prioritizes the true mission of our U.S. military,  and that is to deter and to win wars. That is it. It is pretty simple.   More specifically, it prioritizes America's greatest national  security asset, our brave men and women in uniform who serve on a daily  basis. I thank Chairman Rogers for his support of my amendment within  this en bloc that will secure the highest pay raise in history for  nearly 1 million of our junior enlisted troops, paid for by the  appropriations bill.   This takes the starting salary for an E-1 in the military from about  $22,000 a year to $31,200 a year. It gets them above the poverty line  and off of food stamps. These brave men and women are willing to make  the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our freedom, and it is  unacceptable that they were making less than fast-food workers.  [[Page H3595]]    Mr. Chair, I couldn't be more proud of this historic victory, and I  couldn't be more eager to continue fighting for those who fight so hard  to give us our security blanket.
