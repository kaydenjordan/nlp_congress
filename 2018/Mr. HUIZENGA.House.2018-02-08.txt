 Mr. Speaker, we have been hearing some of the details  of the bill, but here is the real message: this is about our small  communities and small banks that are the lifeblood of those  communities.   A little earlier you heard the ranking member talk about this being  about Wall Street.   Do you know what?   She is right. This is about Wall Street. Wall Street was one block  away from where I lived on Sanford Street in Zeeland, Michigan. By the  way, we were connected by Main Street and Central Avenue. That is what  it is about. Whether it is Wall Street in Zeeland, Michigan, or Sanford  Street, or my friends in Baldwin, Michigan, this is about our small  communities.   What does a strong local community bank bring?   It brings local investment.   And what does that local investment bring?   Stability, predictability, trust, trust among the farmers, among  those corner pub owners, or among those small hotel owners that may be  depending on the stray traveler that is going to be coming through.   This has been sort of viewed as a risk to these small banks. It is  actually the opposite of that. Either, A, one small community bank is  going to merge with another small community bank and they are going to  remain small community banks under that $3 billion threshold; or, B,  what we have been seeing a lot of--and this is what the chairman was  talking about--they are going to get gobbled up by a large bank that  doesn't qualify under this legislation.   And guess what.   They are far more likely to remove those ATMs and far more likely to  move those local branches out of places like Tustin and Luther and  Baldwin and Holland.   I can tell you this: if you went and said that this is anything other  than about strengthening our small community banks, it shows, A, one is  either wildly out of touch or, B, playing politics.   That is the sad part, because I can tell you this: if you go talk to  my friend Debbie Smith-Olson, who is the CEO of Lake-Osceola State Bank  in Baldwin, Michigan--located in the poorest county in the State of  Michigan, one of the top 100 poorest counties in the Nation--and you  told her that this was about Wall Street, she would laugh.   If I went and talked to my friends at Macatawa Bank and tried to  describe this as being about helping big banks and Wall Street and  rolling back Dodd-Frank, they would first look at me in stunned  silence, and then they would ask me: Are you serious?   Well, unfortunately, that is the kind of rhetoric that you are  hearing out here today.   Let's make sure that we understand what this is really about:  strengthening our small banks, which strengthen our small communities  and strengthen our small-business owners. That is what is going to  continue this economic comeback that we are experiencing here in the  United States.   I commend the gentlewoman from Utah in her work on a bipartisan  manner on the basis that this has been coming together with people of  goodwill trying to come up with a solution to make sure that we don't  see needless consolidation in a banking community that has already been  so hit.    As I wrap up, this is about making sure that we have a  solid community banking system. We know that they have been under  assault under these Dodd-Frank provisions that have come through, which  I don't think were necessarily maliciously put in, but they were  misunderstood about what those effects were going to be. The  gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. Love) is rectifying that.   Mr. Speaker, I want to encourage my colleagues to support that and to  vote ``yes'' for this very important bill.
