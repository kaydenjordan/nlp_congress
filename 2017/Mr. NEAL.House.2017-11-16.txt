 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, this is a historic moment, but, most importantly, it is  a missed opportunity.   Mr. Speaker, we are taking the proposal of the Republican Party today  and the financial architecture of our revenue system, based on their  request, to the casino.   Their argument is premised on one thing today, and one thing only.  Maybe. But what about maybe not?   This could have been done between the two parties, as we requested  and wanted to do.   In 1986, 450 witnesses offered testimony on tax reform, thirty  hearings were held, and the Secretary of the Treasury attended most of  them. The two parties found commonality in reaching an accord that was  well received by the American people.   What we are being asked to do here today is to raise taxes on 36  million middle class Americans. The previous speaker, my friend from  California, a quarter of the households in his district claim the State  and local tax deduction, with an average of $10,000 per family.  $10,000. So they are going to tell you today that they are giving you  this and they are giving you that.   Take a look at the distribution tables. That is the most certain  opportunity for people to examine precisely what is in this  legislation.   A gentleman earlier this morning was heralding Alzheimer's month.  They give Alzheimer's a tax during Alzheimer's month. For those who  stay together with loved ones for as long as they can, they need that  deduction that is so important to keeping that family together.   This is the same old, same old. In 2001, tax cuts of $1.3 trillion  all premised on maybe we will have economic growth.   Remember the argument that tax cuts pay for themselves?   Well, they, today, call it dynamic scoring. Now we are being asked  again to premise the argument on maybe there will be enough growth to  generate some return on revenue.   In 2003, another $1.3 trillion in terms of a tax cut was offered with  no or slow economic growth.   And the granddaddy of them all, in 2005, how about repatriation?   Foreign earnings were brought back at 5\1/4\ percent, all based upon  the idea that there was going to be widespread broad-based hiring.  [[Page H9382]]    What did we discover in the aftermath of that?   Almost 20,000 layoffs in the weeks after it. The money was used for  stock buybacks and dividends with no employment gains across the  country.   They keep telling us: Well, you are going to get 3 percent, 4  percent, 5 percent, and the President says 6 percent growth.   I want to find that economist who says we are going to get 6 percent  growth.   Most projections are that we are being asked here today to  participate in the following, because this is the context of the  argument this morning: They are borrowing $2.3 trillion over 10 years  for the purpose of giving a tax cut to people at the very top of our  economic system.   We should be investing in human capital, community colleges,  vocational education, internship programs, and aligning the American  people with the skill sets that are necessary, as the Department of  Labor reported this week, for the 6 million jobs that are available.  That is the most gainful way to do long-term investment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin), who has a long and distinguished history in this  Congress and as a member of the Ways and Means Committee.                                time  0930    (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Lewis), who has the highest professional and personal  esteem of every Member of this institution.    Mr. Speaker, under the Republican tax bill, 570,000  Michigan households earning less than $160,000 a year will see a tax  hike.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Thompson), a thoughtful member of the Ways and Means Committee, whose  admonitions to all of us should be something we could all rally around.    Mr. Speaker, 22,000 constituents of the gentleman from  Miami's district will eventually face the Alzheimer's tax increase that  is included in this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr.  Larson), who is a neighbor, a really nice guy, and a very thoughtful  member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. Blumenauer), who is one of the most thoughtful Members of  Congress, a leader in the field of renewable energy, and my friend    Mr. Speaker, 17,000 people in Mr. Hensarling's district  will now pay higher interest on their student loan deductions.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Kind), who is a great advocate for the heartland of America.    Mr. Speaker, one-third of the gentleman's constituents  claim the State and local tax deduction, totalling $11,684 per family.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), a great friend to all of us here in this  institution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Doggett), a thoughtful member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an additional  15 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), whose knowledge of new markets tax  credits is second to none in this institution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Higgins), one of the most knowledgeable members of the Ways  and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. DelBene), a very successful businesswomen in her own  right, who understands the modern economy.    Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to have Mr. Kelly--as he  describes sports teams, we discovered he is a closet Patriots fan.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Judy Chu), whose history, in terms of revenue and revenue  collection, is well known to the Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Ms. Sewell), a Marshall Scholar and attorney.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Lewis) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.   (Mr. LEWIS of Georgia asked and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth), the ranking member of the Budget Committee, and  one of the most knowledgeable Members of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Mexico (Mr. Ben Ray Lujan).  [[Page H9400]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Sanchez), a very thoughtful member of the Ways and  Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson), and I ask unanimous consent  that he may control that time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, as we wind down this debate on tax reform or, what we  should really call it, tax cut, I think that we should tabulate this as  a missed opportunity. This could have  [[Page H9406]]  been done between the two parties. Instead, much of this was  constructed without any Democratic input.   Reminder: In 1986, the historic Tax Reform Act included President  Reagan and Speaker O'Neill, Chairman Rostenkowski, Dick Gephardt, and  Bill Bradley. In this instance here, 32 years later, not one hearing  was held on this tax bill that is about to be voted on in the next 45  minutes.   The significance of that is that there was never any back-and-forth,  and in 1986, expert testimony was sought from 450 witnesses. We had not  one witness who commented on the legislation.   It has been advertised as a middle class tax cut. Wait until you get  the bill. How can you say that this is a middle class tax cut and  compare that to repeal of the estate tax?   How many middle class people in America pay the estate tax?   That is how many people pay the estate tax. No middle class American  pays the estate tax. There is no such thing as a death tax, in addition  to which a middle class tax cut is described as doing away with the  alternative minimum tax. 4.5 million families pay an alternative  minimum tax in America. That is it.   I fixed the problem years ago for the middle class, and 27 million  people stopped paying AMT. So now we are down to people at the very  top.   So how are we paying for this? Or how are they paying for it, better,  because they are not going to get much help on this side?   Well, they decided that that teacher who used to have $250, that they  could deduct on their income taxes, that is going to be abolished.   So if you have Alzheimer's and you exceed the 10 percent number in  terms of cost in your healthcare for caring for that loved one at home  who is sick or has dementia, that is how they are going to pay for the  tax cut. They are going to take that away.   State and local property taxes, they are going to take that away--the  deduction. They are going to pare back the mortgage interest tax  deduction. All of this advertised on the basis of a middle class tax  cut?   People at the bottom end are not going to get much from this tax cut.  I want to take you back again, as I have repeatedly, because I have  cast three great votes in this House during my 29 years: against the  Iraq war, and there weren't many of us; against the cuts in 2001; and  against the tax system in 2003; all advertised as progrowth economics.   There was no economic growth in the tax cuts of 2001, which totaled,  by the way, $1.3 trillion. For people who said at the time, ``everybody  gets a tax cut,'' they were correct. Then you looked at the  distribution tables to see what people got at the top and then what  people got at the bottom. Then we came back in 2003 and cut another  trillion dollars in taxes--advertises progrowth economics--zippo growth  occurred.   Then, by the way, the granddaddy of them all: How about repatriation.  Repatriation, bringing back those earnings to the United States for  investment in job growth, at, by the way, 5\1/4\ was the tax burden  they carried, all based on job growth. It was for stock buybacks,  dividends, and layoffs.   We had a chance here to do something historic. We had a chance here  in this debate and discussion because there is a genuine affability on  that committee. We had this opportunity to take the Tax Code and  transform it for the gig economy in the modern age. We didn't do that,  though. Four days we had to examine this tax proposal with no hearings.  Not one chance for a Democratic amendment to proceed.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2\1/2\ minutes.   Mr. Speaker, let me acknowledge the support of the Democratic staff  that are here as well: Kara Getz, Karen McAfee, Aruna Kalyanam, Peg  McGlinch, Deva Kyle, Ji Prichard, and Suzanne Walsh. They did a  magnificent job as well, and we are much dependent on the good staff  work, particularly, on the Ways and Means Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I spoke earlier of the missed opportunity that we have  here. We have a real problem in America with labor participation rates.  Six million job go unanswered every day now in America, 18,000  precision manufacturing jobs in New England, and 1 million tech jobs,  because skill sets don't align with the job opportunities that are out  there.    Two million Americans sit home with opioid addictions who should be  in the workforce. This was a chance to invest in human capital as well,  to invest in our community colleges, to invest in apprenticeship  programs. Yes, the other challenge that we have in America is, clearly,  to invest in vocational education for many of the jobs that are  available.   Instead, we pushed that off to the side and decided that, once again,  if we just had tax cuts, all of these challenges and problems would go  away.   The idea of investing in the human side of American opportunity is  then  [[Page H9407]]  people do what we would like them to do in terms of home buying,  raising families, caring for neighborhoods, and practicing the art form  of citizenship.   Once again, what we are witnessing today--and we need to be alarmed  about it--is the greater and greater conservation of wealth in America.  Now, I understand it is complicated. It has to do much with technology  and globalization, but it is also about the gig economy, and we, today,  reward capital more than we reward labor.   When we get done, if they are successful on the other side, we are  going to further concentrate wealth amongst those few families in  America. We serve here in the House of Representatives, not in the  House of Lords. This is not about peerage, where you are entitled to a  seat in this House of Representatives. That is what is wrong. That is  what Jefferson and Madison envisioned when they signed those bonds of  the Declaration of Independence and the American Constitution to break  with Europe. We don't practice divine right here.   I wish the outcome here today, Mr. Speaker, would have been more  genuine and it would have been different.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), a very capable legislator, the Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the very capable Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
