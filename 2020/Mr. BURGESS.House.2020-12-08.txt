 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Indiana for  the recognition.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of a bill that includes coverage for  immunosuppressive drugs after a kidney transplant. This is something we  have worked on for a decade but, more importantly, for kidney patients  and their families, this has been a priority for much, much longer.   Madam Speaker, today's bill is monumental in the life of the  transplant patient. In 1972, Congress voted to allow Medicare coverage  for end-stage renal disease patients under 65 years of age. The policy  opened the doors for patients to have Medicare pay for dialysis and  kidney transplants, but it wasn't quite enough.   A new kidney gives the hope of a better quality of life to patients,  but only if they take those immunosuppressive drugs. Otherwise, their  own immune system is going to recognize the renal graft as a foreign  object and reject it, but that is their new kidney. So without these  drugs, patients risk rejection of a kidney and a return to dialysis.   Now, Medicare, to be sure, will pay for that return to dialysis and  another renal transplant--if they are lucky  [[Page H7000]]  enough to get one--but it will not pay for more than 36 months of  immunosuppressive drug coverage. This is incredibly expensive for the  Medicare system, but think of the toll on the lives of kidney patients  and their families.   So the bill before us today will address the immunosuppressive drug  issue directly by requiring Medicare to cover these drugs past 36  months for kidney patients who do not obtain other health coverage.   Look, a kidney transplant is a gift from one human to another. From  the government's perspective, the transaction is an investment that  allows the government to make that investment into a patient's future,  and this policy allows us to protect that investment, so it is a policy  that is good for the patient, to be sure. As a side benefit, it is a  benefit to the taxpayer.   Madam Speaker, both the CMS Office of the Actuary and the Office of  the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation at HHS have  published reports on the benefits of extending Medicare coverage of  immunosuppressive drugs, which include financial savings for the  Medicare program.    So after years, literally a decade, of wrestling with the policy, a  light finally shone over the Congressional Budget Office and they  confirmed what others have known all along, that this delivers savings  to Medicare. The policy also aligns and builds on what the Trump  administration has done with the kidney health initiatives, including  the Advancing American Kidney Health executive order, which the  President signed in July of 2019.   So this immunosuppressive drug policy has support from everyone--from  the patients, to transplant surgeons, to patients' families, and it is  something behind which the kidney coalition has coalesced for years. We  would not be here today if it were not for the tireless work of that  community and other cosponsors.    Madam Speaker, I thank all of the many people, including  the staffers on both of our committees, who have worked over the past  decade, they have tuned and fine-tuned this policy to get it where it  is today.                                time  1600
