 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I have a simple question: What the heck are you thinking? What is in  your mind? Why would you want to give out any of your personal  information to a faceless corporation for the sole purchase of them  selling it?   Give me one good reason why Comcast should know what my mother's  medical problems are. Do you know how they would know? Because when I  went to the doctor with her and they told me what it was, I had no clue  what they were talking about, so I came home and I searched it on the  net, and I searched the drugs that she was taking. The same with my  children.   Just last week, I bought underwear on the internet. Why should you  know what size I take, or the color, or any of that information?                                time  1345    These companies are not going broke. That is not the situation. The  internet is not in jeopardy. This is plain and simple, and I don't get  this.   When I was growing up, I thought one of the tenets of the Republican  Party that I admired the most was privacy. It is mine, not yours, not  the government's--mine. You can't have it unless I give it to you.   My phone number, my Social Security number, my credit card number, my  passwords--everything is mine. Yet you just want to give it away. You  make one good argument: let's level the playing field. You are right. I  agree with you. But you don't level the playing field by getting rid of  the playing field. You level it by raising it on those who are not  subject to this rule.   Please give me one--not two--one good reason why all of these people  here, why all of these people watching would want Comcast or Verizon to  have information unless they give it to them. We are talking medical  information. We are talking passwords. We are talking financial  information. We are talking college applications. There is nothing in  today's society that every one of us doesn't do every day on the  internet, yet Comcast is going to get it--not because I said it is  okay.   And what are you going to do with it? Kind of look at it and say: oh,  yeah, hey, Mike takes a size 38 underwear. That is great. They are  going to sell it to the underwear companies. Hey, he bought this kind  of underwear. He likes this color. Let's give him ads. By the way, most  of those ads are useless, because I already bought the underwear. I  don't need any more.   But it is none of their information. It is none of their business. Go  out in the street, please, leave Capitol Hill for 5 minutes. Go  anywhere you want, find three people on the street who think it is  okay, and you can explain to them ROIs, the company has to make  progress, and we have to make money.   You will lose that argument every single time, as you should. And I  guarantee you, you won't find anybody in your district who wants this  bill passed.    Mr. Speaker, we all know that our cell phones are  tracking every move we make and keeping a record of it. Many people  don't know, but your automobile is also doing the same thing. They keep  a record of where you go. They keep a record of whether you wore your  seatbelt. They keep a record of whether you applied the brakes or  turned the turn signal on. Okay. That is your automobile. You don't  have to drive.   Just recently, in the last couple months, we have learned that our  televisions and children's dolls are doing the same thing. Last month,  it was revealed that Vizio had spied on 11 million consumers by  listening to them while their TV was off because they can do it.   Also, last month, a child's doll called My Friend Cayla for little  girls or boys was banned in Germany--banned in Germany--because that  doll listens and responds. It goes into the internet, and the doll's  owner keeps and sells that information.   This month--this month--a teddy bear manufactured by a company called  CloudPets was exposed for collecting more than 2 million voice  recordings of children talking to their teddy bear.   Now, maybe we accept that. I know that those are not the items that  this resolution would address, but the problem is you are taking an  item for ISPs and reducing it down to this level. You say your privacy  is protected. I just gave you three examples in the last 2 months where  your privacy is not protected. Neither is your children's. Neither is  your family's.   In 2012, a giant international company--international ISP company, by  the way--filed for a U.S. patent for a cable box that would sit in your  house. It would watch you. It would record you. It contained an  infrared sensor and even take your body temperature with a  thermographic--and that is a quote--thermographic camera. It would do  all this without telling you and would work whether the cable box was  on or not. If you don't believe me, if you still have the courage to go  on the internet, go find patent application number--now, write this one  down--2012/0304206. That is the patent application number. It is still  online.   I want to read you one small segment from that 25-page patent  application. This is a direct quote. I am not making up a single word.  The device ``may detect . . . that two users are cuddling on a couch  during the presentation of the television program and prior to an  advertisement break. Based on the detected . . . action . . . the  device would select a commercial associated with cuddling.''   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.   Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield an  additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from Massachusetts.    For example: ``a commercial for a romantic getaway  vacation, a commercial for a contraceptive, a commercial for flowers .  . . et cetera.''   I didn't make up a single word of what I just read, and every one of  you is sitting there with your mouth open that this might happen in  your world. That is what this resolution will allow, and you can't turn  it off. You can't say: Don't watch my children. Don't watch my wife.   This is a terrible resolution. As I asked earlier today, what are you  thinking?
