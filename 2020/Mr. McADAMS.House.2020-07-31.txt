 Madam Speaker, Utah's hot, dry summers bring with them  risks to lives and property due to wildfires.   Our first and last line of defense against this risk is the skill,  dedication, and courage of firefighters from across our State.  Sometimes we may take their efforts for granted until we hear about a  particular act of valor, as in Utah's firefighters' recent battle  against the Knolls fire in Saratoga Springs.   So far this season, Utah communities have seen 650 fires, which have  forced evacuations across the State. The city of Saratoga Springs and  other surrounding communities faced some of the worst of it so far,  with 13,000 residents forced to evacuate their homes due to the Knolls  fire.   For 7 days and nights, in extreme temperatures and erratic winds, 200  firefighters worked tirelessly to protect the community and our  residents. The fire consumed over 13,000 acres of land, but due to  their extraordinary efforts, only one home was lost to the flames.   Wildfire season continues, but what we have shown with the Knolls  fire is that local, State, and Federal resources in coordination can  minimize damage and save lives.   I am grateful to the brave men and women who suit up for these  dangerous  [[Page H4194]]  scenarios and never quit until the job is done.                            ____________________
