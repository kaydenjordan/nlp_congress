The total       estimated value is $985 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States. Australia       is one of our most important allies in the Western Pacific.       The strategic location of this political and economic power       contributes significantly to ensuring peace and economic       stability in the region. It is vital to the U.S. national       interest to assist our ally in developing and maintaining a       strong and ready self-defense capability.        This proposed sale will improve Australia's capability to       perform anti-surface and antisubmarine warfare missions along       with the ability to perform secondary missions including       vertical replenishment, search and rescue, and communications       relay. Australia will use the enhanced capability as a       deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland       defense. Australia will have no difficulty absorbing this       equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment will not alter the       basic military balance in the region.        The principal U.S. contractor will be Lockheed Martin       Rotary and Mission Systems, Owego, NY. There are no known       offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential       sale.        Implementation of the proposed sale will require U.S.       Government and contractor personnel to visit Australia on a       temporary basis in conjunction with program technical       oversight and support requirements, including program and       technical reviews.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.

The MH-60R Multi-Mission Helicopter is employed       primarily for anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare       missions. The MH-60R carries several sensors and data links       to enhance its ability to work in a network-centric battle       group and as an extension of its home ship/main operating       base. The mission systems consist of the following sensors       and subsystems: an acoustics system consisting of a dipping       sonar, sonobuoys, and acoustics processor; MultiMode Radar       (MMR) with integrated Identification Friend or Foe (IFF)       interrogator; Radios with COMSEC; Electronic Support Measures       (ESM); Integrated Self-Defense (ISD); and Multi-Spectral       Targeting System (MTS).        a. GPS/PPS/SAASM--Global Positioning System provides a       space-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) that       has reliable location and time information in all weather and       at all times and anywhere on or near the earth when and where       there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more OPS       satellites. Selective Availability/Anti-Spoofing Module       (SAASM) is used by military OPS receivers to allow decryption       of precision OPS coordinates. In addition, the OPS Antenna       System (GAS-I) provides protection from enemy manipulation of       the OPS system.        b. The AN/APS-153 multi-mode radar with an integrated IFF       and Inverse Synthetic Aperture (ISAR) provides target       surveillance/detection capability.        c. The AN/ALQ-210 (ESM) system identifies the location of       an emitter. The ability of the system to identify specific       emitters depends on the data provided.        d. The AN/AAS-44C(V) Multi-spectral Targeting System (MTS)       operates in day/night and adverse weather conditions. Imagery       is provided by a Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor, a       color/monochrome day television (DTV) camera, and a Low-Light       TV (LLTV).        e. Ultra High Frequency/Very High Frequency (UHF/VHF)       Radios (ARC 210) contain embedded sensitive encryption       algorithms and keying material.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that Australia can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        5. All defense services listed in this transmittal have       been authorized for release and export to the Government of       Australia.                            ____________________     Madam President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export  Control Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of  certain proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.
