 Madam Speaker, the left has ripped away the pen of  truth from the author of life. They have exchanged natural science for  a party platform and declared war on biology. Your leftwing movement is  forcing children to endure radical expressions of sexuality, and yet,  you can't even define what a woman is.   You might amend a bill, but you will never amend biology. Science is  not Burger King. You can't just have it your way.   I am the youngest member of the House of Representatives, and I never  imagined that one of my sacred duties in this hallowed Chamber would be  explaining to the House Speaker the difference between a man and woman.   Take notes, Madam Speaker, I am about to define what a woman is for  you: XX chromosomes, no tallywhacker. It is so simple.   And yet today, this proclamation of fundamental scientific fact will  cause the woke liberals in Silicon Valley to strip you of your voice  and ban you until you bow at their altar of falsehoods. Patriots like  Charlie Kirk and Tucker Carlson have been muzzled on Twitter for  promoting the dangerous and bigoted ideology called science.   Madam Speaker, you and your party are living a lie. The Babylon Bee  is a more reliable source of fact than you. Perhaps it will click when  you hand the gavel to Republicans and realize that truth is king. It  reigns with the American people; and you, Madam Speaker, never will  again.                            ____________________
