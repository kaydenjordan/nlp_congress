 Mr. President.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object,  approximately 24 hours after the attack at Abbey Gate in Kabul, I had  the privilege to speak with the father of one of the marines who lost  his life there, a young marine from the State of Missouri, St. Charles  County, named Jared Schmitz.   His father, whose name is Mark, told me of the devastation of losing  his son. He later spoke in public about his son in this way. He said:   [[Page S9061]]              I am very honored--    This is Mark talking about his boy Jared.         I'm very honored that I could call him my son. His life       meant so much more. I'm so incredibly devastated that I won't       be able to see the man that he was very quickly growing into       becoming.    Thirteen servicemembers lost their lives on that day and hundreds of  civilians. As a result of the botched evacuation operation, hundreds,  if not thousands, of American civilians were left behind to the enemy,  where hundreds still remain.   Now, I am not going to reveal the contents of my conversation with  Mr. Schmitz, except to say something that he asked me, something that  he told me. He told me, ``Go fight like hell,'' and that is exactly  what I am going to do until there is accountability for the worst  foreign policy crisis this country has suffered since the Vietnam war.   We hear from our friends on the other side of the aisle that our  insistence that we actually vote on nominees is unprecedented. I would  humbly suggest that the crisis into which this President has led this  country is unprecedented. In my lifetime, it is unprecedented.   It is unprecedented for an American President to watch 13  servicemembers lose their lives in an evacuation for which he is  responsible and then to celebrate that operation as ``an unqualified  success,'' ``an extraordinary success,'' I believe were President  Biden's words.   Really, an extraordinary success? Thirteen servicemembers dead,  hundreds of civilians dead, hundreds of Americans left behind to the  enemy--that is success? No, that is a failure. That is unacceptable.   And who has been held accountable for this disaster? No one. Who has  the President fired? Who has offered their resignation? Which of the  planners at the Department of State or the Department of Defense or the  National Security Council has been relieved of duty? No one.   We have seen this movie before. Back to Vietnam. In Vietnam, we  watched as the experts in Washington sent thousands and thousands of  Americans to die, concealing the true state of the war, lying to the  American people.   And what happened to the people who planned that disastrous war over  all those years? Nothing. They went on to their board seats. They went  on to collect their fat pension checks. They went on to be celebrated.  And who was left to pick up the pieces? It was the families of the  fallen. It was those who lost their lives.   Well, I, for one, am not willing to stand by and participate in that  kind of theater again. I am not going to go back to the families of the  fallen in my State and say that I didn't do anything while people in  this body looked the other way. It is time that there was  accountability.   So is this a protest that I am launching by asking the Senate to  actually vote on these nominees? You bet it is. You bet it is because  we don't need more leadership of the same kind in the State Department.  We don't need more leadership of the same kind in the Department of  Defense. We need a different kind of leadership. We need a different  direction for this country.   Until there is accountability, I am going to ask that the Senate do  the simple task of its job, which is to actually vote on these  nominees. The least we could do is observe regular order and vote on  these leadership positions at the Department of State and at the  Department of Defense.   My colleague from Maryland says--and I think he is right--that we  have got to put national security first. I agree with him about that.  That begins at the top, with the President of the United States and the  leadership of the Department of Defense and the Department of State.  But I, for one, am not going to stand by and look the other way while  this administration systematically endangers our national security,  imperils the American people, and watches the sacrifice of our soldiers  go by without any accountability, without any change in direction.   I am not willing to look the other way and just pretend it didn't  happen, which seems to be the posture that many in this body have  adopted. I am not willing to do that. Frankly, I can't do that because  I promised the parents of the fallen that I wouldn't do that.   So I am going to discharge my responsibility. And as long as it  takes, I will continue to draw attention to what happened at Abbey Gate  and to demand accountability for it.   If I am still here on the floor doing this in 2023, so be it; 2024,  so be it, until somebody is held accountable. I don't care who the  President is. I don't care what administration it is. I want to see  accountability for what has happened in Afghanistan, what happened to  those servicemembers, and what happened to those hundreds of civilians  who are even now left behind enemy lines to the enemy.   I would just note one other thing about the situation we are in, vis- a-vis these nominees. While I can ask that there be a vote on the floor  of the Senate, I certainly can't prevent that vote. So you might ask  yourself: Why in the world, if these nominations are so important--and,  by the way, I agree that these are leadership positions. That is, in  fact, why I am asking for a vote. These are leadership positions to the  Department of State, in this case, the Department of Defense in other  cases. But why in the world we haven't voted? I can't prevent a vote.  None of my colleagues can prevent a vote.   The answer is, ask Senator Schumer. My friends control the floor.  Senator Schumer is the majority leader of the U.S. Senate, and what has  he had the Senate doing? Well, not much.   Last week, over a 3-day period--3 days--how many votes did the U.S.  Senate take? One. For 2 full days, we were in session. How many votes  did the U.S. Senate take on any subject? Zero. If these were such  pressing priorities, why isn't the Senate majority leader putting them  on the floor for a vote? I have no earthly idea other than, apparently,  he just can't get his act together to do it.   Here we are. It is 2:15 in the afternoon on a Thursday.   Are we voting?   No.   How many votes have we taken today?   One.   Will we be voting tomorrow?   I doubt it.   Will we be voting next week?   Who knows. Apparently it is not that much of a priority.   So Senator Schumer has a lot to answer for in many regards, not the  least of which is his defense of the indefensible Afghanistan debacle  and the loss of life there. But he also should take a look in the  mirror. And I humbly suggest that my colleagues across the aisle might  want to question him as to why these nominations that they insist are  so important aren't being put on the floor to be voted on.   I would be happy to vote on them anytime, but I am not going to  consent to waving them through and waiving regular order until there is  some accountability for the disaster that this administration has  pushed upon this country and upon the people of my State.   Now, I have one other--before I object--and I am going to object, Mr.  President. Before I do, I want to pick up one piece of bookkeeping  item, bookkeeping issue with my colleague, the Senator from Maryland.  Let me just say this while I am on that subject. The Senator from  Maryland is across the aisle. I want to be clear about this with my  colleague, the Senator from Maryland, whom I have worked with many  times before.   I don't doubt for a moment his sincerity or his earnestness on this  issue. And I know that he thinks that these nominations are pressing  and that they are important, and I agree with him. And I am sure that  he is frustrated by the fact that we disagree on the right way to get  accountability in Afghanistan. I acknowledge that. It is an honest  disagreement.   So I don't want my remarks in any way to suggest in any fashion that  I question the integrity or the uprightness or the sincerity of my  colleague from Maryland, and I just wanted to say to him that two of  the nominations that he read out I don't have any objection to: Adam  Scheinman and Jack Markell. So if the Senator were willing to reoffer  those separately, I think he certainly would encounter no objection  from me.   But with all of that, Mr. President, I object.
