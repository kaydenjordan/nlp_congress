 Mr. President, I am here with Senators Cornyn and Leahy  to ask unanimous consent.   As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  S. 831 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; further,  that the Grassley amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to;  and that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and  passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I guess I am not surprised that we would  have an objection like this because a program that has been corrupt and  that we have been trying to reform for 8 years--every time we reach an  agreement, there is big-moneyed interests in this town and around the  country that keep it from happening.   So today's objection, unfortunately, represents another victory for  those same moneyed, powerful, corrupt interests that have so often  worked to kill reforms to a program that they love to abuse for nothing  more than their own financial benefit.   It also means that Congress will not be able to pass legislation to  reauthorize the program in advance of its expiration on June 30. A  narrow subset of big-moneyed and corrupt interests has now shown that  they would rather kill the program altogether than have to accept  integrity programs designed to clamp down on their bad behavior.   I thank all those groups who have been working with us for 8 years to  get this program reformed. A lot of those people use that program. They  were willing to make it an honest program.   All of this action today of this objection is unfortunate but not  surprising.   I yield the floor.
