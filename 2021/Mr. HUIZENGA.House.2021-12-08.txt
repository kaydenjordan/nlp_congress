 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I appreciate the opportunity to be here today and to have this  conversation.   This shouldn't be a surprise. We knew this day was coming since 2014.  The Alternative Reference Rate Committee, the ARRC, has worked  diligently to help ensure a successful transition from the  aforementioned LIBOR rate system to a new system.   In fact, over the last several years, Republicans on the Financial  Services Committee have raised this issue on numerous occasions with  our prudential regulators, as well as the Secretary of the Treasury  under even the last administration.   I, myself, have asked for a greater focus on this issue, but  unfortunately, this request seemingly fell on some deaf ears. It was  unfortunate that my colleagues on the other side seemed to sort of  forge ahead without having a broader conversation. There was one  hearing on this issue before we marked up this bill in July. We needed  to do a better job in socializing this particular issue because now,  Mr. Speaker, we have a problem.   We have Members of this Chamber who do not understand the issue and  don't understand the process, and they look at this as being just  rushed. They don't see the 2\1/2\, 3, 4, 5 years of having this  discussion since the London Whale scandal happened where there was a  manipulation of those international interest rates.   Here we are today, once again, because of a truncated process, and it  appears to some of our Members that we are rushing through a bill that  is going to expand the Federal Government, that could cost the Federal  Government something, that is going to interfere with private  contracts. We simply have not done the work to normalize and socialize  this particular issue.   This has been described as a once-in-a-generation event, and we are  talking about financial instruments with hundreds of trillions of  dollars at stake, including effects that we can't even totally foresee.   Fast-forward more than 2\1/2\ years, here we are less than a month  from the deadline, and we are just now voting on a bill to address  these legacy contracts for the transition from LIBOR.                                time  1145    This is Washington and, frankly, the process at its worst.   So how did we get here? Every day, thousands of financial contracts  attach LIBOR as the interest rate. With LIBOR phasing out, the  financial system needs legal certainty on what happens to those legacy  contracts that have this rate already baked in.   This bill attempts to provide a solution. It offers an alternative  rate to affected parties who cannot agree on a rate to replace LIBOR.   To be clear, the rate offered under this legislation is one option.  It does not prevent these parties from agreeing to something better  that suits those particular needs of that contract.   Again, this bill was passed out of committee in July. Now, 4 months  later, the Committees on Ways and Means and Education and Labor were  finally able to include their portions of this. That is 4 months of  inaction that has caused some of that now, today, concern by many on  this side of the aisle.   To make this situation more frustrating, we still don't know where  the Senate stands. I don't, the chair doesn't, and certainly the  industry doesn't know where the Senate is. Frankly, maybe the Senate  doesn't know itself. But, hopefully, today will spur them into this  conversation.  [[Page H7484]]    The bottom line is this process could have been much, much better. In  fact, it should have been much, much better. It must be better when we  are talking about preventing systemic risk to our financial system.   Our regulators who supervise the financial system have stated that  this is a satisfactory fix, but I would wager a bitcoin that they  aren't happy with how we arrived here today.   As a whole, I would like to thank the regulators for their hard work,  and, in fact, I do believe that this bill would not be here today  without their guidance. But this is not the process that Financial  Services Committee Republicans would have pursued, and it is certainly  not quite the bill that we would have drafted. But there are trillions  of dollars at stake, and the safety and soundness of our financial  system is at the stake, and here we are with an eleventh hour scramble  again. Unfortunately, that seems to define how Washington, D.C., is  being run today.   I will not stand in the way of this process, of allowing this  process, and the progress for our regulators to be able to supervise  this financial system. But I do encourage my Republican colleagues to  trust our regulators and support this legislation despite having some  doubts about the process of what we are seeing here today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I will reserve my comments for our  colloquy, but the gentleman certainly knows that communication has been  slim at best between staff and Members.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), who is a leader on this issue.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the gentleman at this point to  engage in a colloquy if he is so willing.    I know this is an issue that is both thrilling and  exciting, but let me just state that the problem I am hearing from some  of my colleagues is they don't necessarily understand the depth,  breadth, and work that has gone into this for years prior to this. They  know that it is showing up. They are questioning whether there was a  hearing; they are questioning whether there was a proper markup; and  sadly, they are questioning that because it seems to be following a  pattern as of late. That is why there are questions.    Mr. Hill, others from the committee, and I are trying to alleviate  that. A number of our colleagues have expressed they haven't had time  to really dive into it and come to us with those types of questions. So  we are trying to deal with that.   But as far as our colloquy here, we both described in our respective  remarks that it is regulators who ultimately worked on that.   Mr. Chairman, is that correct?    I yield to the gentleman from California.    Yes, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, OCC,  FHA, CFPB, and, of course, the Fed. I appreciate the technical advice  that each of them has lent and, ultimately, their comments. They  actually reviewed every change that was made to this bill as sufficient  to address the issue.   It is fair to say that it is a fix that these regulators have  requested. Is that fair?    Let's turn to the Senate here.   It is my understanding, however, that there is no consensus in the  Senate and that it is unlikely, frankly, that any action in the Senate  will specifically, exactly reflect this bill.   Would that be a characterization that you have as well?    I think we can let that reflect as a yes.   The Senate will probably be acting. We know that they will be acting,  as has been expressed by the players on the Senate.    Please.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time on that; that would be  my understanding of that. And a concern that I had of not having  ``coercion'' is the word that I would use, that private entities could  be coerced into using a particular declared rate.   Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. And  I will just make a few final points on this bill.   There are trillions of dollars that are caught up in this, and this  is about the safety and soundness of our financial system. Whether it  is mortgages, car loans, you name it, this is an international stage  where this is being played out on.   And as I have said, we could do better than an eleventh-hour  scramble; should have done better than an eleventh-hour scramble, but  here we are.   Again, this is not the process that I would have chosen or my  colleagues on the Republican side would have pursued. It is not the  bill necessarily that we would have drafted. But I will not stand in  the way of allowing our regulators to supervise the financial system  within checks, within proper checks.   This is not giving them free rein. I do expect that there will be  changes to occur from the Senate. I look forward to hearing and  listening to the regulators on those changes.   I do encourage my Republican colleagues to listen to our regulators,  but, more so, listen to your Republican colleagues who have been  working on this issue. And I ask that they support this legislation.  [[Page H7486]]    And, no, we will not see an increase in government. No, we will not  see an increase in the regulatory footprint. It clarifies how we are  going to be dealing with and how these private companies are going to  need to move forward with the legacy contracts that they have that no  longer are within the parameters that are allowed because of this fraud  that had happened within the LIBOR system.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding, and  I don't know how you follow   Andy Barr and that story.   Madam Speaker, Andy talked a lot about Carol, as he should, but we  also want to talk about him and how he responded.   This is an opportunity to turn a tragedy into hope. And there are a  lot of people that would be too bitter, too angry, too frustrated, too  betrayed to take that opportunity and refocus it and turn it into help  for others. Madam Speaker, Andy is doing that, and he is showing his  daughters what his wife would do.   So to those of us who knew her, he is absolutely right, I can still  hear in my mind's ear this, ``just get it done.'' It would be a  desperate tone sometimes, ``just get it done.''   But the words that I think of as I was sitting here, and I have sort  of thrown aside all the prepared remarks, and I want to speak from the  heart. I just started writing down a few words.    Passionate, patriot, fierce--not mean, but fierce--and  focused. She was a leader of teams, but a leader of her family, too.   And, Madam Speaker, that is Andy. He has been forced into some roles  that he was not expecting he was going to have to take care of. And  this is what he does best. He throws himself in. He dives in, and he  works hard to help others. And that, too, is a legacy, a legacy for  Carol and for the girls.   And for Eleanor and Mary Clay, may they know that their mom loved  them. She loved them. And their dad loves them. And Carol is not with  us today, but she is not gone because we won't forget her. And we will  make sure her legacy continues.   Madam Speaker, we love Andy, and we are here for him. I am so  grateful we can help so many others around the country.
