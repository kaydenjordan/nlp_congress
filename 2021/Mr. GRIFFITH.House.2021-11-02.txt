 Mr. Speaker, I offer these remarks today to honor the  bravery and selfless service of the law enforcement officers and other  first responders that worked to ensure the safety of the residents of  Buchanan County during the horrendous flooding caused by heavy rainfall  in the small town of Hurley, Virginia, on August 30, 2021.   Their efforts saved lives and were core to rescue and recovery  following the destructive power of the flood. Particularly, I honor  Buchanan County Sheriff John McClanahan, Deputy Raymond Webb, Deputy  Lieutenant Brandon Hall, Deputy Lieutenant Ryan Mitchell, Deputy Billy  Owens, Deputy Aaron Skeens, Deputy Andy Webb, Deputy John Hagy III, and  Deputy Tasha Meadows.   The excessive rainfall resulted in blocked roadways, numerous  landslides, and severe flooding in the town of Hurley. There were  school closures from the storm as well. All of this caused devastating  damage and jeopardized the safety of many.   In the face of danger, these officers and first responders of  Buchanan County displayed great heroism by rescuing a number of  citizens from harm's way. The storm caused a level of flooding in  Hurley which has not been seen for nearly 20 years and matched any  level of devastation from a natural disaster that I have seen in the  Ninth Congressional District of Virginia.   Hundreds of residents had to evacuate their homes. As many as a  thousand were left without power and drinking water, and I saw roughly  20 homes that had been uprooted from their foundations. But the  terrible flood was also an occasion of heroism and helping others.  Besides the deputies and the sheriff, around 500 volunteers lent their  time to rescue and cleanup efforts.   Mr. Speaker, let me highlight one remarkable rescue from the flooding  on Monday, August 30, 2021, involving a woman trapped in her home.   The woman's mobile home had been swept off its foundation, carried  downstream, and when it crashed into a railroad trestle, the home, with  the woman inside of it, was caught between the raging water and the  train trestle. The home would have continued further downstream if it  had not been trapped at the trestle. And as officers quickly arrived on  the scene, her home was already little more than rubble.   As the water thundered by and the rain continued to pour down, the  trailer, surrounded by water, was precariously positioned and appeared  ready to collapse completely at any moment. Amid this peril, the  officers showed no regard for their own safety as they came to the  rescue.   Deputy Raymond Webb was first to arrive on the scene. He crossed the  railroad tracks, climbed over to where the collapsed home remained,  with water raging around, and was able to cut a hole in the roof of  what was left of the house.   Shortly after, Sheriff John McClanahan and Deputies Skeens, Meadows,  Hall, Mitchell, Owens, Webb, and Hagy arrived at the scene to assist  with the rescue. Deputy Raymond Webb tied a rope around the woman,  while the rest of the officers and personnel retrieved her and pulled  her out of the trailer and up to safety. Thanks to the rapid response  of these officers from the Buchanan County Sheriff's Office, she was  rescued from the battered trailer.   Mr. Speaker, this storm was devastating for the town of Hurley. In a  time when the community was in great need, these officers courageously  came together to do their utmost to ensure the safety and security of  those who were in harm's way.   I offer my gratitude to the officers from the Buchanan County  Sheriff's Office, as well as all the community leaders and first  responders that played a hand in keeping Hurley safe on that day and  the days that followed.                            ____________________
