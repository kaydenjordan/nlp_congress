 Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the loss of a  public servant, veteran, and good man, Paul Joseph Gilmer, Jr., and  recognize his years of service to the people of West Virginia.   Paul's life serves as an example to those who strive to be the change  they want to see in their communities. He was an active member and  leader of several community organizations and a mentor to innumerable  Charleston youth. Furthermore, he was a family man whose memory and  legacy will live on through his wife, children, grandchildren, and all  those who knew and loved him.   A lifelong resident of Charleston, Paul went to Dunbar High School  before serving in the U.S. Army. He returned to the Kanawha Valley to  continue his education, graduating from West Virginia State University  with a bachelor's degree, and went on to work for IBM for 25 years.   Following his career with IBM, Paul entered public service and worked  for the city of Charleston in the city manager and mayor's offices  before being elected as a city councilman. He was the executive  director of the Community Council of Kanawha Valley, Inc., and senior  vice president of the United Way of Kanawha Valley. An entrepreneur,  Paul was also the owner of Business, Tax and Accounting Services, as  well as PJ Gilmer, Inc.   Beyond his career, Paul devoted his time to various community  organizations, serving in leadership capacities at the Kanawha Valley  Collective, the National Association of Planning and Research Councils,  the West Virginia Center for Civic Life, and the Schoenbaum Family  Enrichment Center, among many others. He also served as a volunteer  manager of several youth sports programs, impacting the lives of the  next generation by his example and his message of working tirelessly to  effect positive change.   Above all, however, Paul was a family man. He leaves behind his wife  of 45 years, Linda, as well as his children Batese, Melissa, Ryan,  Charles, Shawn, and Anthony, and their children. He is also survived by  his mother and four siblings.   Paul told the young men and women he mentored ``not to achieve, but  overachieve,'' in order to do something positive with their lives.  Paul's life was a testament to his message, as he overachieved in  making Charleston, WV, a stronger community. It was an honor to call  him a friend and fellow West Virginian.                            ____________________
