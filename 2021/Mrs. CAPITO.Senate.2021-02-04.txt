 Mr. President, I call up my amendment numbered 655 and  ask that it be reported by number.  [[Page S453]]     Mr. President, we know the burden that implementing the  2015 WOTUS rule would have had on farming, agriculture, energy  production, and construction activities across this country and in our  State of West Virginia. The legal challenges that followed resulted in  years of uncertainty and confusion.   Finally, in 2020, the EPA announced the Navigable Waters Protection  Rule as a replacement. It is clear, commonsense policy, and States like  it. As a matter of fact, the Navigable Waters Rule is now in effect in  49 States. President Biden has revoked President Trump's executive  order that led to the Navigable Waters Rule, making it likely the rule  will be revisited in this administration. Replacing this Navigable  Waters Rule with something like the 2015 WOTUS rule would completely  redefine and reframe all water policy and devastate farmers,  manufacturers, and small business owners.   We have had enough uncertainty. Let's not create more. This amendment  would preserve the continued implementation of the Navigable Waters  Rule. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
