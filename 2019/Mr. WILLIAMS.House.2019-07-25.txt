 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Michael F. Doyle), and I just want to congratulate the Democrats  for a hard victory.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman used some words over there that I didn't  understand when he said ``generally'' and some other things, but we  will talk about that later. But I congratulate them for their victory.   I also want to congratulate our players for the Republican team. From  March 1 to game day, from 6 to 7:30, they played and practiced, and I  thank the gentleman for their involvement.   I also congratulate the gentleman from the great State of Florida  (Mr. Steube), who was our most valuable player. Mr. Speaker, I asked  him to throw strikes, and he threw strikes and did a great job for us.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to just remind everybody, this is a  bipartisan event--it truly is--and for at least a moment, we come  together to share the love of this country and the love of the great  game of baseball. I want to thank everybody for participating.   The charities were mentioned; the largest amount raised for the  charities since we have been playing this ball game, and that is the  most important thing.   And, also, I want to say to my players, who I dearly love, we come  back, I think, September 3. At 6 will be our first practice, September  3, to begin the journey to victory next year over the Democrats.   I just close with a quote from the great Satchel Paige, a great Hall  of Fame pitcher, who won two games of a doubleheader in 1948. When  asked what his best pitch was, was it his curve ball or his fastball,  he told the press it was neither. ``It was my `be' ball.''   The press said: ``What is your `be' ball?''   He said: ``When I throw it, it goes where I want it to be.''   And where we want to be next year is right over there holding that  trophy, beating the Democrats.                            ____________________
