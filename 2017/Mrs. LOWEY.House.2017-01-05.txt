 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of today's  bipartisan measure. There are no shortcuts to peace. Only the Israelis  and the Palestinians can resolve their complicated differences through  direct negotiation. That is why it has been longstanding policy to  defend our ally Israel against one-sided U.N. Security Council  resolutions seeking to impose solutions.   Last year, Congresswoman Granger and I led a letter to President  Obama signed by 394 Members of this body  [[Page H162]]  cautioning against one-sided U.N. initiatives that dangerously hinder  the prospects for resuming direct negotiations. I believe the  administration's abstention is a stain on our country's long and  consistent record.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch).
