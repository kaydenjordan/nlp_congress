 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, I joined with President Biden,  Senator Gillibrand, and New York officials on one of the most difficult  and painful trips imaginable.   Visiting Buffalo 3 days after the worst mass shooting in its history  was harrowing. I met a young boy, just 3 years old, who I learned lost  his dad on Saturday because his dad was at Tops supermarket buying a  birthday cake for the 3-year-old boy--a routine errand for a joyous  occasion, something every parent looks forward to. In the blink of an  eye, his life was unfairly and cruelly taken away simply because he was  Black and in a supermarket.   It is tempting to think that this evil is beyond comprehension, but  we know it is just not true. We know the shooter drew from the same  wells of hate and White supremacy that inspired other shootings in El  Paso, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Charleston, and other communities. By now,  we know the shooter was inspired by a deranged conspiracy theory known  as the ``great replacement.'' Indeed, in his online posts, he labeled  the people he targeted as ``replacers.''   But the truth is that you don't need to visit the dark corners of the  internet to see these White supremacist views anymore. You can find  replacement theory on cable networks like FOX News, where Tucker  Carlson used White replacement rhetoric on at least 400 episodes of his  show. You can hear it at most Trump rallies every time the Republican  standard-bearer vilifies undocumented immigrants and spreads the lie  that they stole the 2020 election. Last night, the GOP in Pennsylvania  nominated a hard-right disciple of the Big Lie as their candidate for  Governor. You can also find many examples of replacement theory on  Twitter. One House Member said in April that Tucker Carlson ``is  CORRECT about Replacement Theory as he explains what is happening to  America.''   The radical views of MAGA Republicans are taking over the GOP like a  cancer. We saw it play out earlier this month in the wake of the  Supreme Court's possible elimination of Roe, as they suggested national  bans on abortion and championed restrictions without exceptions for  rape or incest. Now we are seeing it here, as MAGA Republicans openly  champion a repressive and conspiratorial view of who deserves to be  called American.   To its credit, the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board wrote a few  days ago that politicians have an ``obligation'' to condemn  conspiracies like White replacement theory. But 4 days after the  shooting in Buffalo, it is dangerous and disturbing to see that many on  the right have pointedly refused to condemn replacement theory. This  should be the easiest thing in the world to do, but many on the right,  including too many in this Chamber, can't seem to bring themselves to  say the obvious: that White replacement theory is evil and has no place  in our politics, and any candidate or pundit who spreads it should be  resoundingly condemned.   We are waiting to hear more of our colleagues condemn the MAGA right  and condemn this horrible replacement theory. So far, there is just too  much silence, even though a few have.

I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum calls  for the cloture motions filed today, May 18, be waived.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time  to be determined by the majority leader in consultation with the  Republican leader, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider  Calendar No. 461, Marsha Stephens Bloom Bernicat, to be Director  General of the Foreign Service; that there be 10 minutes of debate,  equally divided in the usual form, on the nomination; that upon the use  or yielding back of time, the Senate vote without intervening action or  debate on the nomination, and the Senate resume legislative session.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 885, 541,  771, 926; that the Senate vote on the nominations en bloc without  intervening action or debate; that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table; that any statements related to  the nominations be printed in the Record; that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate resume  legislative session.    Now, Madam President, we have just confirmed Bridget A.  Brink, of Michigan, to become the Ambassador to Ukraine. This was very  important. I am so glad we could finally do this by unanimous consent.   As we all know, the relationships between the United States and  Ukraine are so vital, and to have no Ambassador really hinders our  relationship in ways that nobody would want to see.   To have an Ambassador there at this crucial link, as the United  States continues to help the Ukrainian people resist brutal and vicious  attacks by Russia, is a wonderful thing, a good thing, and will help  advance the cause of peace, security, and freedom.   So I am very glad that we did this, and I congratulate Bridget A.  Brink. I have every confidence that she will be an outstanding  Ambassador and help Ukraine overcome the attacks by Putin.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship be discharged from  further consideration and that the Senate now proceed to S.
