 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to deliver the closing  installment of my farm bill impact series for the 117th Congress. In  2022, I delivered 15 speeches on this House floor about various farm  bill programs and titles that I believe Congress must understand and  support ahead of the 2023 reauthorization.   In Congress, we deal with the laws of the land--and that is  important--but farmers are the caretakers of the land itself. Farmers  built our history, sustain our present, and secure our future. They  deserve the unwavering support of Congress in the form of legislation  that supports their tireless efforts to feed, fuel, and clothe the  world. That means keeping crop insurance strong, supporting robust  trade programs, and ensuring that producers are not being hamstrung by  burdensome overregulation.   Early in my speech series, I highlighted crop insurance first.  Keeping this program strong is my highest priority for the 2023 farm  bill. Crop insurance helps producers manage the risks that they face  every day from weather, pests, disease, and market volatility. It is  also a great example of a successful public-private partnership.  Agricultural producers have a fickle partner in Mother Nature, who  doesn't always cooperate, and crop insurance helps producers stay  afloat when disaster strikes.    Shortly after my crop insurance speech, I spoke about trade programs  which serve to spearhead innovative market access, new market  development, and promote agricultural sales overseas. Each year $140  billion worth of agricultural products are exported. My State of Kansas  is known as the Wheat State, and 50 percent of all wheat sold in the  U.S. is exported. So Congress must think critically and carefully about  the international components of the trade title. Trade programs, which  have longstanding records of success in America, also represent the  partnership between the public and private sectors of our country, just  like crop insurance.   The biggest threat to American agriculture, however, isn't a scarcity  of natural resources or bad weather, but Federal Government overreach.  The Biden administration has tried to dismantle the stepped-up basis  and impose a farm killer capital gains tax on American producers that  would destroy thousands of family farms overnight; the definition of  waters of the U.S. keeps changing, and now the Federal Government would  like to tell farmers what to do with their puddles; animals, like the  lesser prairie-chicken, are being added to the endangered species list;  and fertilizer and other inputs--even if you can get them--are often so  expensive that they can't be afforded by agricultural producers.  Government overreach has created a tornado of chaos, and my producers  are in its path of destruction.   Mr. Speaker, I am standing here today, and will continue to stand  here, advocating for American farmers, ranchers, and agricultural  producers because they are the lifeblood of this country. They keep us  fed, fueled, and clothed. And they have earned the unwavering support  of Congress.   I will be delivering more installments of my farm bill impact series  in the 118th Congress, and I look forward to the 2023 reauthorization  of the farm bill because it is an opportunity for Congress to say  unequivocally that we stand with our farmers.                 Recognizing Legislative Assistant Cale Beam     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and thank Cale Beam  for his service to me, my office, and the great people of the First  District of Kansas.   Cale was on my team since my first day in Congress, and he has  consistently brought an eloquent and thoughtful approach to his  research, writing, and recommendations. He has a genuine and kind  spirit, a clever sense of humor, and a wisdom that is beyond his years.   I am so excited to see what lies ahead for Cale, and I know that with  his skill set, he will go far.   Cale, like me, is a man of faith. I want to send him off on his new  adventure with these two brief thoughts from the Scriptures.   First, God works all things to good for those who love Him.   Second, delight yourself in the Lord, and He will give you the  desires of your heart.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Cale. My first session in Congress would not  have been the same without him. I will miss him, and I wish him all the  best with his new pursuit.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1156.   Twenty years ago, Kansas legend and hero of mine Senator Bob Dole and  Senator George McGovern reached across the aisle to gather bipartisan  support for their noble idea to have the U.S. Department of Agriculture  purchase surplus American commodities from producers and donate those  products to countries across the globe struggling with food security.   Since then, the McGovern-Dole Program has provided 5.5 billion school  meals to 31 million school-age children in 48 countries, improving the  food security, nutrition, literacy, and primary education of these  children and their families.    Codified as part of 2002 farm bill, the program is an ongoing,  successful example of public-private partnerships. The U.S. Department  of Agriculture works alongside nonprofit organizations, cooperatives,  and organizations like the World Food Programme, Catholic Relief  Services, World Vision, Save the Children, Mercy Corps, and many more  to provide school meals, teacher training, and related support to  bolster school enrollment and academic performance, all to keep kids  fed and learning.   Just in the past 2 months, I have heard nothing but excitement about  this program from both wheat farmers at home and sorghum producers who  visited with me in my office here in Washington, D.C. There is a reason  all commodity groups and humanitarian aid organizations support moving  this legislation forward.   Whether it is wheat and sorghum from Kansas, red beans from  Louisiana, or peanut butter formula made from Georgia peanuts, American  agricultural producers are vital to the success of the McGovern-Dole  Program. Since the program's inception, they have proudly donated more  than 1.3 metric tons of commodities to create nutritious school meals.   Representative McGovern and I, along with 86 cosponsors, have brought  this resolution forward to the House to express this body's commitment  to build on the success of the McGovern-Dole Program and to support the  American farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers who provide the  commodities required for it to function.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  resolution and to support this program's success for 20 more years and  beyond, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer).    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   It has been a privilege to advocate for this resolution today. The  McGovern-Dole program absolutely deserves the recognition of Congress  for its wide support and bipartisan nature.   It is not often that you can go to a grain elevator in Kansas to  speak with commodity groups and visit with nuns from Catholic Charities  in Washington, D.C. and hear them both advocating for the exact same  program. More than 200 commodity groups, trade associations,  humanitarian groups, and businesses support this program for its merits  and support today's resolution.   This resolution honors the positive impact that we can have when we  reach across the aisle and work together. Senators Bob Dole and George  [[Page H9722]]  McGovern had a brilliant vision, and they executed on it. It has been a  joy to work with Representative McGovern and more than 86 cosponsors on  today's resolution.   Today, we honor the 20th anniversary of the McGovern-Dole program  because it is a shining example of strategic and effective foreign  diplomacy that we can all support. Today, I urge all my colleagues to  vote ``yes'' on this simple bipartisan resolution.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
