 Madam President, I ask permission to speak as in  morning business for 3 minutes.    Madam President, I come to the floor to recognize the  accomplishments of an organization that has done great service to  communities and veterans across the United States.   This month marks 100 years since the American Legion received its  charter from Congress and formally adopted its constitution. When it  was established in Paris in March of 1919, the American Legion stated  its aims, in part, ``to perpetuate the principles of justice, freedom,  and democracy for which we have fought.''   The accomplishments of the American Legion since that time are  numerous and profound. They include successfully lobbying for the  creation of what was then called the Veterans Bureau, which would later  become the VA, the Department of Veterans Affairs.   The American Legion also conducted pioneering research into PTSD and  drafted the original GI bill that helped to educate so many World War  II veterans after that war and gave a big boost to the expanding U.S.  economy post-World War II.   American Legion members complete 3.7 million hours of community  service each year. I happen to be a member of the Sons of the American  Legion. As part of that organization, I am blessed to have had the  American Legion make a meaningful impact in my life.   When I was a young high school student in Iowa, I was proud to  participate in Boys State, where I learned the rights, privileges, and  responsibilities of citizenship. The American Legion still does that  every year in Iowa and I suppose in every State. Iowans are fortunate  to have the enduring presence of the American Legion in our  communities.   This August, two Iowans were recognized nationally for their  dedication to the American Legion. Bruce Feuerbach of Keystone was  elected national vice commander of the American Legion, and Nicole  Clapp of Gladbrook was elected national president of the American  Legion Auxiliary.   Many more accomplishments are sure to come from the American Legion's  Iowa department. I congratulate the American Legion on its 100th year  of service and thank all members for their dedication to Iowa and to  our Nation.   I want to point out that there was a Major General MacNider, Mason  City, IA, who was the fourth national commander of the American Legion  and probably one of those who was dedicated to establishing this  organization early on.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President.    Today I am here to discuss the critical need to protect  American businesses and consumers from the dangers of counterfeits,  particularly counterfeit goods sold online.   Counterfeits do incredible damage to our country's economic  competitiveness. They harm intellectual property right holders and the  reputation of online marketplaces, undermine the integrity of our  supply chains, and even threaten the health and safety of consumers. So  it is Congress's responsibility to use its oversight and legislative  authority to identify ways to prevent these illicit goods from entering  our borders.   Over the past year, I have worked with the Finance Committee Ranking  Member Wyden to investigate how counterfeiters use e-commerce to sell  their phony goods to consumers. Last week, we concluded our  investigation and issued a report detailing our findings.   Based on the information presented to Senator Wyden and this Senator  by right holders, trade associations, e-commerce platforms, and common  carriers, we made five findings in this report, and we identified two  legislative recommendations for Congress in this report. I believe  these recommendations will enhance existing efforts within the Federal  Government to prevent the sale of counterfeits online.   I will talk briefly about our findings today, and I look forward to  working with my colleagues--both Republican and Democrat--to identify  additional areas for congressional action.   As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I recognize the value of  intellectual property rights and their impacts on society and the  economy. Intellectual property rights allow businesses to generate new  ideas and develop creative solutions to everyday problems that can make  our lives healthier, safer, and more productive. I also understand  businesses and innovators rely on those rights to help drive and recoup  their investments.   In my own State of Iowa, intellectual property represents more than  $14.4 billion in annual exports for the State, more than 94,000 jobs,  and supports more than 2,000 small businesses with less than 500  employees. However, counterfeits are increasingly threatening these  achievements and the hard work of the people that innovate. It has been  estimated that international trade for counterfeit goods in 2016  accounted for $509 billion of world trade.   Counterfeits are found in both physical and online marketplaces, and  almost every industry is affected. Scam artists target electronics,  automotive parts, and even children's toys, to rip-off consumers and to  make a profit. Counterfeits can also harm consumers. Many consumers do  not know that counterfeits can be dangerous and that some have been  found to contain lead, excessive small parts, and even unsafe  chemicals.   In 2018, the Government Accountability Office--or GAO, as we know it  around Washington--examined how e-commerce marketplaces are further  enabling the sale of counterfeits. GAO found that counterfeiters use  online marketplaces to sell fakes to consumers because they can hide  their identity by using false or incomplete names. Counterfeiters also  post legitimate photos or fake reviews for their products, which makes  it harder for consumers to determine whether they are buying a  legitimate or fake good.   The Grassley-Wyden investigation showed that the breadth and variety  of goods sold online makes it nearly impossible to prevent the sale of  all counterfeits. Right holders also told us that their enforcement  efforts are hindered in part because the U.S. Customs and Border  Protection shares very limited--and often heavily redacted--importation  information with these right holders. But right holders need  importation information to identify counterfeit sellers and report  suspected counterfeit listings.   Counterfeits also pose a threat to e-commerce and to common carriers.  Counterfeits smear the reputation of e-commerce and threaten the  integrity of the common carrier supply chain network. As such, these  parties are critical partners in the fight against the sale of  counterfeit goods. However, Customs and Border Protection does not have  the authority to share importation information with these parties when  it identifies a counterfeit at our border.   During our investigation, these parties told us that this information  would give them the ability to better protect our country's  intellectual property and allow them to remove more counterfeit  listings and block counterfeit sellers. We must look at this problem  holistically and with the understanding that right holders, e-commerce  platforms, and common carriers are critical partners in the fight  against the sale of counterfeit goods and those counterfeit goods being  sold online. By sharing more importation information, these parties can  better protect the intellectual property rights of our innovators, as  well as the health and safety of e-commerce consumers.   Our investigation is but a first step. I will continue to use my  oversight authority to look for innovative solutions to protect  intellectual property right holders and consumers from the negative  effects of counterfeits.   Madam President, I yield the floor.
