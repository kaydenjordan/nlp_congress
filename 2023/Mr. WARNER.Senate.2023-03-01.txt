 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today in joining my other  colleagues, organized by my friend the Senator from Hawaii, to ask my  colleagues to vote against the resolution, which I think we will be  taking up literally in the next 10 minutes, which would strip away a  commonsense Department of Labor rule that simply provides fiduciaries-- remember who we are talking about: fiduciaries, people who are  responsible, under ERISA plans, to think about their beneficiaries over  the long term. We are trying to make sure that those fiduciaries who  are charged with maintaining retirement plans have the ability to  adequately account for environmental, social, and governance factors.   I know some of my colleagues have come on the floor and said this is  an  [[Page S555]]  attempt by the Department of Labor to somehow mandate the retirement  investments of hard-working Americans. Nothing could be further from  the truth. The truth is, we look at profit and loss, we look at cash  reserves, and we look at financial accounting. But the idea that  environmental, social, and governance factors can't even be looked at  is an interference in the business cycle that really kind of goes  beyond the pale.   I am often regarded--I have to acknowledge this--in my caucus as  sometimes being a Member who has the most experience with capitalism,  the most experience with business. I absolutely believe in our system.  There is nothing better. But the idea that today--and I don't want to  copy some of the comments that have been made, but the idea that today,  a lot of folks who have never been able to read a balance sheet are  going to come in and tell paid fiduciaries what they can consider or  what they can't consider in terms of the long-term economic returns for  their beneficiaries--I wonder if things have gotten a little topsy- turvy here.   I can imagine if some people were saying ``Well, we need to make sure  we have this rule in place'' or ``Overrule this rule'' or ``Put this  binding in place'' if you are talking about day traders or if you are  talking about a hedge fund that only looks at the next quarter's  results--the kind of short-term capitalism that too often, I think, is  eating at the core of our great system. But if we are going to look at  long-term returns, we ought to take and have to take into consideration  factors--in many cases, factors that may not have been as relevant 30,  50, 70 years ago. Some are going to say we can't look at those.   Unfortunately, my colleagues across the aisle have decided to take  away a useful term, a useful set of analyses, something that has been  asked for by these pension funds, by these beneficiaries, and instead  try to turn it into a political issue.   Let me recall back 75 years ago. If you look at the Fortune 500 and  the companies that were involved in that Fortune 500, about roughly 75  to 80 percent of those companies' assets were tangible assets. What  does that mean? It means it was their plant. It was their equipment. It  was their machinery.   Fast-forward--and a lot of this is due to great innovation in the  technology field--and those same Fortune 500 companies are dramatically  different than the companies named 60, 70 years ago. If you look at  their balance sheets today, 75, 80 percent of their assets are  intangible assets. What are intangible assets? Intangible assets are  things like intellectual property, and that is coming about from a  healthy workforce. But more than anything else, it is the men and women  who work at these firms. Virtually every CEO I have heard from in the  last 10 years has said: My biggest asset is my workforce.   The idea that somehow--because ESG is not just E; it is also S, and  that falls into workforce--the idea that somehow a pension fund can't  look at workforce retention, workforce quality, workforce  characteristics as a measure of what they want to invest in, to me, is  a little whacky.    Let me actually call on a reference sort person, whom I hope my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle will acknowledge, and that  was President Trump's Chairman of the SEC, the Securities and Exchange  Commission, Jay Clayton, whom I had a very good working relationship  with. He said that human capital disclosures can and should inform  investment decisions.   Chair Clayton said:         Our current disclosure requirements date back to a time       when companies relied significantly on plant, property, and       equipment to drive value. Today, human capital represents an       essential driver of performance for many companies albeit in       different ways.    So under Mr. Trump's SEC, there was a rulemaking process that started  to make sure that human capital components can be an appropriate focus  of reviews, particularly for companies and entities that want to invest  for the long term.   I am concerned that this approach we are taking today might  indirectly preclude those fiduciaries who represent pension funds,  long-term investors--they are no longer going to be able to actually  look at this critical criteria around human capital.   The other thing is, the Department of Labor rule--and I know a lot of  my colleagues have spoken to this and talk about: Well, what about the  environment? I think we all would recognize or most of us would  recognize the fact that climate change is real and poses a rapidly  growing threat to the long-term feasibility of investments made on  behalf of hard-working Americans.   While this Department of Labor rule won't direct our Armed Forces, I  think it is really important to understand that the FFRDCs, the  federally funded research and development corporations--the RANDs, the  MITREs, the CNA, which does naval work analysis, federally funded--if  we are going to apply these same kinds of Department of Labor  prohibitions on our Armed Forces, we couldn't allow the CNA to look at  the long-term effects on the Navy--and I don't want to give away a  secret here, but they have been looking at this issue for over 20  years--that they couldn't make those kinds of predictions about what  effect sea level rise would have on our Navy.   I tell you, we are blessed in the Commonwealth of Virginia to have  the world's largest Navy base, in Norfolk, and I can assure you,  virtually every year or every other year, we have to raise the piers,  literally spend hundreds of millions of dollars to raise the piers to  make sure that Navy base can still be utilized.   So if it is a smart enough, good enough requirement that the Navy and  our Armed Forces are looking at the E of ESG, why would we preclude the  private sector from doing that?   I think the Department of Labor's rule on ESG is both practical and  necessary. I think those funds that chose not to abide by it, that is  their right. That is what capitalism is all about--making choices. But  the notion that we are going to somehow come in and impose requirements  on the market and take away long-term investors' ability to consider  human capital, to consider the effects of climate change, and I have  not even touched--I know we are going to have to go to a vote--on  issues around corporate governance, all which can lead to, longer term,  better returns. If this was a rule about day traders and quarter-to- quarter hedge fund folks, I might get it. But in terms of protecting  the long-term value creation in long-term sustainable capitalism, I  think this effort today sadly misses the mark and will do a great deal  of damage.   I urge my colleagues, when the vote comes, to vote against the CRA.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
