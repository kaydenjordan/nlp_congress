 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the historic  commission of the USS Frank E. Petersen, Jr. The brave servicemen and  servicewomen of the United States Navy are now in command of an  impressive vessel with an equally impressive namesake.   Lieutenant General Frank E. Petersen, Jr., was an all-American hero  who served with distinction for 38 years. As the first African-American  Marine Corps aviator and first African-American Marine Corps general  officer, Lieutenant General Petersen went above and beyond the call of  duty as a fighter pilot in over 350 combat missions in both the Korean  and Vietnam wars.   For this exemplary service, Lieutenant General Petersen was well  decorated, receiving the Distinguished Service Medal, the Superior  Service Medal, the Purple Heart, as well as numerous others. His  service was exemplary, and the American people are eternally grateful  to him and his commitment to our country.   This vessel will be a mainstay of the U.S. Armed Forces and, as its  namesake did, will overcome all in the pursuit of excellent. As  soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines have done for generations, the  crew members will continue to carry the torch of liberty and defend our  great Nation.              Congratulating the Parris Island Marine Corps Band     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Lowcountry's  best, the Parris Island Marine Corps Band, for their Emmy-nominated  original composition called ``You Were There.'' This piece salutes the  first responders who continued to work at the height of the pandemic,  honoring their commitment to serve and their dedication to serve.   This piece was inspired by Mrs. Lakin Pellon, the wife of the band  director, Chief Warrant Officer Mark Pellon, who worked with COVID-19  patients at the height of the pandemic in Los Angeles, Beaufort, and  Hilton Head Island. Her bravery during the pandemic exemplifies the  spirit of first responders across the Nation. Mrs. Pellon, as well as  so many other first responders from communities just like the  Lowcountry, made sacrifices every day for us, and we owe them an  enormous debt.   The marines who performed this touching piece are the first  responders for the Nation when we have dangers abroad, but it is  remarkable to see their tribute to our first responders at home.   Congratulations on this tremendous honor.                  Recognizing a Tribute to First Responders     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a tribute to first  responders in Charleston during National Police Week. Charleston Mayor  John Tecklenburg partnered with visual artist Kelvin Blufton and  numerous current and former law enforcement officials from across the  Lowcountry for an unveiling of ``ESCAPE.''   ``ESCAPE'' is an exhibit of original paintings of first responders by  Mr. Blufton that is meant to educate young people in the principles of  civil service and the subsequent responsibility of serving in our  community.   ``ESCAPE'' stands for East Side Civic Art Public Engagement and is  tailored to encourage young people to aspire to be first responders in  order to better serve the Lowcountry.   Mayor Tecklenburg and Mr. Blufton are helping to raise the next  generation of public servants, and we couldn't be more thrilled with  the progress they are making. Congratulations to them both on this  amazing unveiling.        Recognizing Battery Creek High School Wildlife Habitat Program     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Battery Creek High  School, a fantastic Lowcountry school in Beaufort, South Carolina, with  an excellent wildlife habitat education program that has recently won  the South Carolina State championship and will be sending four young  men to the national competition in London, Kentucky.   The Wildlife Habitat Education Program is a hands-on environmental  education program that provides students an opportunity to test their  wildlife knowledge. This knowledge is invaluable to young people,  particularly in the Lowcountry, as they learn important lessons about  wildlife management and conservation.   Conservation is an important value we all share in our community, and  these young men are helping to lead the charge in conservation efforts  throughout the Lowcountry and throughout the State of South Carolina.   This championship has meant a great deal to the Beaufort community,  and we couldn't be more proud of our young students.   Congratulations to Hunter Smith, Diego Vega, Hunter Hollingsworth,  Tanner McCracken, and Ms. Beth Ann Melton. We wish all of them the best  at nationals in July and August.                    Recognizing Chris and Sheila Porzuczek     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of the  Lowcountry's businessowners, Chris and Sheila Porzuczek of Tortuga's  Mexican Grill on Edisto Beach.   Last week, Tortuga's donated a portion of their proceeds from an  event which the Edisto Beach Loggerhead Turtle Project held during  Cinco de Mayo called Tacos for Turtles.   This event not only helped to raise money, but also helped raise  awareness of the importance of turtle conservation and keeping the  lights off at night to help prevent confusion for newly hatched turtles  on their way into the ocean.   Despite staffing shortages, which are affecting businesses across the  Lowcountry right now, Chris and Sheila are known as hard workers and  support local nonprofits in the Lowcountry often.   Thank you to Chris and Sheila for their hard work and their  contributions to the Lowcountry.                            ____________________
