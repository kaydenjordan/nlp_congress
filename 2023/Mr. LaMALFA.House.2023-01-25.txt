 Madam Speaker, recently, my home State of California has  suffered from a series of devastating storms on the flood side of the  equation. We received at least 11 inches of rainfall and were hit by  extreme flooding as a result.   Now, in California, unlike any other places, we have a simultaneous  flood emergency and drought emergency; only in modern California. Many  people were forced to evacuate. Twenty people lost their lives.   The damage was extensive, but the real disaster is that we already  know how to reduce the fallout from flood events. If we built more  water storage, such as Sites Reservoir, raising Shasta Dam, et cetera,  we could store more of this rainfall that would not become floodwater,  rather than also allowing it to flush out to the ocean where we will  need that water in a regular drought period for agriculture, et cetera.   Storing water from these storms also allows us to weather our  periodic droughts, such as in San Luis Reservoir. If we could run the  pumps hard enough, we could be filling that facility.   So, again, that removes water from a flood zone and puts it into a  good place where we can use the water.   We get fatalities from these disasters; they flood out roads; they do  destructive damage to infrastructure.   We need better evacuation routes for people. We need to think ahead  and plan for storage and for flood infrastructure, instead of letting  climate change and environmental issues stop it.                            ____________________
