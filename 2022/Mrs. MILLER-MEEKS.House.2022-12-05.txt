 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Oleh, or  ``Odee,'' Shtefanchuk from Chernivtsi, Ukraine.   Odee is currently a foreign exchange student who is studying at WACO  Community High School in Wayland, Iowa.   Growing up, Odee heard of American football, and when he enrolled at  WACO Community High School, his friends convinced him to try out for  the football team.   Even though Odee is still learning the rules and procedures, he has  been instrumental in leading the Warriors in an undefeated season and  an appearance in the State title game.   I thank the coaches, the faculty, and the students of WACO Community  High School for showing Odee why Iowa is the best place to work, live,  play, and raise a family.   I would also acknowledge December 7 as Pearl Harbor Day, a day that  we should long remember as it cements to us the importance of our  rights under our Constitution.                            ____________________
