 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding.   This is a wonderful opportunity for me to come and to congratulate  the chair, my colleague, Senator Warnock, and my colleague, Nikema  Williams, for the naming of the VA Medical Center of Atlanta the Joseph  Maxwell Cleland Atlanta Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center.   Senator Cleland and I were friends. He was my friend, he was my  mentor, and he was truly an inspiration.   I had the opportunity to know him. He served as secretary of state  for the State of Georgia for 12 years. During that time, I was in the  Georgia General Assembly. When he was elected to the United States  Senate in 1996, I had the occasion to be a colleague with him as I was  a Member of the House of Representatives.   He truly represented and embodied what it meant to be a veteran:  service and sacrifice.   He was a triple amputee because of his wounds in Vietnam as a veteran  and, of course, he was appointed by President Carter to head the VA. Of  course, he served as the head of the American Battle Monuments  Commission and I, as a member of the Military Construction/Veterans'  Affairs Committee, had to work with him in making sure that these  monuments were well-funded and well-maintained. He did a tremendous  job.   Mr. Speaker, I had to come and speak because he was my friend, and he  was my colleague and my inspiration. It is very, very fitting that this  facility should be named for him because of his legacy.   Longfellow wrote:       ``Lives of great men all remind us, we can make our lives             sublime, and, departing, leave behind us, footprints on             the sands of time.''    Senator Cleland lost both legs and an arm, but the footprints that he  left and is leaving are his legacy for veterans that will be there  forever. I am happy to urge my colleagues to support this legislation  which appropriately names the facility in his honor.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   I am honored to speak in support of S. 4359 to rename the VA's  Atlantic regional office after a good and great man, the late Senator  Johnny Isakson.   This is a companion bill to one that I introduced in the House with  my colleague across the aisle, Congressman Rick Allen, and which the  entire Georgia congressional delegation cosponsored.   A son of Georgia, Johnny Isakson was born in Atlanta and graduated  from the University of Georgia. He was first a businessman and then a  public servant.   I served with him in the Georgia General Assembly and then in the  United States Congress where he served as a Congressman and as a U.S.  Senator.   We stood side by side in support of Georgia's military bases,  families, and veterans. Together we worked on many projects to improve  the lives of Georgians and Americans.   During his many years as a public servant and as the chair of the  Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, he worked tirelessly on behalf of  the Nation's most deserving citizens: our military veterans.   It is fitting that we are taking up consideration of this bill just  as we conclude commemorating Veterans Day. One of the fundamental ways  Congress can demonstrate its thanks to our veterans is to provide the  care they have earned and deserved.   Renaming the VA facility in Atlanta after Senator Isakson is a  fitting recognition of his service to our country and his lifelong work  ensuring Congress upholds America's commitment to its veterans. I am  proud to call Johnny a friend, and I know he continues to look down on  us. I hope that we are inspired by his example to always give our best  to our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and to honor  Johnny Isakson's legacy of service.
