 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the men and  women of ICE who courageously serve our country every single day.   Recently, ICE agents have been the targets of vicious name-calling  and partisan attacks. Some have even described ICE as a terrorist  organization. To make matters worse, some politicians in Washington are  now calling on Congress to abolish ICE.   But just last year, Mr. Speaker, an overwhelming bipartisan majority  in the House, including Leader Pelosi, voted to authorize ICE into law  for the first time. This kind of dishonest double standard is politics  at its worst.                                time  1415    Abolishing ICE is a reckless and dangerous idea that jeopardizes the  safety of American communities.   ICE was originally formed after 9/11 to help secure our homeland.   When I was a Federal prosecutor with the Joint Terrorism Task Force,  ICE was instrumental in deporting potential terrorists on immigration  violations. Today, ICE agents stop drug smugglers, murderers, human  traffickers, and dangerous gangs like MS-13 along our border.   In 2017 alone, ICE agents stopped almost 1 million pounds of  narcotics, including opioids, from entering our country. This included  7,000 pounds of heroin and 2,400 pounds of fentanyl. They arrested  nearly 5,000 gang members and identified or rescued over 500 victims of  trafficking.   These are not just hollow statistics. These numbers represent the  great work and positive impact that ICE has on people's lives.   John Kennedy, the great President, a Democrat, talked about profiles  in courage. I would argue a ``present'' vote is hardly a profile in  courage.  [[Page H6490]]
