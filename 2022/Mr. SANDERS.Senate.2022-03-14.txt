 Madam President, since 2010, I have sponsored a  State of the Union essay contest for Vermont high school students. This  contest gives students in my State the opportunity to articulate what  issues they would prioritize if they were President of the United  States.   This is the contest's 12th year, and I would like to congratulate the  409 students who participated. It is truly heartening to see so many  young people engaged in finding solutions for the problems that face  our country. To my mind, this is what democracy is all about.   I am very proud to enter into the Congressional Record the essays  submitted by these Vermont high school students.   The material follows:        Winner, Sasha Lann, Brattleboro Union High School, Sophomore         Citizens' rights to vote may be the most fundamental aspect       of our democracy, but there is a growing effort to limit it.       Increasing voter suppression and restrictive voting laws is       an issue that must be addressed, as it has grown from a       gradual build to a rush of constant new legislation that       could do permanent damage if ignored. Voter suppression is       one of the United States' biggest threats to democracy, and       the way to address it may be to enact legislation that       ensures all Americans have equal access to voting and have       their votes counted.        Recently, the United States has seen a massive uptick in       legislation restricting voting in large sections of the       country. In 2021 alone, 99 bills were introduced in 31 states       to restrict voting. 34 were passed into law. The laws       strengthen ID requirements, limit drop boxes and mail voting,       increase opportunities for voter purges, and introduce       criminal penalties for election officers who help voters       return mail ballots. These laws excessively target BIPOC       communities. Young voters are also made vulnerable by this       legislation. This attack on our voting system, though       disproportionately affecting communities of color, will harm       the entire country and make us vulnerable to authoritarianism       and the collapse of our democracy altogether.        Enacting effective voting rights legislation can be a       lengthy and difficult process. There are already bills in       progress that have passed the House, but are being blocked by       Republicans via the filibuster. As soon as the filibuster can       be changed, we can continue to make progress. In the       meantime, the best solution may be to do what we can to       prevent lawmakers from signing more restrictive legislation       into law. Part of this solution relies on companies ending       support and campaign contributions for lawmakers responsible       for this legislation. Companies and businesses could play an       essential role in standing up to these efforts. However,       community and business support will not be enough to prevent       suppressive legislation for long.        There are several solutions that could stop the onslaught       of voter restriction laws long term, starting with federal       legislation to protect voting rights and remove obstacles for       those facing difficulty casting votes. There should be laws       to enforce automatic registration, restore voter rights for       former prisoners, and increase resources for election boards       to ensure security. Election Day could also be made a holiday       so citizens have free time to vote, and each state should set       up independent redistricting commissions to avoid       gerrymandering. If used together, these methods will greatly       improve access to voting. Voter suppression and restrictive       voting laws are threatening the integrity of our democracy,       and we can counteract them by passing legislation that       protects citizens' say in the course of the country through       their votes. If nothing is done, we may see the fall of our       democracy as we know it. These are the steps needed to be       taken to preserve this cornerstone of our country.   Second Place, Eva Frazier, Champlain Valley Union High School, Senior         In the past few months, millions of people have lost rights       over their bodies, their health, and their futures. As       countless states across the country move to almost totally       limit abortion, I fear for all people who may become pregnant       in these affected areas. I fear for those without money to       travel to obtain a safe abortion, for those expectant mothers       experiencing a medical condition forced to choose between       their life or their child's, and for the youth without proper       education, suddenly finding themselves with no choice over       their lives.        Two things happen when politicians ban or block abortions:       unsafe abortions or children being born to people who can't       take care of them. Many will die, and it is almost always       poor, BIPOC, and marginalized people. The state of       reproductive rights in this country is an aggressive       violation of human rights.        To combat the alarming issues affecting reproductive rights       locally, nationally, and internationally, I would propose a       three-tiered approach to provide reproductive services to all       who need them. First, at the state level, Vermont needs to       amend our state Constitution, and protect the right to       abortion, without barrier, forever. If Vermont state       legislators succeed in passing this amendment, currently       known as Prop 5, Vermont will become the first state to       protect the right to reproductive health care access. In       addition to legally protecting the right to abortion, Vermont       state legislators must increase the budget for health care       centers that perform abortions.        Nationally, Congress must pass two pieces of legislation.       First, Congress must repeal the Hyde Amendment. As the ACLU       states, ``Passed by Congress in 1976, the Hyde Amendment       excludes abortion from the comprehensive health care services       provided to low-income people by the Federal Government       through Medicaid.'' Low-income people are the least likely to       have transportation and funds to obtain an abortion, and the       Hyde amendment keeps low income people from having equal       access to determine their futures.        Reproductive rights are not only at stake nationally, but       internationally. Currently, the U.S. will not fund any       international health care centers that provide abortions,       which often then prohibits them from providing lifesaving       treatments for malaria, HIV/AIDS, and other medical care.       This draconian policy, known as the Global Gag Rule, was       first introduced by President Reagan, and recently reinstated       by President Trump. U.S. congressional representatives have a       duty to pass legislation, known as the Global HER Act, that       would overturn the Global Gag Rule, and cement the U.S. as a       country that provides necessary foreign aid, instead of       risking millions of lives.        As people turn to illegal abortions, it is crucial that       lawmakers work to protect their citizens by passing federal       law and upholding the International Human Rights declaration,       giving humans freedom over their bodies and health care       choices.      Third Place, Samuel Leggett, Woodstock Union High School, Junior         Throughout history, America has been plagued with the       complex issue of food insecurity. Moreover, the children of       our nation--the ambassadors to our future--seem to experience       it more severely. According to Feeding America, one in every       eight adults  [[Page S1151]]       currently faces hunger, and the same can be said for one in       six children. Furthermore, hunger in our youth has only       festered with the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Compared       to 10 million previously, the number of food-insecure       children in America has increased to approximately 12       million. Notwithstanding our nation's immense prosperity and       value for education, our students experience inaccessibility       to affordable, nutritious food, and are seldom provided with       the assistance they need.        Though the discussion of universal free meals has long       existed, the pandemic proved to be the catalyst for its       execution. Through action on behalf of the U.S. Department of       Agriculture, our government will provide free breakfast and       lunch to schools nationwide throughout the 2021-2022 school       year. Students now have the opportunity to be created equal       in their education and wellbeing. Recent studies from the       Robert Wood Johnson Foundation have concluded that the       initiative has even improved both student behavior and       performance. Though abundant are the benefits of this Covid-      mitigation strategy, the implementation of universal school       meals is still seen as a temporary measure. Even long after       these challenging times, however, the pandemic's       repercussions will persist, if not worsen, if not addressed.       Though they may initially seem like a significant financial       hurdle, universal school meals are a progressive, bipartisan,       and necessary first effort in resolving the issue of food       insecurity.        One significant advantage to implementing universal free       meals is that it would permanently eliminate the nation's       preexisting free and reduced lunch system--an inequitable,       stigma-inducing program designed to assist students facing       hunger. With strict eligibility requirements, free and       reduced meals were rarely provided to all those who needed       them, and the income-based aid system couldn't accurately       account for criteria-meeting households that were       nevertheless food insecure for other reasons. Additionally,       applications for the program were not required, which       excluded many more who potentially qualified, yet didn't       apply. The program offered no way to adequately gauge whether       or not one needed assistance.        Nonetheless, there remains one primary barrier to the       support of universal free meals: their funding. Taxpayers       fear they would wholly assume the burden of a potentially       expensive feat. However, only 0.3 percent of the federal       budget is currently reserved for child nutrition programs,       and this cost is distributed nationwide among taxpayers.       Evidently, reapportionment of the budget to increase this       expenditure would neither reduce spending allocated to other       departments nor increase local tax rates greatly.        We must allow ourselves to imagine an America where a free       meal, despite the traditional adage, is indeed possible; an       America that ensures our youth's prosperity, during and       following times of crisis. We must consider the future, and       pass sustainable, logical legislation; legislation providing       every student with the baseline liberty of a satisfied       stomach in their daily pursuit of knowledge.                                 Finalists             jackson bennett, vergennes union high school, junior         We have all seen the images; sea turtles with straws jammed       in their noses, fish entrapped within plastic six-pack yokes,       even whales with bellies full of plastic trash. There is no       doubt that our plastic pollution is not just a problem, it is       a calamity. According to USA Today, ``Different kinds of       plastic take anywhere between 400 and 1,000 years to degrade       in a landfill . . . So much plastic is thrown away every year       that it's enough to circle the Earth four times.'' That means       at least 6.3 billion metric tons of plastic waste is being       added by the day. Something must be done, but what? I believe       that there should be a national ban on plastic, or some other       government-controlled incentive to switch to plastic       alternatives.        There are many existing plastic alternatives already       available, but extensive use of and investment in them has       not yet been seen. On Eartheasy, a site that lists plastic       alternatives, they note that, ``finding alternatives to       common items like plastic bottles and plastic packaging is       becoming increasingly easier--and not a moment too soon for       our plastic-choked planet.'' Examples of these plastic       alternatives include, but are not limited to, bamboo,       seaweed, wood, cloth for bags, and for multi-use but non-      biodegradable substances, glass and stainless steel for       replacing one-use items. The possibilities are limitless on       what ways we can replace plastic, and our technology and       innovation provide us with new, sustainable options, but how       do we convince the world to use these alternatives?        If we really want to make progress against our plastic       pandemonium, we cannot leave it up to individual people to       consider plastic alternatives. This is a collective issue we       need to address first as a nation, and then the world. Many       solutions to this problem have been given, including taxation       on plastic products, and even total bans, but no clear       decision has been reached. Taxes would mean a smoother       transition, and the money made off of plastic usage would go       towards discouraging that same occurrence, as well as       cleaning up plastic pollution. A ban would outright prevent       companies and individuals from consuming plastic, which may       negatively impact people's lives. I believe that a nationwide       ban is the best solution. Taxation would slow the problem,       and raise money for the government, but the problem would       still exist. Banning plastic, though tough, would force       ourselves to use alternatives, and without the incoming       waste, we could focus on cleaning the ocean.        Though plastic bans would offer one solution, there is no       one right answer to this issue. As long as we continue the       conversation and look for ways to prevail and take action, we       still have the devotion to overcome this problem. With our       advances in science and technology, and the combined help of       our government and fellow citizens, we can conquer our       carelessness and restore this beautiful planet we inhabit to       its former glory.             penelope derosset, burlington high school, freshman         Some people in this country see no need for feminism. They       say: ``Men and women are equal. They have the same rights       under law.'' But that isn't true. The only right the       Constitution explicitly grants to both men and women is the       right to vote. And the few rights women have, the right to       abortion for one, are constantly called into question. The       solution? An amendment introduced in 1923. Ratifying the       Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which explicitly grants all       rights equally to all genders, would grant a layer of legal       protection to women's rights which are so often under threat.        Laws protecting women's rights are constantly limited in       their ability to protect women at all. By mid-2021, a record       amount of anti-abortion legislation had already been enacted       by states. Limitations requiring parental consent or banning       abortion past a certain point in pregnancy make it impossible       for many women to get an abortion. This may endanger the       pregnant person's life. If a woman chooses to stay pregnant,       she may face challenges such as pay discrimination, employers       refusing to accommodate her temporary disability, or being       fired. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA), the only       federal law against workplace pregnancy discrimination, is       consistently interpreted too narrowly to be adequate       protection. A report by the Center for Employment Equity at       UMass Amherst says: ``Activists and politicians have argued       that by only providing a comparative, rather than absolute,       right to accommodation, current laws stop short of       guaranteeing protection for all pregnant workers.'' While       women may appear to be protected by law against workplace       pregnancy discrimination the truth is many are not. This       leaves large numbers of people vulnerable. We must work to       defend these rights or risk them disappearing.        The ERA would solve this issue by explicitly stating a       constitutional position against gender discrimination. Some       states have already passed equal rights amendments or have       ERA-like language in their state constitutions, and using       these, Connecticut and New Mexico have found laws restricting       Medicaid coverage of abortion unconstitutional. With regards       to pregnancy discrimination, an article by Robin Bleuweiss       published by the Center for American Progress states: ``The       ERA could provide additional reasoning, grounded in       constitutional protections, to challenge policies that       effectively exclude individuals seeking pregnancy       accommodations from the protection of the law, as well as to       ensure equitable treatment and better conditions for pregnant       workers.'' With the added support of constitutional       protection, policies currently legal under the PDA could       change and finally grant pregnant women equality.        There is no doubt adding the ERA to the Constitution would       have a big impact on the essential rights of women.       Implementing this solution would be simple. All the states       required to ratify this amendment have. The only obstacle is       the time limit. Congress has already exercised its power to       extend the time limit once before, so why couldn't it do so       again? To quote Alice Paul, revolutionary suffragist and the       first to propose the ERA, ``To me, there is nothing       complicated about ordinary equality.''                   jocelyn dunn, essex high school, junior         On September 1, 2021, a law banning abortion from as early       as six weeks into pregnancy went into effect in Texas. The       Supreme Court's failure to stop Texas Senate Bill 8 has paved       the way for other states to mimic actions with similar bills       that directly challenge Roe v. Wade. In December, the state       of Mississippi asked the Supreme Court to uphold its outlaw       on abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy in the case of Dobbs v.       Jackson Women's Health Organization. The new reality of       abortion access is a terrifyingly imperative issue, and the       nation's highest court has never been so close to upholding a       ban that so blatantly ignores the precedent set by Roe v.       Wade. Political shifts that threaten to undermine Roe v. Wade       will harm many, and simply should be unacceptable to anyone       who cares about the health of women.        Since 1973, Roe v. Wade has provided safe, accessible       abortion services to women throughout the country. The       precedent set by Roe v. Wade affirms that it is a woman's       right to have an abortion under the Fourteenth Amendment       without excessive government restriction. Since the case       decision, the Supreme Court has been continuously called upon       to decide whether specific abortion statutes violate a       woman's right to privacy. However, under the current process       of examination, many abortion restrictions have been upheld       and the lasting constraints  [[Page S1152]]       of these harmful laws have opened the door to limits on the       ability of women to make the personal decision of ending a       pregnancy. The Supreme Court's upcoming decision in Dobbs v.       Jackson Women's Health Organization has left the future of       Roe v. Wade at risk. According to Planned Parenthood, if Roe       v. Wade is overturned, 26 states in the country could       immediately act on banning abortion through existing       policies. This means that 36 million women could soon live in       a state that criminalizes almost all abortion services.        With the increasingly likely overturning of Roe v. Wade on       the horizon, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced that the       Senate will soon hold a vote on legislation that would ensure       a nationwide right to abortion. In September 2021, the House       of Representatives passed the Women's Health Protection Act       (WHPA). If the WHPA becomes a federal law, abortion access       would be protected from not only bans but also medically       unnecessary restrictions such as mandatory ultrasounds,       biased counseling, and waiting periods. The WHPA would create       a statutory right for health care providers to perform       abortion services, and a corresponding right for their       patients to receive those services, free from invasive       restrictions.        The United States is on the brink of an unprecedented       crisis regarding women's health. Restrictions on Roe v. Wade       have plagued American women for decades and the right to make       private decisions free from barriers is more crucial than       ever to the personal dignity and autonomy of women.       Eliminating health care restrictions is imperative to       reproductive justice and passing the WHPA is an essential       step toward safeguarding access to abortion.           samantha haselman, bellows free academy fairfax, senior         The opioid crisis and incarceration for nonviolent       offenders isn't the solution for these addicts. It has an       emotional, physical, and economical struggle many are facing       and have been facing. People need to have compassion and       understand that addiction is a disease, not a choice.       Children, youth, and families are affected by opioid use. No       one chooses drugs over their own children, no one chooses to       steal from their loved ones, no one chooses to physically       harm themselves, no one chooses to have their children taken       from them.        There are many issues and concerns that exist within this       topic. I can relate to this very well. In 2009 my mother       developed her relationship with heroin, what most call the       ``devil''. My mother was a kind, hardworking, funny,       determined, confident woman. But since this disease has taken       over her, she's not as present. Watching my mother struggling       on a daily basis from being sick to running out of the home       scrounging for the next ``fix''. It affected not only her,       but it affected her family who were a witness to this. Many       legal systems knew about her addiction but didn't support her       nor did they provide her with the necessary resources. They       focused more on removing things from her life and punishing       her for something that was controlling every part of her.        There is a story that stands out to me called ``Hooked''.       It was about a vulnerable woman who was prescribed opioids,       she instantly became an addict. She was clean for a while,       but relapsed multiple times. She was incarcerated, denied       medical attention, and then died. Incarceration for these       addicts is not helping them. Incarceration does not prepare       them for sobriety when released. They need affordable       treatment and support from a substance abuse counselor, and       resources that will set them up for success.        There needs to be more resources and affordable treatment       for individuals struggling to beat opioid addiction. I will       continue to speak on this until there's a significant change       our government takes far beyond what's been done. I know that       Senator Sanders introduced amendments to strengthen the       opioid crisis response in 2018. In addition to your       amendments to the opioid bill, I believe Congress should also       continue to provide additional funding like the Comprehensive       Addiction and Recovery Act of 2016. The law focuses on       treating people rather than incarcerating people. Congress       passed the bill giving only $181 million in funds for opioid       programs. The federal government was expecting $920 million       to help expand their treatment capacity with each state       receiving money depending on the severity of the epidemic.       Having funding would strengthen and support prevention,       treatment, and medication access. We must continue to help       those who are like my mom and we must honor these families       who are waking up daily facing the nightmare of opioid       addiction. This disease does not discriminate, it can be the       lawyer, the doctor, the son, the daughter, the mother, and/or       the father. This is all the more reason to stay focused on       this and make a change.                   anna pringle, essex high school, junior         Not only is America experiencing a Covid pandemic, but       America is also experiencing a loneliness epidemic. While       loneliness is not diagnoseable medically or psychologically,       it's associated with a variety of disorders and health issues       such as depression, anxiety, and concurrently, increased       suicide rates. As said in the Harvard Graduate School of       Education Report, 61 percent of young adults feel serious       loneliness after the pandemic.        As Covid continues, people all over the U.S. are accepting       isolation. There are simple solutions to this loneliness       epidemic, for example, a simple phone call or Facetime to a       friend. There are also more complex solutions; an example       being in the grocery store. According to Vice, the       Netherlands is introducing chat registers; registers where       employees will be trained to create small talk with customers       who aren't in a rush. This is an effort sponsored by the       Netherland government in hopes to help battle loneliness. The       Netherland government also created a 24/7 loneliness hotline,       both the registers and hotline are a part of the ``one       against loneliness'' program. This is a great example of a       country doing more to help people in need.        In America, mental health is not a top priority, but the       impacts of mental health are astronomical. American citizens       are suffering at an increasing rate because they are so       isolated due to Covid. Since being lonely can be chronic, the       U.S. needs to do more to help. It is not possible for one       solution to single-handedly end the epidemic of loneliness;       instead many solutions will have to come together. Some       examples of solutions are following what the Netherlands did,       creating a hotline or chat registers. Another solution is       bringing awareness to this topic of how quarantining from       Covid has impacted mental health. This could inspire people       to call a loved one; especially the ones that live alone.       Simple actions like calling a loved one could have a huge       impact, this could remind a lonely person that they have       people to talk to and therefore it can make someone feel less       secluded. Social media is a huge part of everyone's life,       putting information out there on the impact that loneliness       has on people could one hundred percent make a difference.        Mental health issues are substantial in America today.       There are many ways that America can do more for the       loneliness crisis, creating a healthier, happier country.          isabelle tupper, brattleboro union high school, sophomore         As James Earl Jones reveals, ``One of the hardest things in       life is having words in your heart that you can't utter''.       Nowadays, black Americans (nationwide) are suffering from       declining mental health; one in every three black people seek       assistance when struggling, and roughly 1.4 million black       people are experiencing crises. As a result, suicide rates       are increasing and citizens are silently suffering.       Therefore, black mental health must become a priority.        In predominantly black communities, mental health is       overlooked--despite its damaging impacts. Injustices are       amplified by unforeseen circumstances that deplete one's       quality of life. For instance, ``Anxiety and depression       symptoms have more than tripled since 2019, [ . . . ]'' and       pandemic-related homelessness and unemployment left ``[ . . .       ] black Americans shouldering the heaviest burden'' (Fowers       and Wan). Additionally, the murder of George Floyd resurfaced       trauma for countless black Americans and caused mental health       issues to spike five percent. Lastly, black people with       mental health issues struggle to gain relief due to stigma       and insufficient BIPOC medical professionals. Consequently,       this urgent matter generates despondency, leading black       individuals to isolate themselves.        Provisionally, this country must fulfill black individuals'       needs whilst identifying propitious resources. Through       survey, the public shall expunge injurious practices and       distribute assets alongside governmental advisors. Parties       must consider privileges of non-black people and prioritize       equality. Schools must incorporate free courses--run by       qualified educators--to help young people identify mental       illness. Classes must be accessible and non-discriminatory,       and identity must not prevent admittance. School-based       clinicians will best ensure students' access to counseling;       psychiatrist David Henderson, reports ``about 25 percent of       African Americans seek mental health care, compared to 40       percent of whites'' because of impediments regarding       accessibility (McLean Harvard Medical School Affiliate).       Progressively, the government must accommodate affordable       healthcare. Mental health must be covered by insurance and       funds shall be supplied by the one percent of taxpayers. All       remaining funds must go towards mental health facilities in       need. Assuming that demands are met, progress will ensue.        Over time, it will be crucial to break the stigma       surrounding black mental health. Once honest conversations       commence, politically-correct terminology must be applied and       blatant irreverence shall be condemned. Publicly, black       mental health advocates shall assemble and enlighten       uninformed individuals, and mental health care providers must       advertise openly. Simultaneously, the mental health field       must employ more people of color. BIPOC positions will be       filled when salaries are livable, staff is receptive, and job       openings have renowned availability. Hired professionals must       have ample training, prior to or upon their employment.       Finally, if employees of color exit, all businesses must hire       new BIPOC staff to diversify America's perspectives.        Black mental health is a nationwide concern and all people       must fight to restore it. Due to Covid losses and natural       disasters, this country is facing a level of despair that       only multiplies when considering mental health. In black       communities, conditions are abysmal and there is dire need       for improvement. If circumstances do not ameliorate, tragedy       will only continue. Nevertheless, this country shall work       diligently together and utilize its power to create immense       change.  [[Page S1153]]                 luna wood, champlain valley union high school, senior         The single most threatening issue our world must deal with       today is climate change. It is crucial that our government       doesn't ignore climate change and its impacts that will       affect everybody. Climate change is going to become much       worse in the upcoming years and we have already started to       face devastating effects. Extreme weather has destroyed       communities and will not stop any time soon. Tropical storms       and sea levels rising on the coasts will soon make towns and       cities uninhabitable. Health risks will become worse and       worse such as deaths from extreme weather storms, air       pollution, water and food supply impacts. The downfall of       countless communities will affect economic prosperity.       Extreme weather such as hurricanes and flooding will wipe out       entire communities, leaving them in poverty. Droughts have a       negative impact on harvests and will increase food       insecurity. As migration increases due to the adaptation of       sea levels rising, resources will become more and more       limited. As a nation, we cannot ignore climate change       anymore.        Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders' Green New Deal would give       our nation the step in the right direction of taking an       action that will sustain our planet for generations to come.       Our federal government has not allowed the passage of this       deal despite its immense benefits for our country. It is       stated to create 20 million jobs, which would improve our       country's unemployment issue greatly.        The deal suggests using solutions such as only renewable       energy will catapult our progress. We need to stop sending       our nation's tax dollars to fossil fuel companies in the form       of subsidies. Instead, we can invest that money into clean       forms of energy such as solar. Fossil fuels are the reason       why our earth has been increasingly warming up. The carbon in       the air needs to be taken out of our atmosphere and put back       into the ground where it came from.        We can help this process in our own state of Vermont by       stopping the overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides       on our farmland. This use of chemicals is killing habitats in       our soils and causing pollution. If we adopt more organic       methods of farming and take care of our soil, the crops,       plants and organisms living in the soil can help sequester       carbon from the air. Another simple solution to drawing       carbon from the air is planting many, many trees. Other       countries have already implemented this solution and there is       no reason why we can't as well.        Yes, applying these solutions will take time, money, and       resources. But the positive outcomes from this deal are       necessary and worth it. This should be the main focus of our       government right now because it is a global emergency and       soon it will be too late.                            ____________________
