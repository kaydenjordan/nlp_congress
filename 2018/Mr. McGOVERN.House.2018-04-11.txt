 Mr. Speaker, the farm bill should be about helping our  farmers and strengthening our food and nutrition programs. It shouldn't  be about beating up on poor people.   As the House Agriculture Committee prepares to mark up the 2018 farm  bill, I rise to express my deep concern and my outrage with reports  that Republicans on the committee are considering drastic cuts to the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program known as SNAP.   Press reports indicate that the majority intends to dismantle the  core function of SNAP to pay for a huge, new, untested bureaucracy,  while cutting and even eliminating benefits for millions of the most  vulnerable Americans, including seniors, older workers, individuals  with disabilities, working families with children, and other struggling  adults.   We are still awaiting the full details on the plan, which was crafted  behind closed doors without any input from Democrats on the committee-- I am not even sure any input from Republicans on the committee. But  this is what we have learned: that the Republicans intend to focus  their cuts in three areas.   First, we are hearing Chairman Conaway's bill will eliminate broad- based categorical eligibility, an important State option that helps  working families with kids and seniors qualify for benefits when times  are tough.   More than 40 States currently implement this option, which allows  them to raise income cutoffs and ease asset limits.   Broad-based categorical eligibility also mitigates any cliff effect,  albeit small, that exists in SNAP, and eliminating it would penalize  families from accruing modest savings to help lift themselves out of  poverty.   Estimates suggest that at least 400,000 eligible households will lose  their SNAP benefits if broad-based categorical eligibility is  eliminated, and 265,000 students will lose access to free lunches at  school.   I mean, really?   Mr. Speaker, this is shameful.   We are also reading that the Republicans are looking to cut benefits  for households with out-of-pocket utility expenses by disconnecting the  link between SNAP and the Low Income Heating Energy Assistance Program  known as LIHEAP. Doing so will require those with utility expenses to  produce the actual bills for each expense rather than receiving a  standard allowance. It will force the elderly, it will force people who  are disabled and working families to make another trip to the SNAP  office and cut benefits for those who are unable to produce the  receipts.   Mr. Speaker, we expect that this proposal will cut benefits by at  least $6.6 billion.   Lastly, we have heard the Republicans intend to focus much of their  damaging proposal on harsher work requirements that target vulnerable  groups of adults who do not have children or other dependents, known as  ABAWDs.   We are reading that the Republican majority is proposing to develop a  massive new bureaucracy and subject 3 to 5 million vulnerable Americans  to new mandatory work requirements.   I want to remind my colleagues that the ABAWD population is diverse.  Many have limited access to education, with more than 80 percent having  no more than a high school education or a GED. Some have mental health  issues, difficult histories of substance abuse, or are ex-offenders  with nowhere else to turn. And as many as 60,000 of them are veterans  who have served our country.   These childless adults on SNAP are often extremely poor and sometimes  experience chronic homelessness. They turn to SNAP as a safety net when  they lose their jobs, their hours at work are cut, or their wages are  so low that they are unable to make ends meet.   Under current law, ABAWDs are already subjected to severe time limits  on the program. They are only provided access to benefits for 3 months  out of a 3-year period and are completely cut off from assistance after  that time if they have not been able to find work.   Mr. Speaker, this Congress should be committed to helping people who  are living in poverty and working to help make their lives easier, not  cutting them off from assistance when they most need it.   Estimates suggest that as many as 1 million people will lose  assistance if these incredibly damaging work proposals advance.   The House Agriculture Committee held 23 hearings on SNAP over the  past several years. I attended every single one. We heard testimony  from dozens of witnesses, Republicans and Democrats alike; and not one  witness, not one, Mr. Speaker, suggested that we make the  drastic changes to the program that will cut off those most in need of  assistance, let alone the ones whom the Republican majority are  advancing.    Quite frankly, I don't know where these ideas are coming from, maybe  some rightwing think tank, but they are certainly not coming from the  Agriculture Committee.   Let's be clear about what is happening. Speaker Ryan made clear a few  weeks ago that he views the farm bill as a key piece of his misguided  welfare reform agenda. And just yesterday, President Trump issued a new  executive order aimed at forcing SNAP recipients off of assistance.   The Republican farm bill isn't about trying to help people. It is  about politics and it is about appeasing the rightwing of the  Republican party. It relies on negative stereotypes to advance the goal  of undermining our safety net programs and cutting people off of help  who need it most. It is disgusting.   Mr. Speaker, I plead with you, I plead with Chairman Conaway and  Republicans in this Congress to stop this attack on those who are  living in poverty. SNAP is an important program. It is about providing  people food, and I urge my colleagues on both sides to reject any and  all proposals that will undermine this important program.   Mr. Speaker, the war against the poor must stop.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Buck) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this closed rule and to  the underlying legislation. Quite frankly, I had hoped that, when we  returned from our Easter break, we would be debating and voting on  legislation that would help people. I had hoped that maybe we would be  able to finally help the hundreds of thousands of Dreamers whose lives  are now in limbo because of President Trump's decision to end DACA and  that we would be able to pass a bill called the Dream Act to actually  provide them some peace of mind. But, no, we don't see that on the  schedule.   I had also hoped that maybe we would do something to address the  epidemic of gun violence in this country. Millions of young people all  across the country have been protesting in front of congressional  offices and have been holding rallies demanding that Congress debate  the issue of gun violence and do something. No, we are not doing that.   Instead, what we are doing is another bill to help the financial  services industries, and in that effort, we are doing something that I  think is going to make consumer protections less relevant. This week,  again, the Republican leadership of this House is ignoring the most  pressing issues facing our country and our constituents in favor of  more legislation to roll back financial protections put into place to  prevent another financial crisis.   Need I remind my friends on the other side of the aisle how damaging  the 2008 financial crash was? Millions upon millions of Americans--our  constituents, Mr. Speaker--lost their homes, and they lost their jobs  and their life savings. Many of these families have still not fully  recovered from these terrible financial blows.   In response, Democrats in Congress came together to pass the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, landmark  legislation to address risk in our financial system and ensure our  constituents are protected from another damaging financial crisis.   Dodd-Frank isn't perfect. Nobody in this Congress says it is. But I  strongly object to the calculated campaign by Republicans in this House  to continue to chip away at the law, making our financial markets more  vulnerable just to benefit their billionaire donors.   One of the key provisions of Dodd-Frank is the Volcker rule. It  prohibits banks from engaging in risky trading activities that  contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. Simply put, it prevents banks  from acting like casinos and gambling with our money.   The rule we are considering today provides for consideration of H.R.  4790, legislation to undermine the Volcker rule by exempting certain  banks from the requirements. The bill also puts rulemaking authority  solely in the hands of the Federal Reserve, making it easier for the  Trump administration to further weaken or eventually repeal this vital  consumer protection.   Now, that is, of course, the goal of my Republican colleagues in the  first place. They have continually advanced legislation to roll back  and weaken the rules put into place to prevent another financial  crisis. It is deeply frustrating, and more importantly, it is very  dangerous to the financial security of the American economy and  American families.   Now, Mr. Speaker, this rule also provides for additional debate time  on the Republican majority's misguided balanced budget amendment, H.J.  Res. 2.   Normally, when legislation of this magnitude is debated, the  leadership of this House brings it through the Rules Committee to set  the terms of debate and to allow for alternative proposals to be  offered and debated. This will be the seventh time a balanced budget  amendment has been voted on in the House.   In the past, it has generally been considered under a structured rule  granting many hours of general debate, making in order substitute  amendments, and providing the minority with a motion to recommit. But  as they did in 2011, Republicans will once again bring this legislation  to the floor under suspension of the rules, providing no opportunity-- none--for Members of the majority or the minority to offer any  substitute amendments.   Now, why does this matter, Mr. Speaker? It matters because this  legislation, the so-called balanced budget amendment, could do  irreparable harm  [[Page H3107]]  to our economy. It would hinder Congress' ability to respond  appropriately to an economic crisis and could potentially even create  one. It could even require Congress to cut funding for safety net  programs that millions of our constituents rely on, programs like  Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP--which is the Supplemental  Nutrition Assistance Program--Supplemental Security Income, and  veterans' pensions.   We owe it to our constituents to have a full and open debate on this  legislation, to hear from experts and to thoughtfully consider  alternatives. But this Republican majority didn't even take the time to  hold a hearing or a markup on H.J. Res. 2. They are rushing it to the  floor under suspension of the rules with no opportunity for us to  consider any alternative proposals whatsoever.   We are talking about amending the Constitution of the United States.  Why in the world would we want to use such a flawed process on such an  important issue? Mr. Speaker, because maybe this isn't a serious effort  in the first place. My Republican friends know this awful legislation  will never become law.   So why are we wasting the House's time on this effort? I have a  simple answer: to appease the far-right wing of the Republican Party in  an election year and to give the impression that these guys, these  Republicans, are somehow fiscally responsible.    You don't have to take my word for it. Republican Representative  Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania confirmed in the press this week that this  is merely a messaging vote. If you think this is cynical, consider for  a moment the impetus of bringing this legislation to the floor.   Press reports indicate that Speaker Ryan agreed to a vote on the  balanced budget amendment in exchange for votes to advance the  Republican tax scam. Can you believe that? Speaker Ryan, the leader of  this House, is advancing legislation that could do irreparable harm to  our economy and our safety net just so he could jam through his  precious tax giveaway to corporations and wealthy donors last December.   Let me remind everyone just how terrible the tax scam Republicans  rammed through Congress really is:   It raises taxes on 68 million middle class families to give 83  percent of the tax cuts included in the bill to the wealthiest 1  percent of Americans.   It gives a $1.3 trillion tax rate break to the largest corporations  in this country and rewards these same corporations for shipping jobs  overseas.   Here is the other part: it explodes the deficit by $2 trillion,  jeopardizing the future of Medicare and Medicaid.   But this balanced budget amendment is supposed to trick people into  believing Republicans still care about fiscal responsibility. It really  is disheartening.   There is a pattern here, Mr. Speaker. At every turn, House  Republicans favor the well-off and well-connected while ignoring the  needs of those in the middle class and working class and certainly  turning their backs on those struggling in poverty.   I meet with constituents in my district every day. Quite frankly,  they don't ask what we are doing to repeal Dodd-Frank. They certainly  don't ask us to ransack Social Security and cut Medicare to give tax  breaks to big corporations.   They want better jobs and they want better wages. They want us to fix  our crumbling infrastructure in their communities and to invest in  education. They want us to protect our water and air from pollution.  They made it clear to us last month, when over 1 million young people  took to the streets across this country, that they want action on  legislation to protect our communities from the plague of gun violence.   But the Republican leadership is ignoring this call, and it is  ignoring any call for progress in favor of legislation to help the  wealthy and well-connected donor class.   I get it. They need all this money for reelection. But the price is  being paid by the American people. They are getting legislation that is  not in their best interest but is in the best interest of a few wealthy  donors.   It is reckless and it is wrong. Over 56 percent of the legislation  that we have considered in the Rules Committee this year--that is over  half--has been bills to roll back regulations on Wall Street and the  financial industry. I don't see millions of people protesting in the  street to give Wall Street a bigger break. I don't hear the voices  being raised all across this country to say: ``Let's make the rich even  richer. Let's do more to give corporations tax breaks.'' I don't hear  that, and yet that is what the focus of this Congress has been about.   By the way, the vast majority of these bills to help the well- connected and the well-off haven't even gone through regular order.  This whole process has been a joke. The legislation we are set to  consider later this week is no exception.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this restrictive rule, to oppose  efforts to weaken the Volcker rule, and to oppose the balanced budget  amendment when it is considered later this week.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the hypocrisy of the Republican majority is on full  display today. After passing a $1.5 trillion tax scam bill that showers  all the benefits on the wealthy and very rich corporations, we are now  going to consider an amendment to the Constitution to balance the  Federal budget on the backs of hardworking Americans by eviscerating  social safety net programs.   According to the AARP, this balanced budget amendment could subject  Social Security and Medicare to deep cuts without regard to the impact  on the health and financial security of our most vulnerable citizens.  Mr. Speaker, a balanced budget amendment would put the pillars of our  social safety net at risk. If you don't believe me, again, maybe you  will listen to our friends at the AARP.   They said, this week, in a letter: ``A balanced budget amendment  would likely harm Social Security and Medicare, subjecting both  programs to potentially deep cuts without regard to the impact on the  health and financial security of individuals.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the AARP's letter.                                                           AARP,                                                      April 9, 2018.        Dear Member: AARP is writing to express our opposition to a       balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United       States. AARP is the nation's largest nonprofit, nonpartisan       organization dedicated to empowering Americans 50 and older       to choose how they live as they age. With nearly 38 million       members and offices in every state, the District of Columbia,       Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, AARP works to       strengthen communities and advocate for what matters most to       families with a focus on health security, financial stability       and personal fulfillment.        A balanced budget amendment would likely harm Social       Security and Medicare, subjecting both programs to       potentially deep cuts without regard to the impact on the       health and financial security of individuals. It would also       likely diminish the resources available for programs       assisting Americans who are least able to provide for       themselves--services such as meals or heating for those who       are too poor or physically unable to take care of their basic       needs without some support.        A balanced budget amendment would prohibit outlays for a       fiscal year from exceeding total receipts for that fiscal       year. It would impose a constitutional cap on all spending       that is equivalent to the revenues raised in any given year.       Because revenues fluctuate based on many factors, spending       would, out of necessity fluctuate as well under a balanced       budget amendment. Consequently, Social Security and Medicare       benefits would also fluctuate, potentially subjecting each to       sudden or deep cuts. Social Security and Medicare would       therefore cease to provide a predictable source of financial       and health security in retirement under a balanced budget       amendment.        The lack of a dependable Social Security and Medicare       benefit would be devastating for millions of Americans.       Social Security is currently the principal source of income       for half of older American households receiving benefits, and       roughly one in five households depend on Social Security       benefits for nearly all (90 percent or more) of their income.       Over 50 million Americans depend on Medicare, half of whom       have incomes of less than $24,150. Even small fluctuations in       premiums and cost sharing would have a significant impact on       the personal finances of older and disabled Americans.        Individuals who have contributed their entire working lives       to earn a predictable benefit during their retirement would       find that their retirement income and health care out of       pocket costs would vary significantly year-to-year, making       planning difficult and peace of mind impossible.  [[Page H3108]]         It is particularly inappropriate to subject Social Security       to a balanced budget amendment given that Social Security is       an off-budget program that is separately funded through its       own revenue stream, including significant trust fund reserves       to finance benefits. Imposing a cap on Social Security       outlays is unjustifiable, especially when the Social Security       trust funds ran a surplus for decades--reducing the past need       for additional government borrowing from the public--and       resulted in a public debt that is less today than what it       otherwise would have been.        Older Americans truly understand that budgets matter and       that we all need to live within our means. However, they also       understand that budgets affect real people; and they       certainly understand the difference between programs to which       they have contributed and earned over the course of a       lifetime of work, and those they have not. AARP opposes the       adoption of a balanced budget amendment that puts Social       Security and Medicare at risk. If you have any questions,       please have your staff contact Joyce A. Rogers, SVP,       Government Affairs office.            Sincerely,                                                     Nancy LeaMond,        Executive Vice President and Chief Advocacy and Engagement                                                            Officer.     Mr. Speaker, this uncertainty could devastate the  nearly half of older American households whose principal incomes come  from Social Security or the over 50 million Americans who depend on  Medicare. Even small cuts to Social Security checks or increases to  Medicare premiums could impact the finances of older Americans and  disabled Americans.   Now, the same week that the Congressional Budget Office predicts this  Republican majority and their tax scam bill will lead to the return of  trillion-dollar deficits, we will consider a balanced budget amendment  that has been subject to no hearings and no markups. Even for this  record-breaking closed Republican Congress, to attempt to amend our  Constitution for only the 28th time in our Nation's history in this  manner, quite frankly, is stunning.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask that my colleagues vote ``no'' on the  previous question. If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule which would amend the bill to exempt Social  Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, vital pillars of our social safety  net.   I would just say to my Republican friends on the other side of the  aisle who go home to their constituents and regularly talk about how  great Social Security is, how great Medicare is, and how important  Medicaid is, if you really believe it, you are going to vote to defeat  the previous question so we can offer this amendment.   I ask unanimous consent, Mr. Speaker, to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the Republican majority is attempting to amend the  United States Constitution with a bill that has had no hearing, no  markup, and will be considered without any opportunity to offer  amendments or even a motion to recommit.   We have only amended the Constitution 27 times in our Nation's  history. Why isn't the Republican leadership treating this with the  seriousness that it deserves? Maybe because even conservative members  of their own party know that this vote is a charade.   In a Politico article titled ``Conservatives irate over GOP spending  hypocrisy,'' Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows said: ``There is no  one on Capitol Hill, and certainly no one on Main Street, that will  take this vote seriously.''   I couldn't agree more. Republicans just added almost $2 trillion to  the deficit with their tax cut for billionaires. As the president of  the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said in the same  article: ``This reads as, `Give us something to hide behind,' rather  than a serious process proposal.''   But we are here because Republican leadership is trying to check a  box, as the Club for Growth put it, in hopes that people will forget  their tax scam giveaway. And no wonder why Congress' approval rating is  at just 15 percent. This is a dangerous gimmick that my Republican  colleagues are pushing. If this is successful, it will lead to major  cuts to Social Security, to Medicare, and to Medicaid. We need to take  that seriously, and we need to stop it.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this Politico article titled  ``Conservatives irate over GOP's spending hypocrisy.''  [[Page H3109]]                            [From POLITICO, Apr. 10, 2018]             Conservatives Irate Over GOP's Spending Hypocrisy                     (By Rachael Bade and Sarah Ferris)         House Republican leaders, stung by President Donald Trump's       rebuke of Congress' recent trillion-dollar spending spree,       are moving to give their rank and file cover by passing a       balanced budget amendment this week.        But many conservatives, including a good number of House       Republicans, say the vote is insincere at best--and blatantly       hypocritical at worst.        ``There is no one on Capitol Hill, and certainly no one on       Main Street, that will take this vote seriously,'' said       Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), on the heels       of a $1.3 trillion spending package that Republicans approved       just last month.        ``Leadership is just trying to check a box here,'' added       Andrew Roth, vice president for government affairs at the       Club for Growth. ``I don't see how voters can distinguish       between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to       spending.''        One conservative commentator, Barbara Boland, equated the       upcoming exercise to ``gorging on a sumptuous feast while       insisting that you want a svelte physique.'' And other       members of the House Freedom Caucus, all of whom voted       against a $1.3 trillion spending package in late March, are       calling it little more than a charade.        ``The time to get spending under control was four weeks       ago,'' said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), again referring to the       late-March spending vote. ``Coming back four weeks later and       saying, `Oh, now we're going to pound our chest like Tarzan       and say we're for a balanced budget amendment,' it's not       going to fool anybody.''        Jordan and Meadows support the balanced budget amendment as       a marker for fiscal austerity--it's the timing of the vote,       on the heels of the spending bonanza, that rankles them and       other conservatives.        The proposal requires supermajorities in both chambers to       pass, as well as ratification by three-quarters of the       states, an impossible hurdle. But with Republicans swimming       in red ink--the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office       projected regular trillion-dollar annual deficits starting in       2020, despite a growing economy--the party feels pressure to       do something.        The CBO's deficit forecast hasn't been that bleak since the       Great Recession. And this time, Republicans can't blame       Barack Obama and the Democrats.        Rather, it's a result of a combination of GOP-approved       bills: tax cuts that CBO now expects to add $1.9 trillion to       the deficit over 10 years; a newly passed bipartisan deal to       raise strict spending caps by $320 billion for two years; and       a recent $100 billion infusion of cash into emergency       disaster coffers--almost entirely unpaid for.        The balanced budget amendment has been a staple of the GOP       playbook going back at least to Newt Gingrich's 1994 Contract       with America. It often resurfaces after major spending       battles that leave conservatives feeling jilted. The last       vote, for instance, followed the 2011 debt ceiling crisis,       when Republicans were anxious about the national debt, which       now tops $20 trillion.        Republicans are returning to it two weeks after Trump       chided Congress for wasting money in the omnibus spending       deal--a scolding that came as the president backed away from       a threatened veto and signed it.        ``I will never sign another bill like this again,'' Trump       vowed, adding that ``there are a lot of things I'm unhappy       about'' with it.        His remarks, GOP lawmakers and aides say, effectively threw       every Republican who backed the bipartisan deal under the bus       at a time when the party already faces an uphill battle       retaining its majority this fall.        Hill Republicans were shocked because White House staff       members were in the room negotiating the budget deal with the       top four leaders in both chambers. They had reassured some       skittish Republicans that it was OK to take the vote because       Trump would have their backs.        When they returned home afterward for the spring recess,       some Republicans caught flak from constituents, which in turn       sent GOP leaders into damage-control mode.        ``This reads as, `Give us something to hide behind,' rather       than a serious process proposal,'' said Maya MacGuineas,       president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget,       who said she'd believe the sincerity of the effort when       Republicans propose a budget with actual spending cuts.        Not all fiscal hawks are scorning the effort. Republican       Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker (R-N.C.), who asked for       a vote on a balanced budget amendment in October, applauded       the looming vote--even as he acknowledged the uncomfortable       timing for the GOP. Walker argued that it's consistent for       Republicans to back the amendment after voting for the       omnibus, because of the need to fund the military. Walker       added, though, that most members pushing hard for deficit-      reduction votes right now personally opposed the spending       bill, as he did.        ``We don't see this as a show vote. We need this. It's       something that we've been talking about for years,'' Walker       said Tuesday.        The balanced budget amendment is one of several measures       GOP leaders might bring to the floor in the coming weeks to       signal their commitment to lower spending. The effort is       being led by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.),       who is working with the White House to try to force a vote on       a ``rescissions'' package that would cut billions of dollars       from the just-approved omnibus legislation.        It's still unclear whether the House will take up the       measure, which GOP aides say could cut as much as $20       billion. House appropriators hate the idea, and some more       pragmatic-minded Republicans argue it would cripple       bipartisan spending negotiations in the future.        Republicans clinched the amount they got for defense only       because they gave Democrats some money for their own pet       projects. A move to recoup money retroactively would       infuriate Democrats--even though GOP leaders fully expect it       would fail in the Senate.        GOP leaders similarly expect the balanced budget amendment       to fail this week in the House. It requires 290 votes for       passage; the last time lawmakers voted on one, in 2011, it       failed 261-165, with 25 Democrats backing the bill.        Speaker Paul Ryan was one of only four Republicans to       oppose the measure at the time. It is unclear whether he will       do so again this year. He said the proposal before the House       then could have led to higher taxes to pay for more spending.        A balanced budget amendment would tightly restrict federal       spending and require two-thirds of lawmakers to approve any       tax changes. Critics argue it would trigger hundreds of       billions of dollars in across-the-board cuts.        Ironically, a balanced budget amendment would have       potentially prevented the GOP Congress' biggest legislative       achievement this year: tax reform. With the amendment,       Republicans could not have enacted tax cuts that weren't paid       for; these ones were not. The GOP also probably couldn't have       gotten the huge budget increase for the Pentagon that was       included in the omnibus.        In the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)       suggested Tuesday that he might follow suit on a balanced       budget amendment vote. He said a vote is ``likely . . . at       some point.''        Democrats are blasting Republicans for what House Minority       Whip Steny Hoyer called a ``political stunt.'' The Maryland       Democrat on Tuesday said Republicans are ``worried'' about       the midterm elections and ``they're flailing about.''        ``It sounds to me very much,'' he said, ``like they're . .       . saying one thing and doing another, speaking out of both       sides of their mouth.''     Congressman  Jim Jordan of Ohio, again another Freedom  Caucus member, said on the balanced budget amendment: ``The time to get  spending under control was 4 weeks ago. Coming back 4 weeks later and  saying, `Oh, now we're going to pound our chest like Tarzan and say  we're for a balanced budget amendment,' it's not going to fool  anybody.''   I would argue that the time to get spending under control was when  Republicans exploded the deficit with their tax cut for billionaires. I  agree with Mr. Jordan on this: A sham vote like that isn't going to  fool anybody.   Mr. Speaker, while I think everybody knows that what is going to  happen on this balanced budget amendment is really show business, I  think it is important to stress that it really underlines the values of  my friends on the Republican side and what they think is important and  what they believe is important to protect. As I said, if this or  anything like what they are proposing ever became the law of the land,  programs like Social Security, like Medicare, and like Medicaid would  be at risk. There are no provisions in their draft to protect these  programs that so many millions of Americans rely on.   And again, this is not surprising because we have seen over the years  their attempts to privatize Social Security, their attempts to  privatize Medicare, their attempts to undermine Medicaid, their  constant attacks on programs like SNAP. This is nothing new.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to close by saying to my Republican friends  that there are some things worth defending, and programs like Social  Security and programs like Medicare are worth defending. They are worth  fighting for. And I want to make it clear that, on the Democratic side,  any Republican attempts to undermine, to weaken, to undercut Social  Security or Medicare, we will fight you. We will fight you with every  ounce of energy and strength that we have because these programs are  important. They are important to our values, but more importantly, they  are important to our constituents.   With that, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question and ``no'' on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
