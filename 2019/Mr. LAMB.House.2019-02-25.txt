 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support veterans in STEM careers.   First, I would like to thank the gentleman from Florida, Dr. Dunn,  for his leadership in helping connect veterans to these good jobs.   Veterans are working today. Most Americans are working today. The  unemployment rate is low. And yet everywhere I go, I meet  businesspeople who tell me that they can't find the right workers for  the right jobs at the right time. If we could fix this, we would stop  being held back by the shortage of workforce that we face, and, most  importantly, our families would not be held back by lower paychecks.   But these new jobs in cybersecurity, in medical technology, in  advanced manufacturing, they are hard jobs and they require training.                                time  1715    We need to make the training available to people where they live at a  cost that they can actually afford. We have no time to waste.   Our businesses are competing on a global stage against countries that  will use the full machinery of their governments to make sure their  workforces are ready. We need to meet their efforts with an even  greater one.   Luckily, we already have a workforce that will go anywhere and do  anything. When it comes to hard work, these folks are fearless. That is  the veteran population here in the United States.   Marine officers are trained that if we are given an order to move  that mountain over there, no sooner is the order completed than we are  leading 100 marines down the road with shovels.   I still have great faith in the ability of 100 marines with shovels,  but what we really need today are hundreds of thousands of veterans who  can 3D print those shovels, put them in the hands of robots, program  them to go down the road, and defend the entire network from foreign  intrusion.   These are the jobs of today and tomorrow. These are the jobs that  will support our families. Most importantly, these are the jobs that  will grow the new middle class.   We want to make sure veterans get these jobs. To do that, we are  going to use this bill to turn to the National Science Foundation. The  National Science Foundation was born in the aftermath of World War II  to make sure that we led the world in science and math, and the most  important advancements. We knew that if we did that, we could make our  country safe, healthy, and strong.   If we are going to continue that mission in the new generation, we  will need veterans to lead the way.   We do have a global competition on our hands, Mr. Speaker, and I know  we can win it if we have the veterans with us. This bill will help  them, and I urge all my colleagues to come together to pass it.
