 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Biggs for leading  this tonight.  [[Page H2223]]    Madam Speaker, the national debt is the single greatest threat to our  national security. Since 1997, Congress has failed to do its job and  balance the budget. Earlier this month, the national debt reached $22  trillion.   For this reason, I am proud to cosponsor Congressman   Andy Biggs'  resolution to recognize the national debt as a threat to national  security. I commend him for introducing this important resolution in  the U.S. House of Representatives, and I also commend Senator David  Perdue for bringing it to the U.S. Senate.   We must no longer rely on routine debt ceiling increases, nor can we  risk the devastating effects that a growing deficit will inevitably  have on our military and our national security agencies.   In an effort to reduce the deficit and regain responsible spending  practices, President Trump has laid out his National Security Strategy  that highlights this critical need to reduce the debt through smart,  fiscally responsible decisions.   While it is clear we cannot undo the past, it is also clear that  Federal spending cannot continue to go unchecked and immediate action  must be taken. We can no longer defer to future generations to solve  our problem and to bear this burden.   I will continue to support legislation that cuts unnecessary spending  and oppose legislation that recklessly adds to the debt. I ask my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get serious and support this  important resolution.    It is time we stopped writing blank checks, and it is time to stop  risking the national security of the United States of America. It is  simple: Balance your books.   In God we trust.
