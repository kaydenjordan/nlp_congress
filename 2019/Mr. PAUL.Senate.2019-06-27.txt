 Reserving the right to object, I have offered a modest  compromise amendment to this legislation. I stand ready and open to  negotiate and discuss this. We have often discussed it in private and  in public. I will object until we can get to negotiating terms, and we  can hopefully pass this bill once we enter into a dialogue.
