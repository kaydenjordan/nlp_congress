 Mr. President, we are in a moment of profound unease  about the stability of the executive branch of our government.   The recent reports about General Flynn detailing constant, high-level  contact between members of the Trump administration and the Russian  Government raise serious doubts about this administration's competence  in the realm of foreign policy and national security and even graver  doubts about the sanctity of our democratic process.   We do not know all the facts, and in the coming days and weeks, more  information may well surface about these disturbing revelations, but we  already know that something is rotten in the state of Denmark.   I have been in Congress a long time, and I have never, ever seen  anything like this. The institutions of government are being tested in  a way they have not been tested in some time.   At this juncture, we would all do well to remember that democracy-- the most benevolent, desirable, effective, and just form of government  devised by man--is also one of the most fragile systems of government  devised by man. It requires constant vigilance and strong democratic  institutions to bolster one another.   At the time of the drafting of the Constitution, Thomas Jefferson  expressed doubt that a government founded on such a document could long  endure. Varying factions in our founding generation worried  alternatively about the threats posed by mob rule and potential  autocrats.   One of the things that the Framers of the Constitution most worried  about was the threat of foreign intervention in our government, what  they called foreign intrigue. Federalist No. 68, likely authored by a  famous resident of my State, Alexander Hamilton, labeled the ``desire  in foreign powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils'' as  one of the ``most deadly adversaries of republican government.'' That  fear is the origin of the emoluments clause, which safeguards against  bribery of government officials by foreign powers.   It cannot be that officers at the highest echelons of our  governmentowe favors to foreign capitals. But it may well be that a  high-level member of President Trump's campaign and administration,  General Flynn, violated the emoluments clause by accepting money from  the Russian Government during a trip to Moscow in 2015. The reported  contact between operatives in the Trump campaign and Russian  intelligence officials is exactly the kind of intrigue that our  Founders sought to prohibit.   I mention all of this because I believe the stakes to be very high.  This is not a drill. Nothing less than our system of checks and  balances, the rule of law, and our national security is at stake.   Our Nation does not face moments like this often. Frankly, the fact  that foreign powers would have high influence in our government has not  been on the front page for decades. But the wisdom of the Founding  Fathers shines through. It is a real danger, and now the possibility of  that danger being real is here today.   History will look upon us and will no doubt judge our efforts to stem  this wrong wherever it occurs. Our Nation does not face moments like  this often.   From the earliest days of the Republic, what has always sustained us  has been the strength of our democratic institutions of government. We  have distinct pillars of power that check and balance one another for  the very purpose of fortifying our government whenever one branch is  deficient. On this matter, the legislative branch has a responsibility  to be that check and balance via our oversight duties.   All of us can agree that right now what are required are the facts.  We have to evaluate the scope of Russia's interference in our election  and assess if agents of their government have penetrated to the highest  levels of our government. Throughout the process, we have to avoid  jumping to conclusions or engaging in wild speculation. We must seek  the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Once we have all  the facts at our disposal, Democrats and Republicans alike can debate  what to do next.   The investigation should proceed along two tracks. The first is  Congress. My friend from Virginia, Senator Warner, the ranking member  on the Senate Intelligence Committee, is committed to using every  resource and authority in that committee to seek the truth. His  committee will take the lead, but it will not be the only committee  that looks into ties between the Trump campaign, transition, or  administration, and Russia. The Judiciary, Foreign Relations, HSGAC,  Banking, and Commerce Committees all have significant roles at getting  to the bottom of this. They should also move forward in their areas of  jurisdiction. These committee investigations must be bipartisan; they  must have access to all intelligence officials, transcripts, documents,  and other related materials that they need to answer critical  questions; and they must be permitted to make their findings public to  the maximum extent possible.   Of course, anything that Congress does requires Republican support  because they are in the majority. I am gratified that some of our  Republican colleagues have called for that. Bipartisan letters from the  Judiciary Committee and the Intelligence Committee have been and are  being sent last night and today. These letters will ask for document  preservation, briefings, and for information related to the  investigations.   As for the Intelligence Committee, Senator Burr, the chairman,  originally expressed skepticism about his committee proceeding with an  investigation into the ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, but  he is now working well with Senator Warner to do this. We will be  watching very carefully. If the Intelligence Committee investigation is  not proceeding to unearth the entire truth, we will seek alternative  tools and structures to get to the truth because get to the truth we  must.   The second part of the investigation is in the executive branch,  where law enforcement resides. While Congress has a constitutional  oversight ability to bring facts to light, it is only the executive  branch that can prosecute potential criminal liability.   The two are not mutually exclusive. They are not either/or. They must  move forward simultaneously on parallel tracks.   On the executive branch side, three specific things must now happen:   First, Attorney General Sessions must follow Department of Justice  guidance and recuse himself.   When the FBI looks into a matter, they do so right alongside  prosecutors from the Justice Department. Those prosecutors should not  be reporting to the first Senator who endorsed Donald Trump's campaign,  who served on the same campaign committee as General Flynn, and who  nominated Donald Trump at the Republican convention. The Justice  Department's own guidelines demand that Attorney General  [[Page S1226]]  Sessions remove himself from this matter immediately. If he does not,  he will be breaking serious guidelines that have been in place for  decades, followed by both Republican and Democratic administrations  alike. To disregard or ignore these rules would be a major  transgression by this administration, so early in its term, and would  bode poorly for the future impartiality of the criminal justice system.   We now know that the President and the Attorney General are meeting  today. Of course the President needs to meet with the Attorney General;  that is important for national security. But until the Attorney General  recuses himself, those meetings raise serious questions. There will be  a cloud hanging over every meeting and conversation between the  President and the Attorney General until the Attorney General recuses  himself. We presume that they would not even think of discussing the  investigation--that the Attorney General and the President would not-- because if they were to discuss any investigation, it would constitute  a massive, massive ethical violation.   Second, to reiterate, from the executive branch point of view, we  expect the administration will order all records from administration,  transition, and campaign officials to be preserved.   There is real concern that some in the administration may try to  cover up its ties to Russia by deleting emails, texts, or other records  that could shine a light on these connections. These records are likely  to be the subject of executive branch as well as congressional  investigations and must be preserved.   Third, campaign, transition, and administration officials must be  made available to testify in public, under oath, on these issues.   It has been reported that campaign officials have had constant  contact with Russian intelligence officials. They must testify.   Our caucus is united in these three requests, and we hope and expect  our Republican colleagues to join in these appeals as well.   Senate Democrats are faithfully committed to keeping this issue above  partisan politics. The gravity of this issue demands nothing less.   Throughout the history of this country, the Senate has come together  to steer the ship of state through stormy seas when the times required  it. Republican Senators like Howard Baker, Hugh Scott, and Bob Dole  rose above politics during the Watergate, Iran-Contra, and Whitewater  scandals to demand the truth. I am very hopeful my Republican  colleagues on the other side will follow in that grand tradition. I am  very hopeful the other side wants to get at all the facts, just as our  side wants to get at all the facts.   I disagree with my friends on the other side of the aisle often on a  number of issues--often, we disagree vociferously--but I have never  once doubted their patriotism. This is an issue on which patriotism  must prevail over politics because before we are Democrats or  Republicans, we are Americans, with respect for the rule of law.   I have a hope and a faith that these reports and revelations will not  pit the two parties against one another--that they will unite the  parties in pursuit of the full truth.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that of the  postcloture debate time under my control, that 60 minutes be yielded to  Senator Schatz, 60 minutes be yielded to Senator Whitehouse, 35 minutes  be yielded to Senator Merkley, and 15 minutes be yielded to Senator  Cantwell.

Thank you, Madam President.    Thank you, Madam President.    Thank you, Madam President.    I will be happy to yield for a UC request.    Does that meet the favor of my friend from Oregon? Is  that OK?    The Senator from Oklahoma asked for 5 minutes  immediately after my remarks.    No objection.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, I rise today on two topics--the need  for Attorney General Sessions to recuse himself from the executive  branch investigation into General Flynn and the nomination of Attorney  General Pruitt to be the EPA Administrator.   First, on the matter of executive branch investigations into General  Flynn's contact with the Russian Ambassador, I rise again to stress my  expectation that Attorney General Sessions will recuse himself from  this investigation.   This morning we learned--according to reports in the Washington  Post--that General Flynn may have lied--lied--to FBI investigators  about the content of his phone call with the Russian Ambassador prior  to the election. That is a potential felony offense, and it must be  looked at and, if validated, potentially prosecuted by law enforcement  officials at the Department of Justice. That review must be independent  and thorough and completely by the books. In order for it to be so, the  Attorney General must recuse himself pursuant to Department of Justice  guidelines that prohibit members of the Department from participating  in investigations of close political allies or friends.   The guidelines are crystal clear. I have read them on the floor  before, but they are worth reading because there is no wiggle room  here. It is absolutely clear:         No Department of Justice employee may participate in a       criminal investigation or prosecution if he has a personal or       political relationship with any person or organization       substantially involved in the conduct that is the subject of       the investigation or prosecution. . . . Political       relationship means a close identification with an elected       official, candidate, political party, or campaign       organization arising from service as a principal adviser or       official.    Those are the words of the DOJ guidelines. Those are not my words,  but they are common sense. We don't want conflict of interest in our  prosecutors. We don't want the appearance of a conflict in something as  sacred as law enforcement here in America.   It is patently absurd to think that the Attorney General--a man who  served alongside General Flynn on Candidate Trump's campaign council-- is prepared to lead this investigation in an impartial way and in full  compliance with those longstanding Department of Justice rules. There  would be a complete appearance of a conflict and might, indeed, be a  conflict itself. By the guidelines, it certainly is. There is no wiggle  room here. AGs have recused themselves at least eight times over the  past two decades to avoid the appearance of bias--twice under President  Obama, five times under President Bush, and once under President  Clinton.   To conclude my remarks on this topic, I want to show--and I ask  unanimous consent that an op-ed coauthored by then-Senator Sessions  calling on Attorney General Loretta Lynch to recuse herself in the  matter of Secretary Clinton's emails be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     [From FoxNews.com, Nov. 05, 2016]  Giuliani, Sessions, Keating, et al.: Time for Loretta Lynch to Appoint                             a Special Counsel  (Editor's note: The authors of the following column are all supporting                        Donald Trump for president)         We are concerned about the egregious damage that has been       inflicted on two revered government agencies: the Department       of Justice and Department of State. The primary missions of       both have been derailed for political purposes.        The Department of Justice has been thwarted by its top       officials' refusal to conduct a proper investigation of       former Secretary Clinton's unsecured email server and the Pay       for Play accusations based on millions of dollars paid to       President Clinton personally and the Clinton Foundation by       entities having issues before the State Department, all while       she was Secretary.        Attorney General Lynch and former President Clinton met on       the Phoenix, Arizona tarmac days before Secretary Clinton was       to be interviewed by the FBI for possible criminal activity.       It has been reported that her staff ordered witnesses not to       take pictures and no one was present during their 39-minute       conversation. General Lynch never recused herself from       decisions on the Clinton  [[Page S1383]]       investigation after her self-admitted ``mistake,'' as it has       also been reported that she continues to deny the FBI the       authority to convene a Grand Jury, which is necessary for any       meaningful investigation.    Secretary Clinton's conduct at the Department of State corrupted our                               foreign policy         It has also been reported that General Lynch opposed       Director Comey from fulfilling his obligation to Congress by       informing members of the discovery of 650,000 emails on       Anthony Weiner's and Huma Abedin's computer, the existence of       which had been concealed from government authorities.        Recusal is a formal process. It is a written document       specifically describing the scope of the recusal and       designating the official in charge of the recused matter. If       General Lynch went through the proper procedure for recusal,       she has not publicly shared it.        Secretary Clinton's conduct at the Department of State       corrupted our foreign policy. She and President Clinton       turned the agency into a Pay for Play adjunct of the Clinton       Foundation and their personal bank account, the latter via       his personal ``speaking'' fees. [UBS, Switzerland's largest       bank, contributed over $600,000 to the Foundation and loaned       it over $30,000,000. UBS was grateful that Secretary Clinton       had intervened in the IRS' demand to UBS to provide       identities of 52,000 depositors. Secretary Clinton announced       the settlement of only 4,450 identities in an ``unusual       intervention by a top U.S. diplomat,'' according to the Wall       Street Journal. UBS additionally paid President Clinton       personally $1,500,000 for a series of questions and answers       with top management.        President Clinton reaped $6,200,000 personally from foreign       governments and businesses for speeches while she was       Secretary of State. For example, Ericsson, a Swedish       corporation, had sanction issues pending before the State       Department regarding telecom sales in certain countries.       Ericsson paid President Clinton $750,000 for one speech. Days       later the State Department announced the sanction list and       Ericsson was not affected. Why should any spouse of a       Secretary of State be permitted ever to receive one cent from       a foreign entity?        Because of our grave concern for integrity in government we       ask for a Special Counsel. When a high public official is       accused of serious wrongdoing and there is a sufficient       factual predicate to investigate, it is imperative the       investigation be thorough, with dispatch and without       partisanship.        Secretary Clinton is the subject of two spheres of criminal       conduct: her deliberate, systematic mishandling of official       and classified emails and her abuse of a family-controlled,       tax-exempt Foundation, and corporate and foreign donations       for her own economic and political benefit.        These allegations arose well before this election year.        Clinton's mishandling of emails became public in March       2015, and allegations over abuse of the Foundation arose well       before that. There has long been sufficient factual predicate       to require these matters be fully investigated.        The appropriate response when the subject matter is public       and it arises in a highly-charged political atmosphere is for       the Attorney General to appoint a Special Counsel of great       public stature and indisputable independence to assure the       public the matter will be handled without partisanship.        In 1991-1992, a Special Counsel was appointed for three       separate matters: House Bank, Iraqgate, and Inslaw. It was       also done in 2003 in the Valerie Plame matter.        Instead of moving with dispatch to ensure a vigorous       investigation of Secretary Clinton, it appears that the       Justice Department, along with State, have enabled the       Clinton campaign to ``slow roll'' the inquiry.        General Lynch continues to exert control of a matter that       she should have assigned to another official.        We are distressed by widespread and credible reports that       FBI agents have been hindered by the Justice Department's       withholding of basic investigative tools, such as grand jury       subpoenas, which are fundamental in a complex investigation.        It is time to do what should have been done long ago--      appoint a Special Counsel.        Rudolph W. Giuliani--Former Associate Attorney General and       U.S. Attorney in Southern District of New York        Senator Jeff Sessions--former U.S. Attorney for Alabama's       Southern District        Frank Keating--Former Associate Attorney General, U.S. in       District of Kansas and Special Agent FBI        Victoria Toensing--former Deputy Assistant Attorney General       in the Criminal Division of the U.S. Justice Department        Henry McMaster--former U.S. Attorney, District of South       Carolina        Rudy Giuliani is the former Mayor of the City of New York.     Senator Sessions, right here, called for Loretta Lynch-- then Attorney General--to recuse herself because of a conflict of  interest under the very same guidelines we cited. We hope and we pray  that Senator Sessions doesn't have an enormous double standard by  refusing to recuse himself now when he asked the previous Attorney  General to do so. We hope that President Trump will abide by the  guidelines and encourage Senator Sessions to go by the guidelines and  not again invoke any double standard.   This op-ed makes it crystal clear. What was good enough for Loretta  Lynch, who did step aside, is good enough for Attorney General  Sessions, and it would be outrageous--outrageous--for him to be in  charge of this investigation.   The op-ed says: ``When a high public official is accused of serious  wrongdoing and there is a sufficient factual predicate to investigate,  it is imperative the investigation be thorough, without dispatch and  without partisanship.''   So I hope Attorney General Sessions takes the word of Senator Jeff  Sessions to heart. Every day that goes by without a recusal from the  Attorney General, the cloud hanging over this investigation and over  this administration gets darker and darker. And every time the  President and Attorney General Sessions confer, again, the cloud hovers  over them: What did they talk about? Was it this investigation?   So I hope Attorney General Sessions will do the right thing and  recuse himself. Justice, the American way, and separation of powers  require no less.   Madam President, today we will vote on another Cabinet nominee who is  clouded by potential conflicts of interest and whose views are almost  antithetical to the very purpose of the Agency to which he is  nominated.   Mr. Pruitt is a climate science denier--some say skeptic, but this is  not an issue where you can be skeptical; either you accept the  overwhelming opinion of climate scientists and researchers or you  don't.   Here is Scott Pruitt on climate change on Oklahoma talk radio:         Well, reasonable minds can disagree what is actually       happening, whether it is happening, number one, whether there       is change in climate that is occurring, that the trajectory       of it is something that is sustainable and whether that is       actually happening . . . the debate about climate change is       just that, a debate.    I would invite this nominee to walk through Long Beach or Long Island  or Staten Island in New York City in the days and weeks after  Superstorm Sandy rocked my State. None of those residents--the  thousands who lost homes, the hundreds of thousands who suffered  injury, damage, economic problems from the flood--they don't debate it,  nor should he. There was no debate there. Folks lost everything that  belonged to them. There was no debate about that. Forty-eight people in  my State died--no debate about that.   Climate change will lead to more devastating natural disasters like  Sandy, which was the third 100-year storm to strike my State in a  decade. Climate change will make asthma and respiratory diseases worse.  It is increasing the range of deer ticks that cause lyme disease--no  debate about that. We have to do something about climate change.   Scott Pruitt as head of our Nation's Environmental Protection Agency  likely wouldn't lift a finger. But it is part of a lifelong pattern.  Instead of fighting for average Americans, Mr. Pruitt decided to make a  name for himself among the far right by endlessly suing the EPA in ways  that would benefit large special interests that also happen to be  campaign contributors. In 13 of his 14 lawsuits against the EPA, he  joined corporations and trade associations that had contributed to his  campaign.   Just yesterday, an Oklahoma judge ruled that Scott Pruitt must turn  over approximately 3,000 emails relating to his communications with the  fossil fuel industry--the very industry he represented in these  lawsuits. We won't get those emails until Tuesday. So you would expect  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to be up in arms. Emails.  Remember, emails? We should get them out, they said, about Hillary  Clinton--the same group. In 2013, Gina McCarthy waited 122 days to be  confirmed for EPA Administrator because she wasn't honoring a  commitment, they felt, to transparency.   There were several inquiries into the emails of Lisa Jackson, another  EPA Administrator. But the majority and majority leader are proceeding  right along and rushing Attorney General Pruitt through the process. We  know why. They want you, my fellow Republicans, to vote for Mr. Pruitt  before  [[Page S1384]]  those emails come to light. If they weren't worried about them, then  why rush? It is not the worst thing in the world to take a few extra  days to properly vet someone who will have immense power over our  Nation's streams, skies, even the lead level in our homes and water  supply.   Those emails could contain material information about his  confirmation. But unless we move the confirmation back, the Senate will  not get a chance to review those emails before voting on his  nomination.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's postcloture time has expired.    I ask unanimous consent for 30 more seconds.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
