 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota  for yielding.   This Ukraine supplemental in this rule authorizes an additional $40  billion to provide defense articles and services, humanitarian aid, and  financial support.   I do believe it is important that Western countries continue to  support Ukraine in its fight against its barbaric aggressors, but  honestly, do we not deserve a plan? Does the administration not need to  come to us with where we are going with this?   This is an additional $40 billion on top of the several billion  dollars that have already been spent. It is not that I object to the  money. I object to not understanding how the administration is  proceeding with this.   Look, it was just 10 months ago that we were all on a conference call  with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, and the  Secretary of Homeland Security. They assured us that the government in  Afghanistan was solid, and they were going to be okay. At the same  time, we are all getting alerts on our phones that the government in  Afghanistan is headed for the exits with all of our money.   Then it was October of this year with the clear signs that Vladimir  Putin was amassing on the borders around Ukraine, and there was no  solid discussion about whether or not this was important for the United  States and whether or not we should do anything to counteract that.                                time  1830    Indeed, there were approvals for some transfer of weaponry, but it  was slow to get there. Then the President made the unfortunate  statement that a small incursion would perhaps be okay. The same  Secretary of Defense and the same Secretary of State told us that this  all would likely be over in 3 days' time, but they didn't take into  account the nationality, the spirit of President Zelenskyy and his  countrymen, who said: No, this is not going to happen in our country.   Look, none of us can predict the future, but truly the Biden  administration really does need to justify the use of American  resources as this conflict unfolds.   Is there a plan for when this supplemental funding runs out?   Will the United States defense production keep up with Ukrainian  demand?   Who is keeping count on the number of Stingers and Javelin missiles  that are leaving our stockpiles that should be defending our homeland?  Are we depleting those so severely that we wouldn't be able to respond  should we need to?   Are we providing resources that will give Ukraine an asymmetric  advantage to eventually win this war? If we are not doing that, how  long are we going to ask the American people to continue to fund the  status quo?   Look, Russia advancing beyond Ukraine's borders into NATO territory  would almost certainly also draw the United States into a war in  Europe. But let me stress: That is a war in Europe. Where is the rest  of Europe in this? We all want to prevent that outcome. We cannot let  Vladimir Putin create this new world order in which he is the new  tyrant of the world. To defeat him, we have to be united in our goals,  united in the expenditure of American resources in support of those  [[Page H4767]]  goals, and we have to have a plan that we are confident is being  followed.   It is not lost on me that this amount of money that we are asking to  appropriate in an emergency fashion today is exactly one-half of the  dollar amount of the weaponry that was abandoned in Afghanistan,  abandoned to our enemies. Let's not find ourselves in that situation  again.
