 Madam President, the distinguished Senator from  Washington and I often agree on issues, and for the most part we agree  on this. We agree that equal pay for equal work is the right thing to  do. What I would add is that equal pay for equal work is already the  law.   Paycheck discrimination on the basis of gender is wrong. It is  already illegal in the United States. Congress prohibited  discrimination based on gender in the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and Title  VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.   The Equal Pay Act is very clear: ``No employer . . . shall  discriminate . . . between employees on the basis of sex by paying  wages to employees . . . less than . . . he pays . . . employees of the  opposite sex . . . for equal work . . . which requires equal skill,  effort, and responsibility, and which are performed under similar  working conditions. . . . ''   Equal pay for equal work. That already is the law; therefore, it is  unnecessary to have yet another law saying basically the same thing. I  object.
