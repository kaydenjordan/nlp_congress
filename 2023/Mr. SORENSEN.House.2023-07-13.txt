 Mr. Chair, today, extremists have put our national  security at risk with this partisan National Defense Authorization Act.   I was pleased to work across the aisle with Congressman LaHood to try  to save the 182nd Airlift Wing in Peoria, Illinois. We should be  focused on these bipartisan issues, not the extremists who have added  amendments that have nothing to do with national defense and security,  including the extreme restriction on abortion access, which threatens  women servicemembers' ability to make their own healthcare decisions.  We need a clean and bipartisan NDAA.
