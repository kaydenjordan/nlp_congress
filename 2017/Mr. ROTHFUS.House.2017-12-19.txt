 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act.   Today we move away from a trickle-down government redistribution  economy to one that is bottom up, organic, and growing. While the  trickle-down government of the last 8 years was great for Washington  and the 1 percent, it did little for the rest of the country.   Today we turn the tide and put money back in the pockets of  hardworking taxpayers and Main Street businesses. This bill gives  immediate relief to moderate income and middle class families.   A single mom earning $41,000 with one kid will see a tax cut of  $1,300, while a family of four making $73,000 will get more than $2,000  back.   The questions are: Will we vote together and put this money back into  the pockets of hardworking Americans? Or will we keep that money here  in wealthy Washington, D.C.? Will we vote together to level the global  playing field for America's businesses and end the unfair status quo  that sends American companies and jobs overseas?   It is an easy choice, Mr. Speaker: vote ``yes'' on this bill and  let's make America prosperous again.
