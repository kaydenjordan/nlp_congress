 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support H.R. 3110,  the ``Pump for Nursing Mothers Act,'' which will close an unintentional  loophole in the 2010 Break Time for Nursing Mothers Act.   The 2010 law requires employers to provide break time and a place for  hourly wage-earning and some salaried employees to express breast milk  at work for one year after the birth of the employee's child.   Unfortunately, this law unintentionally excluded a quarter of all  working women--nearly nine million employees--from protection.   H.R. 3110 closes this coverage gap by extending the law's protections  to cover salaried employees as well as other categories of employees  currently exempted from protections, such as teachers, nurses, and  farmworkers.   H.R. 3110 would also provide employers clarity on paid and unpaid  pumping time.   The bill leaves in place existing law protecting many salaried  workers from having their pay docked and clarifies that employers must  pay an hourly employee for any time spent pumping if the employee is  also working.   Lastly, the bill would ensure that nursing mothers have access to  remedies that are available for other violations of the Fair Labor  Standards Act.   According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, women  with children are the fastest-growing segment of the workforce, and  balancing work and family is an important priority for all employees.   More than 80% of new mothers in the United States begin  breastfeeding, 1 and 6 in every 10 new mothers are in the workforce.   New parents face an incredible amount of increased difficulties while  juggling work, family and mental and emotional tolls that are  exacerbated as a new parent.   According to a study published in Reviews in Obstetrics and  Gynecology, breastfeeding provides health benefits for not only  infants, but also for mothers.   For mothers, abstaining from breastfeeding has been associated with  an increase in developing various types of cancers, type 2 diabetes,  heart attacks, retained gestational weight gain and metabolic syndrome  in adult women.   For infants, not being breastfed is associated with infectious  illnesses such as pneumonia, ear infections, gastroenteritis, and can  increase the risk of developing childhood-onset obesity, type 1 and 2  diabetes, leukemia and SIDS.   This bill will ensure that mothers will no longer be forced to choose  between their own health, their infant's health, and their income.   This includes individuals like Melissa Hodgkins, who has had to bring  suit against her employer simply to provide workers with a clean,  private place and breaks to breast pump at work.   Her coworkers were often of losing their paychecks to ask the airline  to accommodate them; in fact, when some of her coworkers did ask for  breaks and a place to pump, her employer actually prohibited them from  pumping at work, and even forced them off the job without a paycheck.   The PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act will stop such bad actions by  employers and alleviate the disparities that currently exist between  breastfeeding employees and their coworkers, sending a clear message  that the workforce will protect and support women who opt to balance a  career and motherhood.   For these reasons, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 3110, the  ``Pump for Nursing Mothers Act.''                        [From ACLU, Sept. 30, 2021]             The PUMP Act Would Protect Nursing Workers Like Me                           (By Melissa Hodgkins)         I took Frontier Airlines to court for making it impossible       for me to pump breast milk at work. Other workers shouldn't       have to fight for their rights like I did.        When started my career as a flight attendant, I never       imagined that I wouldn't be able to continue breastfeeding       after I went back to work. I thought that, like most       workplaces, my airline would be required by federal law to       provide workers a clean, private place and breaks to pump at       work. (That's thanks to a provision known as the Break Time       for Nursing Mothers law.)        But it turns out my employer isn't. That's because flight       attendants are among the approximately 9 million women who       are excluded from the law's protection--along with other       transportation workers, teachers, agricultural workers,       nurses, and many others. A bill before Congress right now--      the PUMP for Nursing Mothers Act--would fix that. Congress       should act now to pass it.        I first realized the pickle I was in when I became pregnant       with my first child and found out that my employer, Frontier       Airlines, didn't provide any accommodations for nursing moms.       I'd watched other flight attendant moms trying to make it       work pumping on the job--and I saw how stressful it was for       them.        They were too fearful of losing their paychecks to ask the       airline to accommodate them. When some of my coworkers did       ask for breaks and a place to pump, Frontier actually       prohibited them from pumping at work, and even forced them       off the job without a paycheck.        That was when I started to feel like Frontier was making me       choose between my career and breastfeeding my baby. I believe       breast milk is optimal for babies, and I wanted to give him       those health benefits. At the same time, I didn't feel great       about pumping in an unsanitary airplane lavatory, and having       to scramble to find time to pump between flights, especially       given my unpredictable schedule. I was worried I'd lose my       job if I had to pump on duty and got reported. Even though I       desperately wanted to keep nursing my baby, I just couldn't       see how I could make it work. It was a wrenching decision,       but I decided I had no choice but to give up breastfeeding in       order to go back to work and support my family.        No woman should have to make that kind of decision. But       because of the gap in coverage under the current law, too       many of us still do. The ACLU is representing me in a lawsuit       arguing that Frontier's treatment of pregnant and       breastfeeding pilots and flight attendants is discriminatory.       But if the airline had not been exempt from the duty under       the existing federal Break Time Law to provide breaks and a       clean place to pump, we probably would have never had to take       Frontier to court over that in the first place.  [[Page H5810]]         The PUMP Act would give workers like me the protection we       need: a clear requirement that all employers must provide       workers who are nursing with the basic accommodations they       need. Solutions exist in all industries--including airlines--      that would allow employees to pump safely. And the bill would       strengthen the law in other ways, extending protections from       one year to two years, clarifying that it covers situations       like adoption or stillbirth, and ensuring that when employers       are not in compliance, there is a meaningful way to enforce       it.        The bill has bipartisan support in Congress. Let's make       sure it becomes law so that all workers--no matter what       industry they work in--have the choice to continue       breastfeeding and the ability to get back to work.     Madam Speaker, it gives me great joy when I can come  to the floor and really speak directly to the moms and dads and  families that right now, as we stand on the floor, are probably looking  to gather children from schools, looking at what they are going to do  over the weekend, maybe doing grocery shopping and looking at the  resources that they do have or do not have.   It is important that we immediately pass the Build Back Better Act  and that those who have a difference of opinion realize that it is  always the greater good that America has always been about. When we  have gone to war, we have not gone to war to be an offender. We have  gone to war to defend principles of democracy.   I believe the Build Back Better Act will provide greater pricing of  prescription drugs, strengthening the Affordable Care Act, expanding  Medicaid for some 12 States. The State of Texas happens to be one of  them, where 733,000-plus people are uninsured. These are working  people. Expanding Federal Medicaid is going to help those people in  States like Kansas and South Dakota. If they won't speak for  themselves, I will speak for America.   In addition, the care economy really says that we must give childcare  and universal kindergarten to people so that we can be advanced and our  people can be helped.   Finally, let me say that voting is important and crucial. We must  pass voting rights.   This is Build Back Better America, and build back makes America the  best country in the world.
