         Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. The       yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself, and that is       what has happened to the American Negro. Something within has       reminded him of his birthright of freedom, and something       without has reminded him that it can be gained. Consciously       or unconsciously, he has been  [[Page S1920]]       caught up by the Zeitgeist, and with his black brothers of       Africa and his brown and yellow brothers of Asia, South       America and the Caribbean, the United States Negro is moving       with a sense of great urgency toward the promised land of       racial justice. If one recognizes this vital urge that has       engulfed the Negro community, one should readily understand       why public demonstrations are taking place. The Negro has       many pent up resentments and latent frustrations, and he must       release them. So let him march; let him make prayer       pilgrimages to the city hall; let him go on freedom rides--      and try to understand why he must do so. If his repressed       emotions are not released in nonviolent ways, they will seek       expression through violence; this is not a threat but a fact       of history.        So I have not said to my people: ``Get rid of your       discontent.'' Rather, I have tried to say that this normal       and healthy discontent can be channeled through into the       creative outlet of nonviolent direct action. And now this       approach is being termed extremist. But though I was       initially disappointed at being categorized as an extremist,       as I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a       measure of satisfaction from the label. Was not Jesus an       extremist for love: ``Love your enemies, bless them that       curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them       which despitefully use you, and persecute you.'' Was not Amos       an extremist for justice: ``Let justice roll down like waters       and righteousness like an ever flowing stream.'' Was not Paul       an extremist for the Christian gospel: ``I bear in my body       the marks of the Lord Jesus.'' Was not Martin Luther an       extremist: ``Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise, so help me       God.'' And John Bunyan: ``I will stay in jail to the end of       my days before I make a butchery of my conscience.'' And       Abraham Lincoln: ``This nation cannot survive half slave and       half free.'' And Thomas Jefferson: ``We hold these truths to       be self evident, that all men are created equal . . .'' So       the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what       kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate       or for love? Will we be extremists for the preservation of       injustice or for the extension of justice?        In that dramatic scene on Calvary's hill three men were       crucified. We must never forget that all three were crucified       for the same crime--the crime of extremism. Two were       extremists for immorality, and thus fell below their       environment. The other, Jesus Christ, was an extremist for       love, truth and goodness, and thereby rose above his       environment.        Perhaps the South, the nation and the world are in dire       need of creative extremists. I had hoped the white moderate       would see this need. Perhaps I was too optimistic; perhaps I       expected too much. I suppose I should have realized that few       members of the oppressor race can understand the deep groans       and passionate yearnings of the oppressed race, and still       fewer have the vision to see that injustice must be rooted       out by strong, persistent and determined action. I am       thankful, however, that some of our white brothers in the       South have grasped the meaning of this social revolution and       committed themselves to it. They are still all too few in       quantity, but they are big in quality. Some--such as Ralph       McGill, Lillian Smith, Harry Golden, James McBride Dabbs, Ann       Braden and Sarah Patton Boyle--have written about our       struggle in eloquent and prophetic terms. Others have marched       with us down nameless streets of the South. They have       languished in filthy, roach infested jails, suffering the       abuse and brutality of policemen who view them as ``dirty       niggerlovers.'' Unlike so many of their moderate brothers and       sisters, they have recognized the urgency of the moment and       sensed the need for powerful ``action'' antidotes to combat       the disease of segregation. Let me take note of my other       major disappointment.        I have been so greatly disappointed with the white church       and its leadership. Of course, there are some notable       exceptions. I am not unmindful of the fact that each of you       has taken some significant stands on this issue. I commend       you, Reverend Stallings, for your Christian stand on this       past Sunday, in welcoming Negroes to your worship service on       a nonsegregated basis. I commend the Catholic leaders of this       state for integrating Spring Hill College several years ago.        But despite these notable exceptions, I must honestly       reiterate that I have been disappointed with the church. I do       not say this as one of those negative critics who can always       find something wrong with the church. I say this as a       minister of the gospel, who loves the church; who was       nurtured in its bosom; who has been sustained by its       spiritual blessings and who will remain true to it as long as       the cord of life shall lengthen.
