 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the  Protecting the Right to Organize, or PRO, Act.   In 1987, I was arrested for standing on a public sidewalk.   My crime?   I was seeking to help hospital workers organize with SEIU. That was  one of many experiences I had demonstrating how American elections for  workers to form a union are more like political elections in a  dictatorship than in a democracy.   The recent union election at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama shows  just how stacked the deck is against workers. It shows the power  wielded by companies large and small and the lengths they will go to  keep owners and executives reaping the benefits of growing  productivity, even at the expense of their workers' very dignity.   It shows the urgent need for change. The Senate must send the PRO Act  to the President's desk.                            ____________________
