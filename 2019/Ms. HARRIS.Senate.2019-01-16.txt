 We are now 26 days into the longest government shutdown  in American history, and 800,000 workers--800,000 Americans--are going  without pay. Half of them are working anyway.   Let's be very clear about how we got into this mess. The Senate  unanimously passed a bill to open the government right before the  holidays. The vote was 100 to 0. There was such jubilance on this floor  that, literally, Members of the Senate were singing Christmas carols.   Yet 2 weeks ago, the House, doing its job, then passed a bill to  reopen the government. They sent six bills over to the Senate. This  body needs to hold a vote on that legislation and send it to the  President and ask him to sign it.   The real obstacle to ending this shutdown is in the White House. The  President is holding the American people hostage over his vanity  project on the southern border and peddling his usual propaganda to  distract from a crisis of his own making.   The President has said that ``most of the workers not getting paid  are Democrats,'' as if that is true or if that should matter. He has  said that ``many of the people that we're talking about . . . agree  with what we're doing.'' It has been said that the workers have said to  ``stay out until you get the funding for the wall.''   Well, that is contrary to what we have been hearing and what I have  been hearing. Last week, for example, I heard from a woman by the name  of Trisha. Trisha and her husband are both air traffic controllers with  nearly 40 years of Federal service combined. Trisha's husband served in  the Navy. He now has to work long hours of overtime to compensate for  the workers who are absent because they have been furloughed, and he is  not being paid.   Trisha's job was deemed nonessential, so she is also not being paid.  Neither parent in this family is being paid. They have three young  children, and this is on top of the fact that Trisha and her family  have already endured hardship these past few months as victims of the  Thomas fire.   As she wrote me:         On December 5th of last year, our home was completely       destroyed in the Thomas fire and we have used every resource       available to us to work towards rebuilding our home.    While their home is being rebuilt, Trisha's family moved into a  rental home, and they are currently evacuated from that rental home due  to the flood and mudslide risks that are currently an issue in  California.   Trisha said:         We have small children that we are most concerned about       (with the uncertainty of our careers as Federal employees and       the incredibly long road ahead in rebuilding our home but       most importantly our livelihood).    She writes:         We will continue to stand with our NATCA Brothers and       Sisters in ensuring the safety of the National Airspace       System, but without the support staff working, it is a       daunting task.    Trisha's message is one of nearly 20,000 phone calls, emails, and  letters my office has received since the shutdown started 26 days ago-- all pleading with us to reopen the U.S. Government.   They are 2 of the 42,300 workers who are currently being furloughed  in California. I don't know which of them are Democrats or Republicans,  and it doesn't matter. What matters is the people who are being hurt  and the critical government functions that are going undone. They are  the TSA agents who protect our flights and the air traffic controllers  who help to land our planes. They are park rangers and FBI agents and  Coast Guard members. They inspect our food and provide loans to our  farmers. They conduct lifesaving research. Right now, though, they are  being told to pay their bills by babysitting or selling their  belongings on craigslist.   These Americans need their government to do its job. They don't need  a wall. They need paychecks. Congress is a coequal branch of  government. We don't need a permission slip before we can vote on a  bill.   On behalf of Trisha and hundreds of thousands of Americans like her,  let's take up the legislation that we have already approved. Let's send  it to the President, and let's end this pointless shutdown as soon as  possible--right away, now.   I yield back my time.
