 Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Schakowsky and  Congresswoman Spanberger.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of my bill, the Real- Time Benefits Act, which has been incorporated into the bill before us  today.   The bill started with a very simple request from seniors in my  district. People want to know how much a prescription will cost before  they pick it up at the drugstore, and they deserve to know that it is  the best possible price that they can get.   This bill does that very thing. It provides Medicare patients with  the information they need about the cost of the prescription and  whether there are generic alternatives, as well as the best pharmacy  for the best deal before they even leave the doctor's office.   Right now, here is how the system works. A patient goes to the  doctor, gets a prescription, and walks out. Then they take it to a  local pharmacy, fill it, and pick it up. It is right then, at the  counter, in front of everyone else, that they actually find out the  price of their bill.   There is no advanced warning, no comparison shopping, no offer of  generics, and no way of knowing if a different pharmacy could have it  cheaper. By the time you get to the pharmacy, they have you over a  barrel. This bipartisan bill would fix that.   Here is how it works. Insurers would be required to provide  information to a common system, a real-time benefits tool, which  doctors would access through their electronic prescribing program.  Doctors and patients could then sit together to receive real-time  updates, right in the doctor's office, on the price of the drug based  on the patient's insurance plan, as well as the price of any other  cheaper drugs available.   This real-time benefits tools will also list the price differences at  each pharmacy--Rite Aid versus CVS--to allow physicians to make sure  that the patients are getting the lowest possible prices.                                time  1830    This not only lowers out-of-pocket costs for seniors, but it  increases much-needed price transparency into our system.   Imagine if, every time you went to the doctor, both you and your  physician could see the differences in the prices of drugs. This is the  kind of all-American competition we need when it comes to our  prescription drugs.   To be clear, the cost of prescription drugs is the number one issue I  get asked about in my district. People come up to me in the grocery  store. They grab my arm. They ask me why their medication has increased  by 200 percent in cost in the past 5 years.   Connie, a constituent of mine in Brighton, spends $10,000 a year on  Humira for her Crohn's disease, even though she is on Medicare.   Joanna, who lives in my hometown of Holly, Michigan, was hospitalized  for several days due to complications because she could not afford her  inhaler. Her complex health needs require a number of medicines, so she  literally rations her medicines in order to keep them manageable, and  she still spends hundreds of dollars each month.   This is wrong, and our constituents, regardless of party, are asking  us to do something about it.   Democrats and Republicans have both said the right things about the  cost of prescription drugs. They have talked the talk. They now must  walk the walk.   I am incredibly proud to have brought forth this bipartisan  legislation tonight. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes''  to promote transparency and competition.
