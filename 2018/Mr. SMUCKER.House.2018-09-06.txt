 Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today  to honor and remember a dedicated public servant in our community who  just passed away 2 weeks ago today at the young age of 53--Willow  Street Fire Chief Michael Reese.   Chief Reese's career as a firefighter, which spanned four decades and  began when he was a teenager, stands out in our community as one of  service, pride, and bravery. His loss is a tremendous loss to our  community as well as his fellow firefighters. President Bob Kiesel said  recently in a statement, and he said it best: ``Chief Reese's life was  dedicated to helping others.''   In addition to his 39 years as a firefighter and EMT, Chief Reese  spent 17 years as an emergency dispatcher and assistant supervisor with  the Lancaster County-Wide Communications. Chief Reese focused his  entire career on serving others, on making our community a safer place,  and on saving the lives of those he was charged with protecting.   Michael served alongside his brother, David, who is the deputy fire  chief in Willow Street. David and all the firefighters in Willow Street  and across central Pennsylvania will carry Michael's spirit with them  for the rest of their lives.   I am extraordinarily grateful for his service. We owe a debt of  gratitude to Chief Reese, his wife, Susan, and to his entire family.  His memory will not soon be forgotten.                            ____________________
