 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Violence  Against Women Reauthorization Act. I thank my colleague from Houston,  Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, for her leadership and her tireless  efforts to get this critical legislation to this House floor.   The Violence Against Women Act provides essential support for  survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault, and its  reauthorization now is vitally important, as many of my colleagues have  shared. It is critical for organizations in my community that support  survivors, like the Houston Area Women's Center, which has reported a  dramatic rise in requests for their services through the coronavirus  pandemic--more than 6,000 more calls responded to in 2020 alone.   Madam Speaker, in 2020, the number of people the center sheltered  tripled. Sadly, we have been reminded again today of the dangers that  women face in our society. The Violence Against Women Act provides  resources and services that are lifesaving. That is why I am proud to  cosponsor this legislation and to vote in support of it today.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do the same.
