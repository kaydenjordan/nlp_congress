 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the  Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act.   Throughout this crisis, our small businesses have done everything we  have asked, and it is past time that we add this necessary funding to  help them maintain payroll and survive this crisis.   But we all know that this cannot be the end of our work in response  to COVID-19. Local leaders across my northeast Ohio district have made  it clear that their finances are in dire shape. This is forcing  difficult decisions about essential services, including fire  departments and police officers.   While we should not bail out badly run States and cities, it is vital  that we provide targeted funding to municipalities like Parma, North  Canton, Medina, Orrville, Rootstown, and Green, municipalities that  have done things the right way and need our help.   I look forward to working with all of my colleagues on this.
