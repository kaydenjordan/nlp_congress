 Madam Speaker, today is National Rural Health Day.   More than 60 million Americans live in rural areas. Unfortunately,  these individuals tend to be in poorer health than those who live in  urban and suburban areas. They experience greater rates of chronic  disease than the rest of the U.S. population.   The U.S. Virgin Islands is one of these rural areas. Like most rural  America, the VI has high rates of chronic disease, diabetes, heart  disease, stroke, and experience unique challenges in accessing  healthcare.   The Virgin Islands, however, due to geographic distance from the  contiguous United States and our territorial status, face even further  challenges, including inequitable Federal funding. Our health providers  and families have to make difficult decisions, not based on care but on  distance and funding.   All Americans deserve easy accessibility to high quality healthcare.  I want to take this time to recognize the healthcare providers in the  Virgin Islands for their tireless work and commitment to the health and  well-being of our people.                            ____________________
