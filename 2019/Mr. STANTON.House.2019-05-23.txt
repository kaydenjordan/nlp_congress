 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my fellow colleagues from  Arizona to celebrate the life of a phenomenal woman. Geraldine Emmett,  ``Jerry'' to most of us, was 104 years old when she passed away on  April 30, 2019.   Many Americans got the chance to see Jerry sparkle in 2016 at the  Democratic National Convention, where she served as an honorary  delegate and, along with Congressman Gallego, proudly announced our  State's votes for Hillary Rodham Clinton.   But her devotion to the democratic process started long before that.  Part of what captured the attention of the rest of the country during  the national convention is that Jerry symbolized just how far women in  America had come. She was born before the 19th Amendment granted women  the right to vote. She lived through the civil rights movement, the  women's liberation movement, and the women's suffrage movement.   She brought a sign to the convention that read ``Centenarian for  Hillary,'' a reminder that you can be politically active at any age.   Jerry represented the best of our State. She graduated from Northern  Arizona University, and in her first job she instructed children with  disabilities and chronic illness on the Navajo Reservation.   She served as a public schoolteacher in Arizona for 43 years and  actively promoted civic engagement and participation. She was a pillar  in Democratic politics in Arizona for decades.   Each of us here today had a chance to witness Jerry's fierce passion  up close. We wanted to take this opportunity to celebrate her life and  contributions to our community.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. O'Halleran).     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona  (Mrs. Kirkpatrick).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Gallego).    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the members of the Arizona  delegation for those beautiful words about Jerry Emmett.   Now the rest of the country can see why she was such a treasure to  those of us in Arizona and what an honor it was today to honor her  life.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
