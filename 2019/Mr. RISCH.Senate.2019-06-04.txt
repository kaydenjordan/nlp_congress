This determination shall be published in the Federal       Register and, along with the accompanying Memorandum of       Justification, shall be transmitted to Congress.      (U) MEMORANDUM OF JUSTIFICATION FOR EMERGENCY ARMS TRANSFERS AND      AUTHORIZATIONS TO THE KINGDOM OF SAUDI ARABIA, THE UNITED ARAB   EMIRATES, AND THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN TO DETER IRANIAN MALIGN                                 INFLUENCE         (U) Iranian malign activity poses a fundamental threat to       the stability of the Middle East and to American security at       home and abroad. Iran's actions have led directly to the       deaths of over six hundred U.S. military personnel in Iraq,       untold suffering in Syria, and significant threats to Israeli       security. In Yemen, Iran helps fuel a conflict creating the       world's greatest humanitarian crisis. Iran directed repeated       attacks on civilian and military infrastructure in Saudi       Arabia and the United Arab Emirates by Iranian-designed       explosives-laden drones and ballistic missiles fired by the       Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, who receive financial,       technical, and materiel support from Iran.        (U) Current threat reporting indicates Iran engages in       preparations for further malign activities throughout the       Middle East region, including potential targeting of U.S. and       allied military forces in the region. As the Administration       publicly noted and briefed to Congress in greater detail in       the appropriate setting, a number of troubling and escalatory       indications and warnings from the Iranian regime have       prompted an increased U.S. force posture in the region. The       Iran-backed Houthis publicly threatened to increase       operations targeting vital military targets in the United       Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Saudi-Led Coalition       positions in Yemen. The rapidly-evolving security situation       in the region requires an accelerated delivery of certain       capabilities to U.S. partners in the region.        (U) As President Trump noted in National Security       Memorandum 11 of May 8, 2018, ``the actions and policies of       the Government of Iran, including its proliferation and       development of missiles and other asymmetric and conventional       weapons capabilities, its network and campaign of regional       aggression, its support for terrorist groups, and the malign       activities of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its       surrogates continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary       threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy       of the United States.''        (U) Iran's actions pose a critical threat to regional       stability and the national security of the United States,       which has been long acknowledged. Since 1984, Iran remains       designated by the United States as a State Sponsor of       Terrorism pursuant to section 6(j) of the Export       Administration Act, section 40 of the Arms Export Control       Act, and section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act. In       addition, the recent designation of Iran's Islamic       Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a Foreign Terrorist       Organization under section 219 of the Immigration and       Nationality Act notes the Government of Iran, through the       IRGC-Quds Force, provides material support  [[Page S3204]]       to the Taliban, Lebanese Hizballah, Hamas, Palestinian       Islamic Jihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of       Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC). Iran is also identified       as constituting an unusual and extraordinary threat to the       national security, foreign policy and economy of the United       States under Executive Orders dating back to the Carter and       Clinton Administrations.        (U) In 2014, the Houthis, an Iran-supported force       increasingly contributing to the Iranian regime's efforts to       destabilize the Arabian Peninsula, attempted to overthrow the       internationally recognized government of Yemen. The Houthis       have greatly increased regional instability, threatened the       global economy, destroyed infrastructure, and terrorized the       Yemeni people.        (U) The Houthis have attacked civilian areas within Saudi       Arabia and the UAE with ballistic missile and unmanned aerial       vehicle attacks in addition to cross-border raids; these have       resulted in the deaths of over five hundred Saudi civilians,       and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was fortunate in 2017 to have       intercepted a ballistic missile aimed at Mecca which could       have led to a regional conflagration.        (U) The Houthi threat to stability extends beyond the       security of their immediate neighbors. Over 10% of global       shipping passes through the Bab-el-Mandeb straits separating       Yemen from Africa, including an estimated 4.8 million barrels       of oil per day, or about 5% of the global oil trade. Since       2016, the Houthis have repeatedly targeted international       shipping transiting these straits to or from the Suez Canal.       Houthi-controlled media recently announced the Houthis'       intent to target Saudi ARAMCO infrastructure. Utilizing anti-      ship cruise missiles, small boat attacks, and remote-      controlled explosive vessels, the Houthis continue to strike       not only commercial oil tankers, but also struck a cargo ship       carrying grain to a Yemeni port. The Houthis conducted       maritime attacks on the USS Mason and the USS Ponce,       demonstrating the direct nature of the Houthi threat to U.S.       personnel, assets, and our national security.        (U) Within Yemen, the Houthis severely limited the ability       of the international community to provide humanitarian       assistance to the population under their control.       International humanitarian organizations report the ``Houthi       forces' widespread use of landmines along Yemen's western       coast since mid-2017 has killed and injured hundreds of       civilians and prevented aid groups from reaching vulnerable       communities.'' Despite the humanitarian catastrophe, the       Houthis continue to escalate the conflict in Yemen, most       recently disregarding their own commitments under the UN-      sponsored ceasefire deal regarding the port city of Hudaydah.        (U) The United States strongly backs peace efforts brokered       by UN Special Envoy Martin Griffiths. Griffiths' painstaking       endeavor to have parties reach agreements in peace talks in       Sweden in 2018 would lay a solid track for a political       process to end the conflict.        (U) For the reasons cited above, an emergency exists       requiring immediate provision of certain defense systems to       Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan in the       national security interest of the United States. Such       transfers, whether provided via the Foreign Military Sales       system, or through the licensing of Direct Commercial Sales,       must occur as quickly as possible in order to deter further       Iranian adventurism in the Gulf and throughout the Middle       East. The Secretary of State, therefore, has certified an       emergency exists under sections 36(b)(l), 36(c)(2), and       36(d)(2) of the Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2776,       thereby waiving the congressional review requirements of       those provisions.                            Transmittal No. 17-0B       Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensitivity of Technology           or Capability (Sec. 36(8)(5)(C), AECA)        (i) Purchaser: Government of the United Arab Emirates       (UAE).        (ii) Sec. 36(b)(l), AECA Transmittal No.: 16-15.        Date: 8 December 2016.        Military Department: Army.        (iii) Description: On December 8, 2016, Congress was       notified by Congressional certification transmittal number       16-15 of the possible sale under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms       Export Control Act of twenty-eight (28) AH-64E Remanufactured       Apache Attack Helicopters; nine (9) new AH-64E Apache Attack       Helicopters; seventy-six (76) T700-GE-701D Engines (56       remanufactured, 18 new, 2 spares); thirty-nine (39) AN/ASQ-      170 Modernized Target Acquisition and Designation Sight/AN/      AAR-11 Modernized Pilot Night Vision Sensors (28       remanufactured, 9 new, 2 spares); thirty-two (32)       remanufactured AN/APR-48B Modernized Radar Frequency       Interferometers; forty-six (46) AAR-57 Common Missile Warning       Systems (31 remanufactured, 9 new, 6 spares); eighty-eight       (88) Embedded Global Positioning Systems with Inertial       Navigation (72 new, 16 spares); forty-four (44) Manned-      Unmanned Teaming-International (MUMTi) systems (28       remanufactured, 9 new, 7 spares); and fifteen (15) new MUMTi       System Upper Receivers, training devices, helmets,       simulators, generators, transportation, wheeled vehicles and       organization equipment, spare and repair parts, support       equipment, tools and test equipment, technical data and       publications, personnel training and training equipment, U.S.       government and contractor engineering, technical, and       logistics support services, and other related elements of       logistics support. The estimated cost was $3.5 billion. Major       Defense Equipment (MDE) constituted $1.68 billion of this       total.        This transmittal reports:        1. the addition of thirty (30) Radar Electronic Units (REU)       as MDE, which were included in the total value of the       original transmittal, but were not properly identified as       MDE; and        2. the inclusion of additional quantities of the following       items: one (1) new AH-64E Apache Attack Helicopter, six (6)       T700-GE-701D engines (2 installed, 4 spares), one (1) new AN/      ASQ-170 Modernized Target Acquisition and Designation Sight/      AN/AAR-11 Modernized Pilot Night Vision Sensor, one (1) new       AAR-57 Common Missile Warning System, sixty-two (62) Embedded       Global Positioning Systems with Inertial Navigation (EGIs)       (60 remanufactured, 2 new), and one (1) new Manned-Unmanned       Teaming-International (MUMTi) system. The total MDE value of       these items is $101,518,591. The addition will not add to the       total notified value of MDE, which will remain $1.68 billion.       The total notified case value will remain $3.5 billion.        (iv) Significance: This notification is being provided to       report the inclusion of MDE and non-MDE items that were not       included in the original notification. The UAE lost a       helicopter during recent operations and has requested to       replace this loss.        (v) Justification: The Secretary of State has determined       and provided detailed justification that an emergency exists       that requires the immediate sale to the United Arab Emirates       of the above defense articles (and defense services) in the       national security interests of the United States, thereby       waiving the Congressional review requirements under Section       36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act, as amended. This       equipment will support the capabilities of UAE's Apache fleet       and enhance interoperability with the United States.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The AH-64E Apache Attack       Helicopter weapon system contains communications and target       identification equipment, navigation equipment, aircraft       survivability equipment, displays, and sensors. The airframe       itself does not contain sensitive technology; however, the       pertinent equipment listed below will be either installed on       the aircraft or included in the sale:        a. The Radar Electronic Unit (REU) is a component upgrade       to the AN/APO-78 Fire Control Radar (FCR). The REU replaces       two legacy Line Replaceable Units (Programmable Signal       Processor and Low Power Radio Frequency), achieving a weight       reduction of approximately 85 pounds, with improved       reliability, increased processing power, growth for new       modes/capabilities and replacement of obsolete components.       Critical system information is stored in the FCR/REU in the       form of mission executable code, target detection,       classification algorithms and coded threat parametric. This       information is provided in a form that cannot be extracted by       the foreign user via anti-tamper provisions built into the       system.        b. The AN/APG-78 Fire Control Radar (FCR) is an active, low       probability of intercept, millimeter-wave radar, combined       with a passive AN/APR-48B Modernized Radar Frequency       Interferometer (M-RFI) mounted on top of the helicopter mast.       The FCR Ground Targeting Mode detects, locates, classifies       and prioritizes stationary or moving armored vehicles, tanks       and mobile air defense systems as well as hovering       helicopters, helicopters, and fixed wing aircraft in normal       flight. If desired, the radar data can be used to refer       targets to the regular electro-optical Modernized Target       Acquisition and Designation Sight (MTADS). This information       is provided in a form that cannot be extracted by the foreign       user. The content of these items is classified SECRET. User       Data Module (UDM) on the RFI processor, contains the Radio       Frequency threat library. The UDM, which is a hardware       assemblage, is classified CONFIDENTIAL when programmed with       threat parameters, threat priorities and/or techniques       derived from U.S. intelligence information.        c. The AN/ASQ-170 Modernized Target Acquisition and       Designation Sight/AN/AAQ-11 Pilot Night Vision Sensor (MTADS/      PNVS) provides day, night, and limited adverse weather target       information, as well as night navigation capabilities. The       PNVS provides thermal imaging that permits nap-of-the-earth       flight to, from, and within the battle area, while TADS       provides the co-pilot gunner with search, detection,       recognition, and designation by means of Direct View Optics       (DVO), EI2 television, and Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR)       sighting systems that may be used singularly or in       combinations. Hardware is UNCLASSIFIED. Technical manuals for       authorized maintenance levels are UNCLASSIFIED. Reverse       engineering is not a major concern.        d. The AAR-57 Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) detects       energy emitted by threat missiles in-flight, evaluates       potential false alarm emitters in the environment, declares       validity of threat and selects appropriate countermeasures.       The CMWS consists of an Electronic Control Unit (ECU),       Electro-Optic Missile Sensors (EOMSs), and Sequencer and       Improved Countermeasures Dispenser (ICMD). The ECU hardware       is classified CONFIDENTIAL; releasable technical manuals for       operation and maintenance are classified SECRET.        e. The Embedded Global Positioning System/Inertial       Navigation System plus Multi-Mode Receiver (EGI+MMR) The       aircraft has  [[Page S3205]]       two EGIs which use internal accelerometers, rate gyro       measurements, and external sensor measurements to estimate       the aircraft state, provides aircraft flight and position       data to aircraft systems. The EGI is a velocity-aided, strap       down, ring laser gyro based inertial unit. The EGI unit       houses a GPS receiver. The receiver is capable of operating       in either non-encrypted or encrypted. When keyed, the GPS       receiver will automatically use anti-spoof/jam capabilities       when they are in use. The EGI will retain the key through       power on/off/on cycles. Because of safeguards built into the       EGI, it is not considered classified when keyed. Integrated       within the EGI is an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for       processing functions. Each EGI also houses a Multi-Mode       Receiver (MMR). The MMR is incorporated to provide for       reception of ground based NAVAID signals for instrument aided       flight. Provides IMC I IFR integration and certification of       improved Embedded Global Positioning System and Inertial       (EGI) unit, with attached MMR, with specific cockpit       instrumentation allows Apaches to operate within the       worldwide IFR route structure. Also includes integration of       the Common Army Aviation Map (CAAM), Area Navigation (RNAV),       Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF) and       Global Air Traffic Management (GATM) compliance.        f. Manned-Unmanned Teaming-International (MUMT-I) provides       Manned-Unmanned Teaming with Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs),       other Apaches and other interoperable aircraft and land       platforms. Provides ability to display real-time UAS sensor       information to aircraft and transmit MTADS video. Capability       to receive video and metadata from Interoperability Profile       compliant (IOP) as well as legacy systems. It is a data link       for the AH-64E that provides a fully integrated multiband,       interoperable capability that allows pilots to receive off-      board sensor video streaming from different platforms in non-      Tactical Common Data Link (TCDL) bands. The MUMT-I data link       can retransmit UAS or Apache Modernized Target Acquisition       Designation Sight full-motion sensor video and metadata to       another MUMT-I-equipped Apache. It can also transmit to       ground forces equipped with the One Station Remote Video       Terminal. It provides Apache aircrews with increased       situational awareness and net-centric interoperability while       significantly reducing sensor-to-shooter timelines. This       combination results in increased survivability of Apache       aircrews and ground forces by decreasing their exposure to       hostile fire.

Also included       are forty (40) Global Positioning Systems (GPS) with       Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) Type II       (MPE-S); air vehicle support equipment including eight (8)       Ground Control Stations (GCS), four (4) launchers, and four       (4) retrievers; spare and repair parts; publications;       training; and technical support services. The estimated total       case value is $80 million.        The Secretary of State has determined and provided detailed       justification that an emergency exists that requires the       immediate sale to the United Arab Emirates of the above       defense articles (and defense services) in the national       security interests of the United States, thereby waiving the       Congressional review requirements under Section 36(b) of the       Arms Export Control Act, as amended.        This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign and       national security of the United States by improving the       security of an important ally in the Middle East. This sale       is consistent with U.S. national security objectives of       assisting the UAE in developing and maintaining a strong and       ready self-defense capability and enhancing interoperability       with U.S. forces. The UAE will have no difficulty absorbing       these UAVs into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.

Transmittal No. 17-39       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(l) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:         1. The following components and technical documentation       for the program are classified as listed below:        a. The RQ-21 unmanned aircraft system (UAS) is a runway-      independent, modular unmanned aircraft system that is       designed for a variety of missions. The RQ-21 UAS has four       subsystems: RQ-21A air vehicle (AV), launcher, retriever, and       ground control stations (GCS).         1) The RQ-2IA AV is a fixed-wing, single engine AV       remotely controlled by an operator via the GCS.         2) The launcher is a pneumatically-controlled launch       device that accelerates the RQ-2IA AV to flying speed.         3) The retriever is a hydraulically-controlled telescoping       crane that captures the RQ-21A AV at the end of the flight.         4) The GCS is a workstation that is used to plan missions,       control and monitor the RQ-21A AV, and manage the data       received from the air vehicle.        b. The RQ-21 UAS is capable of transport via ground, air,       or ship. The RQ-21 UAS performs a wide variety of       reconnaissance, intelligence, and special missions.       Operationally or tactically vital data may be obtained cost-      effectively by exploiting the UAS mission systems and payload       options. The RQ-21A AV is designed to perform air       reconnaissance (AR) based missions. It is equipped to carry a       forward turret to support the primary mission of       reconnaissance and an assortment of specialized, mission       specific, payloads within the center payload bay. The Electro       Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) Imager Counter Countermeasures       sensor ball is the Alticam 11 EOIR4, which provides       exceptional day/night capability in a small, lightweight, low       power solution, or the EOIR5 which adds a laser designator       capability. It uses mid-wave infrared (MWIR) electro-optical       image, a gyrostabilized gimbal system, has multiple operating       modes, is compatible with the Alticam video processing board       (AVS), and has a laser pointer and rangefinder. It is       designed for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and is       also used on piloted airplanes, blimps, ground vehicles, and       unmanned surface vehicles.        c. The imagery and electronic reconnaissance functions of       the RQ-21A AV support intelligence functions and operational       warfighting missions. Intelligence-based support functions       range from intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance       (ISR) to intelligence preparation of the battlefield (IPB)       including imagery associated sub-tasks. Operational functions       are enhanced by a laser rangefinder and infrared marking       system. The turret, with laser system, facilitates target       acquisition and terminal guidance operations in support of a       wide breadth of aviation support to MAGTF operations mission.       These include but are not limited to point, area, and route       reconnaissance; convoy escort; call for indirect fires;       battle damage assessment; and tactical recovery of aircraft       and personnel. The aircraft also passively supports radio       communications relay and the vessel traffic function of       automatic identification.        d. The GCS includes an operator work station (OWS), a       ground data terminal for C2 communication and video downlink,       and a GPS electronics module (GEM) integration kit for       navigation. The GCS is composed of a standard component       package. If installed on a ship, the GCS will be composed of       the same components as the land based system, but the number       and arrangement of each of the components will vary depending       on the specific class of ship on which the GCS is installed.       The RQ-21 GCS is comprised of the following components:         1) Two operator work stations. The OWS consist of four       modules: electronics power module (EPM), network computer       module (NCM), user interface module (UIM), and the data       storage module (DSM). The EPM provides the power source for       the GCS. The EPM is the bottom module in the OWS. The UIM is       not installed in the GCS for ship-based operations.         2) Ground data terminal. The GDT includes the antenna       interface module (AIM), directional antenna, and omni       antennas (for ship-board operations only). The AIM models are       different between land and ship-based configurations.  [[Page S3206]]          3) GEM integration kit. The GEM integration kit includes       the GEM itself and the ground GPS antenna.         4) Moving platform module (MPM) integration kit (ship-      based only).         5) Selective availability and anti-spoofing module (SAASM)       GPS antenna.         6) Systems check laptop.         7) GCS cables.        e. The launcher provides the initial RQ-21A AV speed       required for air vehicle flight over a wide range of wind and       density altitude conditions, and enables expeditionary       employment of the UAS in locations without suitable runways.       The launcher is designed for transport by air, ship, or towed       by light vehicles into rugged terrain. The launcher is made       up of the launcher core and systems and the accessory       components. The launcher core is attached lengthwise on the       launcher trailer deck at two interface towers. The trailer is       used to transport the launcher components and serves as a       platform for the launcher core and systems.        f. The retriever system is comprised of the recovery system       and trailer. The recovery system is a hydraulically-      controlled telescoping crane mast that uses a vertical       capture rope to catch the RQ-21A AV. The vertical capture       rope features a bungee and rope energy dissipation system.       The retriever is mounted to a modified MIL-STD trailer       chassis. The trailer frame and hitch assembly connects the       retriever to a towing vehicle. The trailer has one axle and       four outriggers that are installed for use.        g.

There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 17-70       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(l) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Javelin Weapon System is a medium-range, man       portable, shoulder-launched, fire and forget, anti-tank       system for infantry, scouts, and combat engineers. It may       also be mounted on a variety of platforms including vehicles,       aircraft and watercraft. The system weighs 49.5 pounds and       has a maximum range in excess of 2,500 meters. The system is       highly lethal against tanks and other systems with       conventional and reactive armors, The system possesses a       secondary capability against bunkers.        2. Javelin's key technical feature is the use of fire-and-      forget technology which allows the gunner to fire and       immediately relocate or take cover. Additional special       features are the top attack and/or direct fire modes, an       advanced tandem warhead and imaging infrared seeker, target       lock-on before launch, and soft launch from enclosures or       covered fighting positions. The Javelin missile also has a       minimum smoke motor thus decreasing its detection on the       battlefield.        3. The Javelin Weapon System is comprised of two major       tactical components, which are a reusable Command Launch Unit       (CLU) and a round contained in a disposable launch tube       assembly. The CLU incorporates an integrated day-night sight       that provides a target engagement capability in adverse       weather and countermeasure environments. The CLU may also be       used in a stand-alone mode for battlefield surveillance and       target detection. The CLU's thermal sight is a second       generation Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) sensor. To       facilitate initial loading and subsequent updating of       software, all on-board missile software is uploaded via the       CLU after mating and prior to launch.        4. The missile is autonomously guided to the target using       an imaging infrared seeker and adaptive correlation tracking       algorithms. This allows the gunner to take cover or reload       and engage another target after firing a missile. The missile       has an advanced tandem warhead and can be used in either the       top attack or direct fire modes (for target undercover). An       onboard flight computer guides the missile to the selected       target.        5. The Javelin Missile System hardware and the       documentation are UNCLASSIFIED. The missile software which       resides in the CLU is considered SENSITIVE. The sensitivity       is primarily in the software programs which instruct the       system how to operate in the presence of countermeasures. The       overall hardware is also considered sensitive in that the       infrared wavelengths could be useful in attempted       countermeasure development.        6. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of specific hardware, the information could be used       to develop countermeasures which might reduce weapons system       effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with       similar or advanced capabilities.        7. A determination has been made that the United Arab       Emirates can provide substantially the same degree of       protection for sensitive technology being released as the       U.S. Government. This proposed sustainment program is       necessary to the furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the policy       justification.        8. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of United Arab Emirates.

Transmittal No. 17-73       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(l) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The APKWS II All-Up-Round (AUR) is an air-to-ground       weapon that consists of an APKWS II Guidance Section (GS),       legacy 2.75-inch MK66 Mod 4 rocket motor and legacy MK152,       MK282 and MK435/436 warhead/fuze. The APKWS II GS is       installed between the rocket motor and warhead and provides a       Semi-Active Laser (SAL) precision capability to legacy       unguided 2.75-inch rockets. The APKWS II is procured as an       independent component to be mated to the appropriate 2.75-      inch warhead/fuze. The GS is manually set with the       appropriate laser code during loading and is launched from       any platform configured with a LAU-68F/A, or similar       launcher(s). After launch, the GS activates and the seeker       detects laser energy reflected from a target designated with       a remote or autonomous laser. The control system then guides       the rocket to the target. The only interface required with       the host platform is a 28V direct current (DC) firing pulse.        2. APKWS II increases stowed kills by providing precise       engagements at standoff ranges with sufficient accuracy for a       high single-shot probability of hit against soft and lightly       armored targets, thereby minimizing collateral damage. The       APKWS II is capable of day and night operation and       performance in many adverse environments.        3. The APKWS II requires no depot maintenance. Activities       to prepare the APKWS II for use include setting the laser       code switches, turning on the Electronic Thermal Battery       Initiator, and loading the AUR into the launcher. Wing Slot       Seals (WSS) may be replaced, if necessary, at an I-level       maintenance facility.        4. All training for APKWS II is unclassified. The training       required is:        a. Pilot training to effectively employ the APKWS II,        b. Ordnance Handler training for safe handling and       preparation of the APKWS II and AUR, and        c. Maintenance training for replacement of WSS.        5. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of specific hardware, the information could be used       to develop countermeasures which might reduce weapons system       effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with       similar or advanced capabilities.        6. A determination has been made that the United Arab       Emirates can provide substantially the same degree of       protection for sensitive technology being released as the       U.S. Government. This proposed sustainment program is       necessary to the furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the policy       justification.        7.
