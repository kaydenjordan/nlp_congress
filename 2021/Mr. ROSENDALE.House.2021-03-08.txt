 Mr. Speaker, on this international day of women, I  remind everyone that the first Member of this body who was a woman was  Jeannette Rankin.   She was elected from the State of Montana in 1916 and again in 1940.  She served us well; she served us admirably.   Mr. Speaker, I wanted to remind everyone that my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle do not have a monopoly on having women  represent them.                            ____________________
