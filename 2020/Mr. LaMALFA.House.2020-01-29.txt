 Madam Speaker, this past weekend was the 75th  anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge of World War II in Europe.   I rise today to honor a great lady, Jean Fernandez, who is a veteran  of that historic battle and turned 100 very recently.   Living to be 100 years old is an accomplishment on its own, but  Jean's story is particularly remarkable.   Arriving after D-Day and before the Battle of the Bulge, Jean is one  of the few women veterans who was actually able to serve in that role  in our Nation during World War II.   During her time as a nurse at the 179th U.S. Army General Hospital at  Rouen in northern France, the hospital was constantly under threat of  air attack, and many of the young men she cared for were severely  affected by shell shock.   Had it not been for the My Life, My Story program provided by the VA,  Jean's story may not have ever been told.   I had the pleasure of stopping by and spending some time with her at  her 100th birthday party up in Susanville, and I enjoyed hearing her  recount her time in the military as well as her extraordinary life.   What a neat lady. She is an exceptional American, and I am very  thankful for her service and really honored to have had a chance to get  to know her and spend time with her.                            ____________________
