 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize and reaffirm the friendship between the United States and  Germany.   I am proud to co-chair the German-American Caucus with Congressman  Bill Keating, and today we introduced a resolution to reaffirm the  history of the United States and Germany under the Wunderbar Together  initiative.   Our countries are linked by heritage, common values, and shared  interests.  [[Page H4779]]  More than 50 million Americans of German origin live in the United  States, many of whom still have strong ties to their heritage.   Madam Speaker, our resolution highlights the alliance between our  nations and our shared commitment to free and democratic societies.   The Wunderbar Together initiative brings together more than 250  partners across all 50 States, with more than 1,500 events and projects  in local communities covering every aspect of German-American  relations, including science, the arts, culture, language, business,  sports, and more.   Germany is an important trading partner of the United States, with  the European Union and German companies creating more than 690,000  American jobs.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and  reaffirm our deep and historical friendship with Germany.                            ____________________
