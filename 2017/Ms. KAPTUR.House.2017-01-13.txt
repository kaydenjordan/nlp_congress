 Mr. Speaker, I am deeply troubled by the majority's  action this week in capitulating to the President-elect's transition  team to deny the House the opportunity to hear from the esteemed  nominee for Secretary of Defense, General James Mattis.   To eliminate the opportunity for the chamber closest to the American  citizens, the People's House, to have a full dialogue in advance of  changing a law paramount to the civilian control of the Defense  Department is troubling. Rolling over a Congressional Chamber to  expedite a waiver that has only happened once before denigrates the  responsibilities of our representative democracy.   General James Mattis--has served our nation and the U.S. Marine Corps  with distinction in war and peace. He has earned the moniker ``warrior- monk-intellectual'' for his devotion to his soldiers, the library of  widely ranging books he carries with him, and his lifetime devotion to  the study of war.   To politicize the nomination of a great General rather than allow  Congress the proper procedure to deliberate his talent and experience  is a blemish to liberty.    Mr. Speaker, the freedom to live in a democratic society  with freedom of speech, assembly, press, and religion are rights  Americans hold most precious.   Not so in Putin's Russia. Putin's Russia brutally invaded Ukraine in  2013, resulting, to date, in over 10,000 war dead, with millions of  displaced persons. The war grinds on.   Dozens and dozens of Putin's critics in the press have ended up dead,  murdered for expressing their views. In 2015, Boris Nemstov, about to  lead an assembly in favor of Ukrainian independence in Moscow, was  murdered on the stairs near the Kremlin.   Georgiy Gondgadze, editor of the news Website Ukrayinska Pravda,  featured critical articles about Putin ally Leonid Kuchma. He  disappeared in the year 2000, and his headless body was discovered in a  forest more than 40 miles from home.   Anna Politkovskaya, a Russian journalist, was murdered in the  elevator of her block of flats in 2006.   And Paul Klebnikov, an American, who was chief editor of the Russian  edition of Forbes, was killed in 2004, likely by hired assassins.   All dead, no investigations, no justice. This is Putin's Russia.   President-elect Trump best be very wary of whom he showers praise  upon, for the cock is crowing too close to home.                            ____________________
