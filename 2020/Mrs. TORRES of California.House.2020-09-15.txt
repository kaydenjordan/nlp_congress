 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Speaker, in 1954, Brown v. Board of  Education unequivocally asserted that segregated schools are inherently  unequal. When Thurgood Marshall argued this landmark case before the  Supreme Court, he thought it would take just 5 years to integrate  schools nationwide. Sadly, 60 years later, schools are more segregated  now than any time since the early 1970s, and school segregation is  occurring at alarming rates nationwide.   In order to address increased school segregation, we must address one  of the root causes of the problem: residential segregation. Housing  segregation leads to school segregation. That is why I am taking an  initial step to address the link between housing and school segregation  by offering an amendment to the Strength in Diversity Act to prioritize  grant recipients that coordinate with local housing agencies to  integrate schools.   My amendment will make sure that all grants have a meaningful  reduction in racial and economic isolation for children in schools.  Segregation in schools is propagated by housing segregation, and my  amendment will work to address this underlying issue.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, no child should receive a  lesser education because of the color of their skin or the neighborhood  where they live, and I am proud that my amendment will address school  segregation holistically by supporting coordination between schools and  housing agencies.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this  amendment and pass this legislation to fight discrimination and secure  the future for all American children, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
