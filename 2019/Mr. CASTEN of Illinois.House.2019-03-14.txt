 Mr. Speaker, just last week we passed H.R. 1,  the For the People Act, with its worthy aim: to ensure that this  government represents the voices of all Americans and not just the  privileged and powerful.   Now, among the many reforms in H.R. 1, one would require that  candidates for President and Vice President must disclose their tax  returns. Giving voters personal tax information has been a tradition of  Presidents since 1973, when Richard Nixon, of all people, released his  returns and said: ``People have got to know whether or not their  President is a crook.'' On that issue, I agree with Mr. Nixon.   Now, that seems to be the thinking of my home State legislature, too,  which has been working on legislation that would require any  Presidential or Vice Presidential candidate who wants to be on the  ballot in Illinois to release their tax returns. They think that the  people have the right to know the true character of the person who will  sit in the White House.   Mr. Speaker, we have got to know if our President is a crook. I would  like to see the Senate take up this bill.   And if they are unable to follow in the great leadership of this  House, I  [[Page H2723]]  hope that other States will follow the great leadership of the State of  Illinois.
