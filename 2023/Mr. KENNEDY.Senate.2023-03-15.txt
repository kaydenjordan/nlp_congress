 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up  to 30 minutes prior to the scheduled rollcall vote. I do not think I  will have an issue, but out of an abundance of caution, I ask unanimous  consent for that, please.    Mr. President, I do appreciate Senator Kaine's remarks.  He has highlighted a serious problem for many Americans. We don't  completely understand it. I have every confidence in our medical  community and our research and development community that we will  figure it out, but in the meantime, there are a lot of Americans  suffering, some silently, and I appreciate Senator Kaine highlighting  this issue.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
