 Madam Speaker, this bill does not look back.   Yes, we saw the abuses of Donald Trump over using the 1976 National  Emergency Act in ways that it had never ever been used before to move  money around to things because he couldn't get it appropriated through  a Republican Senate and a Republican House. He couldn't get it done, so  he moved the money around.   Anybody who works in the House of Representatives or the Senate  should be insulted that you want to empower a President--what about if  Joe Biden starts doing that? Don't you want to have these tools? Or any  other future President of either party?   This isn't about Donald Trump. It is about the Trump era, which  exposed things that need to be fixed, and this law does that.   Subpoena power--our subpoenas should be enforceable, whether they are  from a Democratic Congress or a Republican Congress. They are not.   The Department of Justice needs to have a firewall between the White  House and the Department of Justice. You can't have the President  calling up the Department of Justice, telling them to prosecute people  or make stuff up. Any President of any party shouldn't be able to do  that.   Then the President embargoed, stopped money that Congress, a  Republican Congress, had sent for Ukraine. Just stopped it. But  apparently, on the other side of the aisle, they feel like their job is  to be handmaidens in case Trump comes back.   They don't want to put in the protections now when Joe Biden is  there, who they carry on about as abusive all the time. Why not put in  the protections now? Because you want Donald Trump to be able to come  back and continue these sorts of abuses.
