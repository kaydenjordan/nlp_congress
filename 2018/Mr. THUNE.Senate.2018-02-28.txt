 Mr. President, I also want to join my colleague from  Missouri, Senator Blunt, and others today to pay tribute to the life of  Billy Graham.   Last week we lost a man of great faith. At the end of the Gospel of  Matthew, Jesus gives his disciples the Great Commission, where he says:  ``Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the  Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to  obey everything that I have commanded you.''   If any one man may be said to have fulfilled that charge, it is Billy  Graham. Over a ministry that spanned more than 60 years, Billy Graham  truly made disciples of all nations, preaching the Gospel in the United  States and around the world.   In the days since his death, many have remembered Billy Graham as a  spiritual adviser to several Presidents, which he was, but neither his  association with Presidents nor the famous of this world ever  distracted him from his primary purpose, which was making sure that the  Good News of Christ reached everyone. From China, to South Africa, to  Russia, to Australia, to his home State of North Carolina and his  countless appearances on television, video, and the internet, Billy  Graham labored tirelessly for the Gospel. I think it is fair to say  that no one in our lifetime has lived a life of greater impact for the  cause of Christ.   I remember, as a young child growing up in my home State of South  Dakota, when the crusades would come on--my parents and I we would turn  them on--you would have Billy Graham, George Beverly Shea, Cliff  Barrows, and the message of hope, grace, and redemption that came  across so clearly. It impacted so many people, not only here in the  United States but all around the world.   It was great to hear Michael W. Smith today singing that great song,  ``Just As I Am,'' that was always sung at the end of every Billy Graham  crusade as an invitation for people to come to know the Lord whom he  knew.   My wife Kimberley and I am were privileged to sing in the choir for  Billy Graham's 1986 crusade here in Washington, DC. It was an  experience that neither of us will ever forget. He reminded everyone  that ultimately, there is one thing that matters in life, and that is  serving Christ.   In the days since his death, many people have repeated one of Billy  Graham's quotes where he paraphrased the American evangelist Dwight L.  Moody. I think it sums up Billy Graham's message pretty effectively. It  said:         Someday you will read or hear that Billy Graham is dead.       Don't you believe a word of it. I shall be more alive than I       am now. I will just change my address. I will have gone into       the presence of God.    I remember in that 1986 crusade, there was a story that was written-- presumably in the Washington Post--in which he was interviewed. I am  paraphrasing, but I remember that a question was asked about what he  wanted to be remembered for, what he wanted his epitaph to be when he  died, and he said ``that I preached the Gospel of Christ. That I had  opportunities to do other things, but that I never deviated.'' Mr.  President, he never deviated.   Billy Graham has departed this life, and we mourn him, but I am  confident that right now he is rejoicing in the presence of the Lord.   In the Book of Acts, it talks about King David, and it says that he  served God's purpose for his generation. I think it can be said that  Billy Graham truly did serve God's purpose for his generation. Many  generations of Americans and many generations of people all over the  world have been so impacted by his life and his very consequential  ministry.   I yield the floor.
