 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1435, the  Preserving Choices in Vehicle Purchases Act.   As the chairman of the Subcommittee on the Environment, I am proud to  support this bill led by my Energy and Commerce Committee colleagues,  Representatives Joyce, Latta, Bilirakis, and Obernolte.   H.R. 1435 is a critical step in protecting consumer choice and  safeguarding Americans' access to affordable and reliable vehicles.   The legislation would prohibit the EPA from granting California a  waiver for vehicle emission standards if the State's standards directly  or indirectly limit the sale of new gas-powered vehicles.   Why is this important? California recently submitted a waiver  request, which would require all new passenger vehicles in the State to  be zero-emission vehicles by 2035, effectively phasing out new gas- powered cars.    Even worse, if California is granted that EPA waiver, 17 States,  representing 40 percent of the U.S. market for new vehicles, are poised  to adopt California's exact standards.   This would result in California effectively forcing their values and  their mandates on all of us. How would that work out? Ask the Secretary  of Energy. It was recently reported that on a road trip with her  entourage to tout electric vehicles, her advance staff actually blocked  a family with their baby in the car from the one functioning EV  charging station at a particular stop until the Secretary arrived to  recharge her luxury EV. Mr. Speaker, I think it is safe to say that my  constituents don't get that privilege.   Now, I want to be clear. This legislation does not prevent Americans  from purchasing EVs if they want one. House Republicans are simply  ensuring that all Americans can choose the car that best fits their  needs right now and in the decades to come.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1435.
