 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  continuing resolution.   Every Member of this body has a duty to ensure that the core,  constitutional responsibilities of our government are funded. That work  is not easy. Our Democratic colleagues will, of course, have different  views on the top-line spending levels and we will have to work through  those sharp differences in spending and policy preferences.   Republicans already passed seven fiscal year 2024 bills through the  House outlining our priorities. Each of those bills was considered  individually and allowed Members of both parties to offer amendments  considered on the merits.   Passing bills through regular order is not as clean or as easy as we  would like it to be, but it is a better alternative than one huge  omnibus bill passed right before Christmas. There is no question about  it: More work will be required to enact all 12 appropriations bills  into law. The bill before us gives us the time necessary to agree on a  top-line spending amount and negotiate difficult policy choices in the  final fiscal year 2024 appropriations bills.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman of the full committee, Ms.  Granger, for her knowledge, her leadership, and tireless efforts to  bring these appropriations bills to the floor, and I look forward to  working alongside her as we finish the fiscal year 2024 spending bills.
