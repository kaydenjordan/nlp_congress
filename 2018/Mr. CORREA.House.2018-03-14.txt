 Mr. Speaker, I stand on this floor to speak about our  Dreamers.   Again, I must ask very simply: What happened?   For months, Washington refused to pass a budget. We had many  continuing resolutions. Again, one of the issues was Dreamers.   After spending caps were raised for both military and nonmilitary  expenditures, we got a budget and both Democrats and Republicans voted  for that budget. Yet, still, no action for the Dreamers.   Eighty percent of the public wants a fix. We recognize that Dreamers  are soldiers, teachers, police officers. They are our friends. They are  our neighbors. The President has said he wants also a fix to the  Dreamer issue, yet here we are again, one more time, and, again, the  Dreamers face a very uncertain future.    Mr. Speaker, it is time to stop using Dreamers as pawns in a bigger  political chess game. At the State of the Union Address here on this  floor, my guest was a Dreamer, a young lady studying chemistry at one  of my local universities. She wants to be a scientist, and I know she  is going to be a very good scientist. That is what chemistry majors do.   You know, America is the land of immigrants, and we have many, many  hardworking immigrants. That is what Dreamers are. They work hard. They  study hard. They pay taxes. They follow the law. They have been fully  vetted. Yet, today, again, we ask: What happened to the Dreamers?   I ask my colleagues, let's give Dreamers the opportunity to earn the  American Dream. Let's give them the opportunity to earn citizenship.  And let's not live with regrets. Let's not look back 20, 30 years from  now and say what we could have, should have, would have. Now is the  time to act.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote against the previous  question so that we can immediately bring up the Dream Act to the floor  and give relief to almost a million young people who want nothing but  to earn the American Dream.
