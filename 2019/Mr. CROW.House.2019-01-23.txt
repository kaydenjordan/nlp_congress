 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak out against the great harm  this shutdown has on our Nation's veterans. I have often said, when  politicians talk tough, real people get hurt.   Today, over 150,000 veterans are furloughed or working without pay.  In Colorado, over 20,000 veterans who rely on SNAP food assistance are  left wondering if they will be able to afford to feed their families.   This is more than just a delayed paycheck. It is about the denial of  dignity and respect.   As one furloughed veteran in Colorado told me, when he took off the  uniform, he wanted to continue serving our country by working for the  government. We owe it to him and all others to honor that service by  getting them back to work. There is a sacred promise in America that,  if you step up to serve, we will be there for you when you take off the  uniform.   After I returned from my third tour of duty, I was grateful that my  country was there for me, and today, I stand before you to make sure we  are there for them. It is time for the Senate to vote. It is time to  reopen the government. And it is time to end this travesty.                            ____________________
