 Madam President.    Madam President and fellow Senators, I rise in support of  Senator Cruz's amendment.   This is just a continuation of this animosity toward this President.  This President did a great service to the United States of America, to  the people of America, and to the world by dispatching General  Soleimani as he did.   All of us listened to the intelligence. We had the secret and top- secret briefings on this. In addition to that, those of us on the  Intelligence Committee actually got information that was compartmented.  They had very clear information, proof to a very high degree that he  was imminently attacking--he was imminently planning to attack  Americans and American forces.   This was the right thing to do. It rid the world of a person who  really rose to the same level as Osama bin Laden and some of the other  people who have done these awful things to Americans. We should  congratulate this President----    Just as we did with President Obama.   Thank you. I urge an affirmative vote.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, colleagues, I urge an affirmative vote on  this. Just as we congratulated the President on the last amendment--the  Commander in Chief, who made the very difficult decision to do what  needed to be done to rein up the terrorists and the people who are  operating out of Iran--we also need to recognize the people on the  frontlines, our brave young men and women who are in Iraq, pushing back  on Iran's attempt to influence and to infiltrate the country of Iraq.  They are doing our work for us. We need to recognize that.   I urge an affirmative vote.    Mr. President, I want to be very clear. I oppose this  resolution, as it is misguided and it sends a terrible, confusing  message to Iran and to our allies in the region.   The purpose of my amendment is to make clear to Iran and to our  allies that, under the Constitution, the President of the United States  has a constitutional responsibility to take actions to defend the  United States, its Territories, possessions, citizens, servicemembers,  and diplomats from attack.   Who could disagree with that?   Let's make this clear to Iran and to our allies that that is the  state of play--notwithstanding the fact, of course, that this  resolution will not become law. It is going to get vetoed, and the veto  is going to be sustained.   The clear language of this is very short:         The President has a constitutional responsibility to take       actions to defend the United States, its territories,       possessions, citizens, servicemembers, and diplomats from       attack.    Senators, make this clear. Vote yes on this amendment.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, fellow Senators, we are about to vote on an  important piece of legislation. Of course, it is a piece of legislation  that will never become law, but nonetheless it deserves our attention,  and certainly it deserves serious consideration.   We know two things as we approach this. No. 1, under the  Constitution, it is absolutely crystal clear that only Congress can  declare war. No. 2, which is crystal clear, we know the President of  the United States has the authority to defend the country. Finally, No.  3--and this is very important, as it relates to this--no one wants war  with Iran. No one agrees that we should proceed to war with Iran. That  is simply not the situation here today.   There are constitutional questions here that we know we have to  wrestle with, and they are difficult ones.   It is important to note here, first of all, that the dispute that has  been going on with Iran for a long, long time has really nothing to do  with the Iranian people. We support the Iranian people. They have a  long history, a proud tradition, and they deserve substantially better  than what they are getting in leadership today.   This is an important debate we are going to have today about war  powers and the use of military force.   One thing also that is clear but that muddies the water is that there  is no clear line of delineation between actual war and the use of  kinetic force.   As I said, it is important to have this debate. I really believe it  should not be held in this context. It should be a policy that we are  debating that is useable in all contexts. I have sat through dozens of  hours of debate on war powers, the war powers of the President. It is  an age-old debate that has gone on since George Washington was  President. It is a hard debate because all these words were written in  the 18th century, and things were a lot clearer then. Things are much  less clear today. These debates were long. There were many lawyers  involved. Indeed, no conclusion can be reached.   It is one of those areas where I have come to the conclusion that the  words that need to be written in order to clearly specify the place  that the President occupies and the place that the Congress occupies is  a very, very difficult one.   There are things on this Earth--and I really believe this may be one  of them--where we know it when we see it, but we can't define it. We  know war when we see it. We also know what kinetic action is, in order  to protect the people of the United States, that is more isolated in  the hands of the President doing the defensive measure. We know that  when we see it. But defining the distinction between the two when one  blurs into the other is very, very difficult.   The President needs the authority that he has to defend the United  States, and it is clear that authority comes from three buckets: No. 1,  it comes from article II of the U.S. Constitution; No. 2, it comes from  the War Powers Act; and No. 3, it comes from the AUMFs that have been  passed by this body for some time.   Iran, as you are listening, understand that the President has that  authority. He has specific authority from all of those buckets.  Notwithstanding the arguments that have been made here by some Members  of this body, the President unquestionably has those powers. This power  has been used very sparingly by this President. Compared to the last  administration, the numbers are really, indeed, striking. The drone  action, drone strikes that have been taken then and now--during the  Obama administration, there were 540 of them over 8 years. In this  particular administration, they are very, very few and far between and  can only be described as a handful.   This is a President who abhors the use of military force. I have had  the opportunity to discuss it with him at length. I have actually been  in the room when he has been confronted with these questions and had to  make the decisions. He is deeply moved by these kinds of questions and  understands how difficult they are. When he talks about how he has to  write letters to the families of the men and women who didn't come  home, about having to make those phone calls, about having to go to  Dover to receive the remains of our brave men and women who didn't make  it home alive, he is deeply, deeply disturbed by these matters. I can  tell you, as I said, having been there, when he has had to make these  decisions, they weigh heavily on him.   So what are we doing here today? It certainly isn't to rein in this  President. He has not used his power willy-nilly, as I have indicated.  It has been used very, very sparingly, and it has been used in great  contrast to the previous administration.   Well, what we are doing here today is we are trying to get our arms  around the question of, when is it appropriate for the President to use  military force? We all have our ideas on that. We have the words that  the Founding Fathers left us, so we are going to debate it here today.  And it is important.   The unfortunate part about this is that we are also sending a message  to Iran. Iran is listening. There is no question that they are  listening to this debate. They are listening to what people are saying  here on the floor of the Senate.   One of the messages that will come out of this and the way this is  drawn is that the drafters of this want to send a message of  appeasement to Iran. This has been tried. It hasn't worked. The last  administration bent over backward to offer appeasement to Iran. They  were greatly betrayed by it. It was tried with the JCPOA, and it didn't  work. The reason it didn't work is that we are not dealing with people  here who are acting in good faith.    What we need to do is to send a message of firmness and not weakness.  At the end of the day, when we are all done with this, there will be  such a message. It needs to be a consistent and a uniform message when  it comes to messaging to Iran and when it comes to the messaging of our  foreign policy as it relates to Iran. It will not be this law that is  before us, because it is going to be vetoed. We all know it is going to  be vetoed. It takes a two-thirds majority to override that. It is not  going to happen.   So the mixed message is there. Iran will listen to it. The hard- liners will take it one way, and other people will take it the other.  That is not a good situation. Hopefully, we will be able to lay this  out in a way in which they can read between the lines and get the  message that is important.   The President took an action that people have criticized here that  was difficult. It was a tough decision. He was a really bad guy--a guy  who was worse than Osama bin Laden. He was the person who was executing  Iran's malign policies in the world and in the region. His killings and  loss of limbs have become legendary in the world today. Whenever I see  one of our young men or women who is missing an arm or a leg, he or she  owes that to General Soleimani. He killed hundreds of people. He was  responsible for the IED program that took the lives of so many and  maimed so many of our men and women who were fighting in the Middle  East. It got to the point at which he was wandering around, really,  with impunity and was not worried about what he was doing or that  anybody was going to take any action against him.   Let's look at the timeline over the last year.   The Iranians started by blowing up oil tankers, and nothing was done  about it. They attacked the Saudi oil fields, where 100 Americans were  working, and nothing was done about it. They took down a drone of ours  over international space, and nothing was done about it. Finally, over  the fall, they ratcheted it up with 13 attacks on U.S. soldiers at U.S.  bases in Iraq. These were our men and our women  [[Page S1061]]  whom we had asked to go over there and push back against Iran's attempt  at infiltration into Iraq. They took 13 attacks. Finally, on one of  those attacks, somebody was killed. The President laid down a redline  that, if an American were killed, there was going to be a price to pay.  They finally killed that person. They attacked our Embassy in Baghdad  and attempted to set it on fire.   Eventually, the President made the choice to do what he did. This was  in response to Iran's continual pushing of the envelope and the  miscalculations that Iran made. General Soleimani had been traveling  from place to place, putting in place the final plans of coordination  for the execution of an attack against the American people. It was  imminent.   You have heard my friends here say: Oh, no. It was not imminent. We  listened to the intelligence.   I sit on the Intelligence Committee. I sat through all of the  briefings that were given that were at the secret level and at the top  secret level that were given to the people who are here in the body. I  also sat through the ones that were given to the Intelligence  Committee, which were compartmented and much more granular. There was  no doubt that this man was planning an imminent attack to kill  Americans. He didn't get the chance.   Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you for what you did.   We have heard the argument here that it was not imminent. This person  was substantially more of an imminent danger to the United States of  America and to Americans than Osama bin Laden was. Yet, when the  President of the United States, Barack Obama, took out Osama bin Laden,  we all cheered it. In fact, we passed a resolution here--100 to 0-- commending the President of the United States for what he did.   Mr. President, you heard us today pass such a resolution that thanks  you. Thank you, Mr. President, and farewell, General Soleimani.   Iran, do not miscalculate and read what is happening here as being  capitulation or weakness or appeasement. It is not. It is a  disagreement between this branch of government, the legislative branch,  and our second branch of government, the executive branch, as to how we  should defend ourselves. Make no mistake about it: We will defend  ourselves.   In America, we operate under the rule of law. This joint resolution  that is in front of us that we are debating today will not become law.  It will not be part of the body of law by which we live. It will be  vetoed.   Iran, take note: If you continue on the path that you are on with  your malign activities, it is going to take you to a very bad place.   I urge a ``no'' vote. I understand how it is going to come out. I  will be standing here again to sustain the President's veto, and it  will be sustained.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the scheduled  1:45 p.m. vote commence now.    Mr. President, I have 3 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
