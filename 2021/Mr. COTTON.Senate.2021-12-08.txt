 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, 20 years ago this week, the People's  Republic of China became a member of the World Trade Organization.  There was great rejoicing across Washington by lobbyists and  politicians and bureaucrats and, for that matter, among corporate CEOs  and Wall Street bankers and perhaps most of all, the Communists in  Beijing. But for Americans out in the heartland, in places like  Arkansas, China's entrance into the WTO was nothing to celebrate. That  was the moment their leaders left them exposed to the predations of the  Chinese Communist Party.   Millions of Americans lost good-paying blue-collar jobs to the China  trade shock in the years that followed. Countless small towns, Main  Streets, and working-class neighborhoods were gutted and boarded up.  Michigan lost 24 percent of its manufacturing jobs. Ohio lost 27  percent of its manufacturing jobs. My home State has lost 26 percent of  all of our manufacturing jobs since China joined the World Trade  Organization. Families were shattered and communities crumbled. The  opioid crisis killed thousands of those who were left behind.   Twenty years ago was nothing less than the beginning of the great  hollowing of our Nation's industrial base, economy, and working class.  It is worth recalling what our leaders said and what they promised as  they unleashed this disaster.   During the yearslong lobbying campaign for China, then-President Bill  Clinton said it was ``ironic . . . that so many Americans are concerned  about the impact on the world of a strong China.'' From an economic  standpoint, he said, ``this agreement is the equivalent of a one-way  street.'' In other words, it was all upside for America if only all  those knuckle-draggers who opposed the Chinese Communist Party entering  the World Trade Organization would get out of the way.   Now, that attitude was the conventional wisdom in Washington for  years, and it was in both parties, to be sure. Four years after China  joined the WTO, Republican U.S. Trade Representative Bob Zoellick  reflected that ``our policy has succeeded remarkably well: the dragon  emerged and joined the world.''   Well, it turns out--not surprisingly--that this dragon has fangs and  claws, and now it is sitting on top of a vast pile of looted wealth. It  is clear that our leaders and their naivete have created a monster by  admitting China to the WTO. Let's just review some of the numbers.   Since 2001, China's economy has grown by nearly 1,200 percent,  transforming a third-world backwater into the second largest economy,  largest exporter, and dominant industrial power in the world. The PRC  today makes one out of every four automobiles in the world--more than  the United States, Japan, and South Korea combined. Combined. It makes  one out of every three merchant ships. In the United States, we make  basically none. In addition, China produces 40 percent of mobile  phones, 70 percent of televisions, and 96 percent of shipping  containers on which global commerce moves.   Equally worrisome, China has gained a stranglehold over the  production of essential materials. China produces more than half of the  world's steel, two-thirds of its active ingredients in our generic  drugs, and processes 85 percent of rare earth elements, 85 percent  which are used in everything from the smartphone in your pocket to  advanced fighter jets.   China is also making strides in advanced technology. A few years ago,  China's space agency sent the world's first quantum communications  satellite into orbit. It already possesses 200 of the world's 500  fastest supercomputers. And Chairman Xi Jinping has pledged an  astounding $1.4 trillion over 6 years to help China take the lead in  cutting-edge fields like semiconductors and artificial intelligence.   The stark fact is that China controls nearly a quarter of global  trade. A stunning 70 percent--70 percent, 7 out of 10 countries--in the  world trade more with China than with the United States.   Now, it would be one thing if China had gotten rich and powerful the  honest way, through fair competition and trade with other countries.   Instead, China has gotten rich through a criminal spree of  intellectual property theft, industrial espionage, strong-arm trade  agreements, and illegal subsidies and protection or as the office of  U.S. Trade Representative wrote:         China has continued to embrace a state-led, non-market and       mercantilist approach to the economy and trade, despite WTO       members' expectations--and China's own representations--that       China would transform its economy and pursue the open,       market-oriented policies endorsed by the WTO.    ``Despite WTO's members' expectations.'' WTO members are stupid if  they expected China to change its ways.   But in other words, China lied, and the rest of the world has paid  the price. China is the world's most prolific IP thief, stealing the  equivalent of Arkansas' economy two times over every year, year after  year. And that is just the beginning.   The Chinese Government recruits its citizens working and studying in  our  [[Page S9011]]  country to act as spies, infiltrating our research laboratories and  companies and college campuses to steal valuable secrets. Chinese  nationals are the subject of nearly half--half--of all FBI  counterintelligence cases involving economic espionage.   The Chinese Communist Party also uses illegal subsidies and trade  practices like dumping to help its ``national champions'' offload their  stolen goods below-market prices. The Chinese Government has poured  tens of billions of dollars into its steel industry, encouraging  overcapacity to flood foreign markets with cheap Chinese steel. As a  result, China's production of crude steel rose from 15 percent of the  world's total to 50 percent between 2000 and 2017, while 64 percent of  America's raw steel producers were totally wiped out, two-thirds of it  gone.   Of course, the World Trade Organization exists--supposedly,  allegedly--to curb these kinds of abuses, but it has utterly failed to  get China to change its ways and live up to its promises. If anything,  under Chairman Xi, China has dropped even the pretense that it is on  the path to freeing its economy and society.   Twenty years after China entered the WTO, it is clear that China has  betrayed our trust and is waging an economic war against us. We didn't  seek out this conflict, but now that it has started, we have no choice  but to finish it.   Congress can start by passing my bill, the China Trade Relations Act,  to terminate China's permanent normal trade relations status. We ought  to acknowledge there is nothing normal about our trading relationship  with China, and we cannot afford the state of affairs to be permanent.  We should return to the pre-WTO status quo that recognized China as a  nonmarket, communist country, to which I would add now, committing  genocide against its own people. If we do this, we can begin to correct  the historic mistake our leaders made 20 years ago when they welcomed  China into the WTO with open arms and open wallets and unleashed that  dragon on the world.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
