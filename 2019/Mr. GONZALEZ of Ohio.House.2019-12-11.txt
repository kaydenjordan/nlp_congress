 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor two Summit  County deputies who went above and beyond their job description to  rescue an elderly couple from a house fire in Green, Ohio.   On November 19, 2019, just before 10 p.m., Deputies Chris Boyd and  Bill Wandling were first to arrive at the scene when they heard  neighbors yelling to alert them that 85-year-old Caroline Knotts and  her 86-year-old husband, James, were still inside the home engulfed in  flames.   While neither Chris nor Bill are firefighters, they felt compelled to  help. Without hesitation, the two deputies rushed through the thick  smoke for nearly 10 minutes before eventually discovering the couple  and taking them and their family dog to safety.   According to Chris and Bill, they were just fulfilling their duty to  the citizens of Summit County; but, to me and to everyone present that  night, these deputies demonstrated the kindness, generosity, and love  of neighbor that reflects the very best of our northeast Ohio  community.   Thank you to Chris and Bill for your dedicated service to our  community.                            ____________________
