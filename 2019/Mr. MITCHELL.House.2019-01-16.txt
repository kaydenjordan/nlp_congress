 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I represent Michigan's 10th  Congressional District--northern Macomb County and the Thumb. For us in  Michigan, it is simple. I am from here.   I am co-chair of the Congressional School Choice Caucus with Senator  Tim Scott from South Carolina. Today, a number of Members are gathered  here on the floor to celebrate all types of school choice--from  traditional public schools, to public charter schools, public magnet  schools, online learning, private schools, homeschooling, and more.   Every year, National School Choice Week offers an opportunity to  parents, educators, and students from around the country to come  together and share the many successes of education choice in this  country.   Yesterday, I introduced a resolution in the House recognizing the  importance of school choice the week of January 20 through January 26.  I spent 35 years in business focused on career and technical education  and workforce education. I know the importance of a preparatory  education, of a K-12 education to success in the future.   I am the oldest of seven children. My family struggled. Dad built  trucks on the line when he wasn't laid off, and mom worked at the  Salvation Army. I was the first of my extended family to ever set foot  on a college campus, never mind actually graduate. I saw, firsthand,  the importance of that education and the skills I could acquire if I  put my mind to it.   My mom convinced me I could be anything, and, to her credit, I became  CEO of a fair-size company devoted to workforce education, to helping  people gain the skills necessary for a career, or to retrain if they  lost their jobs.   My company ran some of the largest welfare-to-work programs in the  country back when welfare-to-work meant going to work. I personally  benefitted from that alternative education when I went to college.   As a father of six, I also know that no two kids are alike. Yes, I am  the father of six. You would think I would have learned after being the  oldest of seven, but I didn't. We have a blended family. My oldest is  in her 30s, and my youngest is 8 years old. We adopted him from Russia  6 years ago.   I know that one size of education does not fit for all children. One  of my children, my daughter, who is 17 now, attends a virtual academy  because those who have teenagers know that getting your child up as a  teenager early in the morning to go to school is like running a zoo. It  doesn't go well. So she goes to virtual school, controls her schedule,  controls what classes she does that day, controls her time, and learns  to manage time like we all have to learn as we get older.   My youngest son has special needs that traditional schools have not  handled well. He has learning disabilities. He has dyslexia and ADHD.  It has been suggested I suffer from that as well some days. So we had  to find an alternative for him. Luckily, my wife was able to stay home  and homeschool him, but not everyone has that choice.   Today, we are here to celebrate the range of choices of education,  innovation education, and to encourage that. I would like to start by  recognizing one of my colleagues to talk about education. I would like  to start by recognizing and yielding time to Representative Tim Walberg  from Michigan's Seventh District.   I am proud to introduce him. He is a good friend of mine from  Michigan, who also recognizes the importance of alternative education,  of education options in our home State, and I now yield to Mr. Walberg.  [[Page H666]]         Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan for  joining us tonight in talking about school choice, as he sees it. You  see, parents have a choice to give their kids a chance, in many cases a  chance that their ZIP code or their learning limitations otherwise  would limit them from.   Let me give you an example. In K-12 education, I was regularly placed  outside the classroom at a desk to work independently on projects. Why?  Well, because I asked too many questions. That isn't exactly a learning  model we would endorse these days.   My senior year of high school, I was asked to attend one class each  semester by the assistant principal, debate and public speaking  because, again, I asked too many questions, and it was easier for  everybody if I just took exams and wrote reports rather than go to  class because it was simpler for the teacher.   See, school choice is not about public versus private schools. It is  not about the school system. That is a false dichotomy. It is about  creating an environment in which the students' needs are met. They are  met to gain skills, not to meet standards, not to get grades, but to  have the skills necessary to be successful in their life.   Let me give you one quick example before I turn it over to my  colleagues. Aley Minton from Port Huron, part of my district, has a  story I want to tell.   She was skeptical about educational choice until dire circumstances  drove her to enroll both her sons in a cyber school, not unlike my  daughter.   The St. Clair County family's old brick-and-mortar school left them  in a difficult place by not adapting to the special needs for their  children.   She says: ``Our family chose to utilize school choice because our  youngest son is epileptic and our oldest son is dyslexic.'' She knows  how one son was struggling academically while the timing and intensity  of his seizures interfered with him regularly going to school and  maintaining full school hours. Her other son with dyslexia was having a  difficult time keeping up with school work.   Now in their sixth year at Michigan Connections Academy, the Minton  boys are making great strides in their freedom to learn how best for  them. She says: ``When we first started virtual learning, our oldest  son was on a second-grade level in the fifth grade. He is now on grade  level, being successful''. Their needs are being met, and, guess what,  they are happy going to school.   Let me take a moment and ask another of my colleagues to join us,  Congressman Andy Biggs from Arizona's Fifth District. He knows  firsthand, given his experience with the State, the success with school  choice models as Arizona continues to be a national leader in providing  options for parents and their children and for educators.    I yield to Congressman Andy Biggs from the Fifth District of Arizona.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Biggs for sharing  his experience and background. I really appreciate him taking the time  this evening to talk about the importance of school choice.   As he notes, education should be measured by skills gained, not by  standardized tests, not by grades, but what young people can do as they  move through an educational process, begin postsecondary education, and  start careers. Because long-term, ultimately, the assessment is not  what a standardized test said; it is what you can get done in a day and  what you can achieve.   Part of that is an exposure to STEM--science, technology--vocational  skills, trades. The reality is we don't do enough in the education  system to give those choices to young people. In many cases, where they  live limits their access to those options.   I have an example of neighbors of mine. Their son wishes to take a  vocational program that is offered in the school on the other side of  the county line.   Now, ironically, by the way, it is closer if he goes there, but  because of the funding limitations in the school systems, he can't.  Again, we don't want to limit young people's choices. We want to give  them options.   In order to make education options more available, students, parents,  and school choice advocates must work together to get out the  information of why it is so important, what difference it makes.   Let me give you a couple more examples.   Natalie Fenchel testified before the Michigan Civil Rights Commission  in July of 2018 talking about school choice. She says:         There are a lot of misconceptions about charter schools.    Fenchel said:         I really got a lot of benefits from going to a charter       school and continue to go throughout my college career.       Especially with my nursing school, I feel so well prepared.    She lives in Traverse City, by the way, northern Michigan.         Traverse City is pretty rural, and charter schools really       provided a second option for me. Grand Traverse Academy       provided so many benefits that would be unable to be achieved       for rural students that otherwise it would be difficult. I'm       just really grateful I went to a charter school. It's helped       me pursue my nursing degree.    Let me give you one more example I think will kind of tell the story  of school choice and school options.   Kendra, now at Howard University, says:         Things could have turned out differently if I didn't have       the opportunity to pursue a different educational path when I       was younger. Thankfully, my parents were given the option to       exercise school choice, which is, unfortunately, not the norm       for every student.    Kendra is right. It should be the norm for every parent and every  student.   We can't wait, nor should we, for government policy to fix it. There  should be no Federal policy. I am not here advocating a Federal policy  for school choice. Rather, I am advocating that we make those options  available through sharing information, highlighting models, encouraging  States and communities to make sure they are meeting the needs of young  people across America because, as Congressman Biggs notes, the future  of America is those young people.   Parents, not Washington bureaucrats--I suggest, not bureaucrats in  States--know what is best for their children. School systems,  educational options, and funding options for that education need to be  determined by the parents, working with their children as they get  older.   School choice enables communities and local educators to focus upon  preparing young people for the future, again, rather than preparing  them for standardized tests, grades, or to push them into a model.   We need to stop with the whole idea of putting a round peg in a  square hole and saying that is the best we can do, because America can  do better for our young people.   Ultimately, our number one priority ought to be and needs to be  getting children, getting kids an effective education that will enable  them to pursue their lives going forward, whatever career path they  choose, so they are prepared to be successful in this world today.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
