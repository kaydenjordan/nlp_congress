 Madam Speaker, with Americans facing higher prices  everywhere--at the gas pump, the grocery store, car dealership,  clothing stores, and even at hotels--Americans are paying more  everywhere, thanks to incredible inflation brought on by President  Biden's plan for spending.   Well, with the new budget now coming out, we are going to see an even  bigger amount of deficit. American families are facing a $3,500 yearly  inflation tax, the Biden administration wants to spend $73 trillion  over the next 10 years--just in the budget year, not new spending, not  COVID spending. This is what normal budgets will start to look like,  which was $8 trillion more than what the CBO is predicting for the same  period of time.   Under this budget, Biden can easily add $15 trillion more to the  national debt, which would make it $45-$46 trillion by the year 2032.  We can't manage this. If the price of interest goes up much more, it  will completely eviscerate our ability to do anything besides mandatory  spending in our budget.   More families are going to suffer and the things we care about in the  budget that we can't control will suffer as well.                            ____________________
