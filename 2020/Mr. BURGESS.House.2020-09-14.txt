 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, Dr. Roe, for  yielding and for convening this hour.   I think it is so important that the people hear directly from us, the  doctors who are serving in the United States House of Representatives.   When Dr. Roe was delivering his remarks, I was reminded of how the  information about this illness came to us  [[Page H4374]]  and how serious it seemed that a city in China, a city of 10 million  people, would be shut down.   Clearly, this was a significant illness and must be taken quite  seriously, but I will say the committee on which I serve, the  Subcommittee on Health for the Committee on Energy and Commerce, the  very committee that the Congress before had worked on the  reauthorization of the Pandemic All-Hazards Preparedness Act, would not  hold a hearing on this during the month of February. It was a missed  opportunity.   We had created the legislation that reauthorized pandemic  preparedness. The President had signed that into law in June 2019. Now,  6 months later, we are faced with this possible worldwide pandemic.   You would think there would have been enough curiosity on the  committee to do some real-time oversight. Did we get it right? Were we  focused on the right conditions? Were we responding to the right  signals?   But we don't know because we didn't look. We had to do hearings on  flavored tobacco, horse racing, ticket stubs, all kinds of other  things.   It was not until the end of February, tacked on to the waning moments  of a budget hearing, that we heard from the Secretary of Health in the  principle subcommittee that deals with health in this United States  House of Representatives.   Dr. Roe also has talked about the speed with which the development of  the vaccine is progressing, and it is truly remarkable.   Just as a data point, for people who may not remember, when Ebola was  careening through western Africa, in August 2014, we basically had a  vaccine that was at the same place as our candidate vaccines were at  the end of August 2014, the end of phase 1 trials. The final approval  by the Food and Drug Administration came in December 2019.   Clearly, that 5-year time horizon is just too long in this situation,  and the administration recognized that. The President recognized that  and leaned into the process of developing a vaccine.   One of the more remarkable things I have seen is that the Food and  Drug Administration is going to license the production of appropriate  vaccine candidates prior to their approval.   Now, they can't be sold until they get that final approval, so there  is a financial risk that is taken by the companies that proceed with  the production of that vaccine.   But for those who remember the fall of 2019, when H1N1 was such a  problem in this country, remember the vaccine was developed and then  another month went by before there was sufficient quantity of the  vaccine to begin vaccinating the most vulnerable populations. That is  not going to happen under the watch of Donald J. Trump.   I, for one, am grateful for the leadership that the President has  provided in this regard. I am grateful for the leadership that the  House Doctors Caucus has been providing as we go through this very  difficult time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Tennessee for yielding.                                time  2030
