 Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thanking Chairman McCaul  and Ranking Member Thompson for their dedication to improving our  cybersecurity posture. Since the Chairman and I founded the  Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus together nearly a decade ago, I have  come to firmly believe that cybersecurity is the national and economic  security challenge of the 21st Century, and both Congress and the  executive branch must take steps to recognize and mitigate the risks we  face in our hyper-connected society. Thanks to the leadership of the  Chairman and Ranking Member, the Committee on Homeland Security has  consistently been at the forefront on these issues, and while much  remains to be done, we are worlds away from when I originally took the  cyber subcommittee gavel in 2007. The bill we have before us today is a  testament to those efforts, and I strongly support this latest  iteration of CISA to reorganize the National Protection and Programs  Directorate (NPPD) and enhance the capabilities and the profile of  DHS's cybersecurity activities.   As one of its core missions, DHS is charged with helping Federal  agencies and critical infrastructure owners and operators secure  themselves against physical and cyber attacks. For the past decade,  that mission has been carried out by NPPD, a small headquarters  component of the Department. Since its establishment, NPPD's role in  defending the nation and the .gov domain from cyber intrusions has  grown in concert with the increasing threat to our networks.   It's a growth that the Committee--and the Congress as a whole--has  recognized and encouraged, with the passage of laws including the  National Cybersecurity Protection Act of 2014, which authorized the  National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, and the  Cybersecurity Act of 2015, which made NPPD the federal government's  primary hub for cyber threat indicator sharing. Today, NPPD is home to  two of the premiere computer security incident response teams in the  world and has been recognized as the whole-of-government asset response  lead in the National Cyber Incident Response Plan. It also continues to  lead efforts in protecting federal networks through the Federal Network  Resilience Division, which assists other agencies with risk management,  guides enterprise security policy, and implements programs like  Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation and EINSTEIN.   NPPD is clearly acting in an operational capacity today, but despite  this fact, Congress has not yet elevated NPPD's standing to be  commensurate with these added responsibilities. H.R. 3359 acknowledges  the evolution of the component by transforming NPPD into an operational  agency on par with TSA or Customs and Border Protection. As part of the  reorganization, NPPD will be renamed the ``Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency,'' or CISA, to accurately reflect its  role.   This restructuring was the top legislative priority of DHS Secretary  Jeh Johnson before he left office, and I am grateful that Secretary  Kelly took up the mantle in the new Administration.   Bringing clarity with the new agency structure also stands to benefit  the many cyber defenders working tirelessly at the Department to keep  us safe. I have often said that all of the risk mitigation policies and  intrusion detection systems in the world are nothing without a skilled  workforce. Congress and the Department have been working jointly to  reduce the shortage of cybersecurity analysts at NPPD, and it is my  hope that an empowered Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency  will be able to compete for the best cyber talent. After all, what  mission is more exciting than protecting your fellow Americans from the  canniest of adversaries attempting to do us harm in this new domain? I  hope that all of the young people considering a career in this emerging  field--young people like the brilliant CyberCorps students I enjoy  speaking with--will look at Congress's support for DHS's cybersecurity  work and jump at the opportunity to be in the vanguard at this new  agency.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to speak about the important clarity H.R.  3359 brings to a broader policy debate that has been kicking around  Washington, DC, for some time now.   I serve on the House Armed Services Committee, where I am privileged  to act as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and  Capabilities. In this role, I oversee United States Cyber Command, and  I have the utmost respect for the service members in uniform defending  our country in the digital domain. I have also had the privilege to  serve on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, where I heard  weekly about the all-too-often unsung heroes of our Intelligence  Community and their efforts to protect our national interests in  cyberspace.   I say this, Mr. Speaker, because I want to be clear that I have a  deep understanding of and appreciation for our military and  intelligence services' cybersecurity prowess.   But I also believe that the powers and authorities of those entities  are rightly constrained when it comes to domestic activities.  Protecting our domestic cyber assets in peacetime needs to be the  responsibility of a civilian organization, and that organization is the  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency created under this  bill. We saw this debate play out during consideration of the  Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, where it was also  decided in favor of a civilian hub, the NCCIC that is at the heart of  NPPD. I hope passage of H.R. 3359 will help move the debate on from  where authorities should be housed and instead focus on the  operationalization of said authorities.   Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned at the outset, this bill owes its  existence to the collaborative efforts of Chairman McCaul and Ranking  Member Thompson. But it also reflects the bipartisan spirit of two of  my good friends who head the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Protection, Mr. Ratcliffe and Mr. Richmond. And, like  any effort of this body, it owes a great deal to the staff who work  tirelessly behind the scenes supporting our efforts. In particular, I  would like to Kirsten Duncan and Moira Bergin, the Majority and  Minority staff directors for the Cyber Subcommittee for helping to get  this bill to the Floor. And I would also like to thank their  predecessors, Brett DeWitt and Chris Schepis, for laying the groundwork  for its consideration this Congress.   This bill is important. It's bipartisan. And it's overdue. I hope my  colleagues will join me in supporting this important measure, and I  hope the Senate moves swiftly to pass it through their Chamber.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, H.R. 3359, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.  [[Page H9769]]                                ____________________     Mr. Speaker, earlier this evening, the House passed  H.R. 3359, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act,  and I would like to commend Homeland Security Committee Chairman McCaul  and Ranking Member Thompson for their efforts getting it through the  House, along with my colleagues on the Homeland Security Committee.   This bipartisan bill makes long overdue changes to the organization  of the National Protection and Programs Directorate, or NPPD, to  reflect its growing operational role in cybersecurity. Despite it being  notionally a headquarters component, NPPD is home to the government's  premier cyber incident response teams; the 24/7 watch floor and  information sharing hub; and the Federal Network Resilience Division,  tasked with supporting other agencies in defending their networks. NPPD  is also charged with leading asset response activities under the  National Cyber Incident Response Plan.   H.R. 3359 recognizes that these activities go far beyond NPPD's  original mission and raises the renamed component to an agency on par  with Customs and Border Protection or the TSA.   Mr. Speaker, I hope the bill makes crystal clear that DHS is the  primary agency for domestic cybersecurity in peacetime, and I encourage  young people looking at cybersecurity careers to consider joining the  vanguard at this new agency. I look forward to its swift passage and  consideration in the Senate.                            ____________________
