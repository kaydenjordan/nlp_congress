 Mr. President, I wish I could end this exchange on a  hopeful note. I have come here so many times wishing that an exchange  like this one could lead to progress. And we have offered again and  again and again--the Senator from Connecticut on background checks,  myself on red flag or emergency risk orders, on Ethan's Law with safe  storage, on a myriad of proposals--to sit down with our colleagues and  engage in the kind of constructive and positive dialogue that Senator  Grassley has suggested, and they have yielded nothing. And the reason  they have yielded nothing is essentially that, unfortunately, our  Republican colleagues remain in the grip of a lobby--the gun lobby-- which is waning in its impact across the country but still maintains  its grip in this Chamber.   That is the grip we need to break. That is the grip that will be  broken through the democratic process if the American people have their  way. And the American people are changing in their view.   In fact, there is now a political movement. It is composed of the  young people--March for Our Lives--who suffered in Parkland, FL, when  they saw the same kind of shooting and suffered the same kind of trauma  that those students did in Oakland County, MI.   And again and again and again, this tragedy has been repeated in  schools across our country. We are here again with grief and sorrow for  the lives taken by gun violence--needlessly and violently.   Four young people--Madisyn Baldwin, 17; Justin Shilling, 17; Hana St.  Juliana, 14; Tate Myre, 16--were shot multiple times, as my colleague  from Connecticut has described it in that video, among many others  trying to escape.   Six other students and a teacher were injured, and their community is  reeling from this horror--a horror of blood and flesh and lives cut  short forever.   And their loved ones have joined a club, as it has been called--a  club nobody wants to join. Nobody wants to be admitted.   In just 12 days, just 12 days from now, it will be the ninth  anniversary of a tragedy whose survivors joined that club--the families  of the Sandy Hook children--20 beautiful, innocent children and 6  dedicated, courageous educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in  Newtown, CT.   And whenever I talk about this subject in this Chamber, I see them in  the Gallery. I see them in the Gallery on the day that we failed. We  failed by just a handful of votes to reach the 60 that we needed to  pass a background check proposal. And one of them shouted ``shame.''  ``Shame.'' And it was shameful and disgraceful that we failed to act on  that day.   Think of how many lives we could have saved. You know, in this body,  we talk endlessly, and sometimes we act in a way that can affect real  lives and real people. We could have saved real lives and real people  on that day--not all the lives lost to gun violence, the tens of  thousands who have perished since then, but some of them.   ``When you save one life, you save the world'' is an adage in my  faith. We had it within our grasp to save lives and to help save the  world, but we failed then, and, again today, we failed, even with the  impetus of that horror in our minds and before us played again and  again.   And, for me, the voices of those survivors resonate. Their faces are  forever with me, as they will be for all who knew the survivors of the  Oakland, MI, tragedy.   They have become friends. They have become almost members of my  family, and they relive their own tragedy when they see what happened  in these shootings.   And the trauma affects not just the children in that school on  Tuesday; it affects children everywhere.   Somebody said to me the other day: Do you know the three best words  in the English language these days? ``Back to normal.''   We want to go back to normal. After a year and a half of the  pandemic, we want to go back to normal, put kids back in school, put  teachers back in the classroom--back to normal.   We are back to normal in gun violence. In fact, we are worse than  normal. We are back to normal with school shootings because kids are  back in school, but the rate of gun violence has, if anything,  explosively increased. This normal cannot be normalized. It cannot be  made the new normal. The finality of evil cannot be taken for granted.   The shame that that vote, 9 years ago, brought to this body is a  stain that will forever haunt us and haunts us evermore when we fail,  as we did today, to provide real action. And there isn't any panacea.  My colleague from Connecticut is absolutely right. No single proposal  is a solution.   And there are others that we have advanced and tried to make it a  matter of bipartisan support. Senator Graham and I have worked on a red  flag or emergency risk protection order statute that separates people  from guns when they are dangerous to themselves or others, separates  them when they are under a protective order and they buy those guns, or  when a family member knows they are about to commit or take their own  lives, not to mention other people's lives. More than half of all the  gun deaths in this country are suicides. We can save those lives.   A large number of these deaths occur when children are playing with  guns in their own homes because the guns have been unsafely stored.  Ethan Song was killed in Connecticut because a parent failed to safely  store a gun. Ethan's Law, requiring safe storage, would save lives.   Holding manufacturers accountable and depriving them of sweetheart  deals that led to PLCAA--giving them immunity from any legal  accountability--reversing that immunity would help to save lives in  repealing PLCAA. There is more than one proposal that we need to  seriously consider if we are going to have the kind of dialogue that my  colleague Senator Grassley suggested.   But the simple fact is, the House of Representatives did its job back  in March when it passed that bipartisan legislation to expand  background checks.   We are trying to do our job today, seeking unanimous consent from our  colleagues to move forward on H.R. 8, and there is no rational  explanation--  [[Page S8886]]  none--when the vast majority of American people, gun owners as well as  NRA members, all backgrounds, all walks of life, all geographic areas,  all demographic areas, support this measure.   So back to normal--we are back to normal. We cannot tolerate this  normal. And as we approach that ninth anniversary of the Sandy Hook  Elementary School shooting--and I recall that bleak day in December  when we gathered at a firehouse with parents who were waiting to find  out--waiting to know whether their children were still alive.   No matter what the ages of our children--I have four--we can relive  that moment in our own minds, in our own hearts, and we can see in this  Gallery those parents who came to speak truth to us, speak truth to  power, and who will call us to account. The American people should call  us to account for our failure to act today, our complicity in those  deaths. This Congress is complicit. The Members who vote against these  measures are complicit in the tragedies that follow.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I rise to recognize Mr.  Ben Cooper, a lifelong resident of West Hartford, CT, and outstanding  World War II veteran who turns 100 on December 24, 2021.   Mr. Cooper was a freshman at The George Washington University when  the United States entered World War II. Eager to support his country,  he went to work at Colt's Firearms in Connecticut, where he tested  machine guns until he was drafted in September 1942. Mr. Cooper was  sent for training at Camp Barkeley. While on furlough, he met his  future wife, Dorothy, and the two married when he received news he was  going to be sent overseas. Mr. and Mrs. Cooper had four children and  celebrated their 65th wedding anniversary shortly before Dorothy  passed.   After boarding a liberty ship, Mr. Cooper was assigned as a combat  medic to the U.S. Army's 45th Infantry Division, also known as the  Thunderbird Division, which was largely comprised of Native American  soldiers. They saw combat in Italy, France, and Germany. While in  Europe, Mr. Cooper was instructed by his friends to keep his dog tags  in his pocket rather than around his neck. They were labeled with an  ``H'' for Hebrew, indicating his Jewish faith, which could have led to  harm if he were captured by the Germans. In April 1945, the 45th  Infantry Division received orders to secure a camp. As Mr. Cooper  explains, no one in the division knew anything about the camp other  than their instructions to not allow anyone to enter or exit.   When Mr. Cooper and his division arrived at Dachau in southern  Germany, they witnessed scenes he describes as ``virtually  unspeakable.'' He met the survivors who were able to walk up to him and  was traumatized by what he encountered. On April 29, 1945, the 30,000  prisoners were liberated by American troops, including Mr. Cooper and  the 45th Infantry Division. In the following days, the division helped  capture Munich.   Though the division was sent to France with the expectation of  fighting the Japanese, they were instead discharged when the war ended  before they made it to the Pacific. Mr. Cooper returned home to his  family and did not speak about Dachau to anyone for 45 years.   In 1990, Mr. Cooper shared his story for the first time, speaking to  a group of students. From there, he started to recount his experiences  wherever it could be helpful. For over three decades, Mr. Cooper has  spoken to schools, colleges, civic groups, and archival projects,  repeating his eyewitness account to make sure the realities of the  Holocaust are not forgotten.   His speaking engagements have led to a number of remarkable events.  At the annual Holocaust commemoration at the Connecticut State Capitol  in 1996, he met a man who revealed he and his wife were liberated from  Dachau by Mr. Cooper and his division. They recognized the Thunderbird  logo on his jacket. The two families became friends, and in 2006, their  son performed open heart surgery for Mr. Cooper, who mused, ``what goes  around comes around.''   In 2017, Mr. Cooper was inducted into the Connecticut Veterans Hall  of Fame, and in 2019, he received the Legion d'honneur, France's  highest military merit. That same year, I had the privilege of  presenting Mr. Cooper with a certificate of special recognition at the  Connecticut Veterans Memorial, where he also received the Connecticut  Wartime Service Medal from the Connecticut Department of Veterans  Affairs.   Mr. Cooper's lifetime of service and advocacy serves as a model for  all of us. On his business cards is the motto that guides him: ``No act  of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted.''   Mr. Cooper's courage and compassion will be an enduring legacy. I  applaud his many accomplishments and hope my colleagues will join me in  congratulating Mr. Ben Cooper on this milestone of his 100th  birthday.                            ____________________
