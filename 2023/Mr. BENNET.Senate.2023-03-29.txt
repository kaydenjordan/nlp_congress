 Mr. President, I appreciate so much the Senator from  Hawaii's perspective on this really important issue. And it is a really  important issue.   I mean, there has been some discussion on the other side about how  for 50 years, there has been a consensus in this Chamber about how we  treat these issues, ignoring completely what the Dobbs decision has  done to this country, which is to strip a 50-year constitutional  right--to strip a 50-year constitutional freedom--from the American  people. It is the first time since Reconstruction that a right has been  stripped from the American people by the Supreme Court. It has been a  50-year crusade--an agenda by the allies of the people across this  aisle to accomplish that.   It was a lot earlier today that I heard: Well, I didn't learn that in  law school, I didn't learn that in law school, about the First  Amendment in their debate about TikTok. Well, when I was in law school,  that is when originalism was injected into the bloodstream of  conservative legal thought in this country. It had not existed before.  It was something that was invented by Justice Scalia when he was a law  professor, and it was grabbed onto by a lot of people on the other side  of the aisle to justify a deeply conservative view of economic history  in America.   I would ask my colleagues to allow me to give the rest of my speech  before they use profanity on the floor of the Senate to describe what I  am talking about.    I thank the Presiding Officer.   I am not offended by that. I just think some of the people at home  may not want to hear that kind of language on the floor of the Senate-- but that is because they know what I am saying is true about  originalism.   Because of their efforts and because they were able to elect Donald  Trump, who was not actually read in on the joke, we ended up with three  people on the Supreme Court who subscribe to that originalist view and  who decided, following Justice Scalia, that if it were not a freedom in  1868, then it is not a freedom in 2023, even though it has been a  freedom and a right for the last 50 years in this country.   So don't come here and say that there was somehow a consensus here  when that freedom and that right has been stripped from the American  people by the Supreme Court.   To my colleague from Alabama, who has left the floor--by the way,  just on that point, he has now twice misrepresented my actions on this  floor. So I ask unanimous consent that this article from Politico,  which my colleague from Alabama put in the Record the last time he was  here, misrepresenting my record, be printed in the Record. I would like  to put exactly the same article in the Record so people can actually  see the truth of my record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:    Democrats Step Up Pressure on Biden To Reverse Trump's Decision on                                  Space HQ                     (By Connor O'Brien and Lee Hudson)         And one of the state's senators is even seizing on the       politics surrounding abortion and LGBTQ issues, arguing that       sending the command from a blue state to a red one takes away       the rights of service members.        Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) ``has raised the issue of       reproductive health care access in his conversations about       the Space Command basing decision,'' said one congressional       aide, who asked for anonymity to discuss private       conversations between Bennet and the Pentagon.        The senator, the aide added, ``has serious concerns about       the impact that abortion ban laws have on readiness and our       national security.''        It's the latest turn in a saga that's dragged on for three       years after Trump personally directed the Air Force to choose       Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, as the command's       permanent headquarters. Alabama and Colorado were the two       finalists in the Air Force's search.        The decision, if given the final signoff by the Biden       administration, would uproot the fledgling command from its       current location at Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado       Springs. Since the original decision, members of Colorado's       delegation in both parties have decried the move to a Trump-      friendly state as political favoritism that will delay the       organization from achieving full operating status.        ``I haven't found any Democratic senator who thinks it's a       good idea to allow a precedent to stand that encourages       politics to overrule the judgment of our military command,''       Colorado Sen. John Hickenlooper said in an interview.        The Biden White House vowed to reassess the choice after       lawmakers blasted the basing decision. The Air Force       secretary must  [[Page S1042]]       still determine whether to follow through with Trump's       decision or keep the command in Colorado.        The Air Force was expected to announce a final decision at       the end of 2022, but the deadline passed with no ruling.        ``We don't have anything new on the decision timeline,''       the service said in a statement. The service declined to say       why a choice has not been made.        Lawmakers on both sides of the argument say they're in the       dark on when the Air Force might finally make a call, but       both states' delegations have said they believe they will       prevail.        ``I do think the delay is, in my view, a positive thing,''       said Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.). ``My read of that is that the       administration is taking a harder look and a fresh look at it       and revisiting certain elements of the decision. That's what       I hope they're doing.''        The commander, Gen. James Dickinson, has said Space Command       won't be fully operational until the final basing decision is       made.                                Pros and cons         U.S. Space Command was restarted by the Trump       administration in 2019 as it sought to emphasize the       importance of the military's space mission, coinciding with       the creation of the Space Force. Space Command, which       oversees the operations of military space assets and       defending satellites, had been its own outfit since the       1980s, but was folded into U.S. Strategic Command following       the creation of Northern Command in 2002.        Colorado Springs and Huntsville were two of six finalists       selected by the Air Force in late 2020 for the permanent       headquarters. The list included military installations in       Florida, Nebraska, Texas and New Mexico.        Colorado lawmakers contend permanently keeping Space       Command in its temporary home is more efficient and will       ultimately prove better for national security because it will       be near Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense       Command.        With a large military space presence already in the state,       Colorado's leaders argue that politics alone was the deciding       factor in the Trump administration selecting Alabama.        They point to comments Trump made after leaving office       boasting that he made the call to move Space Command.        ``I hope you know that. [They] said they were looking for a       home and I single-handedly said `let's go to Alabama.' They       wanted it. I said `let's go to Alabama. I love Alabama.' ''       Trump said on an Alabama-based radio show in August 2021.        Alabama's almost entirely GOP delegation says Huntsville--      dubbed Rocket City because of the large aerospace industry       presence there--checks all the boxes for the new command.        The Pentagon visited each of the six prospective       headquarters sites between Dec. 8, 2020, and Jan. 7, 2021,       where experts gathered data and refined cost estimates. Those       cost estimates were not released publicly, according to the       Defense Department's inspector general.        ``Democrats said it was political, but the best place to       put it is in Huntsville,'' Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.)       said in an interview.        ``The only reason you would leave it in Colorado is because       that's where it's at right now,'' Tuberville said. ``But we       need to make sure it's in the right spot. We have the missile       defense. We have Redstone Arsenal, NASA. You name it, we got       it.''        Since a headquarters decision was announced in January       2021, both the Defense Department IG and the Government       Accountability Office released reports that questioned       whether the selection process was adequate.        DoD IG found the Air Force base analysis that was conducted       under the Trump administration's direction ``complied with       law and policy'' when selecting Alabama as the headquarters       location, while the GAO asserted the service's base location       analysis had ``significant shortfalls in its transparency and       credibility.''        Neither report determined whether Trump meddled in the       decision.        Both oversight groups agree a resolution was reached during       a White House meeting with highranking officials on Jan. 11,       2021.        Meeting attendees included the former president and top       Pentagon leaders who have since left--the acting defense       secretary, the vice chair of the Joint Chiefs, the Air Force       secretary and the assistant secretary of the Air Force for       installations, environment and energy.        Days before the meeting, the Pentagon received new       information that if Colorado was selected the military could       renovate a building instead of having to construct a new one       to house the new headquarters.        But the Space Force did not deliver an updated estimate to       Air Force officials ahead of the White House meeting,       according to GAO.        The Pentagon is keeping the cost estimates private and are       not included in the GAO report because the information is       designated as ``sensitive and privileged.''        Opting for renovation instead of new construction would       allow for the command to reach full operational much sooner       than the estimated six years.        In interviews with the GAO, the head of Space Command, the       top Space Force general, and the former vice Joint Chiefs       chair, all said they conveyed in the meeting that the       headquarters should remain in Colorado because that was the       best way to reach full operational capability as quickly as       possible.        Bennet echoed the same concerns during a speech on the       Senate floor this month.        It is important the Biden administration not ratify ``a       political decision that was made in the last few days of the       Trump administration,'' Bennet said, referring to the former       president dismissing the counsel of Pentagon officials who       recommended the headquarters remain in Colorado.        Bennet underscored it is not only expected to be cheaper       and faster to keep Space Command in Colorado, but the       military would not have to worry over the number of civilian       workers who won't opt to move to Alabama. Roughly 60 percent       of the Space Command workforce are civilians, he said.        ``Decisions of this importance shouldn't be made this way.       It should be in the interest of our national security. And       the Biden administration has the opportunity to restore the       integrity of this process,'' Bennet said.                                Renewed fight         The Colorado delegation fought the move when it was       initially announced, but had gone quiet in the following       months. They rekindled their efforts last month when       Hickenlooper and Bennet were the only Democrats to join       Republicans in opposition to the confirmation of Brendan       Owens, the nominee to oversee facilities and energy programs       at the Pentagon. The pair said they opposed him because the       Pentagon had brushed off their efforts to meet with Austin to       discuss Space Command.        Owens was still confirmed despite most Republicans also       opposing him.        Bennet also threatened to hold up other nominees to secure       a meeting with Austin. Hickenlooper and Bennet met with       Austin to discuss the decision on Jan. 26, though no       resolution was reached.        ``He's got a lot on his plate, so he wasn't versed in the       details of the issue,'' Hickenlooper said. ``But he listened       very thoughtfully and I think he took it very seriously.''        But Bennet continued to press the issue. A spokesperson       said Bennet placed a hold on Ravi Chaudhary, Biden's nominee       to oversee Air Force installations. He dropped the hold this       month after meeting separately with Chaudhary and Air Force       Secretary Frank Kendall where he ``reiterated his       longstanding concerns'' with the basing decision. The behind-      the-scenes maneuvering has not been previously reported.        Some opponents are also highlighting how the climate in the       U.S. has changed since an initial decision was made in       January 2021. Many Democrats are unsettled by moving service       members from a blue to a red state after the Supreme Court       dealt a blow to abortion rights last year.        With the end of nationwide federal protections for       abortion, many Democrats have raised the impacts on troops       stationed in states where the procedure is now banned or       significantly limited. Bennet has publicly raised similar       concerns in the proposed Space Command move.        ''I'm deeply concerned about how the Dobbs decision and       state abortion bans will affect Space Command's workforce and       readiness if the command leaves Colorado,'' Bennet said in a       statement to Military.com in August.        Another driver for the Biden administration to keep the       headquarters in Colorado and not move to a conservative state       are rights for LGBTQ people.        ``It's hard not to think about the dramatically more       hostile environment in Alabama when it comes to reproductive       rights and LGBTQ+ rights,'' said one Democratic aide. ``It'll       mean many of the civilians who work for Space Command may not       move with it. And service members will be forced to move       somewhere where they'll lose those rights.''        Though both Tuberville and Hickenlooper downplayed the role       the Supreme Court decision would play in the basing move, the       impact on troops has been in focus after the reversal of       abortion protections under Roe v. Wade.        Even Austin, who is usually not outspoken on political       issues, moved to shore up troops' access for abortion. He       issued a memo in October directing the Pentagon to pay for       service members to travel costs for abortions, though not for       the procedure itself, arguing the ``practical effects of       recent changes'' in laws will hurt military readiness.        Formal policies issued this month cover travel costs for       obtaining abortions as well as administrative leave, as many       troops are stationed in states where the procedure is now       illegal.        Tuberville was among the GOP lawmakers who slammed the       move. He vowed to hold up civilian Pentagon nominations as       well as top military promotions over the new policy.        The issue, however, isn't purely about red states vs. blue       states. If Space Command doesn't move to Alabama, the       headquarters will remain in reliably conservative Colorado       Springs. The area and its military assets are represented by       Republican Doug Lamborn, who chairs the House Armed Services       Strategic Forces subcommittee. Lamborn has also criticized       the move as one of political favoritism over national       security needs.        The state's other two Republican House members, Reps. Ken       Buck and Lauren Boebert, have also protested the decision and       signed several letters with Democrats arguing to keep the       command in Colorado.        Yet if the Biden administration decides to reverse the       earlier decision, it could open  [[Page S1043]]       itself up to criticism that it's making a political call,       just like the Trump White House. A reversal also would draw       push back from Alabama's delegation, including Rep. Mike       Rogers, who has new tools at his disposal as the House Armed       Services Committee chair.        In the meantime, Alabama lawmakers are confident the Trump       administration's decision will be upheld.        ``Nobody's saying, but they've done several more reviews on       it in the last two years,'' Tuberville said of the final       decision. ``And we've pretty much passed all the tests.''     I want to thank--he is gone--the Senator from Alabama for  finding an article about me in Politico because it is so seldom that  any article is written about me. I am grateful that he has called  attention to it. He is not here for me to say thank you for that.   But he is now on the floor, doing something that no Senator has ever  done--holding up every single flag officer's promotion in this  country--180 of them or so, now maybe 600 of them. We have the head of  the Seventh Fleet and the head of the Fifth Fleet. These are vital  offices that he is holding up.   He just said: We have got enough generals. We have enough generals.   Why is he doing it? Why is he doing it? He is doing it because he is  offended by a regulation that the Department of Defense has promulgated  in the wake of the Dobbs decision of reversing Roe v. Wade--stripping  the American people of this fundamental right, stripping the American  people of this fundamental right. In the wake of that, the Secretary of  Defense had the nerve to say: If you are serving--through no decision  that you have made--in a State like Alabama which banned abortion and  you have to travel to another State to get an abortion, we will pay for  that travel--travel.   If you need a little bit of extra time, the regulations say, before  you go to your commanding officer and tell them that you have to have a  medical procedure, like abortion, it gives you a little extra time to  do that.   The third thing it does is that it says that if you have to leave the  State of Alabama because you can't have access to abortion there, then  you don't have to use paid leave.   Those are the three things this rule does. I am coming to an end, Mr.  President. That is all it does. That is all it does.   In his world, he would like to have a place where people did not have  their travel paid for, they had to use their paid leave, and they had  to tell their commanding officer immediately. That is the America he  wants to live in because he lives in a State--    I would ask the Senate for 30 more seconds.    Thank you.   He is entitled to his opinion, certainly, and the State of Alabama  has a totally different approach to a woman's right to choose than  Colorado does, and I respect that even though we differ. But in  Alabama, there are no exceptions for rape or incest. In Alabama, if you  are a doctor who has committed an abortion, you could go to jail for 99  years. In Alabama, they are trying to say that those women who use  chemicals that many women use--   --to end their abortion--all we are saying is--   --we need to recognize what has happened since Dobbs, and  we need----    I yield the floor.
