 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, later this week, the full Senate  will take up and vote on the nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson  to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.   Over the last several weeks, the Congress and the country and,  indeed, the world have gotten to know Judge Jackson. We have learned  about her broad life experience, her exceptional career, her deep love  of the law.   Judge Jackson endured a verbal marathon of intense questioning from  members of the Judiciary Committee. She endured challenging and  sometimes specious lines of questioning from some of our colleagues on  the other side of the aisle, but through it all, she shined. She  approached every moment of the hearing with grace, with wisdom, and  with brilliance. Her good judgment and sharp mind were on full display  for all to see. She was unshakable; she was inspiring.   If confirmed, she will make history as the first Black woman to sit  on the highest Court of the land. With Judge Jackson on the top Bench,  we will get one step closer to ensuring that the Supreme Court of the  United States looks like the Nation it serves; and with Judge Jackson  on the highest Court, we will be even closer to realizing the noble  ideal inscribed on the face of the Supreme Court building: ``Equal  Justice Under Law.''   Her confirmation will be a victory for all of America.   My State of Maryland is also proud to have a small connection with  Judge Jackson. Not only did she reside in Maryland for a period of  time, but her brother served on the Baltimore Police Department for 7  years, and he has also served two tours of duty as a member of the  Maryland National Guard. Other members of her family also pursued  careers in public service. Two of her uncles were police officers, and  her parents were public school teachers.   Like her family members, Ketanji Brown Jackson has taken up the  mantle of public service as a public defender, as a member of the U.S.  Sentencing Commission, as a district court judge, and as a Federal  circuit court judge.   It is no mystery as to why her nomination has been met with  widespread praise. She has been lauded by the Fraternal Order of Police  and by the International Association of Chiefs of Police. Prominent  Republican-appointed judges and lawyers have spoken in favor of her  confirmation. The American Bar Association listed her as  [[Page S1974]]  ``well-qualified'' for the position to which she has been nominated-- their highest rating.   There is no question in my mind that she will serve our Nation well  and with distinction as the newest Justice of the Supreme Court, and I  will vote in favor of her confirmation this week, proudly.   I have watched many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  strain to find some justification for voting against Judge Jackson.  They know she is highly qualified. They know she is a person of  integrity. They know she has the training and judgment required of a  Supreme Court Justice.   Last week, one Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  called Judge Jackson a ``person of exceptionally good character,  respected by her peers, and someone who has worked hard to achieve her  current position.''   Another Republican member of the committee noted that she had  ``impeccable credentials and a deep knowledge of the law.''   You would think these were words leading up to state support for  Judge Jackson, but in both of those cases, those Senators have  announced their decisions to vote against her. The pattern is the same  for too many of our Republican colleagues. They come out and praise  Judge Jackson and then announce they are voting against her.   So the question is, Why? What is the reasoning here? And I have been  listening carefully.   Many of our colleagues tie their opposition to what they have called  her ``judicial philosophy.'' They say Judge Jackson will push her own  political ideology at the expense of the law. They say she is going to  be an activist instead of a judge. They say she will create ``new  rights from the Constitution out of whole cloth.'' In fact, that was a  quote from my colleague, the senior Senator from Texas, who took to the  floor last week in opposing Judge Jackson's confirmation.   When my friend from Texas made that statement, I happened to be  sitting where the Presiding Officer is right now, as I was presiding  over the Senate, and I listened very closely to his arguments and  others that were made along similar lines. None of the claims that I  have heard hold water when you look at the facts because here is what  Judge Jackson herself said during her confirmation hearing when asked  about judicial restraint:         I am acutely aware that, as a judge in our system, I have       limited power, and I am trying in every case to stay in my       lane.    This is not just a hollow promise. Judge Jackson has explained to  this Senate her clear methodology for ruling on cases to ensure that  she stays in her lane. The methodology is simple.   Step 1, start from a position of neutrality.   We have all seen the scales of justice. We want them to be evenly  balanced. Everybody who walks into a court should get a fair shot. That  is step 1.   Step 2, evaluate all of the facts from various perspectives.   Step 3, apply the law to those facts.   That is it. She was clear. That is how she makes decisions. That is  how she rules from the bench.   So what about the Constitution itself, that great document? What  about this notion that she would be a runaway Justice, ``creating new  rights from the Constitution out of whole cloth''?--to use the  language, the expression, of some of my colleagues.   That, too, is just plain wrong.   Here is Judge Jackson again when she said:         I believe that the Constitution is fixed in its meaning. I       believe it is appropriate to look at the original intent,       original public meaning of the words when one is trying to       assess because, again, that is a limitation on my authority       to import my own policy.    Judge Jackson understands the boundaries of her authority as a judge.  She has stayed within those boundaries for over a decade on the Federal  bench.   So enough of the spurious arguments that she is going to be an  activist on the Court. Her method is clear; it is fair; it is balanced  and honest, and I am confident that her rulings will be clear, fair,  balanced, and honest.   Let's not forget this: There are certain rights that most Americans  would acknowledge are central to our Nation's traditions and values but  that are not specifically and expressly enumerated in the Constitution,  not each and every one with its own sentence.   I have a short list here: the right to travel, the right to vote, the  right to privacy, the right to marry. None of these rights are  explicitly, expressly referenced in the text of the Constitution, but  all of them have been derived by a close analysis of the letter and  spirit of our Constitution and laws. These are rights we all embrace.  These are rights the American people don't want elected officials to be  able to take away from them.   Let's not forget that the First Amendment, as written, only protects  Americans from Federal action, from congressional action, that would  violate their right to freedom of religion, press, speech, and  assembly.   Over time, the Court has taken action to protect these rights in the  face of all government action, whether Federal or State or local, to  make sure that those rights are protected against all government action  no matter what its source.   Justices appointed by Presidents of both parties have worked to  protect rights Americans hold dear.   President Reagan's appointee Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the  majority opinion in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges, which protects  the rights of same-sex couples to marry. His fellow Reagan appointee  Sandra Day O'Connor joined the majority in the case of Planned  Parenthood v. Casey, which reaffirmed the reproductive liberties  guaranteed under Roe v. Wade.   Let's be clear: The Supreme Court considers the most challenging  questions in American law. Judge Jackson will have to take on these  challenging questions, like her peers on the Court, if she is  confirmed; but one thing is crystal clear from her testimony and from  the record: She will apply the law based on the facts. She will not be  a partisan in a robe. She will be a fair, independent Justice of the  Supreme Court, and she is very deserving of that title.   I had the great privilege of meeting with Judge Jackson just  yesterday. During our conversation, I was struck, again, by her  brilliance, her intelligence, her kindness, and resolve. That came  across on television during the hearings, but it was very evident in  our one-on-one meeting. I thought about another Supreme Court nominee  who broke barriers nearly 55 years ago, a man from Baltimore, MD:  Thurgood Marshall. He was the first Black man to serve on the Supreme  Court of the United States.   So, during my conversation with Judge Jackson, I invited her to join  me in West Baltimore at P.S. 103. This is public school building 103.  It is in West Baltimore. It is the school where Thurgood Marshall  learned to read and write. It is no longer an active school. The  building is in bad condition. Just this year, as part of the omnibus  appropriations bill, Senator Cardin and I were able to secure some  Federal funds to help renovate that building and to turn it into a  living memorial to Justice Thurgood Marshall and to expand  opportunities for people in West Baltimore. So I told Judge Jackson  that once she gets settled, it would be a great honor and privilege to  bring her, the first Black woman on the Supreme Court, to the place  where the first Black man on the Court grew up and went to school.    Justice Thurgood Marshall inspired a generation of leaders and public  servants to enter the legal field. Soon, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson  will do the same. Young people from all across our country will look at  the Supreme Court of the United States and feel more included. Her  presence on the Court will be a victory for ``we the people.''   In 1978, Justice Thurgood Marshall said to a group of university  graduates:         This is your democracy. Make it. Protect it. Pass it on.    I am deeply honored to work alongside my colleagues in the Senate to  advance that vision, as we all strive to form a more perfect Union. And  there is no doubt in my mind--no doubt at all--that elevating Judge  Jackson to Justice Jackson will make our Union a little more perfect.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 659, Katherine  Vidal,  [[Page S1975]]  to be Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and  Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office; that the  Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate;  that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table; that any statements related to the nomination be printed in the  Record; and that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning  business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes  each.    Madam President, I understand that there is a bill at  the desk, and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for a second reading, and in order to place  the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to  my own request.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 277, S.  2123.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  committee-reported amendments be agreed to; that the bill, as amended,  be considered read a third time and passed; and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 5681, which was  received by the House and is at the desk.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  bill be considered read a third time and passed and the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when  the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Wednesday, April 6, and that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to be  Associate Justice of the Supreme Court; that at 11:45 a.m., the Senate  execute the previous order with respect to the O'Brien nomination and  vote on the confirmation of the nomination; finally, if any nominations  are confirmed during Wednesday's session of the Senate, the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:22 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, April 6, 2022, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
