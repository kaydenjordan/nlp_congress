 Mr. Speaker, no one has worked harder to help House  Republicans win back the majority and deliver on our conservative,  commonsense agenda than Kevin McCarthy.   As the son of a firefighter, Kevin learned the values of grit,  determination, and courage early in life. Throughout his years here in  Washington as a Congressman, whip, majority leader, and our 55th  Speaker of the House, it was those values that made  [[Page H6969]]  him one of the most fierce fighters for Republican priorities ever.   I had the privilege of serving on Kevin's leadership team this  Congress. I have seen him work tirelessly to ensure House Republicans  delivered on our promises to the American people. I have seen him  listen to and work with Members across every sector of our Conference  to bring forward viable solutions. I have seen him do the right thing,  no matter the cost. He truly believes in the greatness of this country  and this institution.                                time  1145    I will be brutally honest. I usually am. It was hard to watch as  things played out the way they did. Kevin McCarthy did not deserve any  of that treatment, but no matter what, he has always risen above the  fold, handled every situation with grace, and put whatever is in the  best interests of America first.   I thank Kevin for his leadership. It has been an honor to serve  alongside him. Jacquie and I are rooting for him always, and we wish  him nothing but the best in whatever comes next.
