 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the future for American workers is looking  bright. A combination of tax reform, which we passed in December, plus  other economy-boosting measures, such as lifting burdensome  regulations, is starting to produce the kind of economy we need to give  Americans access to a future of security and prosperity.   Our goal with tax reform was pretty simple: Make life better for  American workers. That involved a couple of things. For starters, it  involved putting more money in Americans' pockets right away by cutting  their taxes, and that is what we did. We cut tax rates across the  board, nearly doubled the standard deduction, and doubled the child tax  credit. Americans are already seeing this relief in their paychecks,  but we knew that tax cuts, as helpful as they are, weren't enough.   We needed to make sure that Americans had access to good jobs, good  wages, and good opportunities--the kinds of jobs and opportunities that  would set them up for security and prosperity for the long term. Since  jobs and opportunities are created by businesses, that meant reforming  our Tax Code to improve the playing field for businesses so they could  improve the playing field for their workers, and that is what we did. I  am pleased to report that it is already working.   Less than 5 months into the new tax law, business after business has  announced good news for workers--pay increases, bonuses, better  benefits, like increased retirement benefits, like new and better  education benefits, and enhanced parental leave benefits. So far we  have more than 530 examples of businesses making things better for  their workers and customers, from giant corporations like Apple to  small businesses like the Don Ramon restaurant in West Palm Beach, FL.   Economic indicators are looking good. Last month, the unemployment  rate hit its lowest level since 2000. That is right; the last time  unemployment was this low, the iPod hadn't even been introduced yet.   Economic growth is on a solid track. The economy's growth rate in the  first quarter of 2018 was nearly double what it was during the same  period last year.   Small businesses are thriving. The president of the National  Federation of Independent Business reports:         Small and independent business owners are notably confident       about the economy. They are reporting that sales are strong,       profits are good, and employee compensation is increasing.       And many are setting into motion plans to expand.    That, again, is from the president of the National Federation of  Independent Business. That is borne out by NFIB's recent survey data,  which shows the net percentage of businesses raising worker  compensation over the last 3 months has increased to 33 percent--the  highest level since 2000. That is good news for American workers.   Americans had a tough time during the last administration. Our  economy stagnated, and American families struggled. But our economy-- and our country--are coming back, and they are coming back stronger  than ever.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other policies we have passed are  creating an economy that will allow families to access the jobs, the  wages, and the opportunities they need for security today and for  prosperity tomorrow. The future is indeed looking brighter.
