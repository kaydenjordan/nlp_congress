 Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank the  gentlewoman for yielding and for her tremendous leadership on so many  issues.   I rise today in strong support of H.J. Res. 28, this continuing  resolution bill to reopen the government through February 28. This  legislation would end the Trump shutdown and ensure that our Federal  employees get their paychecks, like, now.   This bill also sends a clear message that we will not let President  Trump hold this government hostage for his irresponsible, mean-spirited  wall.   Mr. Speaker, this is the longest government shutdown in history. The  government has been closed now for 27 days--27 days, mind you. All the  President has to do is say: Yes, I will open up the government.   Meanwhile, we Democrats continue to do our job and demand that the  President do his. We have passed seven pieces of legislation to end the  Trump shutdown--seven. But we can't reopen this government alone.  Senator McConnell should do his job to end this crisis.   Now, let me be clear: By continuing this reckless shutdown, President  Trump is leaving 800,000 Federal workers and 200,000 low-wage Federal  contractors in the lurch. Not only is this an insult to their hard  work, but it is a slap in the face for the families who have no other  way to pay their bills.   I have spoken to many people in my district who can't afford to buy  gas to  [[Page H690]]  get to their jobs, jobs that they are working at day in and day out  without pay.   That is no way to run a country, and House Democrats won't stand for  it.   Let's pass this bill to reopen the government now. Let's get the  American people the paychecks that they deserve for the important work  they do to protect the public, our food, our parks, and our families  who are suffering so much as a result of them being used as hostages  and political pawns by this President.
