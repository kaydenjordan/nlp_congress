 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to the  Strength in Diversity Act, which requires grantees to report on their  progress in reducing racial and socioeconomic segregation in our  schools.   In the year 2020, our schools are still separate and unequal. My home  district has some of the most racially segregated schools in the  country, and this is no coincidence. This was by design.   Forty-five years ago, rich White suburbs around my district decided  they didn't want to bus their children to desegregate schools, and the  highest court in our land agreed with them. The Supreme Court case of  Milliken v. Bradley made racial integration of schools nearly  impossible, and we are still seeing the negative impact of that  decision today.   We see it in our Detroit Public Schools, where students had to sue  the State of Michigan for the right to literacy. We see it in the lead  that poisons our school drinking fountains throughout my district. We  see it in having just $7,000 per pupil while the neighboring the Grosse  Pointe community, a largely White, affluent suburb, has nearly $14,000  per pupil.   I want to thank Representative Fudge for her tireless efforts in  leading this legislation, which is a critically important step toward  racial desegregation of our schools.   I also want to thank Chairman Scott and his incredible staff for  working with me on this amendment and for their leadership.   I urge strong support for this amendment and for this bill.
