 Mr. Speaker, this very Nation was founded  upon the belief that all men are entitled to the most precious right to  life. It is a right that I fought to defend in the United States Air  Force, and it is a right I continue to defend in this United States  Congress. That is why, this week, I will proudly vote in support of the  Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.   It is my hope folks across the country are brought together with the  uplifting message that life is a blessing.                            ____________________
