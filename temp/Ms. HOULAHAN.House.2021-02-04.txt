 Mr. Speaker, a lot of people in this body are talking  about jobs these days, and rightfully so. Our economy is in crisis. But  what I want to do is urge everyone that when we talk about rebuilding  this economy, we are talking about all of the issues that make for a  successful economy, and that includes childcare and attention to our  children.   Like many industries during this pandemic, childcare is struggling.  Many facilities can't pay their bills due to reduced demand in services  and increased costs to keep safe facilities for both children and  staff. Many of us on both sides of the aisle have rightfully celebrated  the heroes of this pandemic: healthcare workers, frontline workers, and  essential workers. And these are the very people who are using  childcare right now and they are the ones who cannot work from home  and, therefore, need enriching and safe places for their children to go  while they literally save lives and provide for the American people.   So I ask every Member who has spoken so passionately about our heroes  and about returning to normal life to move beyond those words and to  take meaningful votes on legislation that will ensure access to  equitable, high-quality childcare for infants, toddlers, preschoolers,  and afterschool care children alike all across this country.                            ____________________
