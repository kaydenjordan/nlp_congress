 Mr. President, it is my privilege now to speak to the  pastor from my home State who gave the prayer today, the Reverend  Asriel McLain of Shreveport.   Reverend McLain is a graduate of Bishop College in Dallas, TX, and he  earned his master of divinity degree from Princeton Theological  Seminary. He has been a pastor, ministering to others in Louisiana,  Texas, and Michigan.   Reverend McLain is the son of Mrs. Mildred Oliver McLain and the late  Reverend Claude Clifford, the former pastor of the historic Little  Union Baptist Church, which was the epicenter of the civil rights  movement in Shreveport.   I had breakfast with Pastor McLain this morning and learned of the  courage of his father and that of his congregation, while in the face  of official oppression, in making sure that one Martin Luther King got  to speak in Shreveport and that those in their community had a voice  about how they wanted their community to evolve. The courage that his  father showed and that the parish showed--I am an Episcopalian--that  the congregation showed was quite remarkable.   Much like his father, Reverend McLain has spent much of his life  preserving the civil rights history of Louisiana, and much like his  father, he is a man of profound faith and is a messenger of God's  grace.   He is a proud father of four kids and is a grandfather of four. He is  also one of five siblings--Pat, John, Gene, and Clifford--and Clifford  is here with him today. Pastor McLain is also accompanied by his son  David and grandson Jayden.   It was a pleasure to have Pastor McLain lead us in prayer today, and  I look forward to perhaps having him join us once more.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S2056]]
