 Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Imogene's Alterations of Bowling Green, KY, as the Senate Small  Business of the Week.   Located on Nutwood Street, Imogene's Alterations has served Bowling  Green, KY, for over 20 years. Imogene Garmon, a longtime Bowling Green  resident, embarked on her first career in the grocery sector. After 33  years working at the Kroger meat counter, she was ready for a new  challenge. A self-taught seamstress, Imogene began selling fabric and  doing minor alterations after leaving Kroger. Seeing a business  opportunity, Imogene went on to establish a fabric shop. She thrived as  a small business owner, serving the greater Bowling Green community.  Word spread quickly of Imogene's talent as a seamstress. Request for  alterations poured in, including everything from everyday clothing to  suits and ball gowns. To meet the demand, Imogene decided to focus  solely on alterations. She established Imogene's Alterations, providing  full-time alterations for men and women's clothing.   Today, Imogene's Alterations continues providing alterations for all  types of events and special occasions. This woman-owned business has  grown along with the area, moving into its current location at Nutwood  Street about 20 years ago. Customers are welcomed by name and treated  like family. At 88 years old, Imogene continues to be involved in every  aspect of her business. From operating the store to sewing alterations,  her care and attention to detail are evident in her work. Her strong  sense of family has built a tight-knit, supportive team.   Like many entrepreneurs, Imogene established a successful business  while building community. As a mother, grandmother, and aunt, Imogene  raised and continues to mentor generations of her family. Remarkably,  Imogene founded Imogene's Alterations in her 60s. It took innovation  and courage to pursue her goal, switching from the grocery industry  which she knew well, to the tailoring sector.   Imogene's Alterations is a remarkable example of the resilience and  adaptability of locally owned small businesses. Small businesses like  Imogene's Alterations form the heart of cities and towns across  Kentucky. Congratulations to Imogene and the entire team at Imogene's  Alterations. I wish them the best of luck, and I look forward to  watching their continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
