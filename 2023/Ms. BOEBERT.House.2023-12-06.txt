 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life, sacrifice, and  service of Cortez Police Sergeant Michael Moran, a true American hero  who laid down his life in service to our great country and his  community.   Sergeant Moran was fatally shot during a traffic stop on November 29,  providing a tragic end to a life of dedication and service.   Sergeant Moran answered the call to serve our Nation as a marine for  9 years before joining the Cortez Police Department in 2012. His life  was marked with selfless courage and love, always putting others before  himself.   Mr. Speaker, Sergeant Moran was a shining example for all Americans.  His passing is an immeasurable loss for us all, and he was the best  that Colorado's Third District had to offer.   My prayers go out to his family, his loved ones, and the community of  Cortez. I pray for God's wraparound presence to surround them, comfort  them, and heal them in this time of mourning.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Sergeant Moran for his selfless service.                            ____________________
