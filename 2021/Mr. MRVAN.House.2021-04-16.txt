 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Courtney for the time.   First, I include in the Record this letter of support for H.R. 1195,  the Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service  Workers Act, written by Thomas Conway, the International President for  the United Steelworkers.                                             United Steelworkers,                                                     March 24, 2021.      Re United Steelworkers supports H.R. 1195, the Workplace           Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service           Workers Act.       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 850,000 members of       the United Steelworkers (USW), I am urging you to support the       Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social       Service Workers Act (H.R. 1195).        Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, workplace violence in       health care and social service settings was a growing and       ever-present threat to workers. While helping patients fight       against the virus, these workers, who repeatedly put their       lives on the line to ensure the health and wellbeing of       others, have had to face a continued rash of assaults and       violent attacks.        According to data from the Department of Labor, healthcare       employees are four times more likely to experience workplace       violence than others in the private sector. And those in a       hospital setting are nearly six times as likely as other       workers to be the victim of an intentional injury. It is       clear that these essential workers need protection against       violence on the job. They need an enforceable OSHA standard       to prevent workplace violence and ensure the safe working       environment that they all deserve.        H.R. 1195 would compel OSHA to issue a workplace violence       prevention standard that requires health care and social       services employers to develop and implement comprehensive       plans to protect workers from violence in the workplace. The       requirements are based on existing guidelines and       recommendations from OSHA, the National Institute for       Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), industry       associations, and state measures and ensure that there are       workplace-specific plans in place to protect workers.        Violent, serious, and life-altering incidents should never       be part of the job. In order to begin curbing this epidemic       of preventable workplace violence, our health care and social       service workers need an enforceable OSHA standard that       addresses violence in the workplace in a comprehensive       manner.        Our union urges you to support the Workplace Violence       Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act       (H.R. 1195).            Sincerely,                                                     Thomas Conway,                                           International President.     Madam Speaker, I appreciate that we are taking action  today to support and defend these frontline workers, our healthcare and  social workers, who selflessly have chosen their professions in order  to serve others, and who, at the same time, experience rates of  violence 12 times higher than other workers.   The United Steelworkers letter just inserted into the Record  importantly noted that violent, serious, and life-altering incidents  should never be a part of the job, and that in order to begin curbing  this epidemic of workplace violence, our healthcare and social service  workers need an enforceable OSHA standard that addresses violence in  the workplace in a comprehensive manner.   There is a difference between punishment and safety, and I urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting this critically important  legislation for these invaluable workers.    Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 118.
