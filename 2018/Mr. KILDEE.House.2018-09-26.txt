 Mr. Speaker, this week, House Republicans are rushing  through yet another tax bill that gives the superwealthy and the well- connected a big tax break at the expense of working families in my  district.   The first Republican tax bill already cost $2 trillion, exploding our  national deficit and setting up huge cuts for Medicare, Medicaid, and  Social Security.   The overwhelming number of Americans do not support these massive  handouts to the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations. They  have already funneled these corporations almost $1 trillion in stock  buybacks to shareholders--money that is not going to workers.   This week, House Republicans are just doubling down on this deeply  unpopular and dangerous tax scam. This latest bill has Republicans  scheming to make tax breaks for billionaires permanent, handing tens of  billions of dollars to the wealthiest 1 percent. This latest bill will  add to our national deficit.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats support real bipartisan tax reform that would  give relief to working American families.                            ____________________
