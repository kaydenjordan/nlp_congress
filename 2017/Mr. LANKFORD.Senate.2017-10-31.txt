 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have the opportunity to speak to this  body today about Amy Barrett. Her nomination is currently pending to be  a circuit court judge. There is a pretty high standard for those  individuals because they handle some incredibly difficult  constitutional cases. What is good about this is that Amy Barrett meets  the high standard for those qualifications.   Professor Barrett received her B.A. in English literature magna cum  laude from Rhodes College and her J.D. summa cum laude from Notre Dame  University Law School, where she served as executive editor of the  Notre Dame Law Review.   She currently serves as a research professor of law at Notre Dame  University Law School. Professor Barrett teaches and researches in the  areas of Federal courts, constitutional law, and statutory  interpretation, publishing scholarship in leading legal journals, such  as the Columbia, Virginia, and Texas Law Reviews. Those aren't easy  areas to be able to publish in or an easy professorship to be able to  land.   Before joining Notre Dame, Professor Barrett clerked for Justice  Scalia of the Supreme Court of the United States and for Judge  Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. Following  her clerkships, she was an associate, where she litigated  constitutional, criminal, and commercial cases both in trial and  appellate courts. Professor Barrett also served as a visiting associate  professor at George Washington University Law School.   She seems to be eminently qualified. Then what seems to be the issue?  Interestingly enough, she faced a very odd set of questions during her  confirmation process--questions not about her legal scholarship, not  about her qualifications, but, oddly enough, about her Catholic faith.  It wasn't about her temperament. It wasn't about her fairness. It  wasn't about scholarship. It was whether her Catholic faith would get  in the way of her being a good judge. Quite frankly, it wasn't about  whether she had chosen a faith; it was the problem that she actually  seemed to live her faith that became a big challenge during the  questioning time period.  [[Page S6894]]    It is odd for us as Americans because this seems to be an issue we  resolved 200-plus years ago. We resolved it in article VI of the  Constitution, which says that there is no religious test for any  officer of the United States. There is no requirement to be of a  certain faith or, if you are of a certain faith, to take that faith off  if you are going to serve in the United States. We have in our  Constitution a protection not of freedom of worship, which I hear some  people say--they are free to worship as they choose--that is not our  constitutional protection. Our constitutional protection is the free  exercise of your religion--not just that you can have a faith, but you  can both have a faith and live your faith according to your own  principles. That is consistent with who we are as Americans, that we  allow any individual to have a faith and to live their faith both in  their private and public life or to have no faith at all if they choose  to have no faith at all. That is a decision for each American.   But we don't ask individuals--as has been asked of this individual-- whether faith will be the big issue and whether faith becomes a  question in whether they are capable to serve other fellow Americans.   What is so dangerous, quite frankly, about her Catholic faith and her  Christian beliefs as far as her being a judge? Are people afraid that  she will actually live out what the Book of Proverbs says--to speak up  for those who cannot speak for themselves, speak for the rights of all  who are destitute, speak up and judge fairly, defend the rights of the  poor and the needy? Is that what everyone is afraid of, that she will  actually live out that Biblical principle?   I am a little confused why comments, such as ``The dogma lives loudly  within you,'' were said during her questioning in the committee, and  there were other questions to challenge her Catholic faith. Faith is a  choice that each individual has, and it is an extremely personal but  also extremely important choice.   Some individuals in America--myself included--choose to look past the  mundane, day-to-day events and to think there is someone and something  higher than us. We don't just look at the creation around us; we wonder  about the Creator who made it. We don't just wonder about cosmic dust  smashing into each other; we ask a logical question: If cosmic dust  were to smash into each other in space and create all there is, who  made space and who made the cosmic dust that smashed into each other,  and how did that happen? Faith drives us to ask harder questions and to  look a little longer at things that other people just see as plain in  front of them. We ask what is behind it. A lot of Americans do. It is  not irrational; it is a part of who we are and a part of how we are  made.   It is a challenge to us as Americans to be able to challenge an  individual and to say: That person is so radical that they believe in  things like do not murder, do not steal, do not covet, honor your  father and mother, or even things as radical as, in whatever you do, do  unto others as you would have them do unto you.   It doesn't seem that radical of a belief that we would have to  challenge and wonder whether one was able to be a judge if they believe  in those things. We dare to believe in something beyond us, as do  millions of other Americans.   I really thought that our Nation was past this, that our Nation that  speaks so much of diversity and of being open to other ideas is somehow  closing to people of faith. People who say they want to demand that  everyone be included are afraid of people who have faith and live their  faith. Why would that be? If we are going to be an open society, is it  not open as well to people of faith to not only have a faith but to  live their faith?   We hit a moment like this in the 1960s, and I thought we had moved  past it. There was a Senator at that time who was running to be  President of the United States. We know him as John Kennedy.   Senator Kennedy was speaking to a group of ministers in Houston, TX,  in the 1960s, and he had to stand before them and explain his Catholic  faith because, quite frankly, there was this buzz: Could someone be a  Catholic and be President? What would that mean? Would you have  difficulties with that?   The questions that were asked of Professor Barrett were strikingly  similar to the questions that were asked of Senator Kennedy when he was  running to be President of the United States. Here is how Senator  Kennedy responded:         For while this year it may be a Catholic against whom the       finger of suspicion is pointed, in other years it has been,       and may some day be again, a Jew--or a Quaker or a Unitarian       or a Baptist. It was Virginia's harassment of Baptist       preachers, for example, that helped lead to Jefferson's       statute of religious freedom. Today I may be the victim, but       tomorrow it may be you--until the whole fabric of our       harmonious society is ripped at a time of great national       peril. . . . And in fact, this is the kind of America for       which our forefathers died, when they fled here to escape       religious test oaths that denied office to members of less       favored churches; when they fought for the Constitution, the       Bill of Rights, and the Virginia Statute of Religious       Freedom; and when they fought at the shrine I visited today,       the Alamo.    JFK had visited the Alamo that day.         For side by side with Bowie and Crockett died McCafferty       and Bailey and Carey. But no one knows whether they were       Catholic or not, for there was no religious test at the       Alamo.    Then he made this closing statement:         If I should lose on the real issues [of the Presidential       race], I shall return to my seat in the Senate, satisfied       that I had tried my best and was fairly judged. But if this       election is decided on the basis that 40 million Americans       lost their chance of being president on the day they were       baptized, then it is the whole nation that will be the loser,       in the eyes of Catholics and non-Catholics around the world,       in the eyes of history, and in the eyes of our own people.    This should be a settled issue for us, not a divisive one. We are a  diverse nation--diverse in backgrounds, perspectives, attitudes, and  yes, diverse in faith.   I look forward to supporting Professor Barrett in this position, and  I look forward to seeing her decisions as they come out of that court,  consistent with the law--as she is well trained to be able to do--and  consistent with our convictions as Americans.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have 9 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
