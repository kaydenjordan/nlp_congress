 Mr. Speaker, today, high school students got up from  their desks and walked out of their classes to take a stand against gun  violence and for school safety. From the east coast of Florida to the  central coast of California, students left their classrooms for 17  minutes to remember the 17 lives lost at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High  School and to demand that Congress take action on gun violence.   Now, today, Mr. Speaker, I commend you. We acted together to pass the  STOP School Violence Act for school safety and security, but with all  due respect, Mr. Speaker, that is not enough, and it is time we come  together to pass commonsense reforms that have broad support across our  Nation, from banning bump stocks to repealing the Dickey amendment, to  fixing our system of background checks.   We all appreciate the emotion and passion by the high school students  all across our country, but we realize, as they do, that thoughts and  prayers only go so far. So now it is up to Congress to govern not just  by crisis, but actually by leadership to make our schools, our  communities, and our country safer.                            ____________________
