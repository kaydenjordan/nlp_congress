 Madam Speaker, today we will be taking up a resolution to  denounce the BDS movement, the boycott, divestment, and sanctions  against Israel.   This region is not unfamiliar to me, as I have been there twice, in  both Israel and Palestine. I do not support the BDS movement.   When I was last in Palestine, I asked multiple people with whom I met  if they supported the movement, and the response was that they did not,  as they were afraid of the economic effect on Palestine, where many are  already struggling.   However, I also do not support the resolution today, as it goes too  far, in my opinion, in telling people what they can or should think or  say about the situation in Israel.   Israel the country and the Israeli people are good friends of the  United States. They are a strong democracy and a close ally of our  country. I have supported the Iron Dome as a way to deescalate the  tensions that occur when a rocket is sent into Israel from inside Gaza,  for example. It is better to take out that missile before there is any  damage or death rather than returning a volley of rockets back in  response, injuring or killing people of both countries.   But I also think it is okay to be critical of the Netanyahu  administration, or government, and their policies.   Look, if a dear friend does something that jeopardizes themselves or  their family's lives or livelihoods, I have a moral obligation to say  something because I respect my friend. It should be no different with  our response to Israel. People have a right to be concerned about a  number of actions by the Israeli Government.   We have a right to question how continuing to create illegal  settlements into the West Bank will make it harder to broker a two- state solution, the best path forward toward peace in the region, given  the additional difficulty of the land swaps.   We have a right to question why it is okay to take Palestinian  children, or any child, into a military court for detention by Israel.   We have a right to ask if sectioning off 2 million people in Gaza,  with over a million people needing food assistance and 95 percent not  having access to clean water, will ever lead to peace, or why not  allowing Members of Congress to go into Gaza from Israel is smart. What  don't they want us to see by not allowing us in?   We have a right to ask how demolishing Palestinian homes in East  Jerusalem or the West Bank or crops in Gaza serves to further peace in  the region.   We have a right to ask why it makes sense to have a major highway  with a giant wall in the middle of it with one side for Palestinians  and the other for Israelis, as it looks like something we have judged  poorly previously in history.   We have a right to ask if a bullet directed at a child is an  equivalent response to a thrown rock.   I am not saying that Hamas, the organization that has been recognized  by the United States as a terrorist organization, is innocent or pure-- anything but. But, obviously, not all Palestinians are Hamas by any  stretch of the imagination.   If we really want peace in the region, where we will never have to  send young men and women from our country to risk their lives, then we  need a government in Israel that respects human rights more and works  more aggressively towards peace.   I was told a resolution advocating for a two-state solution would be  up today as well, a resolution I support; but apparently it is not, and  that is a mistake. Instead, only this resolution opposing BDS is up.   And while I do not support BDS, I cannot support this resolution as  worded. My hope is that we will have real peace in the region someday,  that we will have a two-state solution where both Israelis and  Palestinians will live in peace, both internally and with each other.  But this resolution won't do that.   Madam Speaker, I just wish real efforts toward peace were what we  were debating today.  [[Page H7164]]                                ____________________
