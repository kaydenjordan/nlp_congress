 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I thank my colleague and friend from Georgia for yielding time to me.   Mr. Speaker, with this package of bills, the majority is taking a  sledgehammer to civil litigation. I know that my colleague and I are  not going to agree with that because I listened intently to what he had  to say. But it is closing courthouse doors to ordinary people who are  injured in the workplace and makes it harder for working people wronged  by the rich and powerful to seek justice.   First, H.R. 985 is really a solution in search of a problem. It uses  the false notion of rampant fraud in the legal system to shield  corporate wrongdoers and deny their victims relief.   Second, H.R. 906 has the potential to further victimize asbestos  victims.   Third, H.R. 720 would roll back significant improvements to the Rules  of Civil Procedure and repeat a failed experiment that led to a decade  of problems in the courts. By requiring mandatory sanctions that tie  judges' hands, we saw an avalanche of unnecessary litigation.   The majority is wasting time and taxpayer money to make changes that  evidence and the experts tell us are not necessary and could actually  cause more harm than good. It doesn't make sense.   But consider, Mr. Speaker, how the majority conducted itself on  health care for a decade now. Almost immediately after President Obama  signed the Affordable Care Act into law, 13 Republican State attorneys  general filed a Federal lawsuit opposing health reform. That was back  in 2010. Since that time, the majority has voted over and over again-- more than 60 times--to undermine the ACA.   CBS News has highlighted that it costs the taxpayers an estimated $24  million a week to run the House of Representatives. Think how many  millions of dollars of legislative time the majority wasted on these  votes that never had any chance of becoming law under the previous  President. They wasted taxpayers' dollars and they wasted precious  time. The majority spoke again and again about repeal and replace, and  all the while, they didn't have a thing in the world to replace the  health care with.   Former Speaker John Boehner recently made that clear, and it wasn't  until this week that the majority finally let Members of Congress and  the American people see their latest effort--and it would be a  catastrophe for families across the country. More and more groups and  individuals are lining up against it.   People would be forced to pay more for worse coverage if they could  afford any coverage at all. The bill would also defund Planned  Parenthood, which more than 2.5 million people, men and women, rely on  for lifesaving preventive care, like cancer screenings and STI testing,  every single year.   It is truly astonishing that the majority is trying to rush through  this bill without a Congressional Budget Office estimate about how much  it would cost or what impact it would have on the insurance market.   Let me quote from a Washington Post story this morning written by the  great Karen Tumulty:         While it is not uncommon for panels to consider legislation       without the Congressional Budget Office first weighing in,       veterans of the process say that doing so on bills as far-      reaching as the healthcare overhaul is rare and ill-advised.    We don't have any idea how many people would gain or lose coverage  without the CBO estimate, but we do know that this bill would take us  back to the days before the Affordable Care Act when American people  were on their own to try and get health care without any real  safeguards in place at all; when families were liable to go bankrupt  from heavy healthcare costs in a year's time, and the ACA protects them  from that by saying that once an insured person has spent $4,500 a year  on health care, the insurance company will pay the rest, and for a  family, $12,500 to insure them. That is something so rarely talked  about that is in this bill that I think is of vast importance, and we  would lose that.   Billionaires would get a tax break, but working families probably  couldn't afford health care.   We are rushing through this healthcare bill without a proper  understanding of its cost or its impacts. The majority completely  skipped the hearing process and, therefore, hasn't heard from experts  or doctors or people battling an illness--except, I guess, what is  going on torturing people over in the Energy and Commerce Committee  where they have been there since, what, over 24 hours now.   So we were encouraged yesterday when we learned at the Rules  Committee that White House Secretary  [[Page H1965]]  Sean Spicer had said at a briefing yesterday:         Every Member of the House and the Senate will be able to       have their opportunity to have amendments offered through the       committee process and on the floor.    It looks like we are not going to have that opportunity. And I do not  have enthusiasm for the notion that we will have an open rule since,  under this Speaker we have not had any, and the Democrats long to be  able to offer some amendments to this bill. I certainly hope that that  might be the case.   Now, the only way that happens is through the open rule. As I said,  we haven't seen one of those in Speaker Ryan's leadership. I hope the  majority follows through with the White House's promise of an open rule  because, more than anything on this, the American people deserve an  open and transparent process as this bill moves forward.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule that would require a CBO cost estimate to be made publicly  available for any legislation that amends or repeals the Affordable  Care Act which may be considered in the Energy and Commerce or Ways and  Means Committees or on the House floor.   The Committees on Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce are marking  up repeal legislation today. Legislation this significant should not  advance through the committee process, let alone the House, without  first hearing from our nonpartisan budget experts at CBO on what the  cost and overall impact would be.   Mr. Speaker, one of the most enduring symbols of fairness is Lady  Justice, who is depicted holding the Scales of Justice that represent  fairness in our courts. That central idea is embodied in the fact that  justice in the United States of America is supposed to be delivered  fairly, without any bias toward wealth or privilege.   It is no secret that sometimes we do struggle to live up to that  ideal. We have seen evidence of that far too often recently. But, Mr.  Speaker, this Chamber shouldn't be actively working to tilt those  scales toward the rich and the powerful, but that is what this  legislation would do. Considering these bills wastes their money and  fritters away the time we should be spending addressing our crumbling  infrastructure and the skyrocketing cost of education.   And, Mr. Speaker, today we got from the American Society of Civil  Engineers the new grades on our infrastructure. This year we get a D  minus, and we should certainly do better than that.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment into the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
