 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the  Democrats' now estimated $4.3 trillion budget reconciliation bill that  calls for the highest sustained Federal spending levels in American  history.   Combined with the infrastructure bill, this results in a partisan  $5.5 trillion package that will further hurt our economy and, most  importantly, the American people.   This legislation is filled with a spending spree of far-left policies  before the government is funded for next year at a time when inflation  is at a 13-year high. Everyday goods are more expensive for Americans,  while the purchasing power of an hour of work has declined by 0.7  percent over the last year.   Families are paying more and making less, and trillions more in  government spending would only exacerbate this economic crisis.   Madam Speaker, the American people should not have to bear the brunt  of the Democrats' agenda. I firmly oppose the legislation that solely  focuses on the left's priorities while furthering our national debt. I  encourage my colleagues to do the same.                            ____________________
