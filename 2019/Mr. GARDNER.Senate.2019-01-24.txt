 Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for this  opportunity to come to the floor to talk about what this Chamber needs  to do, along with the House and the President, to get this government  reopened and to fund border security, something that all Americans  agree on--that we can walk and chew gum at the same time; that we can  multitask; that we can find a way to fund priority spending on the  border; and that we can find a way to fund 800,000 government  employees, including 53,000 Federal employees in my home State of  Colorado.   In 2014, I was elected to the Senate. In November of 2014, we were  dealing with a question of whether the government would shut down. In  fact, the first issue we were asked in the new Congress as we headed  back into session was this: Would there be a looming shutdown over  immigration? That was not in 2018 or 2019. That was actually in 2014.  Here is what I said then:         There's no time, place, or purpose of a government shutdown       or default. That's simply ridiculous and something that a       mature governing body doesn't even contemplate. We ought to       make it very clear that that's simply not acceptable.    I said that in 2014; I echoed it in December 2018; and I stand on the  floor today sharing the same belief, sentiment, and value.   We need border security in this country. We need to have barriers and  structures on the border where it makes sense, as the President has  said. He has made a reasonable request to put in place border security.   We also have a responsibility to the people of this country to govern  responsibly. That means not jeopardizing our economy, not jeopardizing  the firefighters in Colorado who can't go to training right now because  the government is shut down.   My home State lost hundreds of homes last year due to wildfires.  Think about the catastrophes in California and across the West last  year. Firefighters from around the country were called to do heroic  things and save entire towns, yet those training services, classes, and  tools they need for a fire season that could start at any time are  being denied--training and classes that they need to save their own  lives, to save other lives, and to protect our land.   We have farmers who are trying to get production loans right now.  They can't get their production loans through certain offices because  of the shutdown. Farming is not good right now, and prices are so low  right now that people are struggling. I talked to a farmer in Colorado  yesterday. He doesn't know what the bank is going to say to him on  Friday, tomorrow, when he goes in, and he can't get ahold of anybody at  the USDA because of the shutdown.   We need border security. That is why I voted for both measures  today--the $5.7 billion for border security and the continuing  resolution proposal that contains the President's 2018 border security  proposal. Both measures included border security.   We can do this. It is not that difficult. It shouldn't be a challenge  to govern responsibly. Shutdowns aren't the solution. Walking and  chewing gum at the same time shouldn't be so difficult, and I hope this  Chamber will come to its senses, along with our House colleagues and  the White House, to move forward.
