 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Thornberry  for yielding me the time.   Mr. Chair, my amendment proposes to increase the authorized funding  for the Counterdrug Program by $10 million.   For 30 years, the National Guard has successfully performed drug  interdiction and counterdrug activities to support our local  communities and our national security. The National Guard partners with  local, State, and Federal law enforcement agencies, and community  organizations to effectively combat the supply and demand for illegal  drugs. The National Guard Counterdrug Program works.   In the past 4 years, the West Virginia National Guard successfully  seized more than $500 million of illegal drugs, black market drugs that  are devastating our communities and towns. And as our Nation copes with  the devastating drug epidemic, we must fund programs to stop drug  trafficking and keep drugs out of our communities.   For more than a decade, Congress has consistently provided funding  above the budget request. It is important that we continue that  support.   Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Thornberry and his hardworking staff that  helped to make this amendment possible. I urge adoption of this  amendment.  [[Page H5850]]
