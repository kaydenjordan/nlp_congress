 Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow politics to get in the way  of patriotism in this House.   We might disagree about healthcare, or we might disagree about tax  reform, but I know that there are patriots in this House who want to  stand together against Russian interference in our elections, patriots  who will record their votes for country above party.   The Senate passed Russia sanctions 98-2. This is not controversial  policy. The controversy, Mr. Speaker, is the refusal to let us vote on  it. If you call the vote, Russian sanctions would pass; they would pass  with an overwhelming bipartisan majority of patriots, those of us who  refuse to let anyone stand in the way of defending our Nation.   When this Nation is under attack, we must come together, Mr. Speaker.  Let us vote to condemn Russian cyber attacks, let us vote to insulate  sanctions from political interference, and let us stand together as  patriots to defend the United States.   Mr. Speaker, bring the Russia sanctions bill, the one that passed the  Senate last week, the one that passed 98-2, bring it to a vote here,  let us pass it, send it to the President's desk, and see whether he  will sign it.                            ____________________
