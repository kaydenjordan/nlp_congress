 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oregon  for his leadership and for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, solar energy is one form of electricity generation that  is growing in the United States. Yet, we do not have the economy of  scale in manufacturing solar systems to meet supply and demand for  industry and consumers.   Solar energy accounts for 3.9 percent of total electricity generation  in 2021 compared to 0.7 percent in 2014. Currently, domestic solar  production is sold out for the next 2 to 3 years.   In order to continue to address China's unfair trading practices and  allow America's solar industry to grow, President Biden's Presidential  Proclamation 10414 declared an emergency with respect to U.S.  electricity generation capacity by implementing a final rule that  permits the importation of select sales on modules without the payment  of antidumping and countervailing duty temporary for 24 months.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
