 Madam President, one topic there is much agreement on is  the benefits of work, and our laws should support those who want to  work. The bill I am introducing today will change Social Security so  that parents and their children will know that working will never  disadvantage them in the future.   Let me explain the problem. Under current law, a child with a  disability that began before age 22 may receive a Social Security  benefit based on the work of a disabled, retired or deceased parent.  Often the child receives this benefit for the rest of their life.  Social Security provides the benefit because the child is usually  dependent on their parents for financial support. The problem is that  the law regards earnings by the child above $1,310 a month as ending  that dependency--even if the child is no longer able to maintain that  level of work in the future. When that dependency ends, the child  ceases to be eligible for the benefit from the parent. Instead, the  child would receive a benefit based on their work. The benefit from the  parent's work is often significantly larger than the child's own  benefit. Because of this policy, parents of children with disabilities  may prevent their child from working at their full potential, fearing  that the work will cause the child to lose out on the larger benefit.  We need to change Social Security to ensure parents and their children  that working will not cause them to be worse off in the future.   To provide that assurance, I am introducing the Work Without Worry  Act. The bill ensures that any individual with a disability that began  before age 22 will receive the larger of the benefit from either their  parent's work or the benefit from their own work. Any earnings from  work--no matter how much--will not prevent the child from receiving a  Social Security benefit from their parent's work as long as the child  is eligible for disability insurance by the same impairment from before  age 22. This legislation would give parents the assurance that their  child with a disability can work without having to worry that the child  will lose out on the full protections that Social Security provides.   I want to thank Kathy Holmquist, President of Pathways to  Independence, Inc. in Portland, Oregon, who has been a leader in my  state helping people with disabilities live and work with dignity.  Kathy contacted me about the need for this legislation and I appreciate  her advocacy and support. Additional thanks to The Arc for the  technical assistance and endorsement of the bill. The bill is also  endorsed by the American Network of Community Options and Resources  (ANCOR), Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) Social  Security Task Force, National Down Syndrome Congress, and The  Association of University Centers on Disabilities. I am grateful that  Social Security Subcommittee Chairman John Larson is introducing the  companion bill in the House of Representatives. The Senate bill is  cosponsored by Senators Cassidy, Brown, Klobuchar, Sanders, Leahy,  Merkley and Casey.   I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.   So ordered                                  S. 2108         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
