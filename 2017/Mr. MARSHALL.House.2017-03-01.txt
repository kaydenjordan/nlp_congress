 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support our President's  plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, but I want to stop and salute  my colleague, my neighbor to the north, General Don Bacon, and the  great State of Nebraska. As I tell people, I have never met a bad  person from Nebraska yet. General Bacon continues to represent his  State in a great manner, and I appreciate his friendship.   Madam Speaker, I rise to support the President's plan to replace the  ACA exchanges and Medicaid expansion. This is simply in a death spiral  right now. It is not working in Kansas. It is not working in the  country. We cannot afford to go in that direction.   I am committed to helping those with long-term health issues, as well  as those that get insurance outside the workplace, to truly find  quality, affordable health care. We are not going to turn our backs on  anybody. We are going to ensure there is a quality transition time for  all patients.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I was talking to constituents and reached  a time when a very personal issue arose.
