 Mr. Speaker, 4 months ago, the news came from Plains,  Georgia, that former President Jimmy Carter, along with his family, had  made the decision to enter hospice care as he approaches the end of his  amazing 90-year-old life.   Interestingly, in the wake of that announcement, accolades came from  all over the world, again reminding us all of the work that President  Carter did during his time in the White House.   He led the way to the Camp David peace accords, which demilitarized  the Sinai Peninsula.   He was a prophet and leader, a visionary in terms of renewable  energy. Under President Carter's leadership, the National Renewable  Energy Laboratory was founded, which to this day still operates in  Colorado, utilizing cutting-edge technology and innovation in terms of  development of renewable energy.   After President Carter left the White House, he founded The Carter  Center in Georgia, which has done amazing work in terms of eradicating  disease in different parts of the world, such as river blindness,  amongst many others.   Mr. Speaker, I represent eastern Connecticut, which, again, has a  special and unique appreciation for former President Jimmy Carter.  After he graduated from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis in  1946 and following two tours as an ensign on surface ships, President  Carter volunteered for the submarine force and was stationed at Naval  Submarine Base New London located in Groton, Connecticut. There,  President Carter received officer training from Groton's Submarine  School and was promoted to lieutenant. This picture shows President  Carter onboard one of those submarines.   In 1952, Carter became part of the legendary Hyman Rickover's new  Office of Naval Reactors, an elite unit which introduced nuclear  propulsion to America's submarine force and revolutionized the reach  and stealth of our fleet.   At that point of his career, Carter was assured a virtually  guaranteed path of promotion and success. However, in October 1953,  Carter's 58-year-old father succumbed to pancreatic cancer. Jimmy  Carter left Active Duty with an honorable discharge after 7 years and 4  months of service, returning to his childhood home in Plains, Georgia,  to run the family farm.   Mr. Speaker, President Carter left Connecticut in 1953, but he never  forgot our State. He proved that in 2005, when the Navy, as part of the  BRAC process, sought to close the Groton Naval Submarine Base and  transfer its fleet of submarines to Kings Bay, Georgia. Despite the  fact that this would help his native State of Georgia, he shocked his  home State and the Navy by publicly opposing this plan. As Anthony  Principi, the Chairman of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission,  stated at the time: Carter's letter citing the value of SUBASE New  London's ``proud submarine heritage'' was a ``key factor'' when he and  the Commission voted 7-1 to reject the Navy's plan.   Eighteen years later, with 16 attack submarines in Groton that are in  active heel-to-toe deployments, the wisdom of that position that he  took certainly has paid off in terms of blindingly obvious facts.   Also, eastern Connecticut is the place where the USS Jimmy Carter,  which was one of the Seawolf-class submarines, was built. Today, it  still operates, doing amazing work as part of that unique three- submarine class that has farther stealth, is able to operate at deeper  depths, travels at higher speeds, and does great work.   Recently, the executive officer of the USS Jimmy Carter, Lieutenant  Commander Jacob Cates, stated: ``As our sailors walk through the ship,  they are met by images representing the Carters' service to our  submarine force, our Navy, and to our country. President Carter has  always been an advocate for those in need. By helping to eliminate  disease, feed the hungry, teach Sunday school, and prevent war,  President Carter has positively impacted countless lives. . . . We are  honored by the fact that we are on the USS Jimmy Carter, and we strive  to prepare for and execute our mission in a manner worthy of President  Carter's legacy.''                                time  1215    Well said, Lieutenant Commander Cates.   Again, as we pass the 4-month mark of President Carter's hospice, I  want him and his family to know that certainly, in eastern Connecticut,  our prayers are with him, as well as our deepest admiration and  feelings, just like Lieutenant Cates whose words were reported just a  few days ago.   Again, we honor his record of service in terms of our Navy, our  country, and his service after the time he spent in the White House  where he did not monetize his service but, again, continued to do great  things to help people in need around the world.                            ____________________
