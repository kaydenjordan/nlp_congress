 Mr. Speaker, actions and results speak louder than words.   In the months since President Biden first called for unity and  bipartisan cooperation, the President's and Speaker's reckless tax-and- spend policies have hurt middle-class families and small businesses.  These are the very people they profess to want to help the most.   For the third straight month, the cost of living in America has  continued to increase, the highest rate of inflation we have witnessed  since 2008.   Compared to last year, gas prices are up 45 percent. Food prices have  increased 2\1/2\ percent. The price of an automobile is up 45 percent  for a used car. Americans know they are paying more for what they need  to live every day while their paychecks have decreased by almost 2  percent.   Americans are spending more and getting less. This inflation is a  hidden tax and a pay cut on every American family. And the effects of  these are felt hardest by our senior citizens and people living on  fixed incomes.   The cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security this year was  barely 1 percent, but rising consumer prices have outpaced that  increase by more than four times.                            ____________________
