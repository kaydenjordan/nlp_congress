 Madam President, as we have just heard, thankfully,  instruction is almost complete on the infrastructure bill. Once  infrastructure passes, it is on to the budget resolution, which lays  the foundation to pass Build Back Better this fall.   The Senate Finance Committee is immersed in this effort. For several  months, we have been working with members of the committee on a host of  proposals that are included in the resolution. These proposals stem  from essential American priorities, making it easier to support a  middle-class family, lowering the cost of healthcare, and addressing  the climate crisis.   When you focus on those key priorities, you build a stronger, more  fair economy and create good-paying jobs. There is going to be a lot to  say about these issues in the hours and days ahead. Tonight, I will  take just a few minutes to discuss the Finance Committee's work and why  the policies are so important. I will begin with support for American  families.   For decades, typical working families in Oregon and across the land  have felt that it has gotten harder and harder for them to climb the  economic ladder. The cost of housing and education have shot into the  stratosphere. Yet wages have largely been stuck on the launch pad.   Despite being the best-educated generation in history, young people  working in America today earn less on average than their parents did at  the same age. It ought to be easier to raise a family in America. That  is why Democrats created the monthly child tax credit expansion as part  of the American Rescue Plan.   The new program, as our colleague from Ohio, Senator Brown, has said,  is Social Security for America's children. Too many kids have been  growing up in poverty--or very, very close to it. The expanded child  tax credit is cutting child poverty by more than half. But so far, it  has only been funded for a year. With this resolution, Democrats are  going to lock in the longest extension possible. Children and parents  need help, and they need the certainty and predictability of a long- term extension.   Together with the help of the HELP Committee, the Finance Committee  is also leading the way for a comprehensive national paid leave  program. This sort of program is long overdue, and there will be a  special focus on our efforts--the HELP Committee and the Finance  Committee--on making sure that it is equitable so that workers of  modest incomes can afford to take paid leave, too.   Every family in American needs reliable income and a roof over their  [[Page S6187]]  heads. Tragically, affordable housing is in short supply, and as the  pandemic proved, it takes just one big economic jolt to put millions  and millions of Americans out of work.   As part of this resolution, the Finance Committee is working on  financial support for America's renters, as well as funding for new  affordable housing. The challenge of affordable housing is no longer  just an issue for a handful of big cities. It is a nationwide concern  that needs creative big solutions.   The Finance Committee is also zeroing in on worker training and  making America's unemployment insurance more reliable and resilient for  those in America who are laid off through no fault of their own.   Having enough affordable housing, job training, and support for those  workers is an economic win-win--good for families, good for businesses  who rely on the strength of the American workforce.   I am going to turn now to healthcare. Democrats have promised to  allow Medicare to negotiate a fair price with Big Pharma. As the  chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I intend to make good on that  promise. Americans have been getting clobbered at the pharmacy window  because Big Pharma holds all the power over drug costs.   With the help of Republicans, Big Pharma is now engaged in classic  hostage taking. They say, We decide the prices you pay or the pipeline  for innovation gets shut down   That is just not a reasonable proposition. Big Pharma doesn't need to  treat Medicare and American taxpayers like their own private ATM, and  we don't need that in order to develop the next blockbuster drug.   We also intend to build on the bipartisan work the Finance Committee  has already done in the last Congress: fighting back against drug  company price gouging, strengthening the Medicare prescription drug  benefit, protecting seniors with an out-of-pocket maximum for their  medications. Lifesaving medications shouldn't be sending anybody in  America into bankruptcy.   We are also going to be updating the Medicare guarantee for the  modern era. The Finance Committee has already put a lot of work into  updating the program, particularly to helping seniors with chronic  conditions. That now makes up the bulk of the program--cancer,  diabetes, heart disease, strokes, COPD. We have made a lot of headway  there.   The next update is giving seniors access to a dental, vision, and  hearing benefit because those also are crucial to the health of  America's elderly.   Back in the days when I was a codirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers,  we said Medicare was just half a loaf. It didn't address those  concerns. Now we have the opportunity to make sure those essential  benefits are available for seniors.   Now, President Biden has called for major investment in home- and  community-based care. And this is another priority for the Senate  Finance Committee. We have been led in this effort by our colleague  from Pennsylvania, Senator Casey, and I have been pleased to assist him  with that effort.   And I believe the distinguished Senate majority leader has a question  that he would like to pose.                              Order of Business     I thank my colleague for that timely information.   Madam President, as I was saying, the Better Care Better Jobs Act,  led by Senator Casey, really fulfills another dream that goes back to  those Gray Panthers days. We know that America's most vulnerable would  always prefer to get quality care at home, where they can be with loved  ones. And yet this country really hasn't fulfilled that dream. Our  legislation for seniors and for those with disabilities will give those  individuals a long overdue opportunity to get good quality care at home  and raise the work wages for the crucial workers who provide this  frontline care.   In this resolution, Democrats will also push to expand on the success  of the Affordable Care Act. Already this year, the Congress expanded  middle-class tax credits for health insurance on a temporary basis. We  wish to make that permanent.   Finally, more than a decade after the Affordable Care Act became law,  there are still holdout Governors who have chosen to deprive vulnerable  people in their States of access to Medicaid. Finance Committee  Democrats are leading the effort to close that coverage gap.                                Climate Change    I want to briefly touch on our work on energy and climate. Life for  Oregonians this summer--and virtually every summer--has become about  record-high temperatures and recordbreaking wildfires. Over one weekend  last month, temperatures outside my house in Southeast Portland were at  108, 110, and then up to 116. And, unfortunately, I just learned that  we are headed for another big, severe hit in terms of weather starting  tomorrow and going through Saturday.   It has gotten so bad that I have been spending time on the phone over  the last few days trying to use a section of our CHRONIC Care Act,  which allows Medicare Advantage plans to cover services essential for  the elderly that didn't used to be considered healthcare, like air  conditioners. And we are getting a good response from the plans. They  know because we are seeing story after story--just another one  yesterday--about seniors, often seniors who own their own homes but  haven't been able to get the air filters and the air conditioners and  the like.   That is what we are faced with now this week in my home State. That  is on top of the severe drought. And that kind of heat adds fuel to the  mega-infernos that we have been seeing.   Now, the Congress has to act to prevent the worst most catastrophic  outcomes of climate change, and the linchpin of the Finance Committee's  effort to tackle climate is the Clean Energy for America Act.   The Finance Committee passed this earlier this year, and for the  Finance Committee, this is the most dramatic proposal passed from the  committee in more than 100 years--more than 100 years. And I am pleased  to see climate's most vigorous champion on the floor here, our friend  from Rhode Island. What we did, with the Senator from Rhode Island's  help, is we took the 44 tax breaks in the Federal Tax Code for energy  and we put them in the dustbin of history--gone, over, lights out--and  we substituted, instead, one for clean energy, one for clean  transportation fuel, and one for energy efficiency.   And then we said for America going forward, we will have a tech- neutral free-market system for energy tied to one very clear measure;  and that is, if you are a renewable energy program or you are a fossil  fuel program, if you reduce carbon emissions--that one standard,  reducing carbon emissions--you are eligible for the tax reductions in  the Senate Finance Committee's proposal.   The proposal also makes electric vehicles more affordable to middle- class families and boosts clean energy manufacturing in everything from  semiconductors to solar components.   An independent analysis of the Finance Committee's energy plan said  it would help create more than 600,000 jobs, and I just believe it  would be a catastrophic mistake to pass that up in order to protect the  status quo. The status quo is an outdated system that basically cuts  special taxpayer-funded checks every year to these powerful interests-- these oil and gas firms. So we are going to talk a lot more about  climate in the days ahead, and I think it is very fitting that Senator  Whitehouse is here.   I will close by way of saying that the proposals that I have just  outlined would be paid for under what we have focused on by restoring  fairness to the Tax Code. I know there has already been some discussion  on the floor of the Senate about how these proposals will be paid for.  We will have a lot of discussion about it, but it sure takes chutzpah  for the Members who spent $2 trillion on the Trump tax handouts to  [[Page S6188]]  the megacorporations and wealthy to come over to the Senate floor and  say it is the Democrats who are fiscally irresponsible.   Senate Democrats in the Biden administration have been working on a  number of changes that can help pay for the proposals in this  resolution. That includes making sure megacorporations, which are  paying less today than they have in decades--are required to pay a fair  share. It includes legislation to close the carried interest loophole  for private equity executives and legislation to close other loopholes  abused by wealthy investors. And Democrats made a promise that nobody  who earns less than $400,000 per year pay more in taxes, and we are  going to stand by that. In fact, the expanded child tax credit is the  largest tax cut for working-class and middle-class families in decades.  And we have proposed as well to cut taxes for Main Street small  businesses from one end of the country to another.    Now, the Republican position has been something else. Their position  is that megacorporations and those at the very, very, very top of the  economic system, basically, shouldn't pay one penny in taxes. That is  unfair. It is wrong. And the American people know it.   We are going to have a lively debate on the resolution, and I am  pleased to be able to stand up with colleagues to make the push, to  make the fight for making it easier to support a middle-class family,  lowering the cost of healthcare, addressing the climate crisis, and  building a stronger, more fair economy.   I yield the floor.
