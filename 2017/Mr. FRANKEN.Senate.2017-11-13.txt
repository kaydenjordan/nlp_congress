 Madam President, I thank Senator Leahy, my good friend.   New developments in the ongoing investigation into Russian  interference in the election have, once again, raised concerns about  the accuracy of statements made by Attorney General Jeff Sessions  during his appearance before the Senate. In light of the Attorney  General's failure to tell the truth about not just his own interactions  with Russian operatives, but also the extent to which he knew about  Russian contacts by other members of the Trump campaign team, I call  upon Attorney General Sessions to return to the Senate Judiciary  Committee and provide us with a complete and accurate accounting of the  facts.   There is no question that Russia--a hostile foreign power--meddled in  our election. Russia carried out this attack in order to undermine  confidence in American democracy, to damage Hillary Clinton's campaign  for President, and to help Donald Trump. Our intelligence agencies have  confirmed this to be true. But in order to keep our country safe and  prevent an attack like this from happening again, the American people  need to understand what happened, including whether members of the  Trump campaign either participated in the Russian operation or turned a  blind eye to it. We need to get to the bottom of this, and to do that,  we need to know the truth.   Regrettably, Attorney General Sessions, our Nation's chief law  enforcement officer, seems to have a real problem telling the truth  about both his own interactions with Russians and those of the larger  Trump campaign team. At his confirmation hearing in January, when I  referenced a breaking report from CNN that there had been a  ``continuing exchange of information during the campaign between  Trump's surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government,'' I  asked him, ``If there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the  Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course  of this campaign, what will you do?'' This was a simple,  straightforward question: ``What will you do?'' The implication was,  would you recuse yourself? But rather than answer that question, then- Senator Sessions said: ``I didn't have--did not have communications  with the Russians.'' That, of course, was not true. It was later  revealed that Attorney General Sessions had met with the Russian  Ambassador at least three times during the campaign. Only after two of  those meetings were uncovered and disclosed--7 weeks later--did  Attorney General Sessions announce his recusal from the Russia  investigation.   After he was confronted with the truth, the Attorney General began to  subtly change his story. His first answer, under oath before the  Judiciary Committee in January, was that he ``did not have  communications with the Russians.'' But after his meetings with the  Russian Ambassador were exposed, Attorney General Sessions began to  qualify his explanations. In a  [[Page S7173]]  statement issued on March 2, the day after his Russian contacts were  revealed, he said: ``I never met with any Russian officials to discuss  issues of the campaign.'' But in July, the Washington Post published a  report suggesting that the Attorney General did discuss campaign issues  with the Russian Ambassador. According to the report, American  intelligence agencies intercepted communications between the Russian  Ambassador and the Kremlin in which the Ambassador described his  conversations with then-Senator Sessions. The two men reportedly talked  about substantive policy matters, including campaign-related issues.   In response to this report, the Justice Department issued a statement  stating that Attorney General Sessions stood by his testimony and again  claimed that the Attorney General did not discuss ``interference with  any campaign or election.''   Each and every time new information comes to light about the Attorney  General's contacts with the Russians, he has responded not by coming  clean and admitting that his initial testimony was inaccurate but by  shifting his story and moving the goalposts. The truth has a nasty  habit of catching up with Attorney General Sessions.   Recently, unsealed court documents revealed that in early October,  former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos pled  guilty to lying to the FBI about his communications with Russian  operatives during the campaign. The unsealed documents also revealed  that Mr. Papadopoulos didn't just meet with Russian operatives during  the campaign, he did so with the express goal of facilitating meetings  between the Russian Government and other Trump campaign officials,  including the candidate himself, Donald Trump. According to the court  documents, Mr. Papadopoulos made no secret of his Russian contacts. He  described his Russian meetings in emails to senior campaign officials,  and according to Mr. Papadopoulos, he discussed his Russian contacts  with then-Senator Sessions directly.   On March 31, 2016, Mr. Papadopoulos attended a meeting of the Trump  campaign's National Security Advisory Committee--a group led by  Attorney General Sessions, who chaired the committee and advised the  candidate on foreign policy and national security matters. The court  documents revealed that after Mr. Papadopoulos introduced himself to  the group, he ``stated, in sum and substance, that he had connections  that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and  President Putin.'' Mr. Papadopoulos made that pitch while seated two  seats to the left of Attorney General Sessions. We know that for a fact  because then-Candidate Trump posted a photo of the meeting on  Instagram. There is then-Senator Sessions, there is George  Papadopoulos, and there is then-Candidate Donald Trump.   After the court documents were unsealed, reports about what happened  at the March 31 meeting began to emerge. Reportedly, Mr. Papadopoulos  spoke about facilitating a meeting between the candidate and the  Russian President for a few minutes. Then-Candidate Trump reportedly  ``listened with interest and asked questions of Mr. Papadopoulos.'' But  according to an adviser present at the meeting, then-Senator Sessions  reacted negatively to Mr. Papadopoulos's idea and reportedly ``shut  [Papadopoulos] down.'' Attorney General Sessions is reported to have  said: ``We're not going to do it'' and ``I'd prefer that nobody speak  about this again.'' If those reports are accurate, they would signal  that then-Senator Sessions reacted quite strongly to the suggestion  that then-Candidate Trump should meet with President Putin. Such a  strong reaction suggests that Attorney General Sessions would have  remembered a conversation like that.   Mr. Papadopoulos wasn't the only member of the campaign to tell  Attorney General Sessions about his Russian contacts. Earlier this  month, Carter Page--yet another former Trump campaign foreign policy  adviser who is under scrutiny for his Russian contacts--testified to  the House Intelligence Committee that he told then-Senator Sessions  about a trip to Russia that Page was going to take in July 2016, where  he met with Russian officials and state-owned businesses.   Nonetheless, time and time again, Attorney General Sessions has  claimed under oath that he was unaware of any communications between  Russians and members of the Trump campaign.   During his confirmation hearing in January, when I mentioned reports  that there was a ``continuing exchange of information during the  campaign between Trump's surrogates and intermediaries of the Russian  government,'' the Attorney General said that he was ``not aware of any  of those activities.''   My good friend Senator Pat Leahy asked him in writing whether he had  ``been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian  government about the 2016 election.'' The Attorney General answered,  simply, ``No.''   In June, Attorney General Sessions appeared before the Senate  Intelligence Committee. In his opening statement, he said: ``I have  never met with or had any conversations with any Russians or any  foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign  or election in the United States. Further, I have no knowledge of any  such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign.''   Senator Risch asked him: ``Did you hear even a whisper, or a  suggestion, or anyone making reference within that campaign that  somehow the Russians were involved in that campaign?'' Attorney General  Sessions replied: ``I did not.''   Senator Joe Manchin asked him: ``Are there any other meetings between  Russian government officials and any other Trump campaign associates  that have not been previously disclosed that you know of?'' Attorney  General Sessions said that he did not recall any such meetings.   Senator Kamala Harris asked him: ``Are you aware of any  communications with other Trump campaign officials and associates that  they had with Russian officials or any Russian nationals?'' Attorney  General Sessions replied: ``I don't recall that.''   Just last month, during the Attorney General's most recent appearance  before the Judiciary Committee, Senator Lindsey Graham asked him: ``Did  anybody in the campaign--did you ever overhear a conversation between  you and anybody on the campaign who talked about meeting with the  Russians?'' This time, Attorney General Sessions replied quite  carefully. He said: ``I have not seen anything that would indicate  collusion with Russians to impact the campaign.''   But when I asked him to clarify his shifting explanations for his own  interactions with the Russian Ambassador, Attorney General Sessions  said that when he first heard about reports of a ``continuing exchange  of information'' between Russians and the Trump campaign, that he was  ``taken aback by this dramatic statement that I'd never heard before  and knew nothing about.'' He said that ``a continuing exchange of  information between Trump's surrogates and intermediaries for the  Russian government . . . did not happen, at least not to my knowledge,  and not with me.''    Describing his January testimony, he said:         [A]nd I said, I'm not aware of those activities. And I       wasn't, and am not. I don't believe they occurred.    Setting aside the convenient amnesia that Attorney General Sessions  seems to experience when asked about his own interactions with Russians  or those he witnessed, I find it disturbing that he went so far as to  claim, as recently as October of this year, that he didn't believe that  any meetings between Trump associates and Russians ever occurred.   Just think about the Trump campaign members we know to have met with  Russians from publicly available information: Carter Page, former  campaign adviser; Paul Manafort, former campaign manager and chief  strategist; Michael Flynn, the disgraced former National Security  Advisor, who in 2015 spoke at a party honoring Russia's state-owned  television network, where he sat next to Vladimir Putin; Jared Kushner,  White House senior adviser and son-in-law; and Donald Trump, Jr., the  President's son. Each and every one of these former members of the  Trump campaign have had unusual contacts with the Russians.   Nonetheless, just last month the Attorney General said:         I'm not aware of those activities. And I wasn't, and am       not. I don't believe they occurred.   [[Page S7174]]     I wanted to say to Attorney General Sessions: Listen, I understand  that you are recused from the Russia investigation, but do you think  that means you are not allowed to watch the news or read a newspaper?  My God, what is going on here?   It is clear that Attorney General Sessions has an ongoing difficulty  remembering his own interactions with Russians and the extent to which  he knew about Russian contacts with other members of the Trump  campaign. As the record demonstrates, Attorney General Sessions has  misrepresented the truth about those contacts to Members of this body  time and time again. The interference by a hostile power in our  Nation's elections represents an attack on democracy itself, and the  inability of our Nation's top law enforcement official to speak with a  clear and consistent voice about what he knows of the Russian operation  is disturbing.   Tomorrow morning, the Attorney General will appear before the House  Judiciary Committee, where I am confident he will once again face  questions about this issue. It is my hope that this time Attorney  General Sessions will answer those questions honestly, but in light of  his misrepresentations to Members of this body, Attorney General  Sessions has an obligation to return to the Senate and explain himself.   Getting to the bottom of Russia's interference in the 2016 election  is a matter of national security, and Attorney General Sessions owes  the American people an explanation about what he knows. He needs to  return to the Senate Judiciary Committee to set the record straight.
