 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Pallone and Mrs.  McMorris Rodgers for their excellent bipartisan leadership in bringing  these bills to the floor. It is the way Congress is supposed to work.   Mr. Speaker, I didn't know anyone who died of a drug overdose when I  was in high school or college. But my two sweet kids can count five or  six of their peers who have been lost to suicide, drug overdose- related. It is heartbreaking. Everybody in this House knows the  horrifying 107,000 losses we have seen from opioid deaths last year.   So I do, in fact, rise in support of H.R. 7666, and to discuss my co- prescribing legislation that was included in this mental health  package. My bill seeks to prevent opioid overdoses through co- prescription. This effort was inspired by my home State of Arkansas,  which is one of 14 States that has co-prescribing now.   Co-prescribing is when a doctor prescribes an opioid overdose  reversal drug like naloxone along with the prescription. My legislation  encourages co-prescribing when medically appropriate. It also supports  existing standing orders to increase laypersons' access to opioid  overdose reversal drugs like naloxone.   Statistical modeling reported to the International Journal of Drug  Policy suggests that high rates of naloxone distribution among  laypersons and emergency personnel could avert 21 percent of opioid  overdose deaths. The majority of overdose death reduction would be as a  result of that increased naloxone distribution to patients.   Mr. Speaker, in 2021, 551 of our citizens of Arkansas are alive today  because of a co-prescription legislation.   Mr. Speaker, the data is clear. Co-prescribing saves lives, and that  is why I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 7666.
