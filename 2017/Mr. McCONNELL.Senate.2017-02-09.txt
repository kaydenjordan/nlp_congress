 Mr. President, I would like to begin this morning by  directing some remarks to the Chair. I would like to recognize an  important milestone of his, but let me start off this way.   The President pro tempore is something of a legend in the Beehive  State. He is a published author. He has gold and platinum albums  hanging on the wall, and he is a great fighter for his home State.   It is not hard to see why Utahns keep sending him back. It is not  hard to see why they chose to make him the longest serving Senator in  Utah history.   Senator Hatch has come a long way from the grinding poverty of his  childhood, and just recently, he passed yet another significant  milestone. He became the longest serving Republican Senator in American  history. Now, that is impressive.   Yet, given what we all know about our colleague, it isn't all that  surprising. Senator Hatch is almost always in the mix on the most  consequential issues of the day. He has been a leading voice on  everything from labor law to judicial nominations, religious freedom to  tax reform. This expansive policy expertise helps explain why his  colleagues chose him to serve as chairman of three major committees:  HELP, Judiciary, and today the powerful Finance Committee.   Senator Hatch remains as much of a key player as ever in advancing  the Senate's agenda. His guidance will be crucial as we continue to  move forward with repealing and replacing ObamaCare, as we turn to tax  reform, and as we consider the President's Supreme Court nominee.   The tasks before us are as diverse as they are challenging, but I  know our colleague from Utah is up to the charge.   The man known as ``Honest Orrin'' is one of the kindest and most  gracious guys you will ever meet. He is a man of deep faith and  principled conviction.   But Senator Hatch is anything but a pushover. He is a fighter for  Utah and for the Nation. He is a proud conservative. He has simply  learned the art of disagreeing--sometimes strongly--without being  disagreeable. That is how you build friendships with both Robert Bork  and Ted Kennedy. That is how you establish yourself as one of the most  productive legislators in modern history, as Senator Hatch has.   He isn't slowing down any time soon. He is actually getting more done  than ever. He just passed dozens of bills out of the Senate last  Congress, and many of them became law. Now our friend, the Finance  Committee chairman, is in a unique position to continue having an  impact on a range of issues, and I am sure he will.   I hope he still finds some time to keep up with his songwriting  career. You should listen to his stuff. It is good. He has penned  everything from a love song on the ``Ocean's Twelve'' soundtrack to his  world-famous Hanukkah song. Senator Hatch would want me to remind you  that it ranked somewhere between the Black Eyed Peas and Lady Gaga on  the hit charts. ``Everyone,'' he says, ``loves my music''--everyone.   You have to admire that confidence.   We look forward to seeing the great things he will be able to achieve  for Utahns, for the country, and for the music industry in the years to  come.   It has been my distinct privilege to recognize our colleague in the  Chair today. I would ask colleagues to join with Senator Hatch's  family--his wife of nearly 60 years, Elaine, their 6 children, 23  grandchildren, and 19 great grandchildren--in marking this important  milestone.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it was great to see our now-former  colleague, Senator Sessions, confirmed as the Nation's 84th Attorney  General yesterday. We all had to watch as he was subjected to a  terrible campaign of unfair and deeply personal attacks. He endured it  all with grace, though, and with the same considerable dignity,  respect, and courtesy we have long  [[Page S976]]  known Senator Sessions for. We are going to miss him in the Senate, but  we couldn't be more proud of him as he begins this new position.                            ____________________     Mr. President, of course the departure of one Senator  typically heralds the arrival of a new one. Today is no different. I  hope colleagues will join me in welcoming Alabama's newest Senator  later today, Luther Strange, who will be sworn in this afternoon.   You won't have much trouble finding him. He will be the tallest guy  around here. Now, you would expect nothing different from a former  college basketball player. Senator Thune and Senator Cotton last night  were somewhat distressed by the notion that they would be replaced by  an even taller Senator, and that will happen later today.   Luther Strange, like the man who preceded him, is a devoted Eagle  Scout. He shares his interest in the law too. He even argued  successfully before the Supreme Court. It is notable experience to  bring to any job, especially this one, and especially at a time when we  are actively involved in the process of considering a new--and superbly  qualified--nominee to the Court.   We are looking forward to the contributions that Alabama's newest  Senator will make. He will have the chance to get started right away.  We have important work to do, and that starts with confirming more of  the qualified Cabinet nominees who are before us.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the nominee currently before us is the  President's pick for Health and Human Services Secretary, Congressman  Tom Price, a physician. Dr. Price knows more about health care policy  than just about anyone. He doesn't just understand health care policy  as a policymaker--although he does deeply--he also understands it as a  practicing physician. He gets the real-world impact.   He has a clear-eyed view about Washington's capacity to do great  harm, even with the best of intentions, just as he is excited about his  potential to do great good.   He can start having a positive impact almost as soon as he is  confirmed. He can start bringing stability to the health care markets  ObamaCare has harmed. He can start bringing relief to the families  ObamaCare has hurt. I know he is ready to get to work with Congress to  move toward truly patient-centered health care--care that prioritizes  the needs of patients over the needs of Washington.   The American Medical Association supports him and says: ``[H]is  service as a physician, state legislator and member of the U.S.  Congress provides a depth of experience to lead HHS.''   The Association of American Medical Colleges supports him and says:  ``[H]e will bring a thoughtful, measured approach to tackling the wide  range of issues affecting the nation's health.''   And the Healthcare Leadership Council couldn't be more enthusiastic.  ``It is difficult,'' they said, ``to imagine anyone more capable of  serving his nation as the Secretary of Health and Human Services than  Congressman Tom Price.''   That is high praise. It also happens to be accurate.   The American people need Dr. Tom Price applying his practical  knowledge as a doctor and as a legislator at the Department of Health  and Human Services, an agency in great need of new leadership.   This job is a big one. There is no doubting that. It requires  overseeing some of the Nation's most important programs, like Medicare  and Medicaid, and helping to protect public health at the CDC and  helping to find cures at NIH and helping to ensure at the FDA that  those cures can make it to the patients.   It is a big job, but Tom Price is the right man for it. We shouldn't  wait a moment longer to confirm him. As soon as we do, we will turn to  the nomination of Steve Mnuchin to lead the Department of the Treasury.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I will have more to say about Mr.  Mnuchin tomorrow, but let me say this. For the last 8 years, Americans  had to endure an economy that failed to live up to its potential. Part  of the problem was the regulatory avalanche of the last administration.  It is time to finally move toward a modern regulatory framework  instead, one that appropriately manages risks while promoting growth  and job creation. The President has started providing relief already  that will move us toward that goal. Steve Mnuchin can help do more.   He also has an important role to play in the effort to make our tax  system simpler and more conducive to the kind of economic growth and  job creation we should all want. It won't be easy to get that done. We  need someone like Steve Mnuchin working with both parties to make it  happen.   The Treasury nominee is smart, capable, and he has impressive private  sector experience. We need him confirmed as soon as possible so he can  begin to tackle these challenges and reverse the last 8 years of  economic heartache.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S.  Res. 57, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, for the information of all of our  colleagues, including our newest colleague from Alabama, who is going  to have a very long first day here, if all time is used postcloture on  the Price nomination, the Senate will have two votes at 2 a.m. Senators  should be prepared to stay in session and take those votes tonight. If  an agreement is reached to yield back time and to cast those votes  earlier, we will notify Members the moment such an agreement might be  reached.   I thank my friend from Maryland.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote on the  nomination.    I move to table the motion to reconsider.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call be waived.    Mr. President, for the information of all Senators,  the Senate will debate the Mnuchin nomination tomorrow. The next series  of votes will occur on Monday at around 7 p.m.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, following leader remarks on Monday February  13, there be up to 7 hours of debate remaining on the Mnuchin  nomination; and that following the disposition of the Mnuchin  nomination, the Senate proceed to the consideration of the following  nomination: Executive Calendar No. 17, David Shulkin to be Secretary of  Veterans Affairs.

I further ask unanimous consent that the time until 11 a.m. be equally  divided in the usual form; and that following the use or yielding back  of time, the Senate vote on the nomination with no intervening action  or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table; that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action; that no further motions be in order;  and that any statements relating to the nomination be printed in the  Record.    Mr. President, the next vote will be the last vote of  the evening, and we will be back voting Monday night.                                CLOTURE MOTION
