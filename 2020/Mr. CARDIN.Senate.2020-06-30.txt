 Mr. President, shortly, I am going to make a UC request.  I am not going to do it now because we are still working out some of  the specific details, and Senator Scott will be on the floor when I do  that, but let me just explain while I am on the floor.   My colleague Senator Shaheen, a key member of the Small Business  Committee and one of the negotiators on the small business package, is  on the floor, and we are joined by Senator Schumer, who has been a real  champion in making sure we get help to America's small businesses. I  want to acknowledge the work of Senator Coons, who I expect will be on  the floor a little later. One of our key cosponsors in the next round  of aid is Senator Rosen.   I want to acknowledge the cosponsors of the unanimous consent request  legislation, including myself and Senator Schumer, Senator Shaheen,  Senator Coons, Senator Rosen, and Senator Collins.   I also want to acknowledge that this is bipartisan. I talked to  Senator Rubio, and he has informed me that this has cleared the  hotline, so we are hopeful that we will get this UC done today.   As we are waiting for the paperwork to get to us, let me just explain  what the UC does before I make the UC request.   The authority of the Small Business Administration to approve any  more Paycheck Protection Program loans expires at midnight tonight.  With the deadline we established when we passed the CARES Act in  March--that was a reasonable assumption in March. We thought that by  the end of June, our economy would be back on track and we would not  need to have additional applications after that date.   Well, a lot has changed since March of this year, and we recognized  that when we passed the bipartisan Flexibility Act. It changed the time  period for use of PPP funds from 8 weeks to up to 24 weeks and changed  the allocation that Treasury had established of using 75 percent of the  funds for payroll to 60 percent of the funds for payroll. We recognize  that times have changed.   The PPP program is extremely popular. As of 5 o'clock tonight, $520.6  billion of forgivable loans have been issued under the PPP program to  4,856,647 small businesses. Quite frankly, these are small businesses  that very well may not have been here today but for the PPP program. We  kept them alive, and we have saved jobs. The Labor Department's May  estimate of 2.5 million jobs added--a large number as a result of the  PPP funds.   Small businesses need additional help. They need additional help.  Times have changed. We know, for example, that in the State of Texas  and Florida, we are seeing a record number of infections just now. The  need is still there. We have mandatory closures of bars in those  States. We certainly didn't anticipate that when we passed the  legislation last March. Small businesses need additional help. We don't  want to close the door on the PPP program.   The good news is that we have $130 billion remaining in the coffers  for the PPP program. So the resources are there, the need is there, and  we just need to change the date. So the UC I am going to be making in a  few moments would change the deadline for filing for a PPP loan from  June 30 to August 8. We picked August 8 because that is the end of the  next work period. We certainly hope that by then, we are going to have  the next stimulus package signed by the President of the United States.   I must tell you, we need to do more than just extend this date; we  need round two of help for small businesses. I am very pleased that I  have had the help of Senator Shaheen and Senator Coons. We filed  legislation that targets the next round. The first round was to get  money out quicker to save small businesses. The second round needs to  be targeted to those small businesses that really need the help. That  is why our legislation targets it to small businesses under 100 workers  and those that have economic needs that can be demonstrated and helping  particularly the underserved, underbanked community.   I was very pleased that this type of a second round was acknowledged  by Secretary Mnuchin at an oversight hearing before the Small Business  and Entrepreneurship Committee. There have been good-faith negotiations  with Senator Rubio. We worked on this bipartisan issue. I think we can  get it done today.   I am disappointed, though, that we are going to go into the recess  scheduled for the end of this week. We are not coming back until July  20, and small businesses are going to run out of money during that  period of time. The small businesses that have used up their PPP money  and need additional help are not going to get our attention until we  come back July 20. That is wrong.   We should have taken up this bill by now. The House passed the Heroes  Act months ago. We should have been taking this up now. As I said,  small businesses have exhausted a lot of their PPP funds, and we need  to act.   Tonight, we will have the opportunity to extend the June 30 deadline  [[Page S4024]]  by the UC request. I am pleased that we are likely to be able to get  that done. The last day that we anticipate, the end of the work  period--the next work period--we will have time to work together, act  together, and hopefully pass additional bipartisan help for small  businesses in this country. Small businesses are the growth engine, job  creator, innovator, and we need to act, and we need to act tonight.   With that in mind, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  the immediate consideration of S. 4116, introduced earlier today. I  further ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read a third  time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object to modifying  the amendment, under my reservation, let me first thank the Senator  from Florida. I agree with his concerns, and that is why we are looking  at additional help for small businesses.   The legislation that I filed with Senator Shaheen and Senator Coons  includes a needs-based approach to the next round of PPP loans because  we are going to need to do more.   Secretary Mnuchin acknowledged that we are going to have to do more,  but he also acknowledges that we can target that aid.   The first round was aimed at getting money out quickly, and we could  not have gotten money out quickly if we had underwriting standards that  required the needs-based as in the Senator's amendment.   So here is the dilemma that the Senator is offering. We are not  looking at this PPP-2 program. This is the original program that we  want to keep alive as we negotiate the next round.   So if the Senator's amendment were adopted, you could have a bar  owner in Maryland who has been closed, who has been able to get the PPP  program, but now you have a bar owner in Florida who just recently got  notice that they have to close and wants to apply for a PPP loan and is  not going to be able to get it in a timely way because they are going  to have to establish--maybe prospectively--the loss of revenue after  guidelines are given, et cetera.   That is not fair. It is not fair to treat one small business of one  State differently than we treat a small business in another State.   The second point I would point out to the Senator is this: As we have  looked at the evolution of the PPP program, the late applications,  those that are filing now, they are invariably the smallest of the  small businesses, the ones in the greatest need. So why would we want  to change the rules for those that had the greatest need when we didn't  do it on the original round?   So I would just urge my colleague: Let's work together. I assure you  that we want to do this in the next round. I am disappointed we are not  doing it this week before we adjourn, but that is a decision made not  to bring up the next stimulus package at this point. I would urge my  colleague to recognize that this would create an administrative burden,  an inequity, and it is not really germane to what we are trying to do  in moving forward with the second round of the PPP program.   With that, I would object to modifying my unanimous consent request.    Mr. President, let me thank my friend from Florida for  allowing this to go forward. I think we do share the same objective. We  want  [[Page S4025]]  to make sure the money gets out, and we also want to make sure that  those who really need it get the funds.   I assure the Senator, I would be happy that we could bring up the  second round this week, but let's make sure we work together with your  colleague from Florida, Senator Rubio. We have been in constant  contact, and we hope to have a bill ready.   I want to acknowledge on the floor Senator Schumer, who has been our  leader on our side to make sure that we really target the help for the  small businesses that really need it.   I see on the floor Senator Collins, who was part of the negotiating  team that was able to come up with the PPP program--incredible  contributions. Senator Shaheen was also part of that negotiating team-- with Senator Rubio--that came up with the PPP program, and I thank you  for your support on this unanimous consent request.   Senator Coons, as I have already mentioned earlier, is one of the key  members of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, one of  our cosponsors of round 2 of relief to small businesses.   With that, I yield the floor to my colleague from New Hampshire.    Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Coons for his  comments and Senator Shaheen. Senator Coons is absolutely right. There  are many reasons why we needed to bring up the next stimulus package  before we go on recess. The issue of the State and local governments  are real.   I have heard from Governor Hogan of Maryland. I have heard from Mayor  Young of Baltimore City. I have heard from our county execs. Their  fiscal year begins at midnight tonight. They have hundreds of millions  of dollars of revenue shortfalls that they have to make up because they  have to have a balanced budget. That is going to mean they are going to  have to consider layoffs. It means it will be difficult to open up  schools in the fall. And the list goes on and on and on. They need help  from us.   The CARES Act was important. It did provide some meaningful help, but  the CARES Act dealt with the direct cost to State and local government  of taking care of COVID-19, not the revenue loss as a result of income  tax revenues down, as a result of the special fees that local  governments receive for parking or for rental cars or hotel taxes. We  never made up any of that. They have to balance their budget. We needed  to act on that.    Senator Coons is absolutely right when he talks about the fact that  in March, when we passed the CARES Act, we thought that the unemployed  would have jobs available, certainly, by July, but that is not going to  be the case for millions of Americans.   We are going to have to do something about the expiring unemployment  insurance, and we have to deal with election security. There are a lot  of issues.   We have to deal with pre-K through 12 and higher education. They have  direct costs that have yet to be met. They are in danger of not being  able to safely reopen in the fall, and we have to act to help them in  that regard. I just really want to underscore the point that Senator  Coons made.   I want to thank Senator Coons, and I want to thank Senator Shaheen  because we have put out there for the public to take a look at what the  second round of help for small businesses will look like. We put a  priority, as I think we should, on the smaller of the small businesses,  first, by eligibility--100 employees or less--and, second, by  guaranteed set-asides for those that are 10 employees or less. We have  a needs-based approach, 50 percent loss in revenue as a result of  COVID-19, and we make it easier for the smaller small businesses to be  able to get loans by making it more financially rewarding for the  financial institutions to make those loans. We have stepped up to say  that this is what we need to look at.   I must tell you that we are in a pretty good position in the Small  Business Committee because we have open dialogue and negotiations.  Today, on two occasions, I was in contact with the chairman of the  committee, and we are negotiating this and we will be ready. We want  you to know that we put out our proposal, and I want to thank Senator  Coons and Senator Shaheen for joining me in that effort.   I would hope lightning could strike and perhaps we could bring up the  bill this week and get something done. I think that is highly unlikely,  knowing the leader's schedule for this week. That is wrong. He should  have acted before the July recess. Let's hope we can use the 2 weeks  during the recess to put together a bill that cannot only pass the  Senate and the House but be signed by the President, to help not just  small businesses, not just State and local governments, but all the  people in this country get through this horrible pandemic.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, as we grapple with the manifestations of  racism and intolerance in our society here in the United States, it is  important to remember that we have friends and allies across the globe  who face similar challenges. They support U.S. leadership and seek our  engagement on issues of common concern.   Throughout my career in Congress in both the House and Senate, I have  been fortunate to participate in the Parliamentary Assembly of the  Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe--OSCE PA--a  critical venue for international engagement. I have served as the OSCE  PA Special Representative on Anti-Semitism, Racism, and Intolerance for  the last 5 years, after serving as a committee officer and then a vice  president of the assembly. It has been a rewarding experience  [[Page S4028]]  working with like-minded parliamentarians from Canada and across Europe  to advocate for human rights and to promote democratic development.   Of course, as we engage on these issues, we must be candid about our  own shortcomings, which I did in a recent web dialogue with dozens of  parliamentarians from across the OSCE region on the impact of the  current pandemic on diverse societies. I noted how minority and  immigrant communities are more vulnerable to the harmful impacts of the  pandemic, in part due to past inequalities that inadequate healthcare  and economic responses are exacerbating. I also raised the efforts to  respond to the killing of George Floyd, including reforms designed to  rebuild trust between police officers and the communities they are  sworn to protect and serve.   Following this web event, Dr. Hedy Fry, the head of the Canadian  Delegation to the OSCE PA, contacted me. She shared with me an opinion  editorial she wrote which describes, in equally candid terms, how the  events in the United States have made Canadians more aware of  inequalities and injustices in their own country and the need for  Canada to respond appropriately. Her remarks illustrate that the U.S.  can exercise global leadership by serving as an example of self- examination followed by corrective action. If we do it, we can  encourage other countries to do the same.   I want to thank our friends in the Canadian Parliament for their  collaboration in the OSCE PA and support for U.S. initiatives. I am  grateful that we have worked so closely together over the years toward  the common goal of making this world a better place, and I look forward  to our continued collaboration. I would like to share Dr. Fry's remarks  with my Senate colleagues; therefore, I ask unanimous consent to have  her op-ed printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                House of Commons,                                              Canada, June 25, 2020.        The terrible acts of violence against Black persons in the       United States has brought racism, to the forefront, in       Canada. But, racism has also been systemic, though insidious       here, for generations. Not as openly violent, as in the US,       but present nonetheless, in our institutions, workplaces,       schools and society.        Over the last 30 years, Canada enacted progressive       legislation to protect minorities: the Charter of Rights and       Freedoms, Employment Equity, the Citizenship Act, the       Canadian Human Rights Act, the Multiculturalism Act, and       anti-hate laws.        Yet data shows that Indigenous peoples still have the       highest suicide rate, poorest health outcomes, and most       incarcerations; that visible minorities, despite education,       are under employed and under-paid; that Black men are carded       and suspected of criminality.        Racism is rooted in colonialism. Colonialism sought to tame       the savages, to bring them to Christianity, to de-culturalize       native populations ``for their own good''. It also       stereotyped them as inferior, less educable, more ``savage       and untamed'' in their reactions and therefore less       trustworthy and prone to criminality.        Stereotyping is the root of xenophobia.        Residential schools in Canada, apartheid in South Africa,       and slavery in the Americas were all based on the presumption       that Native peoples were one step above animals, barely. The       so-called ``science'' of eugenics, in the early 20th century,       confirmed this.        The bubbling cauldron of anti-Black violence and xenophobia       has historically never been far from the surface in the USA       and is entrenched in all of its institutions.        In Canada, the stereotyping and institutional bias is more       insidious and subtle. Though the violence against Black       communities is most apparent in some areas of Canada. The       violence against Indigenous peoples is evidenced across the       country and this age of ubiquitous cameras record and bring       them to light.        Systemic racism is never far beneath the surface. COVID 19       exposed this. Crisis brings anger and fear. It cracks the       thin veneer of tolerance that seems to exist in quiet, polite       times. It seeks to blame ``the other''. Fear caused the       eruption of anti-Chinese hate in Canada and amplified the       reality of Black and Indigenous lives.        We are all shaken and empathetic.        But our denial and ignorance can no longer stand.        We must listen and act. We need to collect disaggregated       data, based on ethnicity, Indigenous status, religion, race,       color, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression,       age, and disability. We must match that data against       employment, incarceration, health outcomes, socioeconomic       status and participation in the social political, economic       and cultural life of our nation. This is called getting to       the factual evidence.        We must use that evidence to educate the public and teach       unvarnished history, in our schools. It will then become       apparent that the Chinese and Japanese have been in British       Columbia for 160 years; that the Chinese built a railroad       that united our nation from sea to sea; that they, the Sikhs       and Indigenous peoples fought in WWI and II; that they       returned to face discrimination and hardship, but stayed and       built a nation.        We must teach about the internment of Ukrainians, the       arrest of Italians, and the antisemitism that turned away       Jews from our shores during World War II. We must acknowledge       the ugliness of our past and learn from it.        We must then take steps to train and sensitise our       institutions; we must make them welcoming to the diversity of       Canadians that live here. We must set policies, programs and       measurable goals to eradicate systemic discrimination. We       must track our progress and report to Canadians. We must,       finally, aim for an inclusive society that will respect and       harness the benefits which diversity brings.        It is a long road. But if we begin now, it is a worthy goal       to show the world that it is possible to put aside conflict       and live together, as many different peoples, in peaceful       coexistence.        In order to build a strong, peaceful prosperous nation,       everyone must belong--and everyone must build it together.            Stay well,                                 The Honourable Hedy Fry, P.C., MP,      Vancouver Centre.                            ____________________
