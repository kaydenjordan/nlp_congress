 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the  Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, which ensures fairness and  safety in girls' athletics.   Our daughters' opportunities to compete in athletics and their safety  at school have been threatened by the radical left's disturbing trend  of allowing biological men to compete with them and use the girls'  locker room.   Earlier this month, the world watched in horror as leftwing rioters  attacked a young woman named Riley Gaines and held her kidnapped  against her will simply because she was speaking out to defend girls'  sports. This week, the House will stand with Riley and all young women  and girls who deserve the full protection of Title IX.   The Biden administration has been clear. They want men competing  against our daughters, and they want to force schools to allow  biological men to change and shower with our daughters in the girls'  locker rooms. This is wrong.   Proverbs 31:8 reminds us that we must speak up for those who cannot  speak for themselves and defend the rights of those in need.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the  Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act and stand up for the rights  and the safety of our daughters.
