 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the College  Affordability Act, a comprehensive overhaul of our higher education  system that will lower the cost of college and improve higher education  for students of all backgrounds, because right now students are paying  increasingly more for an education that is giving them less.   I know that because I have heard it. I have heard from constituents  in my district that we need to do better when it comes to the rising  cost of tuition and the overall quality of higher education.   That is why I am taking action. Since coming to Congress, I have  worked closely with my colleagues on the Education and Labor Committee  to lead four pieces of legislation that will be included in this act.   The legislation will expand educational opportunities for all  individuals impacted by the criminal justice system, dedicate more  resources for prevention and treatment of alcohol and substance abuse  on college campuses, strengthen grants for teachers and school leaders  around recruitment and retention, and establish a commission to study  mental health issues facing college students.   These measures as well as others are what make the College  Affordability Act a down payment on our higher education system that  just makes sense.   I urge swift passage for my colleagues in the committee today, and I  hope we can move this bill to the floor and the President's desk even  faster. As my good friend, Chairman Elijah Cummings, said: Our children  are messengers we send to the future we will never see.   It is time to invest in their future and give all Americans the good,  quality higher education that they deserve.                            ____________________
