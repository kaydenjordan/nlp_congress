 Mr. President, will the Senator from Illinois yield to an  inquiry?    Mr. President, I am told that Speaker Pelosi has not sent  a bill to the Senate yet. Is that your understanding?    Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry.   Has the bill bent sent by Speaker Pelosi to the Senate yet?    It is probably tough for us to vote on a bill that hasn't  arrived yet.    I don't disagree with you that we should take it up.    Thank you, Mr. President.
