 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the  remarkable life led by Mr. Cullan Brown from Eddyville, Kentucky.   Mr. Brown was a student athlete at the University of Kentucky where  he excelled on the golf course. He passed away in August at the age of  20 after battling a rare form of bone cancer.   A young man with a love for golf, he racked up numerous  accomplishments over his young career. He won the individual Kentucky  High School Athletic Association State Championship, Lyon County's  first State championship in any sport.   Mr. Brown was a highly ranked recruit nationwide in 2018 and could  have played golf at many different schools, but he decided to commit to  the University of Kentucky, saying: ``I love the State of Kentucky and  its people.''   Cullan Brown would go on to have a successful freshman year at the  University of Kentucky, including being named to the All-Southeastern  Conference freshman team.    Even more impressive than his success on the golf course, friends,  coaches, and others have widely noted that this young man had a love  for the people around him and impacted many lives with his wonderful  personality.   Cancer takes a harsh toll on individuals and families. One life lost  to this disease is too many. It is critical for our Nation to double  down on efforts to fight cancer, including expanding research efforts  aimed at developing effective treatments and cures.   Cullan Brown was a force for good whose courageous battle inspired  many. His family and friends continue to be in our thoughts and  prayers.                           Honoring Jeremy Creason     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Mayfield Fire  Department Chief Jeremy Creason for recently being named the Kentucky  League of Cities 2020 City Employee of the Year.   Mr. Creason joined the Mayfield Fire Department in Graves County in  2008, serving as a firefighter and paramedic. He quickly rose through  the ranks to become chief at the age of 34.   At a time when essential workers have made numerous adjustments to  serve their communities, Mr. Creason's dedication to Mayfield has been  on full display. When personal protective equipment was scarce, he  found some for his fellow firefighters to ensure they remained safe.  This, along with other precautions he took, have proven to be  effective, with no positive cases within the Mayfield Fire Department  personnel.   In addition to taking good care of his staff, Mr. Creason met with  local businesses and churches to advise them on capacity seating in  their buildings and regulations for reopening. His due diligence is a  shining example of caring for others and taking proper precautions to  safely reopen.   I am honored to recognize Jeremy Creason for this award and his  excellent service and commitment to his community.                                time  1930                       Honoring Neighborhood Pet Stores     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the support  neighborhood pet stores provide for our local communities.   Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, small businesses have been slammed  economically, but these dire circumstances have provided us with an  opportunity to raise awareness of the tremendous impact local pet  stores have on our communities.   As we all know, our animals serve as an extension of our families and  often provide a source of friendship and comfort for both adults and  children. During the pandemic, that companionship has become even more  paramount as pet owners are spending significantly more time with their  pets.   Local pet stores establish personal relationships with the community,  whether those relationships are formed through employees providing  expert advice and helping customers buy the correct product for their  animals or helping to raise money for the local humane society.   These small businesses make a huge impact on the lives of our  animals, and they become part of our families' lives, watching the pets  grow over the years and serving as a go-to resource time and time  again.   I join with everyone in honoring the extraordinary work neighborhood  pet stores do to make a difference in our pets' lives. I am honored to  represent them as they continue to build relationships throughout the  First Congressional District of Kentucky and across the United States.          Congratulations to Marie Gatton Phillips Elementary School     Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate Marie Gatton  Phillips Elementary School in Sacramento, Kentucky, for receiving the  distinction of a 2020 National Blue Ribbon School by the U.S.  Department of Education. The award is based on a school's overall  academic performance or progress in closing achievement gaps among  student subgroups.   I am grateful to the hardworking faculty and staff at Marie Gatton  Phillips Elementary School for their commitment to the betterment of  their students and the local community. Their passion for creating a  positive and supportive learning environment helps each student develop  essential academic and social skills.   These skills help them succeed both inside and outside the classroom,  placing them on a path to become leaders in their communities for years  to come.   At a time when schools are working tirelessly to adjust to present  challenges, I am proud to congratulate you all on this terrific  achievement. Your faculty, staff, and students are very deserving of  this honor.   I look forward to continued success from Marie Gatton Phillips  Elementary School. All of McLean County, the First Congressional  District, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky should be very proud of this  recognition.                           Honoring Roger Holloway     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Roger Holloway of  Hopkinsville, Kentucky, a veteran and one of the last Buffalo Soldiers  alive, who is on a mission to keep their legacy front and center.   Mr. Holloway enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1950 at the age of 17,  serving in the Vietnam and Korean wars where he rose in the ranks to be  named a corporal and squad leader.   At that time, the all-Black regiment was segregated from the general  Army that would soon be integrated in 1951. In 1953, Mr. Holloway took  a break from service, but soon reenlisted in 1954 and served in the  airborne division until his retirement in 1972.   Mr. Holloway is now on a mission, a new mission, spreading the word  to keep the stories of the Buffalo Soldiers alive.   In 1866, Congress passed the Army Organization Act, creating the  Buffalo Soldiers, a unit composed of all African-American troops. The  Buffalo Soldiers mainly helped to protect the western frontier after  the American Civil War and later fought in the Spanish-American War and  the Korean war.   The Buffalo Soldiers were a pivotal part of our Armed Forces,  including working to secure the first U.S. victory in Korea on July 20,  1950.   I am honored to share the exceptional history of the Buffalo Soldiers  on the House floor today. Throughout decades of service, they provided  much-needed support, not only for our military but for all Americans. I  am proud of all of their accomplishments.  [[Page H5101]]    I am honored to recognize Mr. Holloway and the Buffalo Soldiers for  their exceptional service to our Nation. I especially want to thank Mr.  Holloway for being an exceptional leader in his community and the First  Congressional District of Kentucky.                Congratulations to Starfish Orphan Ministries     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Starfish  Orphan Ministries in Paducah, Kentucky, for being selected as an Angels  in Adoption Honoree by the 2020 Congressional Coalition on Adoption  Institute.   The Angels in Adoption program honors individuals and organizations  focusing on adoptions, permanency, and child welfare issues. I was  proud to nominate this outstanding organization for this award, which  they have gone above and beyond to achieve.   The Starfish Orphan Ministries supports children going through the  foster care and adoption processes, both in my district and around the  world.   One way they help children is through Kendra's Kloset. This program  serves single-parent households, foster parents, and teens aging out of  the system by providing them with clothing and furniture. These and  other necessities allow children to become more settled in their new  home environments.   In addition to serving Kentucky children, Starfish Ministries has  expanded the footprint of their ministry through international mission  trips. They regularly take high school students on mission trips to  Central and South America, giving young people hands-on exposure  to community outreach programs, which make an extraordinary difference  in countless lives.    Thanks to their tireless efforts to promote the well-being of  children, I can think of no organization more deserving of this  recognition.   Congratulations, again, to Starfish Orphan Ministry of Paducah.                       Honoring the Late Trevor Gosser     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor my friend, the late  Trevor Gosser from Russell County, Kentucky, who tragically passed away  last month.   I first met Trevor on Gosser Ridge in Russell County when I was out  campaigning with farmers. I hired Trevor at the Kentucky Department of  Agriculture when I served as Kentucky's Commissioner of Agriculture.   He quickly demonstrated a strong work ethic and high level of  dedication to his work. He also became a good friend of mine, and I  offer heartfelt condolences to his family.   Trevor was a devoted husband, father, and employee who was able to  get along with everyone.   I join with everyone throughout Russell County and the First  Congressional District of Kentucky in keeping his family in our  thoughts and prayers.                        Honoring the Late Ted Roberts     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the late Mr. Ted  Roberts, a Paducah, Kentucky, whose life was dedicated to public  service in his community.   Throughout his job at the United States Postal Service, Mr. Roberts  rose through the ranks to become the first and only African American to  hold the position of postmaster for the United States Postal Service in  this tristate region.   In addition to serving as postmaster, he served as a member of the  Postmaster General Speaker's Bureau in 1991 and a member of the  National League of Postmasters of the United States.   Mr. Roberts' community service extends beyond the Postal Service. He  was a part of the Paducah mayor's Task Force on Human Rights;  commissioner of the Paducah Human Rights Commission; vice president of  the Paducah, Kentucky, NAACP chapter; and an associate member of the  Fraternal Order of Police. Throughout these roles, Mr. Roberts proved  himself to be an integral part of his community.   In addition to serving his community, Mr. Roberts served his country  in the Navy during the Vietnam war.   I am honored to recognize Mr. Roberts, whose distinguished record of  public service is remarkable.   Thank you for being an exceptional leader with unparalleled  contributions to the city of Paducah and all of west Kentucky.                           Honoring Richard Dicken     Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Richard Dicken from my  hometown of Tompkinsville, Kentucky. Richard retired from TVA, where he  was a well-respected engineer.   To demonstrate both his work ethic and his entrepreneurial spirit,  Richard began building houses while working full time at TVA.   Upon his retirement from public work, Richard returned home to Monroe  County and started four credible businesses, which employed hundreds of  people: Dicken Construction, Southern Kentucky Hardwood Flooring,  Country Boy Pellets, and a lumber company.   Richard told people to ``always keep busy and work hard for anything  and everything you want in life.''   Richard Dicken passed away unexpectedly last month. He is survived by  his spouse, Stephanie Dicken, four stepchildren, one brother, and two  sisters.   He was a true Monroe County success story who will be deeply missed.                   Supreme Court Nominee Amy Coney Barrett     Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak on the importance of  ensuring that the Supreme Court, the highest court in our land, is  armed with Justices who will respect our government's guiding light,  the Constitution.   There is a reason that my friends on the left are so heartbroken by  the possibility of President Trump's outstanding nominee to the Supreme  Court being confirmed. Unfortunately, they see judges as lawmakers, not  merely interpreters of the law, as outlined in the Constitution. Any  judge who rightfully stands in the way of judicial activism is a  barrier to their agenda.   They want policy to be made by unelected black robes, not through the  leaders we elect at the ballot box. Democrats' only hope for forcing  fringe policies on the American people is for judges to sign off on  unconstitutional executive actions, which we saw President Obama  repeatedly pursue as a substitute for congressional approval.   Judge Amy Coney Barrett is an exceptional nominee who brings a wealth  of experience from her time in both the private sector and on the  Federal bench. She was confirmed to her current position on the Seventh  Circuit Court of Appeals by a bipartisan vote, including with the  support of Hillary Clinton's 2016 running mate. Everyone who has spent  time around her has praised her qualifications and devotion to the law.   Additionally, she clerked for the late Justice Scalia and has pledged  to follow his philosophy of following the words of the Constitution,  not legislating from the bench.   Being extremely qualified and devoted to the Constitution is  apparently a red flag for Washington Democrats. They are going to  desperate lengths to stop her confirmation, including attacking her  faith and threatening to impeach President Trump for following his  constitutional duty to nominate a replacement for the late Justice Ruth  Bader Ginsburg.   The American people put President Trump and the Republican Senate in  charge to nominate and confirm judges to the Federal bench. President  Trump was incredibly transparent about his plans, even putting out a  list of candidates he would choose from. And the American people  elected him to do just that.   I look forward to seeing the Senate fulfill their constitutional duty  and confirm the President's very qualified and capable nominee.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.    Madam Speaker, I want to conclude by talking about the  election process that we are about to face. Recent news stories from  across America highlight the fundamental problem with blue States  implementing universal mail-in voting.   Now, let me explain the difference between absentee voting and  universal mail-in voting. Absentee voting is where a registered voter  requests a ballot. Universal mail-in voting is where everyone on the  voter rolls receives ballots unsolicited.   With respect to mail-in voting, we have uncertainty, delay, and  inaccuracy. These are the consequences of the  [[Page H5102]]  universal mail-in scheme that threaten the integrity of American  elections.   As ranking member of the Oversight and Reform Committee, I recently  published a report, alongside Congressman   Jim Jordan, that laid out  these threats to our elections. Simply put, Democrat States are  changing the rules in the middle of the game.   There is nothing wrong with absentee voting. Absentee voting is a  time-honored tradition where voters request a ballot if they are unable  to vote in person. Expanded absentee voting is appropriate for those  who don't feel safe because of the COVID-19 pandemic. I support  absentee voting.   However, blue State Governors have taken mail-in voting to a whole  new level. Their brilliant idea is to mail out ballots to everyone on  the voter rolls, which are notoriously inaccurate.                                time  1945    They include people who have moved and even died, creating a  situation ripe for fraud as millions of unrequested ballots go out to  households. Who lives in those households? We don't know.   Look no further than my home State of Kentucky, where former  Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes was sued for the State's  failure to maintain accurate voter registration lists.   And just yesterday, New York City announced that they would be  resending nearly 100,000 absentee ballots out due to a printing error  just a month before the election.   This raises numerous questions: How many of these ballots were  already cast? Will votes in New York count twice? Do these ballots even  have to be postmarked?   The fact that we are even asking these questions raises fundamental  concerns with the integrity of the upcoming election.   Another concern is the flurry of late ballots we will see after  election day. It is a disgrace to our electoral system that we are  allowing ballots to be counted for days after the November 3 election.  Shame on the States that are allowing this to happen, including  Kentucky.   Ballots received after election day is a disaster waiting to happen.  If you vote by mail, then do it now, or at least by October 15 or  October 20 to ensure that it has time to arrive by election day.   We know what the consequences of ballots accumulating in the days and  weeks after election day will be. Look no further than a recent New  York primary, where Governor Cuomo's shift to mail-in voting led to  absolute chaos. Election officials disqualified thousands of ballots  for not having timely postmarks, and the election wasn't certified for  6 weeks.   The surest guarantee of election integrity is for Americans to vote  in person where safe and possible. Even Dr. Fauci has declared in- person voting to be safe. This method comes with knowledgeable workers,  identity verification, and secure ballot submission practices. These  safeguards will minimize any delay in election results and ensure the  integrity of the outcome.   I wish Congress could come together to have universal voting  standards for what will be a Presidential race that, by all accounts,  will come down to the wire.   Ballots should be received by election day, and if we can't agree on  that, then surely we can agree that ballots that are received after  election day have to be postmarked.   There are States that are coming out with new guidance that say  ballots received after election day don't even have to be postmarked.  Are you kidding me?   We have to come together on this before we leave. We have to come  together to ensure the integrity of our elections.   Madam Speaker, that concludes my remarks, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                            ____________________
