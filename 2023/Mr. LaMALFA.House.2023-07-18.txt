 Madam Speaker, until recently, we weren't supposed to  discuss that indeed the United States does have an ammunition shortage  for our military here and around the world. But it is so widely  reported in the press, I guess we really shouldn't ignore it anymore  and pretend it isn't a problem.   Recently, with the controversy around cluster bombs, the President  has defended his decision to send them to Ukraine by announcing the  U.S. Army ammunition stockpiles are depleted. In other words,  basically, this is all we have to give them at this point.   The primary reasons are lack of funds, little focus on production,  and truly a lack of will to truly ramp up and build our ammunition  stocks to what they should be.   The U.S. military's goal decades ago was that we could fight a two- front war. The United States used to have that might and capability. We  saw that in World War II with many other allies, of course, around the  world that we fought side by side with.   As we know, modern, western military hardware is indeed incredibly  complex, costly, and difficult to produce at scale. It requires a large  infrastructure, a well-protected supply chain, and a large workforce of  skilled labor. These are things that we are capable of as a country.  Look at all the gadgetry we can build in order to satisfy a market of  people desiring entertainment.   Artillery round expenditures we point to in Ukraine really paint a  dark picture. Ukrainians burn through a year's worth of U.S. artillery  round production in 1 month. In 1 month, they can burn through a year's  worth of our production. That is just Ukraine. What does that make our  own stocks look like?   We must ramp up production tremendously. If we are going to continue  in  [[Page H3646]]  some fashion, or not, the controversial backing of Ukraine, we have to  be able to supply them in order to have them be able to do a credible  job on the field. If we are going to support that policy, we have to  build our own stocks.   What does this mean for us? We are actually foraging shells and  ammunition from stocks around the world, even from our allies, in order  to keep the chain going into Ukraine. That is why cluster bombs, right?   The main concern for American defense really should be what does it  mean if China's aggression gets much worse? What if they make a move on  Taiwan that we are obligated and have promised to back up on? What  about other issues that may happen in NATO? Are we ready?   We are not near ready for it. We need to produce the bombs and the  bullets and the other hardware so that we have that as a deterrent and  not have the idea that we are so weak that they know they can make a  move on us or our allies. It is really that simple. It is really common  sense.   So ramping up these domestic munitions production could run afoul of  a lot of ideas the Democrats hold: climate, environment, or just a  philosophy that if we don't produce the ammunition, we don't produce  these arms, that we just won't have war.   We are going to have to make some very clear choices here with the  Democratic policies. Is it about climate? Is it about environment, by  producing these things and having them ready and available to deter  war? Do they want to weaken us so much that China and others can make  any kind of move they want and we just have to sit and watch?   These munitions are procured on a yearly basis. That is why when we  have an orderly appropriation process in committees, instead of a last- minute continuing resolution, throwing last year's spending in the  hopper, put some duct tape and baling wire on it and kick it out for  another year or whatever the period is, you can't plan for that. You  certainly can't plan long-term to up your military needs and fill them  when we do last-minute things like that. We have to have a better  process of procuring and planning for it.   What we saw from the end of the Cold War, we scaled down military.  Okay, maybe there is a dividend there. We lost one-third of it in  armament production after the Soviet Union collapsed. Then in the  global war on terror, procurements and production was indeed focused on  smaller, low-intensity conflicts, not a wide war.   Training skilled labor takes time and building the infrastructure to  do so will take time, but what we have in place we should be running  24/7 and have the will to do it.   So what does that mean for our national security? I just said it.  What are they going to do? Russia is going to continue to be able to  bully Ukraine if they see us as weak.   China and Iran can do what they want, and who knows what we will get  out of North Korea.   We must be ready. We must get the supply chain going again and  bolster our military so those who serve in it have everything they need  in order to do their job and be safe from unnecessary risk.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I express my grave concerns regarding the  alleged involvement of members of the Biden family in criminal  activities. The evidence keeps popping up again and again and again  that there are a lot of problems with the interactions with foreign  concerns.   Our duty as Representatives is to demand transparency and  accountability from our leaders, whether it is within this House, in  the administration, in the bureaucracy, or what have you.   That said, Congress and the American people cannot ignore the  mounting evidence and questionable business dealings that have plagued  Hunter Biden and the rest of the Biden family for seemingly years now.   We know Hunter Biden served as a board member for a firm that has  been accused of bribery. We know of his work with an investment fund  that is controlled by the Bank of China, getting paid huge salaries for  something he has no expertise and really spending no time on.   All this comes with other pressing allegations of questionable  business ethics, legal exposure, and concerns about U.S. national  security because of Hunter Biden's relationships in China.   What do we hear lately? They are going to go after President Trump  again for January 6 stuff. What is the deal?                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on rollcall No. 334, I mistakenly voted  ``yea'' when I intended to vote ``nay.''
