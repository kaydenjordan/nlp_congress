 Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Whitehouse for  this long journey we have been on together.   For Congressman Malinowski from the House, this has been a passion.   This amendment would allow the Department of Justice, through the  Secretary of State, to transfer proceeds from seized oligarch assets or  other sanctioned entities to the people of Ukraine. It will be a  godsend to the long-suffering people of Ukraine. It will be a relief to  the American taxpayer because billions of dollars are subject to being  seized and transferred. It will be a bad day for oligarchs.   I ask for a voice vote.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.
