 Mr. President, a few moments ago, my friend from South  Dakota was speaking about the bill. He made one statement that I do  agree with, and that is, just because you say something over and over  again does not make it true. Unfortunately, much of what he said is  just not accurate. The truth is that what we are seeing today, in an  unprecedented way, is the looting of the Federal Treasury.   Today marks a great victory for the very wealthy campaign  contributors who have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars over  the years to the Republican Party. These billionaires will see a huge  tax break for themselves at the same time as the deficit of this  country is driven up by about $1.5 trillion.   Today is also a victory for the largest, the most profitable  corporations in America, companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Pfizer,  and General Electric, which, despite recordbreaking profits, will now  see hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks.   At a time of massive income and wealth inequality, where the people  on top are becoming wealthier while the middle class shrinks and 40  million live in poverty, this legislation--according to the nonpartisan  Tax Policy Center--will provide 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1  percent, while increasing taxes on 92 million middle-class households  by the end of the decade. Let me repeat that. By the end of the decade,  this legislation will provide 83 percent of the benefits to the top 1  percent and, incredibly, 60 percent of the benefits to the top one- tenth of 1 percent, while, at the end of the decade, 92 million middle- class households will be paying more in taxes.   Does anybody really believe that when we have such a massive gap in  income and wealth inequality, we should be giving 60 percent of the  benefits in this bill to the top one-tenth of 1 percent?   It says a lot about the priorities of the Republican Party when the  tax breaks for corporations in this bill are permanent, while the tax  breaks for working families expire at the end of 8 years.   Furthermore, I hope that every American is listening to what Speaker  of the House Paul Ryan is saying, and other Republicans, when they talk  about how they are going to offset the $1.5 trillion in deficits they  just created by giving massive tax breaks to the wealthy and large  corporations. What Ryan is saying and many other Republicans are saying  is that they are going to come back and offset that $1.5 trillion in  deficits by cutting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. And if I  am wrong on that assertion, I would hope that some of my Republican  colleagues would come down to the floor and say that I am wrong, but I  do not suspect that will be the case.   During his campaign for the White House, Donald Trump said over and  over again to the American people, quote after quote, day after day,  that he would not cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Well, I  say to the President: For once in your life, keep the promises that you  made, and tell the Republican leadership now that you will veto any  legislation that cuts Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid. I suspect  we will not be seeing a tweet from the President on that issue.   Moving toward passing this very unfair piece of legislation, the  Republican leadership--which controls the House and the Senate--will  move soon to shut down the Congress and head home for a holiday break.  After massive tax breaks for the rich and large corporations, they  believe their work is done, and they are ready to head home.   Well, I respectfully disagree. Maybe, just maybe, before Congress  adjourns for the holidays, we should start paying attention to the  needs of the working families of this country, to the middle class of  this country, and not just the billionaire class.   We need to address the crisis that faces some 800,000 young people  who are currently in the DACA Program. Without the legal protections  afforded by the DACA Program, these young people today are living in  constant fear and anxiety that they may lose their legal status and, in  fact, be deported from the only country they have ever known.   Imagine somebody who is 20 or 25 years of age, has lived in the  United States virtually his or her entire life, went to school here,  now has a job, now is in college, now is in the military, and because  of Trump's disastrous attack on DACA, repealing DACA, 800,000 young  people are worried about whether they are going to be able to even stay  in this country.  [[Page S8100]]    The American people are very clear about how they feel about this  issue. I believe just today there was a Quinnipiac poll that appeared  on this very issue, and this was the question:         Which comes closest to your view about undocumented       immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children? A) They       should be allowed to stay in the United States and to       eventually apply for U.S. citizenship. B) They should be       allowed to remain in the United States, but not be allowed to       apply for U.S. citizenship. C) They should be required to       leave the U.S.    That was the question asked of the American people.   Here is the answer. Seventy-seven percent of the American people--77  percent--say that these young people should be allowed to stay in the  United States and move toward citizenship. Seven percent say they that  should stay in the United States but not gain citizenship. Twelve  percent say that they should be forced to leave the United States.   Republicans, by overwhelming numbers, say that these young people,  these Dreamers who have spent their entire lives in this country, who  know no other country, should be allowed to stay in America and apply  for citizenship. Ninety-one percent of Democrats say that, and 81  percent of Independents say that.   As we speak, young people are losing their legal status. We have to  act on that and act on that now, before we adjourn for the holidays.  Put yourself in the place of a 20-, 25-year-old person living in  extraordinary anxiety. We have to act now to address those concerns. We  have to do what the American people want us to do.   As I think most people know, the Koch brothers are the major funders  of the Republican Party. They have probably given billions of dollars  over the years. Even Charles Koch acknowledges that the right thing to  do is to provide legal status for the Dreamers.   Let me quote from a recent op-ed in the Washington Post by Charles  Koch and Tim Cook, the head of Apple:         The United States is at its best when all people are free       to pursue their dreams. Our country has enjoyed unparalleled       success by welcoming people from around the world who seek to       make a better life for themselves and their families, no       matter what their backgrounds. It is our differences that       help us to learn from each other, to challenge our old ways       of thinking and to discover innovative solutions that benefit       us all. To advance that prosperity and build an even stronger       future, each successive generation--including, today, our       own--must show the courage to embrace that diversity and to       do what is right.        We have no illusions about how difficult it can be to get       things done in Washington, and we know that people of good       faith disagree about aspects of immigration policy. If ever       there were an occasion to come together to help people       improve their lives, this is it. By acting now to ensure the       dreamers can realize their potential by continuing to       contribute to our country, Congress can reaffirm this       essential American ideal.    This is from Charles Koch. He funds the Republican Party. They might  want to listen to him as well.   But it is not just the need to address the crisis facing our  Dreamers. As you know, community health centers providing health  insurance, healthcare, for 27 million people have not been reauthorized  or refunded. We have to address that issue, and we have to address it  now.   Nine million children are in the Children's Health Insurance Program.  While we are busy giving tax breaks to billionaires, we have not had  time to reauthorize a health insurance program for the children of this  country. We should be ashamed of ourselves.   We have disaster relief out there. Folks in Congress will go home to  celebrate the holidays, and will light up our homes. In Puerto Rico and  the Virgin Islands, they can't light up their homes because many of  them still don't have electricity as a result of the recent disasters  they have experienced. We need to do disaster relief. We need to do it  now for the people of Puerto Rico, for the people of the Virgin  Islands, for the people of Texas, and for the people of Florida.   There are 1.5 million workers who are about to lose the pensions they  were promised, and those pensions, after a lifetime of work, will be  reduced by 60 percent if we don't address the multiemployer pension  plan crisis. We have to do that.   Over 40 million people in this country are dealing with student debt.  They leave college deeply in debt. Many of them are in despair because  of their financial situations--because of their outrageous levels of  student debt. We have to address that.   We have an opioid epidemic that is killing people from coast to  coast. We have to start investing in treatment and prevention.   We have 30,000 vacancies in the VA today. Our job is to make sure  that every veteran in this country gets the quality healthcare he or  she needs. They don't get it with 30,000 vacancies in the VA. We have  to invest in the VA.   There were 10,000 people on disability who died last year while  waiting for the Social Security Administration to act on their  applications; 10,000 people died last year because the Social Security  Administration is greatly understaffed--massive cuts to the Social  Security Administration. The elderly and the disabled in this country  are entitled to have prompt process when they apply for benefits. They  are not getting that. We have to pay attention to that, and on and on  it goes.   The bottom line is that the U.S. Senate should be doing more than  providing 83 percent of the benefits in a tax bill to the top 1  percent. We cannot go home unless we address the very serious crises  facing the working families and the middle class of this country.   With that, I yield to my colleague from Oregon.    If I could ask my colleague from Oregon a simple  question--he is the ranking member of the Finance Committee. This is a  bill that deals with trillions of dollars in our entire economy.    It impacts every person in America. Would he mind  telling the American people just how many public hearings there were to  hear from economists, to hear from the business community, to hear from  labor, to hear from senior advocates, to discuss this rather long and  complicated bill?    Talk about taxes in general----    Let me translate that into English. In other words, as I  understand what the Senator is saying, billionaire campaign  contributors could then legally put money into churches, which would  then do the political work that they otherwise would have been doing.    Absolutely. It is not only that mistakes are made; it is  that when you don't open the doors to the American people, to  economists, to mayors, to Governors, to businesspeople, and to leaders  in the labor movement to see what do you want in tax reform--when you  don't do that--and when you conduct your business behind closed doors,  you end up with legislation that represents the needs of the  billionaire class, which also makes a number of mistakes.   In that regard, I would tell my friend that this afternoon, the  Senate Parliamentarian advised that certain provisions of the  Republican tax legislation violate the Byrd rule, including a provision  allowing for the use of 529 savings accounts for home schooling  expenses; the short title--the Tax Cut and Jobs Act--and part of the  criteria used to determine whether the endowments of private  universities are subject to the legislation's new excise tax. These  provisions may be struck from the conference report absent 60 votes.   With that, I raise the following points of order against the pending  conference report:   That subsection 11000(a) violates section 313(b)(1)(A) of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974; that subparagraph (B) of section  11032, starting on page 75, line 17 and all through page 76, line 9,  violates section 313(b)(1)(D) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974;  and that the phrase ``tuition-paying'' as it appears on page 309, line  12, and page 309, lines 14 through 15, violates section 313(b)(1)(D) of  the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
