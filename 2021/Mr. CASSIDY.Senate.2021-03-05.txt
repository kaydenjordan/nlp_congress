 I call up my amendment No. 1161 and ask that it be  reported by number.    I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes of debate, equally  divided.    Mr. President, on a bipartisan basis, the December COVID  relief bill included emergency assistance to private and parochial  schools, reimbursing for things such as disinfectants, technology, and  PPE.   Guidelines prioritize schools serving low-income students. The  current bill has money for private and parochial schools but,  incredibly, does not allow reimbursement for COVID-related expenses in  a COVID relief bill. It does allow arbitrary guidelines restricting  which schools are eligible.   My amendment goes back to the bipartisan language agreed to in  December, prioritizing schools with low-income students and addressing  COVID expenses. I urge colleagues to support these schools serving 10  percent of America's children, 7 percent of children in poverty, to  support their families. Please support this amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    How many seconds do I have left?    I ask unanimous consent for 10 seconds, please.    This is the exact same language that we used in  December. It targets children with private schools. To say that you are  going to restrict it further than that is merely a way to keep the kids  from having it. Seven percent of kids in poverty go to private schools.  About 7 percent of this money will go to private kids. We should  support the children.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1161     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1162 and ask  that it be reported by number.    I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes of debate equally  divided.    Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senators  Cotton and Cruz. Our amendment prevents $1,400 stimulus checks from  going to inmates.   You heard that right. This bill sends $1,400 stimulus checks to  people incarcerated for heinous crimes. Prisoners  [[Page S1257]]  have all their living and medical expenses paid for by the taxpayer.  They don't pay taxes. They don't contribute to the tax base. They can't  be unemployed. In other words, inmates are not economically impacted by  COVID, and inmates cannot stimulate the economy. But under this bill,  Democrats are giving prisoners--again, sometimes incarcerated for  heinous crimes--a $1,400 stimulus check. If we eliminate these, we save  taxpayers $1.9 billion.   Now, I know my Democratic colleagues aren't going to agree, but this  spending should be on real needs. Stimulus checks for inmates is  nontargeted, inappropriate, and is a total waste of money. I ask my  colleagues to support the amendment.    I will reply, it only applies to people incarcerated for  a year. That is not true.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1162    I call for the yeas and nays.
