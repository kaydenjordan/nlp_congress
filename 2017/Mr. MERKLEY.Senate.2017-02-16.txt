 Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity that my  colleague from Hawaii has given me to ask a question. Particularly, I  appreciate his willingness to be on the floor making this case because  being the guardians of clean air and clean water in the United States  of America is an incredible responsibility, and the individual we place  in this position as Director of the Environmental Protection Agency is  going to make decisions that will affect the life and death of millions  of American citizens, that will affect the quality of life of millions  of American citizens.   When the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency proceeds to  say we are to fight for the mercury standard, that means that fewer  children will be exposed to a persistent neurotoxin that stunts the  development of our children's brains. On the other hand, if that  individual says: I am not concerned about that or I think I will just  look the other way because I want to help the fossil fuel industry make  a few more bucks, and he decides that weighs more heavily than the  health of our children, then the health of our children is impacted.  That is true with one form of pollutant and another, and they are just  across the landscape. This is an incredibly important position. That is  why understanding the viewpoints of the nominee is so critical.   My understanding is that the individual who controls access to the  emails in Oklahoma is the attorney general; am I correct in that  understanding?    So we have a situation where an individual has accepted  a nomination from the President for this incredibly important position  and then has turned around and said: By the way, I am the guardian of  the gate for the very records the Senate needs to see in order to  determine if I am a fit character for this position, and he says: No, I  will not allow the Senate to see my records.   My question to my colleague from Hawaii is as follows: Just the fact  that a nominee, accepting a nomination and knowing the Senate has a  responsibility to vet the nominee, who turns around and says, but you  can't have access to my records, shouldn't that in itself disqualify  that individual from consideration?    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a  colloquy with the Senators from Hawaii and Rhode Island over the course  of the coming hour.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Has the Senator from Hawaii yielded the floor?    Mr. President, I believe that will be charged to my  time, but I have asked for that to be the case.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.    Mr. President, in this conversation about these emails,  the thing that keeps striking me is that our fundamental question is,  Is the individual, is the nominee, given his record in Oklahoma, going  to be an advocate for the environment, an advocate for the health of  the citizens of the United States of America, an advocate for upholding  clean water and clean air that have done so much to improve the quality  of life for Americans, or is the individual, Scott Pruitt, going to be,  instead, an advocate for the oil companies and the coal companies and  the gas companies? That question goes to the heart of whether the  individual, Scott Pruitt, is fit to carry this responsibility.   The American people have been very pleased with the enormous changes  in the quality of the environment over the last 30 or 40 years, and it  has added a tremendous amount of improvement to their lives. Here we  have somebody who, possibly, is not going to advocate and fulfill the  responsibilities of the office but who is going to use the office as  director of the EPA as an extension of the complex matrix of fossil  fuel companies and work on their behalf and not on the people's behalf.   I will invite my colleagues, if they have insight or questions  related to this question of whether Scott Pruitt is going to serve the  interests of the people or the interests of the fossil fuel companies,  to feel free to weigh in.    My colleague from Rhode Island put up the web. Maybe  ``web'' is a better word than ``matrix'' because it looks like a giant  spiderweb. What is being ensnared in this spiderweb, in this web of  denial, in this ``denial beast'' as you have labeled it, is the truth.   What the complex group of organizations does is to put out  information from every possible direction. They hold conferences; they  hold workshops; they write letters to the editor; they write opinion  editorials in our newspapers; they organize research--all so that it  can reverberate in a way that an ordinary citizen hears from here and  here and here the same lie--the lie that it is not clear whether carbon  dioxide from burning fossil fuels is damaging our environment.   Here is the truth: We know very clearly the damage that is being done  by burning fossil fuels, by burning natural gas, by burning coal, by  burning oil, but there is so much money, so much profit, that they can  build this enormous web of organizations to mislead the public, and  that is half of it.   Then there is the second chart my colleague put up, which lays out  these funds of dark money. This is really about the corruption of our  democratic Republic. Maybe if I come over here, this will be in the  same frame of reference. These funds flow through in a fashion that  they contaminate the debate among citizens in election after election  after election. This dark money is corrupting the very soul of our  democracy--our elections.   Here is the interesting connection. Right now, a judge has ruled and  said: ``There was an abject failure to provide prompt and reasonable  access to documents requested.'' Our nominee is in control of these  emails, his own emails. He has been stopping access to them because he  has that power as attorney general of Oklahoma because he is afraid of  the information the public will learn from his communications.   The lines on the chart that my colleague from Rhode Island put up  showed his connection to fund after fund after fund. In his  communications with these groups, which may possibly be among the  communications that the judge has just said will be released to the  public, wouldn't it be interesting to find out what he said related to  those organizations? Was he serving the public, or was he serving the  fossil fuel industry?   This information will be available next Tuesday, but the majority  leader has said, essentially, that he is willing to deny Americans the  right to know the truth about Scott Pruitt. He is willing to deny  Americans the right to know the truth about these emails. He is willing  to deny Americans the right to know about these leaks between  organizations and whether Scott Pruitt served the public trust or  served the fossil fuel industry, served the Koch brothers.   It is an offense to this body and it is an offense to the American  citizens' right to know that we might be voting tomorrow without  getting the information necessary to make a considered judgment on this  nominee.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Mr. President, I appreciate the questions from my  colleague from Hawaii. As we stand here tonight, I think about how  Hawaii is a State completely surrounded by water. It is very vulnerable  to changes in the environment, very vulnerable to the introduction of  invasive species, very vulnerable to changes in the acidity of the  ocean, which is affected by carbon dioxide, and very vulnerable to the  rising sea level.   I appreciate so much that as a citizen of Hawaii as well as now a  leader for the voice of the State here in this Chamber, he keeps going  back to his fundamentals of concern for our broader environment.   As you were asking this question, I was thinking about President  Richard Nixon creating the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970. He  recognized that we all share ``a profound commitment to the rescue of  our natural environment and the preservation of the Earth as a place  both habitable by and hospitable to man.''   Well, that is a pretty clear statement that things were in trouble  and we needed to operate a rescue. I think about that in the context of  growing up in Oregon and, as I grew up, through my church and through  my Boy Scout troop, we would go and do different projects to try to  clean up messes that had been left. One of those was that we had a  problem with these plastic six-pack rings that held all of the six cans  together and the birds that were on the Pacific Flyway would stick  their head through one of these plastic rings that would have held the  top of a soda can, and they wouldn't be able to get it off, and they  would end up choking or dying. Also, these plastic rings were being  digested by the animals, and it was affecting them.   Then we had these flip-tops where you would open a can of soda by  pulling off a triangular piece of metal and it would be a little hook  that would sit on the beach or the pathway, and then somebody would  step on it and cut their foot open or an animal would eat it, and this  nice little curved object would tear up their throat and kill them.  Those issues of: Why? Why do we have to operate with these consumer  products in the fashion that are creating these specific hazards? The  answer was: We didn't.   There was a bill in the Oregon legislature, and we eliminated the  plastic rings that birds were sticking their heads through. And then we  had a proposal--and I can't really recall if was done by initiative or  by the legislature--to eliminate these flip-tops. The industry said:  You cannot eliminate these flip-tops. People will not be able to open  their cans of soda. It will be a terrible tragedy for America. There is  no solution. You cannot touch this. Adamantly, they said: Nothing can  be  [[Page S1283]]  done. It is an impossible problem to solve.   But we passed the law. We adopted that law, either by initiative or  by the legislature, and a magical thing occurred. Within what seemed  like a few days--maybe it was a few weeks--those peel-off flip-tops  disappeared and were replaced by a different mechanism that opens that  same triangle, but stays attached to the can.   Well, I have seen this time and again where there is a proposal where  we need to improve our habits as humans, and as we are engaged in  making our consumer products more complimentary to the environment, we  are told: It can't be done. It will be too expensive. It will be too  difficult. And then, when we say no, it can be done, and we pass a law,  the solutions appear. And everyone says: Oh, that works just fine.   So now we don't have those plastic rings. Now we don't have those  peel-off flip-tops that sit on the ground.   But we would go out in my Scout troop or in my church group and we  would clean up and we would think that this would be so unnecessary to  have these, and I saw the changes that occurred.   Then people said: What about all of these aluminum cans and glass  bottles that are sitting all around here on the pathways around our  State. Oregon had a strong ethic for the environment, but we were  littered by all of these aluminum cans and steel cans back then, and  also by glass bottles and broken glass bottles. If you have cleaned up  a broken glass bottle, you know that it is real a pain to do that. And  if you step on the shards from a glass bottle, you regret that somebody  else shattered it and left it on the ground.   So we said: Why can't we change that? So the legislature put forward  the idea and said: Let's just put a deposit on this so when you turn it  in, you get 5 cents back. So we had the first bottle bill in the  Nation, and that bottle bill got a huge percentage of those cans and  those bottles returned that were left out in the public. And if  somebody did leave something in the public space, somebody else would  come along and say: There is a nickel; I will grab it and return it.   I must say that the amount of deposits in Oregon hasn't kept pace  with inflation. When my kids were small, I would say: There is a  bottle; grab it. There's a nickel. And they would say: It is just a  nickel, Dad. A nickel isn't what it was three or four decades ago. But  nonetheless, it still was an innovation that served as well.   About that same time, Oregon was worried about the developments of  its beaches because we had a huge public trust with the beaches. The  beaches belonged to all the people in the State, but the law was a  little bit vague in this regard. But there was a provision that said  that essentially public byways would remain public byways, and those  beaches were established then by law in Oregon as belonging to all of  the people of the State, and that access would be available to all of  the people in the State. So nobody could take a piece of beach and say:  This is mine. It belonged to everyone. So we gained our public beaches  during that time period.   Then, someone else said: Well, look, we are seeing what is happening  with congestion in some other States. And, with apologies to my fellow  Senators from California, a lot of Oregonians turned to California and  said: We are seeing a lot of sprawl, we are seeing a lot of congestion,  and maybe we can do something about that and change the way that  development occurs.    So under the governorship of Tom McCall, who, by the way, was a  Republican and who, like Richard Nixon, believed in the environment--it  was Richard Nixon who was President when we did the Clean Water Act and  the Clean Air Act, and we established the EPA, and it was the  Republican Tom McCall who preserved the beach bill and the bottle bill  and this land use planning bill that said: Let's put a boundary around  each town and city, and you will not be able to build outside of that  boundary so that we don't have sprawl. And some said: Well, we want to  still have the right to build anything. So a compromise was struck. And  it was that the tax rate outside of those boundaries would be much  lower. So, with that, the farmers said: That is a sweet deal, we will  take that. And the forest industry said: We will take that. Meanwhile,  it meant that our city started to develop more densely with intense  services, and we avoided the sprawl that had been experienced  elsewhere.   I mention each of these issues--the bottle bill, the beach bill, the  land use bill, the fact that we got rid of the flip-tops--because these  were strategies to make us be able to operate in a more sustainable  fashion, in accordance with the vision that Richard Nixon laid out when  he created the Environmental Protection Agency.   Let me read that one more time. He said that we all share ``a  profound commitment to the rescue of our natural environment and the  preservation of the Earth as a place both habitable by and hospitable  to man.''    He will.    He will.    He will.    He will.    I appreciate that question. It is something we have  witnessed unfold over the last two decades. It was not that long ago  Republicans--both parties--for example, would stand up and say: We have  a serious threat to our planet. That threat is the temperature of the  planet is increasing, that we are suffering the impacts of methane and  carbon dioxide pollution, and we must address that threat, but in the  last few years, we have seen a steady diminishment of Republican  commitment to address that threat. What does that correspond to? It  corresponds very precisely to the  [[Page S1284]]  growth of dark money from the fossil fuel industry.   I hate to lay out this story because it is offensive to anyone--any  patriotic American who wants to see government of, by, and for the  people--to hear this story about the massive corruption of our body  politic by this dark money.   If I go back a few years and look at a set of campaigns the last time  I ran for office, that dark money became involved in Senate campaign  after Senate campaign after Senate campaign after Senate campaign, and  it very much had an impact on the composition of this body. As those  races were won with dark money from the fossil fuel industry, the  willingness of some individuals to stand up and speak truthfully,  forthcomingly, and powerfully about the challenge to the environment  diminished and diminished and diminished. That really has to change. It  is why we have to take on this role of dark money. It is the factor  that means there is no longer a Governor McCall--a Republican who is  fighting for the beach fill, a Republican who is fighting for the  bottle bill, a Republican who is fighting for the land use bill to make  our environment work better.   As a kid, we had rivers in Oregon you couldn't swim in, and now you  can. Now, they are not perfect. They still show a touch of humankind on  them, but the point pollution--the pipes full of toxic materials that  went in the river--those are gone. What we have left primarily is  nonpoint pollution, which is a much harder thing to tackle, but even  that we are working to control through buffers and a variety of  regulations to try to clean that up. We have made big improvements.   That, to my colleague from Hawaii, I would have to say is the factor  that has changed this body.    I will.    I will.    I appreciate the Senator's chart because I think it  demonstrates, in a much more precise way, what I was describing, the  corrupting role of dark money. Here, the Senate has illustrated how  that money was really unleashed by the Citizens United decision and how  the impact has been dramatic, just squelching the ability of my  Republican colleagues to share this effort to create a sustainable  planet.   I think, when we are asking for these emails to be reviewed before we  vote, we are asking the question: Does Scott Pruitt share the mission  that Richard Nixon stated when we created the Environmental Protection  Agency? If you are going to head the Agency, do you share the mission?  We want to know whether Scott Pruitt has, in Richard Nixon's words, ``a  profound commitment to the rescue of our natural environment.'' We want  to know whether Scott Pruitt has a profound commitment to the  preservation of the Earth as a place habitable to mankind. We want to  know whether he has a commitment to the preservation of the Earth as  hospitable to mankind.   Henry David Thoreau kind of summed it up like this: What use is a  house if you don't have a tolerable planet to put it on? That is a good  question. It is a commitment to the fact that where we live is just not  the house, the structure of our bedroom and our kitchen and dining  room, where we live is on this beautiful blue-green planet. That is our  home, and we must care for it just as we do the structure of our house.   When I ask this question: Is Scott Pruitt committed to the mission of  rescuing our natural environment, I think there will be answers to that  in these emails. That is why we should see these emails, as the judge  has said that we should see those emails. He said there was an abject  failure to provide prompt and reasonable access. By whom? The person  who blocked it was the attorney general of Oklahoma, who is the nominee  whose record we are examining--the attorney general of Oklahoma. The  reason this body hasn't had these emails, the reason the American  public has not been able to answer the question: Are you committed to  the mission of the Environmental Protection Agency, is because Scott  Pruitt prevented us from being able to answer that question.   He has been quite clear in other circumstances which amplify our  concerns. On the Agency he has been nominated to lead, he describes  himself as a ``leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda.''  Just with those words, we sense a certain hostility to the work the EPA  does to try to clean up the air, clean up the water, and hold polluters  accountable. Activists. Isn't it a good thing to fulfill the mission  you are charged with doing? It is not a pejorative. It is an important  commitment to work hard to fulfill the responsibilities of the office.   That is one piece of evidence, but here is another. Devon Energy sent  a letter to Scott Pruitt and said: Would you please make this the  position of your office and address it to the Environmental  Protection Agency, to the Honorable Lisa Jackson, head of the EPA.    Here is the letter as it was sent to Scott Pruitt by Devon Energy,  saying: Won't you take our position as your position. Here is the  letter that was sent on. This is the first page. There was a longer  amount to it. As we can see, these paragraphs in yellow were lifted 100  percent over here into the letter. There was one sentence that was  dropped out in the course of this lengthy letter. I think it is less  than 5 percent of the letter was dropped out. Essentially, he took  their letter and printed it on his stationery as the position of the  attorney general on behalf of the people of the State of Oklahoma.   So I asked him in the hearing whether he felt he was representing  Devon Energy and making his office an extension of this corporation or  whether he was serving the people of the State. He had earlier said he  would like to hear from everyone and get all sides of something. He  said: Well, I consider, in printing Devon's letter as Oklahoma's  attorney general's letter, simply advocating for an industry that is  important to Oklahoma--so making the oil position the position of the  attorney general's office.   I said: Well, earlier you stated that you liked to hear the various  sides of an issue and consider the input. Whom else did you talk to  about this issue before you simply took the position of the oil  company?   The answer was: No one.   So we can only conclude that, at least in this one instance, the  nominee before us didn't look out to the people he was representing as  attorney general. He didn't look after the body of law, the body of  opinion, the body of effects. He didn't consult with anyone, except one  organization--Devon Energy.   I must say, this is evidence, at this moment, of not serving the  people, as an officer of the people is committed to do, but serving a  company. So is this an anomaly or is this essentially the way he  operated day in and day out? The answer is in the emails that we do not  have. That is why it is a travesty if we vote tomorrow without getting  those emails next Tuesday and enabling the public to examine them.   We normally have 30 hours of debate postcloture after we officially  close debate. We don't quite close it but say there is another 30 hours  of debate. That is what we are in right now, and that is why we are  here tonight. Wouldn't it make sense to suspend this debate until after  the citizens of the United States of America have a chance to pour  through those emails and know the answer? Is this what we  [[Page S1285]]  can expect; that we will have an Administrator of the Environmental  Protection Agency who is serving Devon Energy and the Koch brothers and  this dark money cartel or is he going to serve the citizens of the  United States of America? That is what we want to know the answer to.    I will.    I will.    One of the things that I want to return to is why we are  so concerned about this complex matrix of corruption, of dark money  changing the outcome of campaigns, changing the makeup of the Senate,  changing the type of rules that are adopted and the laws that are  passed, because behind it all is a rising tide of pollution that is  changing the chemistry of our air and changing the temperature of our  planet.   This is a very simple chart here, and this shows temperature and  carbon dioxide. If we look at this carefully, you can see that the  carbon dioxide rises and the temperature rises. This is what has  happened. The scientists have looked back hundreds of thousands of  years. Carbon dioxide goes down, and the temperature goes down. Carbon  dioxide goes up, and the temperature goes up because carbon dioxide is  essentially a blanket.   If you increase the thickness of that blanket--that is, the density  of the carbon dioxide--more heat is trapped on the Earth's surface.  When we realize the age of the Earth, which is measured in billions of  years, the time that we have been here in human civilization is pretty  brief. And the time that we have been burning fossil fuels for energy  is very brief--150 years--a very small blink of the eye.   In that time, we have changed the chemistry of the air. We have  increased the size and the weight of the blanket substantially. Prior  to the burning of coal, for many thousands of years, the carbon dioxide  level had varied up and down, but the top level was 280 parts per  million. That is this blue line.   What we see is that the carbon dioxide level has steadily climbed as  we burn the coal, the natural gas, and the oil. As we have done that,  the black line is going up and down. It has varied a little bit from  year to year. It has steadily increased as well.   There are many folks who look at this and say that is just lines on a  chart. If you project into the future, that is just a computer model.  It can have different assumptions, and you can tweak that computer  model. But this is a powerful, powerful explanation of facts on the  ground that we are seeing every day.   Let's look at the facts on the ground. Let's set aside the computer  models. Let's even set aside this chart showing temperature rising as  the carbon dioxide levels rise.    What do we see in my home State of Oregon? What we see is that we  have warmer winters, and those warmer winters mean that the pine  beetles don't die off in the same way they do when there is a very cold  winter. So they come out, and they attack more trees and more trees are  killed. That is damaging to our forests. We see that effect.   What else do we see? We see a change in forest fires. Our forest fire  season has grown enormously, by more than 2 months over about the last  40 years. Two months is a big additional portion of the year with fires  raging, and the fires have been more intense. Partly, they are more  intense simply because the forest is different.   The old-growth forests were more resistant to fire than the second- growth forests, and that is a result of our logging practices. In  addition, there is the dryness of the forest. The forest is more dry.  Sometimes the wood on the floor of the forest is as dry as a kiln-dried  two-by-four. Then we have these weather patterns that involve more  lightning, and there are more lightning strikes that are starting  fires. So we have drier forests.   We have more lightning strikes. We have more dead trees, and we have  more damage from these fires. We see a significant impact on our  forest. How about on our farming? Farming depends on water. We have had  three worst ever droughts in the Klamath Basin over the last decade and  a half--three worst ever droughts. It had a huge impact on ranching in  that basin and a huge impact on farming in that basin.   As we see that impact, we realize that on the frontline--on the very  frontline--in the battle with rising temperatures is rural America,  where we have industries that depend on our natural resources, on our  forests, on our fishing, and on our farming.   Let's turn to our fishing for a moment. As the winters have gotten  warmer, we have seen that in most winters--not in all but in most  winters--the snowpack has been decreasing. What does that do? Partly,  it affects farming because you have less water stored in the form of  the snowpack, but it also affects the mountain streams. So you have  warmer, smaller mountain streams for trout and for salmon.   For those who love to fish in Oregon--and so many people do love to  [[Page S1286]]  fish in Oregon; in fact, people come from many parts of the world to  come and fish in Oregon--you now have streams that are less hospitable  for that purpose.   Let's think about what is happening on the coast of Oregon. On the  coast, we are a Pacific Rim State. We have the vast Pacific Ocean.  Ponder this question. Is it possible that you could burn so much coal  and so much oil and so much natural gas in 150 years that you could put  so much carbon dioxide into the air, that the ocean could absorb a good  share of that, and you could change the chemistry of the ocean?   I have to tell you this. Apologies to my colleague from Hawaii. This  is the most beautiful coastline on the planet. You have these  incredible mountains dashing into the ocean. You have these gorgeous  Pacific waters. You have all kinds of wildlife, all kinds of fishing  industry. The Oregon coast is one of the most spectacular places in the  world. I must say that, in fairness, I have really enjoyed seeing the  Hawaii coastline as well. It is different. It is beautiful and rugged  in a different way, but spectacular.   There you are on the coast of Oregon, and you are looking out from  those mountains that come crashing into the sea. We have capes--one  cape after another. The cape is a big projection of land. You can stand  on top of those capes, and you can see out to the horizon of the ocean.  You can't see any land. You realize you can only see about 20 miles  with the curvature of the Earth, but you know that the ocean goes on  and on, far more than a thousand miles. And you say: That is a lot of  water. That is an incredible amount of water on the planet Earth. It  surely can't be possible that we have changed the basic chemistry of  the ocean through the burning of carbon dioxide.   Then you talk to the marine biologists who measure what makes up the  Pacific Ocean, and they tell you: You know what, the burning of coal  and oil and natural gas is changing our ocean in a way that is making  it less hospitable to life.   Here is what they are talking about. The ocean through wave action  absorbs that carbon dioxide that we have been putting into the Earth.  In fact, the carbon dioxide level in the air would be much, much higher  if it weren't for the oceans pulling a good deal of it out. And then,  in the water of the ocean, the carbon dioxide becomes carbonic acid.   When you hear the word ``acid,'' you say: Well, that doesn't sound  very good. And you are right. That acid, then, has an impact on the  ability of marine organisms to create shells. One specific example of  this are the oysters on the Oregon coast. The oysters, as little  babies, start to pull molecules out of the water and form shells. If  the water is more acidic, it is much more difficult for them to do  that, and the result is they die. They put all their energy into that  effort. They can't do it. So they die.   In about 2008--the year I was running for office--we had this big  die-off of baby oysters in the hatchery on the Oregon coast. It was a  big scientific puzzle: What is causing this? What is the virus or the  bacterium that is causing this?   The scientists got together, and with a lot of help from Oregon State  University, the industry got together and they studied this, and they  couldn't find that there was a virus causing this action. They started  looking for a bacterium. Well, they looked. They didn't find that  either.   What else could it be? It has to be one disease agent or another. It  turned out that it wasn't a disease agent. It was the increasing  acidity of the Pacific Ocean.   Now, this morning, the owner of that hatchery happened to be coming  through DC and came to my ``Good Morning Oregon'' reception. I hold  this every Thursday morning that I am here. People can show up. We have  a little bit of good Oregon coffee and a warm chance to reacquaint  ourselves with old friends and to hear what folks who are visiting are  thinking. He said to me this morning: Buffering is now continuous.   What did he mean by that? What he meant was, when they discovered it  was the acidity that was killing the baby oysters, they had to start  taking this seawater--they have a big pipe that pulls seawater up into  the oyster hatchery, and they have another pipe that recirculates it  back into the ocean. They had to start artificially reducing the  acidity of the seawater so the baby oysters could thrive. What he said  this morning is: We now have to buffer continuously. The condition has  become so bad, it is bad on any given day. So that is where we are.   If the acidity of the ocean has changed from the burning of coal and  oil and natural gas, isn't it time for us to wake up and pay attention?  Isn't it time for us, as the stewards of the environment here in terms  of making laws, to be paying attention? Shouldn't we be thinking again  about those words that President Richard Nixon said when he created the  Environmental Protection Agency in 1970; that we all ``share a profound  commitment to the rescue of our natural environment.''   How are we going to rescue our natural environment from the harm of  burning fossil fuels if we keep burning fossil fuels? That is the  question before us, and the answer is that we can't. We have to stop.   We have to, in a modest period of time, a rather short period of  time--really, in the course of human civilization, just a microsecond  of time--we have to move from burning fossil fuels to basing our  economy on energy from clean and renewable sources. We have to do this  very conscientiously. We have to do it through grassroots action. We  have to do it through a framework that we create here at the national  level. Both are powerful. Let's do both.   In the middle of that is the Environmental Protection Agency. That is  why it is so important that we have a Director of the EPA who is  committed to the vision of rescuing our natural environment, and that  is why we need to have access to these thousands of emails before we  vote in the U.S. Senate.   I think that as we consider this, we need to ponder that the  conditions we see in Oregon--that are derived from global warming,  increasing temperatures--are not simply happening in my State. I used  those examples because I come from Oregon. I represent Oregon. You can  see these things right where I am, but you can look across our Nation,  you can look across our planet, and see the effects everywhere.   If you take the 100 largest glaciers in the world and track their  average retreat, it is dramatic. There are those, by the way, who say  if you want to see a glacier at Glacier National Park, you better go  soon because a number of glaciers in Glacier National Park have  retreated substantially.   You can go to other parts of the country and see other impacts. For  example, if you go to the Northeast, you have the challenge--just like  the pine needles aren't being killed in the winter, the ticks aren't  being killed, and the ticks are infesting the moose, and the moose are  dying because you have these big clumps of ticks sucking the blood from  the adults and from the babies. The list goes on.   Our colleague from Maine says: We are concerned about our lobsters.  Our lobsters are migrating up the coast to find a temperature of water  that used to be in Maine, and now they are moving north toward Canada.   You can talk to those who track insects, like certain types of  mosquitoes that carry the Zika virus, and their range is spreading.  There is an insect called a sandfly that thrives in Central America,  that is starting to show up in the United States of America because the  temperature is changing, and that sandfly carries a disease called  leishmania. This disease basically is extraordinarily difficult to  cure, and it is a single-cell parasite. When you get bit by a sandfly,  you get an enormous number, if it is an infected sandfly, of these  parasites that start eating a hole either in your organs or in your  skin--very difficult to cure.   As I describe this, I am just touching the surface. I haven't talked  about the Great Barrier Reef, much of which has died over the last  couple of years off Australia, and the list goes on and on.   So to close, we need a Director of the Environmental Protection  Agency who has that profound commitment to the rescue of our natural  environment, and the preservation of the Earth as a place habitable by  and hospitable to humankind. That is why we need the emails,  [[Page S1287]]  and that is why this vote should be delayed until they have been  examined fully by the public.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lee). The Senator from New Jersey.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Christy  Veeder be granted floor privileges through the remainder of the year.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, as everyone in this Chamber knows, we  are currently debating and preparing to vote on the nomination of Scott  Pruitt to be the next Administrator of the Environmental Protection  Agency.   The truth is that we don't have all the information we need to make  this important decision. We don't have all the facts we ought to have.  That is because the nominee, in his role as attorney general of  Oklahoma, worked very hard to keep the information contained,  controlled, and unavailable to the Senators in this Chamber and  unavailable to the citizens of the United States of America.   For 2 years now, his office has stonewalled attempts to make public  the records of over 3,000 email communications with members of the  fossil fuel industry. Two years ago, the Center for Media and Democracy  requested these emails through the Oklahoma Open Records Act. Who is  the person who decides whether to release those records? The attorney  general of Oklahoma. Who is the nominee before us? The attorney general  of Oklahoma.   When Democrats on the Environment and Public Works Committee  requested these records from Mr. Pruitt during the confirmation  process, the answer we got back was this: ``I would direct you to make  a request of the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office under the Oklahoma  Open Records Act.'' Now, when he encouraged us to make that request, he  knew--and we shortly knew--that he had no intention of actually  granting access. He was telling us to get in line behind more than 50  other requests for that information, and that request has not yet been  answered. In fact, Senator Whitehouse did put in a request directly to  the Oklahoma attorney general's office using the Oklahoma Open Records  Act. Imagine what the result was. Did the attorney general of Oklahoma  immediately release these records? He did not. Have we those records  today? We do not.   But yesterday, Oklahoma County District Judge Aletia Haynes Timmons  ruled on whether or not the public deserves access to these emails and  deserves access to these records, and she ordered the attorney general  to do his job--to release the records so that we here in the Chamber  will have that information, so that the American public will have that  information. Judge Timmons said there was ``an abject failure to  provide prompt and reasonable access to documents requested.''   On Tuesday, the first batch of emails is going to be released to the  public. That is just a few days from now. But if we vote today, we  won't have that information before us. It will be too late for us to  have all the facts and information we need to make a qualified decision  on whether Mr. Pruitt is a fit character or unfit character to be a  member of the President's Cabinet. That is exactly what the Founders of  our Nation charged us with doing in the advice and consent  responsibility--to determine whether a nominee is a fit character or  unfit character.   So we here in the Senate are not doing our job. Under our  responsibility under the Constitution, if we vote today, not having yet  reviewed the information in those emails that the judge has just said  must be released, we are being asked--or, more pointedly, forced--by  the majority leader to rush through the confirmation of Mr. Pruitt  without having this vital information.   This is a question of transparency. This is a question of exercising  our authority in a responsible fashion. This is about the right of the  Members of the Senate to have the information needed to fulfill their  responsibility under the Constitution. This is about the right of the  citizens of the United States to know Members here are doing their job  and to weigh in--to weigh in with us on what they consider to be fit  character and unfit character. We should not deny Americans the right  to know.   That is why I will ask unanimous consent of this Chamber in a moment  to postpone the vote until 10 a.m. on March 3, because that would give  us the full ability to get both sets of emails and have 3 days to  review them, which I think is most reasonable.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the confirmation vote  on Calendar No. 15, the nomination of Scott Pruitt for Administrator of  the Environmental Protection Agency, be postponed until 10 a.m. on  March 3.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Mr. McCONNELL. I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   The Senator from Oregon.    Madam President, I am disappointed with the majority  leader's objection. I know all of us who serve in this Chamber want to  do our job in a fashion in which we thoroughly and responsibly execute  the responsibilities of our office. We can't do that without these  emails. These emails have been stonewalled for 2 years. I know that if  the shoe were on the other foot, there is a very good chance the  advocacy for transparency would be coming from multiple Members across  the aisle.   So I am disappointed the decision has been made to object to holding  the vote after the time that both sets of emails have been released.  But I do understand the majority leader has responsibility for the  schedule for the Senate. So I am going to tailor back my request and  ask that the vote be held after the first batch of emails is released.  They are going to be held next Tuesday and we are going to be out next  week. So under this request, no time is lost in the Chamber in  considering the nomination. It does not delay any other work of this  Chamber. It does not stand in the way of anything else we might do. It  just means that we hold the vote when we get back, instead of holding  it this afternoon before we leave.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the confirmation vote  on Calendar No. 15, the nomination of Scott Pruitt for Administrator of  the Environmental Protection Agency, be postponed until 9 p.m. on  February 27.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Mr. McCONNELL. I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   The Senator from Oregon.    Madam President, both of my unanimous consent requests  have been rejected, as is the right of any Member. But still, there is  a principle here--a principle of executing our responsibilities and a  principle of transparency, a principle of understanding whether or not  the individual before us is a fit character to serve in the office.   So I am going to make a formal motion, which is allowed under the  rules, to extend this debate. The rules call for 30 hours of debate but  provide a clause that, by a vote, we can extend that debate. I propose  we extend that debate for an additional 248 hours. That 248 hours would  take us until Monday evening, on the evening we return. So again, no  time is lost with the agenda before this body, but we would all have  the chance to review those 3,000--or at least the first batch of those  emails--to determine if there is information that is related to whether  the nominee is fit or unfit to hold this office.    I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.   Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, over the past several weeks, we have  seen a historic level of obstruction from our Democratic colleagues on  the President's Cabinet. Let me say that again--truly historic,  unprecedented, harmful, and pointless obstruction. It is one thing to  obstruct to get some outcome. Really, these are a collection of futile  gestures not changing the outcome on any of these nominations.   They have postponed committee meetings as long as they possibly  could. They forced unnecessary procedural hurdles, and they have even  boycotted markups altogether.   So as I indicated, to what end? It hasn't prevented the Senate from  moving forward with the confirmation of these nominees. And, by the  way, it hasn't--and it won't--change the outcome of the election,  either, which was back in November. I think it is pretty clear that  that is what this is all about.   Instead, this Democratic obstruction has just kept many of our  Nation's most critical agencies without a leader for too long-- needlessly delaying the President from fully standing up this new  administration. It has led to what is now the longest it has taken to  confirm most of the President's Cabinet since George Washington--what a  record for our Democratic colleagues to hold.   Enough is enough. We need to put the rest of the President's Cabinet  into place without further delay. Confirming these well-qualified  nominees is what is best for our country. My goodness, isn't that what  we should all want?   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.    Madam President, when President Richard Nixon created  the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970, he recognized that we all  share in a ``profound commitment to the rescue of our natural  environment and the preservation of the Earth as a place both habitable  by and hospitable to man.'' That is a pretty powerful commitment. That  is the mission of the Environmental Protection Agency--to rescue our  natural environment and keep our planet--our world, our Earth--as  habitable and hospitable to humankind.   For more than 46 years, the Environmental Protection Agency has been  the top cop on the beat, safeguarding our natural environment while  also protecting critical aspects of public health--controlling toxic  and poisonous chemicals, improving air and water quality, enhancing  vehicle efficiency and emissions controls. The lists of the  Environmental Protection Agency's accomplishments go on and on.   Today, we are considering President Trump's nominee for the  Environmental Protection Agency. The appropriate question for us to ask  is, Does this nominee hold in his heart the mission of the  Environmental Protection Agency? Does he have a profound commitment to  the rescue of our natural environment, a profound commitment to the  preservation of the Earth to keep it habitable by humankind, hospitable  to humankind?   This individual is Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt. We would  like to have the full set of information about his work as attorney  general that has been very relevant to this question, because the  limited information we have shows that he has very deep connections and  very close allegiance to the fossil fuel industry. And rather than  displaying during his time as AG a profound commitment to our natural  environment, to preserve it and keep it hospitable and habitable, he  has instead weighed in time and time again on behalf of the polluters.    So for us to have a full sense of these connections, we need to have  access to the emails and correspondence that he has generated over the  last 2 years tied to the fossil fuel industry.   There are some 3,000 emails and associated pieces of correspondence-- we are not sure of the exact total, but that is a substantial body of  information that has been identified--and for 2 years, the attorney  general, Scott Pruitt, has stonewalled the efforts to obtain these  documents. There have been repeated requests time and time again filed  with his office, and his office has failed to produce the information  requested under the Public Information Act of Oklahoma. Time and time  again, he said no, no, no.   So then he comes to this body as a nominee to be the steward-in-chief  of the responsibilities for our environment. So here in the Senate, we  asked for those emails to help understand  [[Page S1382]]  whether he has served the public or whether he has served the  polluters. That is the question before us. He said: Well, apply to the  attorney general's office of Oklahoma for those emails and information.   This is rather unique. I don't know if this has ever happened in the  history of the United States, the nominee saying: Yes, you can acquire  that information by applying to me, back in my role as attorney  general, knowing full well that he had absolutely no intention of  actually providing that information.   Then yesterday a court stepped forward and said: Yes, this  information must be provided. This is not the type of information that  can be compiled overnight, so they gave Attorney General Scott Pruitt a  couple of days--until next Tuesday--to be able to compile this  information and provide it. And when it is provided, it will simply be  the equivalent of PDF documents--scanned copies, if you will--of the  printed copies of the emails and correspondence. Then it has to be  shipped out to the group that applied for the information, and then  they have to digitize it and send it out for us to have it here. It is  still not searchable. Then we need time to go through it.   Well, it is convenient that we delay this vote until after we have  this information because we are not going to be here next week. So  whether we hold the vote at this moment, scheduled for 1 p.m., as we  are leaving for a week or we hold it until when we return, on the  Monday we return, it doesn't have any impact on slowing down this body.  It would cost nothing in terms of the processing of the President's  nominees to delay this vote until we return, at which time we will have  the emails, and we will have had time to examine them, and the public  will have had time to examine them, and that would honor our  responsibility.   The Constitution was laid out in a fashion to put full responsibility  on the individuals staffing the key agencies and Cabinet departments  with the President. The Founders, the writers of the Constitution,  wrestled with who should have that responsibility. They thought perhaps  the appropriate check would be to have the Congress--they refer to it  as ``Assembly'' in their dialogues--the Assembly decide who would be  the folks staffing the executive branch at the highest levels of  management. They said that was a problem because there wouldn't be full  transparency. The public wouldn't be able to determine why one person  was chosen or another person was chosen. There might be all kinds of  trades taking place between the Senators. One might say: If you give me  my choice for this Cabinet post, I will give you your choice for  another, and the public wouldn't even know how those deals were being  struck.   So the public accountability was honored by our Founders by saying  the President will nominate, but in case the President goes off track  and starts to nominate people of unfit character--unfit character--the  Senate will have the responsibility to review the person's record and  stop that nomination. That is our responsibility. That is the  deterrence that Hamilton used, that we would take the process of this  Chamber to ensure we do not confirm someone of unfit character. But to  make that determination, we must have access to those emails, which are  going to be distributed next Tuesday.   Madam President, I yield the floor to my colleague.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.    Could we have that unanimous consent request restated?    Could we have that unanimous consent request restated?    No objection.    No objection.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  allowed to speak for 2 minutes, followed by Senator Heinrich for 10  minutes and Senator Tester for 10 minutes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   The Senator from Oregon.    Madam President, I thank the floor staff who were here  through the night last night and also the staff of the Republican  cloakroom and the Democratic cloakroom. They have enabled us to  continue this process at great expense to their energy and fatigue. As  Senators, we all appreciate the team that has made this possible.   I also want to draw attention to a letter from 773 EPA employees, who  state:         We write as former employees of the Environmental       Protection Agency (EPA) to share our concerns about Oklahoma       Attorney General Scott Pruitt's qualifications to serve as       the next EPA Administrator in light of his record in       Oklahoma. . . . Our Perspective is not partisan. Having       served under both Republican and Democratic presidents, we       recognize each new Administration's right to pursue different       policies within the parameters of existing law and to ask       Congress to change the laws that protect public health and       the environment as it sees fit.        However, every EPA Administrator has a fundamental       obligation to act in the public's interest based on current       law and the best available science. Mr. Pruitt's record       raises serious questions about whose interests he has served       to date.    Madam President, with that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator  Peters be allowed to speak for 5 minutes, followed by Senator Carper  for 10 minutes, followed by Senator Barrasso for 10 minutes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The Senator from Michigan.
