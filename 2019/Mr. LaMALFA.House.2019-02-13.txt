 Madam Speaker, last year, veterans from northern  California brought an issue to our attention. Due to a flaw in the  current law, the Department of Veterans' Affairs cannot include almost  any information about the spouse of a veteran on a VA-provided  tombstone at a non-VA cemetery.   That is why last week I introduced the Honoring Veterans' Families  Act to rectify this issue and allow the spouse of a veteran to be  included on the veteran's grave marker on their death.   With all that veterans and their families sacrifice for this country,  is that too much to ask?  [[Page H1533]]    Every veteran should have the opportunity to include their spouse on  their own tombstone should they wish to do so.   I would like to thank my colleague from California (Mr. Panetta), a  veteran himself, for joining with me to correct this oversight in a  bipartisan effort. Honoring the families of our veterans is something  that everyone can and should support.                            ____________________
