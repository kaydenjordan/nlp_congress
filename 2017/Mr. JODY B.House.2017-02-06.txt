 HICE of Georgia. I thank my friend and colleague for  leading this Special Order and for taking the leadership on this very  important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I am here to try to implore our leadership to bring H.J.  Res. 27 to the floor and, hopefully, to enable us, the Members of the  people's House, to strike down this deeply flawed and deceptively  written Death with Dignity Act that has been passed in the District of  Columbia.   This is not a bill about the elderly. It is not a bill about the sick  and dying, as has been stated here. This is a bill that legalizes  suicide. It actually attempts to normalize euthanasia. As you know, Mr.  Speaker, this bill applies to individuals with ``a terminal disease.''  We all know that could be applied to almost anyone. We could have  someone with diabetes, for example, who is able to live a perfectly  normal life, in spite of the fact of having an insulin dependency, but  without the insulin, it could be terminal--they would be. So this bill  applies to individuals who also may have been misdiagnosed.   I appreciate Mr. Rothfus mentioning Jeanette Hall. What a powerful  story that is--someone who actually voted for this bill in Oregon, and  then a few years later comes to find out that she herself has cancer.  She tries to have her doctor help her end her life. The doctor urges  her to fight to have treatment. She does so, and now 16 years later,  she is alive and healthy.   There is no reason for us to have this bill. If you look at the  suicide rate in Oregon since that bill was passed in that State in  1997, they have 42 percent above the national average of suicide in  that State.   I appreciate Dr. Wenstrup, too. Just the flaws that he identified  that this bill has are alarming. The fact that it, more than likely,  will--certainly, the potential is there--lead to elder abuse. The bill  has no requirement that the death certificate lists the real cause of  death. It will just be required to say ``natural causes'' when, in  fact, there was a lethal drug injected. The drug itself is not required  to be disclosed. The bill does not require a medical professional to be  present to administer the lethal drug.   Furthermore, as was alluded to a moment ago, the bill bars law  enforcement and, arguably, courts from reviewing medical records at the  Department of Health, effectively potentially preventing them from  doing their jobs in cases where there may have been foul play.   Mr. Speaker, please know that this does not simply apply to D.C.  residents but to those who reside in D.C., which would include everyone  in this House.   I urge my colleagues to join in cosponsoring H.J. Res. 27. I urge our  leadership to bring this to the floor for a vote. I thank the gentleman  for giving me the opportunity to speak.                                time  1945
