 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment to the  National Defense Authorization Act, which will accelerate the  modernization of the F-22 fighter wing at Tyndall Air Force Base. This  is one of only three F-22 training wings in the Air Force.   We have the most highly trained and dedicated military in the world.  But if we are not giving them the resources to maintain their planes  and training them in the most realistic environments possible, we are  doing them a disservice. Over the last year, we have begun to correct  that problem and rebuild our military and invest in our servicemembers.   Modernizing the training wing of F-22s at Tyndall Air Force Base is  another step in that process and is essential to the safety and  security of the airmen we ask to achieve air superiority over  battlefields all around the globe.   We are giving certainty to our warfighters with this NDAA, and I urge  all of my colleagues to support this important legislation.                            ____________________
