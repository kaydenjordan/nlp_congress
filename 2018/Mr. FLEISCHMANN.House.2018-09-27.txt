 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Salvation  Army of Greater Chattanooga as they celebrate their 125th anniversary.  This exceptional organization has been an integral part of the Hamilton  County community, helping those in need with compassion and uplifting  them during the most trying of times.   The Salvation Army of Chattanooga opened its doors on March 16, 1893.  Never pausing in their service to the community, the Salvation Army  continued operations through World War I, the Great Depression, and  World War II. For 125 years, members of the Salvation Army have worked  to feed, clothe, and empower the great people of Tennessee's Third  District.   On a number of occasions, I can reflect on many fond memories with  the Salvation Army. During the holiday season, I have had the honor of  being kettle co-chairman with my wonderful wife of 32 years, Brenda-- today we are celebrating our 32nd wedding anniversary--to serve this  outstanding organization and its wonderful people. As a matter of fact,  my wonderful wife, Brenda, serves on the board of directors with  several outstanding Chattanoogans.   Regardless of the time of year, whenever I spend time at the  Salvation Army on McCallie Avenue, I witness Tennesseans coming  together to provide help, hope, and healing to one another. That is the  embodiment of the great Volunteer spirit.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the Salvation Army of  Greater Chattanooga on 125 years of service. I am sure they will  continue to do the most good for residents of Hamilton and surrounding  counties for many years to come.                            ____________________
