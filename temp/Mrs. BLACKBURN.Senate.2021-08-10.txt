 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my  amendment No. 3062 be called up and reported by number.    Mr. President, this amendment maintains what has been  the existing right of any Senator to weigh in on the special treatment  we give to designated funds.   As it stands, this current budget resolution would destroy that right  and allow a simple majority of Senators free rein to declare anything  and everything an emergency. Without this amendment, fiscal discipline  will go out the window, along with the rules laid out in the Budget Act  and any chance of countering the Biden administration's reckless  socialist agenda.   The existing rule worked for bipartisan COVID relief, and it will  continue to work for this body. There is nothing broken here to fix.    Mr. President, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the  amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.
