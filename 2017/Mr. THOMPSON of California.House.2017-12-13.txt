 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding and also for her leadership in regard to gun violence  prevention and all the work that she has done and all of the effort she  has put forward to try and bring some common sense to this issue.   The speaker before me said that she will never forget what happened  at Sandy Hook and where she was when that tragedy took place. I don't  think there are any of us who know what Sandy Hook was or were in  Congress when Sandy Hook happened or care about this issue who will  ever forget where we were.   For me, I was in my home State of California, in the Sacramento  Valley, in a duck blind. I was duck hunting. Yes, I am a hunter. I am a  gun owner. I carried a weapon in Vietnam during the Vietnam war. I  strongly support the Second Amendment.   But I truly and passionately believe that, as a responsible gun  owner, I have a responsibility, as does every responsible gun owner in  the United States of America, to speak out to make sure that everyone  who handles and owns a firearm does it safely and responsibly and that  we do everything we can to make sure that people who shouldn't get  their hands on firearms don't.   I know you can't stop everybody, but we should be doing everything we  can to minimize the likelihood that someone who shouldn't have a  firearm--a criminal, a domestic abuser, someone who is dangerously  mentally ill--doesn't get their hands on firearms.   Last week, families who lost loved ones in the Sandy Hook massacre  came here to Capitol Hill to share their grief and to call for action  to deal with this terrible, terrible thing we call gun violence. This  was a day after the House passed the dangerous Concealed Carry  Reciprocity bill that would let criminals convicted of violent crimes  carry loaded concealed guns in virtually every State in the country.   Instead of honoring the 20 precious little children and the 6 brave  and dedicated educators who were slaughtered at Sandy Hook, the  Republican leadership put the gun lobby ahead of State laws and ahead  of gun violence prevention.   We have had 40 moments of silence since Sandy Hook. Forty moments of  silence. Meanwhile, there have been 1,500 mass shootings since that  awful day in December, 5 years ago.   64,000 people in the United States of America have been killed by  someone using a gun. Last week, the families of those victims asked us  one thing. They asked us to honor their loved ones with action, stop  the gun lobby's reckless and profit-driven agenda, and stand up  [[Page H9893]]  for communities all across this country.   As I have said before, I am a gun owner. I have owned and used guns  all of my life. I support the Second Amendment.   I am here tonight to call on the Republican leadership to come to the  table. Let's move commonsense, bipartisan legislation that will keep us  safe, keep our communities safe, and still honor the Second Amendment.   I care about the people in my district, as I know all of you care  about the people in your districts. I have a son who is a deputy  sheriff. I certainly don't want him to go out on a call and meet up  with somebody who shouldn't have a gun. I have got grandchildren in my  community. I certainly don't want them exposed to people who shouldn't  have guns.   I am here tonight to call on the Republican leadership to do  something about this. Let's move this commonsense, bipartisan  legislation. We can start by expanding background checks to make it  harder for criminals and the dangerously mentally ill to get their  hands on guns. This should be the first line of defense. Congress  should make that happen.   Ninety-two percent of the American people believe we should expand  background checks. What is the harm in checking to ensure that someone  is not a criminal or to ensure that someone is not dangerously mentally  ill before we allow them to buy a gun and take it off into the  community where they can possibly do some harm?   We put these ideas up before this leadership and there has been  silence. No hearings on the bill, no votes on the bill.   Well, if the Republican leadership doesn't like our ideas about how  to curb gun violence, then how about putting together a select  committee of both Democrats and Republicans? Charge that select  committee with working on the issue of gun violence prevention and to  come up with some ideas that will keep our communities safe.                                time  1915    We owe it to the families of Sandy Hook and to all those who have  lost someone to gun violence. We dishonor their memory when we do  nothing, and that is what is happening under this leadership: we are  doing nothing. That is shameful. We need to make sure that we do  everything we can to help prevent gun violence.
