 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.

Sarbanes, for his ceaseless efforts to preserve  Fort McHenry in Baltimore, MD. Senator Sarbanes worked tirelessly to  honor the site and elevate the history of the War of 1812 in the  national consciousness throughout his career. This legislation  acknowledges his long-term advocacy for the preservation of the site  and the improvement of the visitor experience by designating the  visitor and education center the Paul S. Sarbanes Visitor and Education  Center.   I first got to know Senator Sarbanes when he first ran for public  office in 1966. We both were elected to the Maryland General Assembly  that year, and we became good friends. Delegate Sarbanes at that point  made a name for himself on the House Judiciary Committee in the  Maryland General Assembly and was a rising star from his first day in  the Maryland General Assembly. He shortly thereafter ran for the U.S.  House of Representatives, where he served three terms with a very  distinguished record. His service in the House occurred during the  Watergate scandal. Representative Sarbanes was on the Judiciary  Committee and was given the responsibility of the first Article of  Impeachment against President Nixon. That article dealt with  obstruction of justice. It was the key article against President Nixon  on impeachment, and it is very telling that a relatively young and  junior Member of the House of Representatives was entrusted with  pursuing and presenting it. It was because of his work ethic, his  commitment to scholarship, and his understanding of legal issues that  he was entrusted with such an awesome responsibility.   Paul Sarbanes then served five terms in the U.S. Senate, the longest  term for any Senator in Maryland's history, which Senator Barbara  Mikulski ties 10 years later. Paul Sarbanes was known as a Senator's  Senator for his integrity and for his principled commitment to public  service. He was a Rhodes Scholar who chose to serve the public rather  than using his skills in the private sector for his own personal gain.  His entire life was devoted to public service. What a legacy he has  left us by his incredible public service. In 2002, the Enron scandal  hit America, and Senator Sarbanes, then chairing the Banking Committee,  teamed up with House Financial Services Committee Chair Michael Oxley  ass the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation. Then-President George W. Bush  called the Sarbanes-Oxley bill ``the most far-reaching reforms of  American business practices since the time of Franklin Delano  Roosevelt.'' From Watergate to Enron and beyond, Paul Sarbanes stepped  into the breach and he delivered on behalf of the American people. It  is a fitting tribute to name the Visitor Center at Fort McHenry  National Monument and Historic Shrine after a true American hero: Paul  S. Sarbanes.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Brown, Ms. Smith, Mr.          Blumenthal, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Warnock, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr.          Schatz, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Booker, Mr. Lujan, Mr. Fetterman, Mr.          Welch, Mr. Padilla, and Ms. Butler):   S. 3549.
