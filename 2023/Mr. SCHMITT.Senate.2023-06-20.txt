 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and  celebrate the work being done by Camp Barnabas in Purdy, MO, a  remarkable organization that provides summer camp opportunities for  individuals with disabilities.   Founded in 1994, Camp Barnabas has compassionately transformed the  lives of nearly 100,000 individuals with special needs. When I had the  opportunity to visit Camp Barnabas, I saw the tremendous amount of care  and professionalism their staff exhibits to ensure that every camper  gets to experience summer camp just like every other kid. Their  ministry in Southwest Missouri touches countless lives and inspires  positive experiences in an environment where everyone can thrive, no  matter what hand life has dealt them.   As they undergo a ribbon cutting soon for their new water park, the  camp will be offering another unique opportunity for these campers to  have an incredible summer and make amazing memories. This new water  park is designed to make sure individuals of all abilities can  participate and includes an intentional space for sensory relief, a  lazy river, splash pads, adaptive slides, and several wheelchair  accessible features.   I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing and celebrating  the incredible work from Camp Barnabas and share in their excitement as  they unveil their new water park features to provide more amazing  summer camp experiences for their campers.                            ____________________
