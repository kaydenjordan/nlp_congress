 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday evening, as everyone knows, the  group of bipartisan Senators working on infrastructure finished the  text of the bill. I immediately moved to make that text the base of the  bill here on the floor, as promised.   Last night, Democrats offered to begin the amendment process right  away. There are three bipartisan amendments to the bill ready to  consider. Two were led by Republicans: a Rounds-Smith amendment and  Thune-Tester amendment, and another from Senators Padilla and Moran.   Let me be clear. These three amendments would constitute only the  first  [[Page S5530]]  tranche of potential amendments. The Senate can and should consider  more amendments afterward.   I encourage Senators from both sides of the aisle to submit potential  amendments to the bill. And, as we have already done several times this  year--on the anti-Asian hate crimes bill and the U.S. Innovation and  Competition Act, just to name two examples--the majority will work with  the minority to put together packages of amendments for the Senate to  vote on.   At the moment, we need consent from our Republican colleagues to  start the amendment process, and we await their answer. I hope we can  use our time in the Senate efficiently.   Let's start voting on amendments. The longer it takes to finish the  bill, the longer we will be here.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following amendment to the substitute be called up and reported by  number: Lummis-Kelly No. 2181; further, that the Senate vote in  relation to the amendment on Tuesday, August 3, at 11:45 a.m., with no  amendments in order to the amendment prior to a vote in relation to the  amendment, with 60 affirmative votes required for adoption and 2  minutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10:30 a.m.,  Tuesday, August 3, 2021; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; and that upon  conclusion of morning business, the Senate resume consideration of H.R.  3684.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 9 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, August 3, 2021, at 10:30 a.m.                            ____________________
