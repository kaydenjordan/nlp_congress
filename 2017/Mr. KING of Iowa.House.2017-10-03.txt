 Mr. Speaker, I am privileged to address the House  of Representatives on this issue, as I seek to do on each pro-life  issue that we have come before this Congress.   This is a powerful piece of legislation that has had a lot of hands  on it to produce good work; and the difference in this debate that you  hear here, Mr. Speaker, is anecdotes on this side, looking for  exceptions that might sway, somehow, the people on the side that  understand the rule is this: life begins at the moment of conception.   Human life is sacred in all of its forms, and these little babies  that are 20-weeks mature can and have and do survive outside the womb,  and they can feel pain inside the womb. And doctors that are doing  surgery on pregnant mothers give anesthetic to those children because  they don't want them flinching in the womb and suffering while they do  the surgery.   How can we support a ghastly procedure of abortion on demand to end  the life of the miracles that we need to put this country in the right  condition?   Sixty-five percent of the babies 22 to 26 weeks old survive that are  born premature. As I said, we know they feel pain.   So I applaud everyone who has done the work on this. I stand solidly  with the entire pro-life movement we have in this country. We have a  long ways to go to get to where we need to be, but this is a step in  the right direction.
