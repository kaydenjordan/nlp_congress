 Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Armed Services  Committee and as the Senator from the great State of New Mexico, it is  my honor to recognize all of the patriotic Americans who have  contributed to 75 years of accomplishments and history at White Sands  Missile Range, WSMR.   In the final months of America's engagement in World War II and as  the Manhattan Project's unprecedented scientific mission achieved its  secret goal of harnessing nuclear power, the U.S. Army established the  White Sands Proving Ground on July 9, 1945, in New Mexico's Tularosa  Basin. Seven days later, the detonation of the first atomic bomb at the  Trinity Site ushered in the nuclear era and began what would become  three-quarters of a century of major scientific breakthroughs, critical  weapons testing and evaluation, and military technology advances.   We must acknowledge the sacrifices New Mexicans have made over the  years that contributed to both the establishment and the enduring  missions at WSMR. That includes the families whose historic homes and  ranches were taken to create WSMR's land base. It includes local  residents in the Tularosa Basin who were downwind from the Trinity test  and whose lives continue to be impacted. It includes the local  communities in southern New Mexico who play a vital role in supporting  WSMR's success today.   WSMR is a landmark of technological advances for all branches of the  [[Page S4213]]  military. Following World War II, White Sands was where German  scientist Werner Von Braun conceived, developed, and tested the long- range V-2 rockets, initiating America's space program. Since then,  White Sands has continued to support essential defense and space  exploration programs for the Department of Defense and the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration, alongside other important  scientific research.   Today's WSMR, which spans 3,200 square miles of the Tularosa Basin,  is the Department of Defense's largest, fully-instrumented test range.  It provides our Armed Forces, our allies, and defense technology  partners with unrivaled terrain for research, testing, evaluation,  experimentation, and training that ensures our defense readiness. WSMR  executes an average of 5,000 tests each year. These tests, in emerging  technologies such as swarming autonomous and unmanned systems, joint  integrated air and missile defense, nuclear weapons effects, and space  based capabilities, will keep WSMR at the forefront of our national  defense for years to come.   As part of the Army Test and Evaluation Command, WSMR is the Army  Center of Excellence for Air and Missile Defense Test Bed and Precision  Fires Rockets and Missiles. White Sands supports key capabilities in  the National Defense Strategy and modernization priorities, including  directed energy systems such as laser and high-powered microwave  systems, kinetics, electromagnetic pulse, hypersonic and long-range  precision fires, U.S. Space Program test support, nuclear weapons  effects, and autonomous systems.   While it is a U.S. Army installation stewarded by the Army, WSMR is  chartered as a tri-service installation, home to elements of the U.S.  Army, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Air Force. Other organizations conducting  operations at WSMR include NASA, National Reconnaissance Office,  Defense Threat Reduction Agency, the Research and Analysis Center,  Center for Countermeasures, and Combat Capabilities Development Command  (Data and Analysis Center and Army Research Laboratory).   WSMR also hosts the Bataan Memorial Death March each year, a large  and growing event that recognizes the heroism and sacrifice of the New  Mexicans and others who endured and in many cases lost their lives to  the horrors of World War II's Bataan Death March. I have had the  distinct honor of joining this incredible event on a few occasions and  treasure the valuable lessons it imparts on everyone who participates.   I want to extend my sincere appreciation and congratulations to  everyone who works hard every single day at WSMR to keep all of us  safe. President John F. Kennedy stated it best, when he stood before  your predecessors at WSMR during a visit on June 5, 1963. President  Kennedy said: ``What you do here far and away from Washington, far away  from our great capitals, far away from so many countries which depend  upon us, what you do here, what progress you make, what dedication you  demonstrate makes a significant difference to the security of our  country and those who depend upon us.''   I could not agree more. I wish everyone at WSMR a happy 75th  anniversary and will continue to support WSMR's critical work in  defense of our great Nation.                            ____________________
