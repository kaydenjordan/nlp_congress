 Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent to speak as  if in morning business.    Mr. President, I rise this afternoon, almost the evening  now, to reflect on the sad news that we received today that Rich  Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO, passed away today.   I wanted to try to provide some perspective, at least from my vantage  point as a Pennsylvanian, because he was a son of Pennsylvania, born in  Southwestern Pennsylvania, in Greene County.   Greene County, for those who don't know where it is, is in the  furthest southwestern corner of our State, the corner where  Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia meet.   Rich Trumka was a man who fought his whole life in the cause of  justice, fighting on behalf of working men and women. Before he became  president of the AFL-CIO, obviously a national position, he also, as a  very young man--I think he might have been 32 at the time--served as  the president of the United Mine Workers of America, that union. And  that was during a very difficult time for coal miners and their  families.   And then, in that position and in so many others, he fought for  workers everywhere, literally the world over--not just here in America  but workers in South Africa and other parts of the world.   So to sum up what he meant to this country is difficult, but I think  it can be said of Rich Trumka that he spent every day of his adult life  advancing the cause of justice: the cause of justice for workers; the  cause of economic justice, social justice, and racial justice. He  dedicated his life in service to American workers and their families.   I wanted to reflect a little bit about two parts of his life: first  of all, his roots and then, secondly, his work and his contributions.   I mentioned that Rich was a native of Greene County, PA--Southwestern  Pennsylvania--a coal county. He was not just a miner himself as a young  man, before and actually overlapping, really, getting a degree at Penn  State and then eventually getting a law degree at Villanova University,  but he  [[Page S5921]]  worked in the coal mines himself. He was a third-generation miner. Both  his father and grandfather and uncles--just like any coal-mining  community, virtually everyone was working in the mines.   The town that he was born in and raised in goes by the name of  Nemacolin, PA, in Greene County, right on the Greene County-Fayette  County border. And it was that kind of community, a coal-mining  community, as was most of Greene County in those days.   I think of this community from the perspective of my own ancestors'  background. I come from the other end of the State, all the way up in  the northeastern part of the State--Scranton, Lackawanna County,  Northeastern Pennsylvania, also a coal community. Lackawanna County,  Luzerne County, Carbon County, Susquehanna County, Northumberland  County--I may have left one out, but they were the main counties that  were producing anthracite coal, hard coal. Where Rich and his family  were living was so-called bituminous coal--soft coal, as they used to  call it.   In 1894, the great novelist Stephen Crane, who is famous for, among  other novels, ``The Red Badge of Courage''--Stephen Crane visited a  coal mine near my hometown of Scranton, and he was, at the time, a very  young man. I think he passed away before the age of 30. So he was in  his twenties when he wrote a long essay about visiting this coal mine,  a beautiful description but a haunting description of what a coal mine  was like in 1894.   Now, when Rich Trumka went into the mines in the late sixties, of  course, there were great advancements to protect workers, new  technology, other protections that his ancestors and mine would not  have benefited from. But you are still going underground. You are still  going every day into that darkness, into that place of so many risks,  what Stephen Crane called a place of ``inscrutable darkness, a  soundless place of tangible loneliness.''   That is how he described his first impression of a coal mine, when  Crane was just in his twenties. Later, he described all the ways you  could die in that coal mine, what he called the 100 perils of dying in  a coal mine. Of course, this is in the context of the 1890s, but he  said:         There is an insidious, silent enemy in the gas. If the huge       fanwheel on the top of the earth should stop for a brief       period, there is certain death. If a man escapes the gas, the       floods, the ``squeezes'' of falling rock, the cars shooting       through little tunnels, the precarious elevators, the hundred       perils, there usually comes to him an attack of ``miner's       asthma'' that slowly racks and shakes him into the grave.    He was talking about pneumoconiosis, what they used to call miner's  asthma in the old, old days.   Rich Trumka understood that. His own family members had died from  that same cause of death. It wasn't some theory or some passage he read  in a history book or even a passage that he might have read from  Stephen Crane. He lived it. His father and his grandfather and his  extended family and his community lived it.   And that awareness, that understanding of danger in the workplace,  that understanding of suffering that workers still face today--in a  different context but certainly faced in a coal mine all those years  ago--is part of who he was. And to understand Rich Trumka and his  contributions to American working men and women, you have to understand  where he came from, those roots.   So I am thinking about that today because of the connection to my own  region of Pennsylvania; really, the connection to my own family. I am  far removed from it. We had, I guess, four generations before me  working the coal mines, but it kind of stopped when my grandfather  worked there as a child and then was able to escape the mines.   These were people who not only understood labor and suffering and  contribution to their community, these are people who kept their  promises. That is why we fought so hard just a couple of years ago--the  Presiding Officer was one of the people waging this battle--to get  healthcare benefits for retired miners. They waited year after year  after year, when we finally had a breakthrough. And one of the  arguments we were making is, these miners had kept their promise. They  were told by their country, by their government--the Federal  Government--that those benefits would be there for them. And the  Federal Government was not, at that time, keeping its promise.   You had miners who had kept their promise to their country--sometimes  serving in combat and World War II or the Korean war or Vietnam and  Iraq and Afghanistan--but also keeping their promise to their employer  to work every day in the most dangerous job in the world, and, of  course, they kept their promise to their family.   So Rich Trumka knew what it meant to make a commitment and to keep  your promise, to never break faith with those to whom you had made the  promise. And that is why workers all over the country trusted him. They  knew that he came from them, that he understood their struggles, and  that he kept his promises. So to understand the life of Rich Trumka and  what he meant to this country, what he meant to workers, you have to  understand his roots in the coal mines.   How about his work? Well, it was a lifetime of fighting battles tooth  and nail for workers, first for coal miners and then for workers across  the board, represented by the AFL-CIO.   And there is no way, if I had a half an hour or several hours--there  is no way I could encapsulate his work leading the AFL-CIO. So I won't  try to do that. But suffice it to say, if there was a battle on  healthcare or pensions or the minimum wage or the right to organize and  bargain collectively, Rich Trumka was at the center of it, often the  leader of all those battles, and it is noteworthy--and this, of course,  applies to Rich Trumka but also any labor organization or any labor  leader--often fighting battles for the rest of us, battles that they  had already won. Rich Trumka was trying to preserve the protections of  the Affordable Care Act, and yet as the leader of the AFL-CIO, unions  have already bargained and negotiated for healthcare benefits. But he  knew that other people who were not members of a union needed that  protection, needed the protection and the security that a family would  need that the Affordable Care Act would provide.   The minimum wage, another example. Unions had already bargained for  their wage--in almost every instance, higher than minimum wage. But  there they were, and there he was, Rich Trumka, on the street, marching  and battling for an increase in the minimum wage, even though his  entire membership already had a higher wage, always helping those who  didn't have power.   It is difficult on a day like today to be comprehensive in a  recitation of all that Rich Trumka contributed to working men and women  and, by extension, our country.   But I think our best tribute is not what we will say in a floor  speech or in a statement or even in a eulogy, as important as those  words are, as important as it is to pay tribute--maybe the best tribute  of all that we can contribute, that we can offer in memory of Rich  Trumka, is to keep up the work, to pick up the banner and keep  marching, keep fighting. And we have one of those opportunities in the  next few months in the opportunity that presents itself in the form of  a piece of legislation that Senator Murray talked about from the floor  today and she has led the fight on--the PRO Act, the Protecting the  Right to Organize Act, that Rich Trumka spent his whole life--or, I  should say, the most recent years of his life trying to enact into law.  Our tribute to him should be to pass that piece of legislation.   Let me conclude with condolences for Rich's family, especially his  wife Barbara and his son and the men and women of the AFL-CIO who have  lost a leader but, more importantly, have lost a friend, someone who  would walk with them in every battle. May it be said of all of us that  we will walk those same battle lines with him.   With that, I will yield the floor    Mr. President, today I wish to honor the  distinguished life and career of Patrick J. Solano, who passed away on  January 23, 2021. I am proud to remember Pat, a resident of Pittston  Township, PA, decorated World War II veteran and lifelong public  servant. Pat will be remembered at an annual golf tournament in Luzerne  County on August 6.   In 1942, Pat was drafted by the U.S. Army Air Corps after he  graduated from Pittston Township High School. During his military  career, he served as a flight engineer on 23 combat missions with the  Eighth United States Air Force Heavy Bombardment Group, aboard the B-17  Flying Fortress. For his service during World War II, he was awarded  the Group Presidential Citation, the Air Force Medal with two oakleaf  clusters, and the Europe Combat Theater Medal with two Bronze Stars.   Pat's service to our country did not end with World War II, as he  came home and embarked on a lifetime of public service at both the  local and State level in Pennsylvania. He was recognized as a trusted  political adviser for almost 50 years and served in the administrations  of nine Governors of both political parties. His service to the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania crossed party lines, and he became known  as a voice of reason and a unifying force in Harrisburg.   He served in the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Regulation,  later known as the department of environmental protection. Later, he  was appointed the acting secretary for the department of conservation  and natural resources when it was first created in 1995. Pat helped to  shape the future of the department and its mission to conserve and  sustain Pennsylvania's natural resources for present and future  generations.   My thoughts and prayers are with Pat's wife, Marie; his children,  Mary Pat, Cathy, Anita, Rita, Liz, and Anne; his 11 grandchildren and 3  great-grandchildren; and his countless friends.                            ____________________
