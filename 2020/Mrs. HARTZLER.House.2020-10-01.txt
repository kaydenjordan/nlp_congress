 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Swisher  Acquisition, Inc., of Warrensburg, Missouri, on their success producing  American-made products.   Swisher-branded products were chosen to participate in the White  House's fourth annual Made in America Product Showcase on October 5.  This event celebrates the hard work and dedication of American workers,  businesses, and their products. Businesses from each of the 50 States  have been invited to display their American-made products at the White  House.   It is an honor and achievement for Swisher Acquisition, Inc. to be  selected to represent the great State of Missouri, and I am proud to  represent them in Congress.   Swisher Acquisition, Inc. is an outdoor power equipment manufacturer  dating back to 1945. All products are American-made and commercially  graded and carried in stores around the world, such as Home Depot,  Cabela's, Atwoods, and more.   At the showcase, the Swisher Brand Outdoor Power Equipment; ESP  Branded Safe Rooms, Tornado, and Storm Shelters; Swisher Branded  Agricultural Products; and the new 2021 Huckleberry's Hammers and LogOX  Brand Products will be on display.   I encourage all to take the opportunity to view all displayed  American-made products and see the outcome of American ingenuity.   Please join me in congratulating Swisher Acquisition, Inc. on this  tremendous accomplishment.                        Recognizing All Saints' Church     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the All Saints'  Church in Nevada, Missouri, and to celebrate its 150th year of  incorporation as a parish on All Saints Day, which will be recognized  on November 1.   In November 1870, the All Saints' Church in Nevada was officially  organized, and their church building was completed. The parish began  making positive impacts in their local community that continue today.   The All Saints' parish expresses their love for their fellow  neighbors through supporting the community outreach food pantry with  donations of food and volunteering.   All Saints' also has been a pivotal supporting figure through their  care for domestic violence victims and their selfless service to their  neighbors and strangers alike.   I want to congratulate the All Saints' Church in Nevada, Missouri,  for 150 years of service to the Lord and to the community. I wish them  God's continued blessings in the coming year.   May your next 150 years be just as impactful as your first 150 years.                Honoring the Life and Service of William Lane     Mr. Speaker, last June marks the 70th anniversary of  the beginning of the Korean war. I rise today to honor a selfless hero  of that war, William Lane. He is a resident of Lebanon, Missouri, and a  veteran of both the Korean and Vietnam conflicts.   Sergeant First Class Lane was a medic in the 24th Infantry Division,  among the first contingent of U.S. soldiers sent to Korea in 1950. He  frequently risked his life to render medical assistance and evacuate  wounded soldiers in the Battles of Chonan, Taejon, and the Pusan  Perimeter.   Assigned to the 3rd Infantry Regiment, his unit sustained a casualty  rate of 39 percent by mid-August. By the end of the month, there were  only 184 men of the original 1,898. This casualty rate is equivalent to  some of the bloodiest battles of World War II.   Without the efforts of men like Sergeant Lane and his fellow  soldiers, the outcome of the war may have been decisively different.  Sergeant Lane would later go on to serve his country for 21 years in  the United States Army.   From the frozen tundra of Korea to the jungles of Vietnam, Sergeant  Lane went wherever his Nation called him. I commend him for his  service, and I thank him for his commitment to defending our Nation and  the freedom-loving people of Korea and Vietnam.                  Recognizing Bates County Memorial Hospital     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Bates  County Memorial Hospital and their continuous community service over  the last 60 years.   In 1926, a dedicated community servant,
