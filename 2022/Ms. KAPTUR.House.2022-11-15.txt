 Madam Speaker, I rise today with more good news. A  wonderful organization in my district, Let's Build Beds, serves  northwest Ohio and does exactly what its name implies, building beds  for children whose families are in need.   The organization's mission states: ``We believe that every child  deserves a bed of their own to sleep in at night. We believe that every  child is full of infinite potential. We help children by providing a  bed and empowering them to assemble it and be successful.''   Partnering with local Rotary chapters, Let's Build Beds brings  together various charitable organizations for group projects to make  beds, furnish the bedclothes, and deliver and assemble the beds to  children in need. Older children often participate in this real-life  Lego project.   I have been privileged to help build these beds with community  members and learn from impacted families how important this joyous  venture is.  [[Page H8506]]    This constructive, simple idea can be replicated everywhere. I look  forward to future building opportunities with schools, churches, and  organizations dedicated to giving a lasting gift to children and  families, especially during the upcoming holiday season.                            ____________________
