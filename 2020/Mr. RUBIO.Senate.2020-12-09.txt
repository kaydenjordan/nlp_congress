 Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small  business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit at the  heart of our country. It is my privilege to recognize a family-owned  small business that promotes American health and wellness by operating  a gym and fitness business. This week, it is my pleasure to recognize  Bayshore Fit of Tampa, FL, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   In 2012, partners Jeff Fink and Beth Scanlan founded Bayshore Fit in  Tampa, FL. Both Jeff and Beth had years of experience training for  marathons, bodybuilding, and fitness competitions. Together, they  created a gym that met the demand for a personalized alternative to  large national gym chains. Jeff and Beth focused on helping every  customer meet their health goals, developing a family-friendly,  relationship-driven business. As their client base grew, they quickly  moved their gym into a larger facility.   Today, Bayshore Fit continues to serve the Tampa area, with members  ranging from first-time gym attendees to senior citizens and even  professional athletes. The gym has been featured in local media,  recognizing their significant membership growth and continued emphasis  on personalized programs.   Bayshore Fit's emphasis on healthy living extends to their  philanthropic endeavors. They are involved with the South Tampa Chamber  of Commerce and the Westshore Alliance in Tampa's Westshore business  district. For more than 8 years, Bayshore Fit has sponsored local youth  sports teams. They regularly support local nonprofit organizations,  including Frameworks of Tampa Bay, Inc., which fosters youth social and  emotional development.   Like many of Florida's small businesses, Bayshore Fit temporarily  [[Page S7325]]  closed its doors due to the coronavirus pandemic. In April 2020, the  U.S. Small Business Administration launched the Paycheck Protection  Program, a small business relief program that I was proud to author.  The PPP provides forgivable loans to impacted small businesses and  nonprofits who maintain their payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic.   Jeff and Beth used their PPP loan to keep their business operating  until Florida allowed gyms to reopen. Bayshore Fit pivoted to provide  virtual classes and video training sessions. When they reopened,  Bayshore Fit developed an outdoor workout facility. They also  introduced a Bayshore Fit app to manage workout class schedules and the  number of people allowed to enter the gym.   Bayshore Fit exemplifies the unique role of relationship-driven small  businesses in building communities. I commend their support to youth  athletics programs and promoting public health.   Congratulations to Jeff, Beth, and the entire team at Bayshore Fit. I  look forward to watching your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
