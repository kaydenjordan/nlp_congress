 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a young  woman from my district for making University of Iowa and Big Ten sports  history.   Recently, University of Iowa field hockey star Anthe Nijziel was  awarded both Big Ten Co-Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the  Year honors after leading the Hawkeyes to an impressive 16-1 regular  season.   Though each of these honors are an impressive feat on their own,  Anthe has raised the bar, becoming the first Iowa student athlete to  win both awards in the same season and the third person in Big Ten  history to win the Player of the Year title in more than one season.   I congratulate the entire Iowa field hockey team for a great season,  and Head Coach Lisa Cellucci, who was unanimously named Big Ten Coach  of the Year after being awarded Co-Coach of the Year last season.   Congratulations to Anthe, Coach Cellucci, and the rest of the Iowa  field hockey team, and good luck as you head into the Big Ten  tournament.                            ____________________
