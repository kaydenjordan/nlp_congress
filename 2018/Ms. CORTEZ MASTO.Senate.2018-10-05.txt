 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today as the Senate has been  called upon to fulfill our constitutional duty to give advice and  consent on President Trump's nominee to the Supreme Court, Brett  Kavanaugh.   In the past, Presidents worked with a bipartisan Senate to appoint  someone who understood the importance of precedence and transparency,  who respected the independent integrity of the highest Court in the  land. Unfortunately, that did not happen during the nomination process.  Instead, the process was flawed to fast track a nominee without a full  vetting for political gain.   Brett Kavanaugh was handpicked by the Federalist Society, a rightwing  lobbying organization dedicated to overturning Roe v. Wade. Why?  Because, as he has made clear on several occasions, President Trump  wants to stack the Court with Justices who will overturn Roe v. Wade.   Now, I am new to the Senate, and as long as I have been here, I have  been told that this is not regular order. As we went through this  confirmation hearing, unfortunately, I found it, along with my  colleagues, to be fast tracked.   I take very seriously my role of advice and consent when it comes to  a nominee, and I think we all as Senators have an equal vote. We should  all have access to all of the information and a full vetting of any  nominee who wants to sit on the highest Court for a lifetime  appointment.   Think about it--a lifetime appointment. There are only nine members.  This is something that we should all look for--the right person--and  everyone should have a full vetting, but this hearing was fast-tracked.  Not only was it fast-tracked, but we did not have access to all of the  documents necessary to determine whether Brett Kavanaugh had the  correct judicial philosophy and the judicial temperament and  impartiality that is necessary for somebody to sit on the highest Court  of the land.   Not only were we limited in the number of documents, but what little  documents we did get, unfortunately, on some of them were marked  ``committee confidential'' in an effort to prevent Members from using  documents to question the witness. By unilaterally declaring them  committee confidential, many of my colleagues in the Senate Judiciary  Committee hearing were unable to adequately question Judge Kavanaugh. I  am told that this process of marking ``committee confidential'' is  without precedent.   Republicans claim that Chairman Leahy also accepted documents on a  ``committee confidential'' basis during the Kagan nomination. Those  documents were processed by the National Archives, not private,  partisan lawyers, and Republicans did not object.   By the time of her hearing, 99 percent of Elena Kagan's White House  records were publicly available and could be used freely by any Member.  In contrast, the committee has only seen 7 percent of Brett Kavanaugh's  White House records and only 4 percent were made available to the  public. No Senate or committee rule grants the chairman unilateral  authority to designate documents ``committee confidential'' and  prohibit their public release. Neither the rules of the Senate nor the  rules of the committee authorize the unilateral designation.   There was no committee action and Ranking Member Feinstein sent a  letter stating she did not agree with a  [[Page S6644]]  blanket designation, and she asked the chairman to work with her to  identify the subset of documents that should remain confidential, and  he refused.   But the chairman released thousands of documents himself.  Specifically, he released thousands of documents that had previously  been marked ``committee confidential,'' after consulting with Mr.  Burck. If these were committee confidential documents, then, the  chairman's actions would be a violation of Senate rules. The Senate  rules provide a penalty for disclosing ``the secret or confidential  business or proceedings of the Senate'' but it requires a vote or a  committee action to conduct confidential business or proceedings.   Democrats cannot be held to a different standard. Chairman Grassley  has asserted that Mr. Burck has sole authority to decide what documents  may be used to question Judge Kavanaugh and sole authority to decide  which documents may be released to the public. However, he has failed  to cite any rule or statute that gives Mr. Burck any authority.   We should not move forward with hearings when we only had a fraction  of the nominee's record, and the most significant document we had  remains hidden from public view.   The chairman claimed that he provided ample opportunity for Democrats  to clear committee-confidential documents for use at the hearing, but  he refused the request of several Members to make documents on a number  of topics public.   I also want to make it clear that as I watched that hearing, there  were allegations that Members of the Senate didn't even show up to take  a look at these confidential documents, so why were we complaining. I  will tell you what, I showed up. I was there for 3 days looking at all  of these documents because I thought it was necessary, even if we were  going to be limited in what we could see and what we could talk about.  I have a voice equal like everyone else, and I should have access to  those documents and figure out if I had the opportunity to talk to  Judge Kavanaugh or talk with my colleagues about it, then I should have  access to those documents, but even when we had access, the chairman  demanded that Democrats send him their documents for preclearance by  his staff, President Bush's lawyers, and the White House.   My understanding is, never before have minority members of the  committee been required to identify and preclear the topics and  documents they want to discuss with a Supreme Court nominee with the  chairman or outside private lawyers in the White House; never has a  majority asserted unilateral authority to preclear what issues the  minority party can even ask a nominee.   The idea that Democrats have to ask Republicans to preclear their  questions in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing is outrageous. If the  chairman, Bill Burck, and the Trump White House were truly interested  in a transparent process, Mr. Burck and the White House could make the  White House Counsel records public now, as President Obama and former  President Clinton did for the Kagan nomination, but we still don't have  access to all of the documents.   We still have a process that is broken. We still have a process that,  unfortunately, did not provide all of the Senators the opportunity to  have a full vetting of Brett Kavanaugh. I took my time. I reviewed  Judge Kavanaugh's record. I looked at his cases, his written  statements; I listened to his comments in the hearing; I went and  viewed the committee-confidential documents. I wanted an opportunity to  meet with him. Unfortunately, that never happened, so I couldn't  question him myself.   Based on all of the information and based on taking my time--like I  did with our previous nominee because it is that important that we get  the right person on the bench--in his statements and in his writings  and opinions, it was clear to me that Brett Kavanaugh has shown he does  not respect precedent. He does not respect a woman's right to choose.  He does not respect workers' rights.   If confirmed, I believe Judge Kavanaugh's extreme activist judicial  philosophy will pose a threat to women, our environment, our  constitutional separation of powers, and our fundamental civil rights,  but it is not just Brett Kavanaugh's judicial philosophy that troubles  me.   Last week, Judge Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary  Committee to defend himself against sexual assault allegations. He was  asking for our vote for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court-- one of the deepest and most profound honors this Nation can bestow upon  a citizen. This nominee was interviewing for a job in front of the  American people, and he was belligerent, evasive, and aggressive. This  nominee, who currently sits as an appellate court judge on the DC  Circuit Court, disregarded all demeanor and respect for impartiality  and independence by accusing the Democrats of engaging in ``a  calculated and orchestrated political hit fueled with apparent pent-up  anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been  unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the  Clintons, and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing  opposition groups.''   He then took it even further by stating: ``And as we all know in the  United States political system of the early 2000s, what goes around,  comes around.''   ``What goes around comes around,'' are those the words of an  impartial judge? Of course not. During the question-and-answer period  with the Senators, he was belligerent, impatient, and aggressive toward  anyone who pressed him to get to the truth.   His demonstrated lack of temperament and impartiality is another  reason I cannot support him. It is also why over 2,400 law professors,  from respected law schools across this country, penned a letter to the  Senators to state that the Senate should not confirm Judge Kavanaugh-- some of these very law professors who also appeared before the U.S.  Supreme Court; some of these very law professors who also practiced and  teach at Yale and Harvard. They wrote:         Judicial temperament is one of the most important qualities       of a judge. A judge requires a personality that is even-      handed, unbiased, impartial, courteous, yet firm, and       dedicated to a process, not a result.    They further stated:         At the Senate hearings on September 27, Judge Brett       Kavanaugh displayed a lack of judicial temperament that would       be disqualifying for any court, and certainly for elevation       to the highest Court of this land.    Former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, a Republican  appointed by President Ford, stated similar concerns:         When I watched Judge Kavanaugh's testimony, I didn't see a       fair and impartial Justice. I saw a man who is blinded by       rage and ideology. As a sitting judge, Brett Kavanaugh knows       better.    His accuser, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified before the Senate  Judiciary Committee for 4 hours. She was poised, serious, and credible  recounting what was clearly one of the most scarring, traumatic  experiences of her life, and she did it on live television for all the  world to hear. She did it in the face of death threats. She did it at  the risk of damaging her credibility and career. She had nothing to  gain. She has done a profound service to everyone whose life has been  touched by sexual assault or abuse.   Dr. Ford, I believe you, and I thank you for your courage in coming  forward. I believe in a fair and independent process for people who  have been accused of serious crimes like sexual assault, and the  process should include a neutral investigation that is thorough and  nonpartisan because it will hold a perpetrator accountable or exonerate  the falsely accused. But that fair and independent process did not  occur this time. I am glad some of my colleagues stood up to make sure  the FBI had a chance to reopen its background investigation. I will  tell you what, after reading the recent FBI report, it is clear  Republican leadership limited its scope, and I say that as somebody who  not only has been a prosecutor for 10 years, 8 years the attorney  general of the State of Nevada, who has conducted criminal  investigations and oversaw peace officers who did the same thing.    What they did not do, they did not interview Dr. Ford, nor obtain  from her the important medical records that would corroborate her  testimony. In fact, her attorneys wrote to the FBI offering up not only  additional witnesses  [[Page S6645]]  but making the statement that if they were to interview Dr. Ford, she  would have also provided corroborating evidence, including her medical  records and access to the phone from which she messaged the Washington  Post about Judge Kavanaugh's assault prior to his nomination to the  Supreme Court. I am here to tell you, corroborating evidence isn't just  in the form of witness statements; it is in the form of documentation  that is key, and that was never recovered by the FBI.   I will tell you, the potential witnesses that potentially the FBI  could have talked to, we know--we know because they came forward out of  a civic duty and they went public, and the FBI still did not talk to  them. We know Dr. Blasey Ford's husband, Russell Ford, said Christine  shared the details of the sexual assault during a couple's therapy  session in 2012. She said that in high school, she had been trapped in  a room and physically restrained by one boy who was molesting her while  another boy watched, and Dr. Ford's husband said: ``I remember her  saying that the attacker's name was Brett Kavanaugh'' in 2012--2012.   Along with her husband, Adela Gildo-Mazzo, a friend of Dr. Blasey  Ford, came forward and said:         In June of 2013, Christine said that she had been almost       raped by someone who was now a Federal judge. She told me she       had been trapped in a room with two drunken guys, and that       she then escaped, ran away, and hid.    A third witness, somebody who could have corroborated Dr. Ford's  statement, Lynne Brookes, Brett Kavanaugh's college friend, who said:  ``There is no doubt in my mind that while at Yale, he was a big  partier, often drank to excess, and there had to be a number of nights  where he does not remember.''   So I know--and unfortunately too often we have seen in this  particular case an FBI supplemental report that was not thorough. In  addition, after I reviewed the summary of the report and realized we  were missing information, the additional corroborations would have also  gone to Debbie Ramirez's allegations, but the FBI did not interview  important witnesses to corroborate Debbie Ramirez's allegations.   We now know--because they have been again willing to come forward  after seeing what has been happening through these hearings--Kenneth  Appold, a suitemate of Brett Kavanaugh at Yale, who is now a professor  at Princeton, stated: ``I can corroborate Debbie's account.'' He said:  ``I believe her because it matches the same story I heard 35 years ago,  although the two of us have never talked.'' Professor Appold was never  interviewed.   Likewise, James Roche was also a roommate of Brett Kavanaugh, and he  said: ``Although Brett was normally reserved, he was a notably heavy  drinker, even by the standards of the time, and that he became  aggressive and belligerent when he was very drunk.''   Likewise, Chad Luddington, a college classmate came forward: ``I can  unequivocally say that in denying the possibility that he ever blacked  out from drinking and in downplaying the degree and frequency of his  drinking, Brett has not told the truth.''   They were not interviewed by the FBI. So now, because we have only  limited information, all Senators are left with a lack of a full  understanding of the facts surrounding the allegations against Brett  Kavanaugh.   The questions swirling around Brett Kavanaugh get at the very heart  of our responsibility as Members of the U.S. Senate. We are not here to  be a rubberstamp on the President's nominees. We are a check and  balance on his power. We are here to work with him to make decisions  that are right for the American people. That means we listen to our  constituents. That includes women and men who have buried their  experiences of trauma for far too long.   I have received letters from my constituents from all over Nevada  sharing their stories of survival. I heard from men and women in our  military who were struggling not just with the effects of PTSD but with  the experience of being sexually abused.   I recently met with women who led the campaign to codify a woman's  right to choose in the Nevada State Constitution, and they all asked me  to oppose Brett Kavanaugh's nomination, and I stand with them. I stand  with survivors. I stand for the right of every American woman to make  her own healthcare decisions. I believe Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. I  believe in the integrity and independence of our judicial system.   I condemn Brett Kavanaugh's confrontational and partisan behavior,  and I condemn the handling of this nomination by Senate Republican  leaders.   We must work together, in a bipartisan way, and restore our  constitutional role of advice and consent. This is about something  bigger than any one nominee. It is about the integrity of our Nation's  institutions. It is about the core functions of our democracy. We can't  allow partisan politics to eat away at the checks and balances  enshrined in our Constitution. We have to return to common decency and  regular order. Anything less is below the dignity of the American  people and the great Constitution we swore an oath to faithfully  support.   I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in voting against this  temperamentally unfit nominee.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
