 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a man from  Iowa's Second Congressional District for his countless hours of service  to our community.   Recently, Wilson Elementary School principal and Polar Xpress frozen  yogurt shopowner Jeff Hendred, from my hometown of Ottumwa, was awarded  the President's Volunteer Service Award by the United Way of Wapello  County.   The volunteer service award is given to honor individuals who have  gone above and beyond to leave a positive impact in their community and  for inspiring others to pay it forward through community service of  their own.   Jeff was instrumental in coordinating the annual celebration of Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr., and has dedicated countless hours to the  Emergency Youth Food Program.   It is truly inspiring, and I am incredibly thankful to have Jeff in  Ottumwa.   With over 20 years of service in Ottumwa's schools, Jeff has the  important job of being a role model and teacher to hundreds of  students, and his service to the Ottumwa community sets a great example  for our next generation of community leaders.   I could not be prouder to represent Jeff in Congress, his first  Congresswoman from Ottumwa, and to call him and his wife, Sandra, a  friend.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this is National Police Week, and it  is an excellent time to say thank you to the heroic men and women who  put their lives at risk every day to keep us safe.   These officers and their families have sacrificed so much to serve  others that we must be doing more to keep them safe, well funded, and  supported.   This past year has been challenging for all of us, but our police  officers have been hit especially hard. Imagine what we have gone  through with the pandemic, but being a police officer and first  responder during these difficult times.   Many of my colleagues have called to reform, defund, and even abolish  police departments. While I do believe that our policing system is in  need of serious bipartisan and commonsense reforms, I will never  support defunding or abolishing the police. Those calling for defunding  or abolishment of the police as serious policy are flat out wrong.   Our communities need police to stay safe. They must be fully funded,  and they deserve our respect and gratitude.   Defunding or abolishing the police would make our communities less  secure and more vulnerable to criminal activity, putting all of our  families at risk.   We must produce constructive ways to reform and improve our policing  system, not strip departments of critical funding for training,  equipment, community engagement programs, and body cameras.   To reform our police system, we should focus on real solutions, like  empowering police chiefs to fire bad cops and improving police training  and accountability in line with best practices, similar to the reforms  I proudly supported as a State senator in Iowa.   Earlier today, I signed on as a cosponsor to the bipartisan Defund  Cities that Defund the Police Act. Introduced by Representatives  Fitzpatrick, Golden, Stauber, and Lamb, this piece of legislation would  prevent jurisdictions that defund the police from receiving certain  Federal grants, stopping specific Federal taxpayer dollars from  bankrolling jurisdictions that intentionally make their communities  less safe.   Under this legislation, any jurisdiction that chooses to defund the  police is choosing to defund themselves of Federal assistance.  Municipalities around the country that wish to defund or abolish the  police will only harm their communities.   America does not need to defund or abolish the police. We need to  fund and support law enforcement.   It is interesting to me and ironic that here I am in this building as  a U.S. Congresswoman, and my first tour of this building and the White  House was my brother, who was a Secret Service agent in this city.   We especially need to honor our fallen police officers, including  Iowa State Patrol Officer Jim Smith, U.S. Capitol Police Officers  Sicknick, Evans, Liebengood, Green, and Smith. We also need to honor  the selfless sacrifice of Officer Goodman.   Police officers are true public servants and protectors of our  communities who deserve our respect and appreciation. I am proud to  back the blue this week and every week.   Thank you, Congresswoman Cammack, for your fierce advocacy for our  police officers and for organizing tonight's Special Order.
