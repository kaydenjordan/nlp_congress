 Madam Speaker, today, President Trump held a press  conference and referred to the Emoluments Clause in the Constitution as  the ``phony Emoluments Clause.''   I take an oath to support the Constitution, as does he, as do all 435  of us. I am also the chairman of the Constitution, Civil Rights and  Civil Liberties Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee.   I take umbrage at his remarks. The Emoluments Clause was first put in  the Articles of Confederation, and before that, 100 years earlier, the  Dutch put it in their documents to protect from foreign influence.   It was said at the Constitutional Convention that a violation of the  Emoluments Clause could result in impeachment.   No wonder President Trump thinks it is phony.   There is nothing phony about the Emoluments Clause, the impeachment  clause, Article I, Congress' powers, or separation of the three  branches of government.   Madam Speaker, I respect the Constitution, and I wish the President  would as well.    Mr. Speaker, I was just walking back to my office and I  saw on the video this memorial service, this celebration of life, and I  wanted to come listen. It has been inspiring for me, so many  appropriate remarks made about this great man.   I feel privileged just to stand here at the podium where he spoke and  next to his photograph just as I felt privileged to know him and become  a friend, and where we spoke over here when he was in the wheelchair  and in the Speaker's lobby before votes and during votes.   When I was home this weekend, more people came up to me in Memphis,  and people on social media, and expressed their condolences, their  appreciation of his life and their knowledge that the Congress had lost  a person who was irreplaceable.   Elijah Cummings was one of the great people that I have had the  opportunity to interact with in my life, in Congress, and in other  places.   Truly, a giant has fallen. He had grace. He had knowledge. He had  judgment. He had character.   It has been spoken, and I remember seeing him on television walking  in Baltimore at some risk to himself, during the riots, to help bring  calm to Baltimore, leadership where he put his community first and his  safety second.   He talked about: We are better than this. Well, we are better than  this, and, hopefully, one day, we will be as good as him.   He knew that we were only here for a minute and you should make that  time worthwhile, and he made it worthwhile.   Friday, a week ago, the last Friday that Elijah was in our caucus, we  had a caucus conference call, and the discussion toward the end was  about the Congress' issuance of subpoenas and the attempt to get them  enforced through the courts.   I believe Elijah was the last person to speak on the call, and when  he spoke, it was like hearing the voice of God. He said that these  cases will go through the courts, and they will be appealed, and they  will eventually be appealed to  [[Page H8294]]  the Supreme Court, and, at that point, our democracy will be in the  balance.   He was right, and those were his last words to the caucus.   He cared about democracy. He cared about this Congress. He cared  about the Constitution.   And even when President Trump degraded his city, he was gracious in  his response and never was in any way defensive or attacking the  President.   Elijah Cummings would stop you and give you a word of encouragement  to keep going. He was one of the great people to serve in the Congress.  I am just blessed to have my life interface with his. I will miss him  greatly.   I also extend my condolences to his family, and I hope I get the  chance to serve along with his wife.                                time  2115
