 Mr. President, our Nation is built on some fundamental  ideas. One of those ideas is fairness.   But there are millions of women across this country today who are  doing the same job as their male colleagues and are being paid less.   That is why on this National Equal Pay Day, I stand with my fellow  Senators to close the pay equity gap and ensure equal pay for equal  work.   Fifty-eight years after the passage of the Equal Pay Act, women still  only earn, on average, 82 cents for every dollar paid to men.   This wage gap is even worse for women of color.   African-American women who work full time make only 63 cents for  every dollar paid to White males.   Hispanic women make only 55 cents on the dollar.   In nearly every industry in our country, women's median earnings  remain less than their male counterparts.   There has been one profound change since the passage of the Equal Pay  Act 58 years ago. Forty-one percent of women are now the primary-or  only-breadwinners for their families.   In my own State of Illinois, women earn, on average, just 81 cents  for every dollar earned by men.   African-American women in Illinois make just 63 cents for every  dollar paid to White males. Hispanic women are paid even less-just 49  cents on the dollar.   This pay discrimination hurts working families. More than one-third  of households led by women in Illinois live in poverty.   Over their lifetimes, this persistent pay equity gap will cost the  average woman in my State nearly $500,000 in lost wages.   This is not right, and it is not fair. And it means women have to  work that much harder to support their families and retire in dignity,  and too many can't achieve those goals no matter how long or hard they  work.   The coronavirus pandemic has underscored just how deep and damaging  pay inequality is in the United States.   Nearly 2 in 3 frontline workers are women. Yet they-nearly  universally-are paid less than men in the same roles.   For example, 88 percent of registered nurses are women. Yet they make  93 cents for every dollar a male nurse makes.   Women who work as home health aides, personal care aides, or nursing  assistants typically lose $250 per month, or $3,000 per year, because  of the gender wage gap.   While our economy is slowing starting to recover as people become  vaccinated and the virus is brought under control, economists warn that  it may take years for women to recover from the economic and career  setbacks they have suffered during this pandemic.   Four times as many women as men left the workforce in September of  2020 alone. More than 860,000 women compared to 216,000 men.   From wage discrimination to the unavailability of childcare, women  are not getting a fair deal. That means working families are not  getting a fair deal. That must change.   This Senate should pass the Paycheck Fairness Act reintroduced by  Senator Murray.   The Paycheck Fairness Act would build on the successes of the Lilly  Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which was the first bill signed into law by  President Obama back in 2009.   The Lily Ledbetter Act prohibits gender-based pay discrimination, but  it is hard to enforce because many employers still maintain policies  that punish employees who voluntarily share salary information with  their coworkers.   Workers can't demand equal pay if they don't know that they are being  underpaid.   The Paycheck Fairness Act would close loopholes that still permit  retaliation against workers who disclose their wages.   It would prohibit employers from asking prospective employees about  their salary history.   It would require that employers prove that pay disparities exist for  legitimate, job-related reasons, not simply because they think that  ``women's work'' is worth less.   I am disappointed that Republican opposition has prevented the Senate  from passing this bill, which is vital to the economic security of  millions of American women and their families. But we are not giving  up.   Women have carried America's families and our economy through this  pandemic. As the pandemic begins to end, so should the persistent pay  discrimination against women.   I urge my colleagues across the aisle to commit to passing the  Paycheck Fairness Act and working with us to close this gender wage gap  once and for all.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I'm reintroducing a piece of legislation  that I first introduced in 2017: the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act.   Back then, we knew there was an urgent need to address the crisis of  hate and violent extremism in America.   In the years since, that crisis has only gotten worse, and Congress  has failed to take meaningful steps to address it.   We can change that, and we can change it now.   Earlier this week, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on gun  violence in America.   It happened just one day after a mass shooting in Boulder, CO claimed  10 lives and just 1 week after a shooting spree at 3 Atlanta-area spas  claimed 8 lives.   During the hearing, I mentioned how these tragedies--mass shootings,  acts of terror, hate crimes--they occur with such frequency, that we  can't keep track.   Each life lost is added to our national tally of failure. A failure  to save American lives.   And behind each number is a person.   We lost eight of them last week in the Atlanta area in a hateful act  of violence.   Each of them had a name and a story.   Xiaojie Tan was a hard-working mother, wife, and business-owner.   Soon Chung Park was a mother and grandmother who loved to stay  active. Her family was sure she was going to live to 100.   Hyun Jung Kim was a former elementary school teacher who had  immigrated to the United States from South  [[Page S1806]]  Korea. She dedicated her life to raising her two sons.   Delaina Ashley Yaun was a newlywed and a mother of two, one of whom  was an 8-month-old baby. She and her husband were getting a couple's  massage at the time of the shooting.   Young Ae Yue was a wife and mother of two sons who looked forward to  sitting down for a traditional Korean dinner every Sunday night.   Paul Andre Michels was a loving husband and a U.S. Army veteran.   Daoyou Feng had recently started working at one the massage parlors  that was attacked. She was described by a friend as ``kind and quiet.''   Sooncha Kim was a wife, mother, grandmother, and avid line dancer.  She and her husband had been married for 50 years.   All of their lives were cut short by a lone gunman with hate in his  heart.   How many more lives must we lose before we act?   How many more vigils, funerals must we hold?   How many more families must be devastated forever?   While the motives behind these horrific attacks are still being  investigated, it is impossible to ignore that six of the victims in the  Atlanta attack were Asian-American women.   It happened at a moment when violence against members of the Asian- American and Pacific Islander community has been on the rise.   Two of my colleagues in the Senate have shown tremendous courage in  the wake of last week's attack in Atlanta.   I am proud to have Senator Hirono as my colleague on the Senate  Judiciary Committee, and I am proud to serve alongside Senator  Duckworth and represent our home State of Illinois.   The two of them have, rightfully, criticized the Federal Government  for failing to protect members of the AAPI community from acts of hate  and violent extremism.   And they have every reason to be angry.   A year ago, they warned us.   They-along with Vice President Harris, who was serving in the Senate  at the time-introduced a resolution expressing alarm that people are,  quote, ``living in fear and terror following the dramatic increase of  threats and attacks against those of Asian descent.''   They called on us, the Members of this body, to have a ``singular  focus'' on protecting the safety of AAPI people, along with every  American.   We failed to do that.   Since the pandemic began last March, nearly 3,800 hate incidents  targeting members of the AAPI community have been reported.   Now these Americans are afraid to walk the streets of their own  neighborhoods.   It is one of many examples that highlight the dire need to transform  the way we deal with domestic terrorism in this country.   Even before the pandemic began, a tide of hatred had begun sweeping  over America.   In 2019, the FBI reported that hate crimes had increased to the  highest level in more than a decade.   Another report, from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism,  found that the number of hate-motivated aggravated assaults in America  had increased by nearly 50 percent between 2013 and 2019.   Since hate crimes are historically underreported, we know that the  increase is probably much greater.   Recently, the Department of Homeland Security warned that violent,  White supremacy is now ``the most persistent and lethal threat in the  homeland.''   Violent extremism is a threat to all of us, whether it is a lone  gunman in Atlanta or hordes of blood-thirsty extremists battering down  the doors of this very chamber.   The Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act will enhance the Federal  Government's ability to prevent these acts of extremist violence.   It will establish offices to combat domestic terrorism at the  Department of Justice, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland  Security.   Those offices would regularly assess the threat of violent extremism  so law enforcement can focus their limited resources on the most  significant ones.   The Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act would also provide training and  resources to assist State, local, and tribal law enforcement in  addressing those threats.   I want to thank Majority Leader Schumer for working expeditiously to  bring this bill to the floor.   I want to thank Senators Hirono and Duckworth for their leadership  and for joining me in cosponsoring a version of this legislation that  combines the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act with their COVID-19 Hate  Crimes Act.   This combined bill, which we have named the ``Domestic Terrorism and  Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2021'', would both combat the broader  threat of domestic terrorism and ensure that the Department of Justice  is promptly addressing the particular threats facing the AAPI  community.   Over the past week, in response to the attacks in Atlanta and  Boulder, CO, I have heard Senators on both sides of the aisle make  speeches about taking action to prevent acts of domestic terrorism.   Well, I can think of no better first step than voting in support of  this legislation. To be clear, it is just one step. There is more we  can and must do to combat domestic terrorism.   But we have been waiting 4 years too long to sign this bill into law.   Too many Americans have died.   Let's work to save ourselves from another 4 years of unthinkable  tragedies. I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the  following letter in the Congressional Record.

A bill to create jobs in the United States by increasing  United States exports to Africa by at least 200 percent in real dollar  value within 10 years, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1022         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Increasing American Jobs       Through Greater Exports to Africa Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Export growth helps United States business grow and       create United States jobs. Ninety-eight percent of United       States exports came from approximately 300,000 small- and       medium-sized businesses supporting 4,000,000 United States       jobs.        (2) In a February 5, 2021, message to an African leaders       meeting at the African Union Summit, President Joseph R.       Biden reaffirmed the United States relationship with African       countries as partners in the continent-wide spirit of       entrepreneurship and innovation.        (3) Many countries have trade-distorting export promotion       programs that aggressively subsidize exports to Africa and       other countries around the world. In 2019, there were 115       known official export credit providers around the world,       including export credit agencies, up from 85 in 2015--a 35       percent increase from 2015 to 2019. The increasing investment       by foreign governments into export credit can threaten       competitiveness of United States businesses abroad.        (4) Between 2008 and 2019, the People's Republic of China       alone provided more than $462,000,000,000 in loans to the       developing world, and, in 2009, the People's Republic of       China surpassed the United States as the leading trade       partner of African countries. The Export-Import Bank of the       United States reports the People's Republic of China's export       finance activity is larger than all the other export credit       agencies in the Group of 7 countries combined, making the       People's Republic of China the world's largest official       creditor with a portfolio more than twice the size of the       World Bank and International Monetary Fund combined.        (5) The Export-Import Bank of the United States supported       $12,400,000,000 worth of transactions to sub-Saharan Africa       from 2009 to 2019, while in 2018, the People's Republic of       China made up 22 percent of public debt stock, and, in 2020,       the People's Republic of China made up 29 percent of debt       service in low-income countries in Africa. The People's       Republic of China accounts for a quarter or more of all       public and publicly guaranteed debt in Angola, Djibouti,       Cameroon, the Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, and       Zambia.        (6) The practice of the People's Republic of China of       concessional financing runs contrary to the principles of the       Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development       related to open market rates, undermines naturally       competitive rates, and incentivizes governments in Africa to       overlook the People's Republic of China's troubling record on       labor practices, human rights, and environmental impact.        (7) Sixty percent of Africa's approximately 1,250,000,000       people are under the age of 25, and by the year 2050, one-      third of global youth will be in sub-Saharan Africa. By 2030,       Africa will have 17 cities with more than 5,000,000       inhabitants, as well as 90 cities with populations of at       least 1,000,000. Both are factors contributing to rising       household consumption predicted to reach approximately       $2,500,000,000,000 by 2030.        (8) When countries such as the People's Republic of China       assist with large-scale government projects, they often gain       access to valuable commodities such as oil and copper,       typically without regard to environmental, human rights,       labor, or governance standards.        (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to create jobs in       the United States by expanding programs that will result in       increasing United States exports to Africa by 200 percent in       real dollar value within 10 years.

There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1022         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Increasing American Jobs       Through Greater Exports to Africa Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Export growth helps United States business grow and       create United States jobs. Ninety-eight percent of United       States exports came from approximately 300,000 small- and       medium-sized businesses supporting 4,000,000 United States       jobs.        (2) In a February 5, 2021, message to an African leaders       meeting at the African Union Summit, President Joseph R.       Biden reaffirmed the United States relationship with African       countries as partners in the continent-wide spirit of       entrepreneurship and innovation.        (3) Many countries have trade-distorting export promotion       programs that aggressively subsidize exports to Africa and       other countries around the world. In 2019, there were 115       known official export credit providers around the world,       including export credit agencies, up from 85 in 2015--a 35       percent increase from 2015 to 2019. The increasing investment       by foreign governments into export credit can threaten       competitiveness of United States businesses abroad.        (4) Between 2008 and 2019, the People's Republic of China       alone provided more than $462,000,000,000 in loans to the       developing world, and, in 2009, the People's Republic of       China surpassed the United States as the leading trade       partner of African countries. The Export-Import Bank of the       United States reports the People's Republic of China's export       finance activity is larger than all the other export credit       agencies in the Group of 7 countries combined, making the       People's Republic of China the world's largest official       creditor with a portfolio more than twice the size of the       World Bank and International Monetary Fund combined.        (5) The Export-Import Bank of the United States supported       $12,400,000,000 worth of transactions to sub-Saharan Africa       from 2009 to 2019, while in 2018, the People's Republic of       China made up 22 percent of public debt stock, and, in 2020,       the People's Republic of China made up 29 percent of debt       service in low-income countries in Africa. The People's       Republic of China accounts for a quarter or more of all       public and publicly guaranteed debt in Angola, Djibouti,       Cameroon, the Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, and       Zambia.        (6) The practice of the People's Republic of China of       concessional financing runs contrary to the principles of the       Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development       related to open market rates, undermines naturally       competitive rates, and incentivizes governments in Africa to       overlook the People's Republic of China's troubling record on       labor practices, human rights, and environmental impact.        (7) Sixty percent of Africa's approximately 1,250,000,000       people are under the age of 25, and by the year 2050, one-      third of global youth will be in sub-Saharan Africa. By 2030,       Africa will have 17 cities with more than 5,000,000       inhabitants, as well as 90 cities with populations of at       least 1,000,000. Both are factors contributing to rising       household consumption predicted to reach approximately       $2,500,000,000,000 by 2030.        (8) When countries such as the People's Republic of China       assist with large-scale government projects, they often gain       access to valuable commodities such as oil and copper,       typically without regard to environmental, human rights,       labor, or governance standards.        (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to create jobs in       the United States by expanding programs that will result in       increasing United States exports to Africa by 200 percent in       real dollar value within 10 years.
