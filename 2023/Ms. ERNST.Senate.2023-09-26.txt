 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week it is my privilege to recognize  Dunlap Livestock Auction of Dunlap, IA, as the Senate Small Business of  the Week.   The Schaben family's involvement in Dunlap Livestock Auction began in  1948 under Jim Schaben, Sr., who served as manager of the livestock  auction. Two years later, in 1950, Jim Schaben, Sr., purchased Dunlap  Livestock Auction with his wife Ruth. Jim is a 1945 graduate of the  Reppert School of Auctioneering in Indiana following his honorable  service in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II. The current  facility was completed in 1974 and was passed on to his sons Jay, Jim  Jr., and Jon. Jim Sr. passed away in 2013 at the age of 87, leaving  behind a legacy of service, generosity, and auctioneering excellence.   Today, the Schaben family still owns and operates Dunlap Livestock  Auction and has grown to include multiple generations of the family. In  addition to livestock, they also offer home and estate, farm machinery,  gun, and real estate auctions serving clients throughout Iowa and the  Midwest. The Schaben family has continually advocated for the cattle  industry. In 2021, Jon Schaben testified before the Senate Judiciary  Committee on behalf of the Iowa Cattlemen's Association, an  organization of which he is a member.  [[Page S4677]]  In 2023, Dunlap Livestock Auction celebrated its 73rd business  anniversary of being operated by the Schaben family.   Dunlap Livestock Auction and the Schaben family are a staple of the  Harrison County and Dunlap community. Jim Sr. served in the Iowa Senate  from 1967 until 1975 on the Agriculture Committee. Jim Sr. and Ruth  donated 80 acres of land in the 1970s to Harrison County, which now  bears the name Schaben Park. Dunlap Livestock Auction has also been  recognized for its work. In 2020, they won the Iowa Beef Industry  Council's Beef Quality Assurance Iowa Marketer Award. In 2022, Will  Epperly represented Dunlap Livestock Auction and won the World  Livestock Auctioneer Championship. Jon Schaben won the World Livestock  Auctioneer Championship in 2003.   Dunlap Livestock Auction's commitment to providing livestock  auctioneering services in Western Iowa is clear. I want to congratulate  the Schaben family and the entire team at Dunlap Livestock Auction for  their continued dedication to providing auctioneering services to  Iowans. I look forward to seeing their continued growth and success in  Iowa.                            ____________________
