 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, as I sat here and I listened to Congressman Hensarling,  the chair of the Financial Services Committee, where I serve as ranking  member, I thought to myself he was absolutely correct on many of the  issues that he surfaced when he held the letter up in the air and he  said that there are many Members of Congress who could tell similar  stories or maybe have gotten similar letters. He is absolutely correct.   Even more than that, there are many of us who have watched the  devastation of communities that we represent because of drug addiction  over the years for a long time. Unfortunately, many of these stories  ended in tragedy, and I am pleased that we are focusing time and  attention on opioid addiction and abuse.   I am so absolutely thrilled that we are paying attention, and we are  recognizing that this is literally a disease and that we can help  people, that we can do rehabilitation, that we can provide resources to  keep people from dying and being imprisoned and treated in ways that  will not help deal with the problem in any real ways. I am pleased  about all of that, and I think the intentions of many of our Members  are very good, that they really want to do something because many of  them are seeing this for the first time.   But let me tell you how many years I have been seeing this. Let me  tell you about how many deaths I know about. Let me tell you about the  imprisonment of those who were both addicted and dealing drugs. Let me  tell you about those who have died not only from heroin, that you are  seeing now, but crack cocaine and other kinds of drugs and the mixtures  that we don't even know about that have caused so many deaths, so much  devastation.   So I want to do everything that I can to share my knowledge with you,  to share my experiences with you, to help in every way that I possibly  can move to credible, reasonable, sensible, rehabilitation and support  and assistance for those who are addicted.   We are trying, as I can see in many of the bills that are being  produced, to do what we think is best, but much of it needs more  consideration. It needs better understanding.   Today, we hear talking about a piece of legislation that I think the  author of the legislation is absolutely sincere in what he would like  to do. He is seeing drug addicted persons who have abused not only  prescription drugs but all the way to heroin on the streets without  jobs, laying in the alleys without support, without housing, no place  to go, and that is what he is attempting to do. He is attempting to do  everything that he possibly can to get them safe and secure places to  live with the other resources that must go along with it, supportive  resources in order to help them become the persons that they can be.   But you cannot do this on the cheap. You cannot do this without  understanding that rehabilitation costs money.   So, while I absolutely applaud the attempt, I want to share with you  that taking 10,000 vouchers from those who have been waiting in line  for years--I am talking about single-family parents with their children  who simply are praying and hoping that they can get a voucher so that  they can get a decent place to live.   I am not talking about drug addicted people, necessarily. I am  talking about people, some of whom work every day on minimum wages who  cannot afford the first and last month's rent to get into a place. I am  talking about those who, even if they could find a place, they would be  paying more than 30 percent of their income to have a safe and decent  place. I am talking about those who have been living in rental units  that really need more than just rehabilitation. They are dangerous  places that people are living.   They are places that still are not protected from wind and rain and  all of those things that people should not have to experience trying to  live in a decent place to live. I am talking about people who are  living in apartments that the ceilings are falling in who are looking  for a decent place. I am talking about people who call every day to  check to see if in fact they are going to be the next person who is  going to be allowed a voucher. I am talking about people who have been  waiting 2 and 3 years and on and on and on.   So I support the idea that the new population of opioid abusers can  have a decent place to live and resources, but let's not deny the  people who have been standing in line, who have been praying, who have  been hoping for a decent place. Let's not take 10,000 vouchers in a so- called demonstration project.   Really, we don't need a demonstration project. I can tell you, many  folks in this House can tell you what they know and what they have  experienced so that we can put together good, credible, sensible  legislation. But it will cost some money.   It is not about taking from one and giving to the other. The old  people call  [[Page H5174]]  that robbing Peter to pay Paul. We don't want to do that. We don't want  to say to Ms. Jones with 3 kids out there waiting in line for 4 years,  3 years, 2 years, what have you: Sorry, we have a new population that  we are going to serve. No, we are not going to vote for more money, for  more resources. We are going to take from your opportunity. Sorry you  have been standing in line all this long.    So, Mr. Chairman, I want to be helpful to all of the folks who need  our help. I understand the shock that many are going through who are  experiencing this for the first time, but I want you to know about the  many nights that I have gone to bed when I have heard about another  death of someone who is addicted, who has not had a place to live, who  has been on somebody's doorstep, who has been in an alley. I want you  to know what I know and what I understand about that mother who has  begged me to help find a bed in a unit, a rehabilitative unit that  could be used.   So this is not the way to do it, and this is not about creating new  nonprofits with no experience, no background, to be able to implement  this program. This is about understanding all the people who have  struggled with these nonprofits, who begged for money, who begged for  resources to deal with the populations who are basically dying from  this addiction.   So whether it is about the fact that there is not enough money here,  or we should not be developing new nonprofits to do this because we  have experience with our public housing entities that know how to do  this, this is about us saying: Yes, we have a problem, and we are going  to spend the money. We are going to put the time in on it to develop  the good, credible legislation. We are going to be serious about it. We  don't want to just look like we are trying to do something. We are  going to be positive. We are going to be committed. We are going to do  what it takes in order to help these people who are waiting and looking  for just another chance in life.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much  time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I think we should have a little clarity in what is  being presented by my colleague about whether or not vouchers will be  taken away from anybody. The fact of the matter is nobody thinks that  vouchers will be taken away from anybody. They will never get the  voucher.                                time  1330    They are standing in line waiting for years to get Section 8 vouchers  to be able to have a decent place to live. That means that you take  10,000 vouchers away from the people, and the families, and the  children, who have been waiting in line all of this time and you give  it to a new population of people. That is what this is all about. That  cannot be denied, and that is a fact.   I am sure that my colleague who is proposing this legislation will  agree with me, the fact of the matter is, that person who has been  waiting for so long will have to continue to wait, because the voucher  that he or she could have gotten is going to go to someone else.   Let me just talk a little bit about Mr. Barr's letter that he sent to  the appropriators. First of all, I want to thank him for offering to  send the letter. And I want to thank him for coming to me and asking me  if I would sign on to the letter. What Mr. Barr is doing is--if I may  correctly describe this--is having second thoughts about the fact that  you need some money, you need some resources in this program. So the  gentleman from Kentucky's letter to the appropriators is basically  meaningless, because his own bill directly contradicts it.   And I pointed this out to him as we had this discussion. The plain  text of H.R. 5735 states, ``No additional funds are authorized to be  appropriated to carry out the requirements of this act  [[Page H5175]]  and the amendments made by this act. Such requirements shall be carried  out using amounts otherwise authorized to be appropriated.''   Mr. Chairman, you can't have it both ways. You can't support language  that specifically prohibits appropriators from funding your  demonstration and then turn around and ask the appropriators to provide  funding. This just doesn't make good sense. That is why I had to say  that I could not sign on with him on that letter, knowing what the  language was in the legislation.   So, if the gentleman from Kentucky wants funding for this  demonstration, he needs to be consistent in his advocacy for that  funding, and that includes petitioning his own leadership for a waiver  of their rules preventing bills that cost money from being considered.   I would be happy to join the gentleman from Kentucky in requesting  funding for additional vouchers to support people with substance use  disorders. But I cannot support this unworkable demonstration. And I  cannot lend credibility to his efforts to distract us from the fact  that his bill would take vouchers away from families in need, who have  been standing in line begging, waiting, and praying for a decent, safe  and secure place for them and their families to live.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, yes, Mr. Duffy is absolutely correct, I care about this  issue very deeply, and I want to do the right thing. I want him to know  that while he was talking about the 2.8 million vouchers, does he know  that there are 5 million people who are in need of these vouchers?   You cannot make the argument that there is more than enough to go  around with all of these people standing in line. When they opened up  the waiting list recently, just in Los Angeles alone, 600,000 people  attempted to get access to these vouchers.   This is about whether or not you are willing to put your money where  your mouth is. Either you are willing to pay for your demonstration  project, or you want to take away the opportunities of those who have  been standing in line, and we are talking about families with children.  You don't tell me what is going to happen to them because you won't  increase the number of vouchers, and you don't want to put any money  into it, so you have to show how you care.    It is one thing for us to get up on this floor and talk and debate  and explain what we would like to see happen, but it is another thing  when we say that we are willing to put the resources that are needed to  deal with the problem.   I will just say that of the 2.8 million people waiting, 5 million  people are in need, and the average waiting time is almost 2 years. So  what are you going to do? You don't need a demonstration. We have  enough information, we have enough research, and we have enough stories  about what has happened for so many years and how so many people have  died because they have not had resources available to them to deal with  the problem.   And, again, I am willing to spend as many hours as it takes to help  you know and understand the history of this problem. It didn't just  start with opioid abuse. It didn't just start with communities who  never experienced this before. This has been going on for years and  years and years.   I join with Members in wanting to do something about it. But I say to  Mr. Barr, it is going to cost some money, and we should not rob Peter  to pay Paul. We should not take from those in need. We should not tell  the people standing in line, Too bad, stand in line a little bit longer  because we have a new episode that we have to deal with.   Let's take care of everybody who wants to change their lives,  everybody who wants to put behind them this addiction, everybody who is  begging for just a second chance.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Again, I am so pleased that Members on the opposite side of the aisle  are just being introduced to this crisis. I am so pleased that they are  just learning about addiction. I am so pleased that they are willing to  talk about it. But I am not so pleased that they are not willing to  spend any resources on it. I don't know if they understand that the  average cost of a voucher annually is $9,500.   Why can't they support that amount of money to deal with credible,  decent housing for the very individuals that they say they are trying  to give some support to. I don't know how much they know about  addiction. And I don't know how much they know about the history of the  war on drugs.   Have any of them ever visited a drug rehabilitation project? Let me  commend them to one that they need to know about. It is right here in  Washington, D.C. It is known as N Street Village. Please go. I want  them to learn about what they do, or what the costs are, and how they  struggle for more and more resources to help more and more people. They  cannot legislate. They cannot come up with programs without having an  understanding of, and an appreciation of, what has happened in this  country and the many people who have died, and the families who have  suffered.   It didn't just start now. The gentleman who just spoke talked about  it is now a crisis. No, it has been a crisis for a long time.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1345     Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez), the ranking member of the  Small Business Committee and a senior member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, it is interesting that my colleagues on the opposite side  of the aisle can come into this Chamber and talk about homelessness and  talk about rehabilitation and talk about the need for housing.   I am the ranking member on the Financial Services Committee with  every wish and every hope to be able to have this committee take up a  bill on homelessness. I have not been able to get that done. We have  taken up over 100 bills on the Financial Services Committee, but not  once have we dealt with the issue of homelessness.   The gentleman from Minnesota who talked about homelessness and the  fact that veterans are homeless is absolutely correct, but what are you  going to do about it?   Are you going to come to the floor to try and convince the Members of  this House that somehow a demonstration project where you take 10,000  vouchers from the existing vouchers that people are standing in line  for is going to make a dent in this problem? I don't think so.   This problem has been around for a long time, and I really do want  the Members on the opposite side of the aisle to understand what has  not been done to help those people who have needed a lot of assistance  and a lot of help.   I can recall, God bless her soul, when Nancy Reagan said to drug  abusers, ``Just Say No.'' This is another piece of legislation that  falls in that category: 10,000 vouchers in a demonstration project.   You have been hearing how huge this problem is. We don't need a  demonstration project for a few people taking 10,000 vouchers from  those who have been standing in line. We need to appropriate the  dollars that are necessary, number one, to help fund those  organizations that have been working on this problem for years that  need more money, that need more beds, that need more resources.   We need more money not only to deal with the housing issue that is  attempting to be addressed in this demonstration project, but whether  it is helping to equip police departments with the necessary equipment  to save lives of the people on the street who are overdosed that they  encounter in their daily work. Some communities have that, a few  communities have that, but every community experiencing this problem  needs to have that.    In addition to that, we need more beds for rehabilitation. You can't  get to supportive housing until you deal with the addiction so that  when people are ready to go into transitional housing, they get the  support that goes along with that. That is not just a bed and a roof,  but it is the social services that go along with it.   It will cost money, and unless you are willing to put up the dollars,  unless you are willing to work with our appropriators to do what is  necessary to honestly and forcefully deal with this issue, we are just  talking about it. We are just pontificating. We are just saying things  that we don't even understand.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   While I have this opportunity, I will refer to my bill on  homelessness again. My bill is a bill that will end homelessness. It  costs $13 billion, and I would dare say that we could have funded this  effort when we were thinking about the tax cuts.   Some of those tax cuts benefit the richest people in this country.  While we were reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21  percent, we could have easily spent $13 billion to deal with ending  homelessness.   That tax cut was worth $1.8 trillion. $13 billion from that $1.8  trillion, what would that have done for homelessness in America? We  could have been on the road to ending homelessness.   So the bill number is H.R. 2076. I am hopeful that the Members of the  House and the Members of the Senate will take a look at this  legislation so that they know that we have something that has been  given a lot of attention, that has a lot of research, that understands  what it takes to get rid of homelessness. So my bill, H.R. 2076, is a  bill that I would ask my colleagues to immediately support.   Mr. Chairman, we have many Members of this Congress who want to do  something about providing housing opportunities for those who are the  victims of opioid abuse and drugs. I join with them, and I, too, am  very concerned, and I know that we can do something substantive about  this issue of providing housing opportunities.   But again, I will say over and over again, it should not be done in  such a way that we have a little demonstration project that will take  away 10,000 vouchers from the neediest of people who have been standing  in line, in order to say or think or have anyone believe that we are  doing something about this crisis in America.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire of Mr.  Hensarling how many more speakers he has.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, this week, we are seeing my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle advance legislation focused on individuals with  opioid use disorders. We are really talking about drug addiction. These  are the people they used to call drug addicts, and I don't want us to  hide behind any new language. We are talking about a serious problem of  addiction here.   But something very important is missing from these bills and that is  new resources and funding necessary to actually make a difference for  those individuals.   H.R. 5735 is a clear example of this problematic approach. Rather  than providing funding for housing assistance vouchers for individuals  with disorders, individuals who are addicted, this bill takes away  10,000 existing vouchers that would otherwise go to people in need,  many of whom have been waiting and waiting for years.   There are millions of people on waiting lists across the country,  including families with children, seniors, veterans, persons with  disabilities, persons experiencing homelessness, and others in need.  Redistributing these vouchers away from others who need housing is  simply not a fair or reasonable step.   What we need is bold action to commit real dollars to tackling this  public health crisis, and also to address the shortage of affordable  housing in this country. Unfortunately, this bill falls short and  commits no new funding for additional vouchers.   While H.R. 5735 has an important goal, the way it tries to get there  is ultimately harmful and counterproductive.   For these reasons, I urge Members to vote ``no'' on this bill. This  will not begin to make a dent in the crisis. We  [[Page H5179]]  don't need a demonstration project. We need to move forward with a  committed project with the funding that is necessary in order to deal  with drug addiction.   We have drug addicts who are in the alleys and on the streets in  communities who never saw this before, who never experienced this  before.   Listen to someone who has seen it, who knows about it, who  understands how many lives have been lost because of it, and let's do  the right thing. It is not about a demonstration project. It is not  about just a few vouchers. This is about real action.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this manager's amendment  is simply a last-ditch attempt to address significant administrative  concerns and questions about the correct interpretation of the  underlying legislation.   The fact that this amendment had to be revised three times before a  final version was submitted past the deadline for consideration by the  Rules Committee, is indicative of the hasty and haphazard nature in  which this bill has been cobbled together.   For example, in response to a Congressional Budget Office score that  interpreted the bill to create up to 50,000 new vouchers, resulting in  a cost of $1.2 billion, this amendment would clarify that the intent of  the gentleman from Kentucky was not to provide new funding, but,  instead, to take vouchers away from people waiting in line for housing  assistance.   And while this amendment resolves a few technical issues, it also  creates new problems. In particular, this amendment would add broad  authority for the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban  Development to waive requirements that would otherwise apply under the  Section 8 program. This includes being able to waive basic tenant  protections as well as the requirement that rents are affordable to  residents at 30 percent of their adjusted income, which is known as the  Brooke amendment.    In sum, this amendment does nothing to address the fundamental issues  with this bill, including the fact that it prohibits new funding.   Mr. Chairman, I really do need to point out that perhaps it was not  clear in Mr. Barr's presentation about this amendment that this  amendment additionally reinforces his point that no additional funds  would be authorized.   As a matter of fact, if you look at section 5 of the amendment where  it says, ``No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to  carry out the requirements of this act and the amendments made by this  act. Such requirement shall be carried out using amounts otherwise  authorized to be appropriated,'' which simply means taking 10,000  vouchers from people who are waiting in line, who are desperate for the  need for safe and secure housing, and it makes sure that you understand  that he does not want any more funds appropriated. Except, there is  some kind of contradiction that can be confusing.   When he first introduced the bill--and I talked about the fact that  he had not only asked me to sign on to a letter to the appropriators  asking for more money, and I decided not to do that because of the fact  that he still had this amendment that would say that there should be no  additional funds spent on this.   What is my friend doing? What is he talking about? How can he send a  letter to the appropriators asking for more money when, not only does  he have in the bill, but in the amendment to the bill, very clear  language that says there should be no additional funds appropriated.   Well, of course, that is confusing. And I am not so sure why the  contradiction is there. But I do know this: I believe that the intent  of my colleague is a good intent; that he really would like to do  something about opioid addiction. I believe that most of the Members  who have gotten involved in this issue and who are learning about it  for the first time, and understanding that there is a crisis for the  first time, want to do something about this issue.   But what they have not done is, they have not taken the time to  construct legislation to truly deal with the issue, and spend the  money, ask for the money, ask for the resources that are necessary to  deal with what they say is a crisis.   They come here and they talk about homelessness, and they talk about  the opioid abusers who are on the streets who need housing. Yes, they  do. Just as all of those people who have been standing in line waiting  for Section 8 housing need housing.   They talk about veterans who are homeless. They are absolutely  correct. Some of those veterans have drug problems. Others don't have  drug problems. They have come back from their service to their country  without jobs, without a place to live, and here we are, talking about  robbing the folks who have been standing in line and who are in need-- including the veterans on the street--robbing them of their  opportunities because we want to take away 10,000 housing vouchers from  them.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I don't think the  amendment really does what the gentleman would like to have it do, but  I am not opposed.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
