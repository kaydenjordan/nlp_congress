 Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to  recognize the extraordinary work of Vermont's Meals on Wheels programs.  All across the State, hundreds of volunteers regularly deliver freshly  cooked nutritious meals to thousands of seniors in their homes, many of  whom otherwise might not have  [[Page S2260]]  enough to eat. These volunteers play a critically important role  helping ensure that older Vermonters have access to adequate nutrition.  That, in and of itself, is no small matter.   These volunteers do much more than just deliver a meal. They also  provide invaluable social interaction and companionship for the seniors  they visit, which goes a long way to combat the effects of isolation  that many older Vermonters face, especially in rural areas. Without  this social interaction, seniors are more likely to have feelings of  loneliness and depression, which puts them at higher risk for dementia,  chronic disease, falls, and hospitalization.   The regular visits serve another purpose as well. The volunteers  routinely check to make sure that the seniors are safe, secure, and  warm. They know each person they visit and recognize immediately if  something doesn't seem right. It is no exaggeration to say that they  have saved Vermonters' lives by checking when no one answers the door,  taking the time to discover that someone had fallen and been injured.   Every single Meals on Wheels volunteer has my sincere appreciation  for their remarkable work.   I would also like to recognize the caring and dedicated professionals  that run Vermont's Meals on Wheel these programs, from the chefs who  prepare the nutritious meals that the volunteers deliver, to the  program staff who ensure that everything runs smoothly. Together, these  agencies served more than 1 million meals in Vermont last year alone.  They form an indispensable component of our social safety net for older  Vermonters.   Last month was ``March for Meals,'' when Meals on Wheels programs  across the country expand their outreach to draw attention to the  growing need for the services these agencies provide. I am enormously  pleased that many of my Vermont staff rode along with Meals on Wheels  volunteers across the State to see the wonderful work they are  doing.                            ____________________
