 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sweet Briar College  for being named one of the most innovative schools in the country by  U.S. News & World Report. This is the second time in 3 years that Sweet  Briar has earned this distinction in recognition of its academic and  institutional innovations.   Located in Amherst County, Virginia, the college is committed to  instilling in its students the knowledge and skills necessary to  address the challenges facing our communities.   Sweet Briar utilizes its sprawling 2,800-acre campus, including its  lakes, vineyards, apiary, and 26,000-square-foot greenhouse, as a  natural canvas and laboratory to offer students an experience unlike  any other in the country.   Further, not only is Sweet Briar home to one of our country's oldest  award-winning riding programs, but it is also one of two women's  colleges in the United States with an ABET-accredited engineering  program. Thus, it came as no surprise to hear that they were once again  honored for their innovation.   President Meredith Woo and the school faculty have created a truly  shining example of the incredible academic opportunities the Sixth  District offers students from across the Nation.                            ____________________
