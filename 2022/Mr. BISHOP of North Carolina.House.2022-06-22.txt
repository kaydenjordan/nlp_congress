 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor and  congratulate the Providence High School baseball team for winning the  North Carolina High School 4A State championship.   Not only did Providence win the championship, but they also dominated  the season, compiling a record of 34-0. Never before in North Carolina  4A baseball history has a team gone undefeated.   Along with these extraordinary young men, I congratulate Head Coach  Danny Hignight, who told his coaching staff on the night of their big  win: ``We . . . went 34-0. That is unreal.''   Well, Coach Hignight, it is my honor to say on the floor of this  Chamber that it is real and that I and all of Charlotte, North  Carolina, are proud of this amazing school and team.   Congratulations, Providence High Panthers, on an incredible season.                            ____________________
