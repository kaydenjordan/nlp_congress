 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for  yielding to me.   Madam Chair, I will follow up with the last two colleagues of mine,  the gentlewoman from California and the previous speaker.   We cannot have what happened in the 1980s and 1990s of the  scapegoating of communities with the heinous drug epidemic.   It is interesting that now that fentanyl is impacting certain  communities, it is now a health issue. In the 1980s and 1990s when  there was a crack epidemic in urban communities, Nancy Reagan told us:  ``Just say no.'' But here we are now, in this day and age, and now it  is a major issue. Why?   Because it is impacting other communities that people tend to care  more about--their communities. What we are seeing now in minority  communities was going on 20 years ago and we were screaming: Please,  help. Please, let's stop this scourge.   What we did was say: No, those people that are abusing those drugs  are criminals. Let's lock them up--mass incarceration.   Now, in this day and age with fentanyl, it is a health issue when the  same thing was happening then is happening now. I don't know how one is  a criminal act and now we need to have compassion. We do because this  country is suffering. Our young people are dying. It is just unreal the  scourge that this drug is.   We have to remember that fentanyl is such a powerful opioid. It is 50  to 100 times more potent than morphine. Two milligrams, or the size of  five grains of salt, can cause a possible overdose. We need to do  something. Our young people are screaming out. They are crying. They  are dying.   We cannot blame it all on the southern border. Time and time again,  we have data that shows that 90 percent of the fentanyl is coming  through ports of entry by American citizens. We need to address that.  We need to talk about it.    Madam Chair, the HALT Fentanyl Act is not the way to go,  but we need to come together and do something as this plague is ruining  our future.   I have seen it in my community. Others have seen it now in their  communities. We must come together with reasonable legislation. This is  just another possible situation that starts mass incarceration once  again. I know I don't want to see in your community what that did to  mine over the past 20 years.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the benefits of  President Biden's student loan forgiveness plan for the Black  community.   Today, American families struggle with the high costs of higher  education. These financial burdens are even worse in Black communities.   Black college graduates owe $25,000 more in student debt on average  than White graduates, and they owe 12.5 percent more than they borrowed  4 years after graduating.   President Biden's plan would forgive $10,000 to $20,000 of student  loan debt for eligible students. It would cut the loan balance for  Black graduates nearly in half, and it would erase the debt for 25  percent of Black borrowers.   It is a great first step, but we must do more. We must increase debt  forgiveness for students targeted by predatory for-profit colleges  regardless, and we must create interest-free Federal student loans to  lower the financial burdens of college.    These actions would help millions of Black graduates pay off their  loans and get a fresh start.                            ____________________
