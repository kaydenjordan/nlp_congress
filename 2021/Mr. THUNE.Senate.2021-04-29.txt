 Mr. President, I would echo what my colleague from  Delaware has said about the Chaplain's Bible study on a weekly basis.  That, I think, is the highlight for many of us throughout the week.   I would also say that the Senator from Delaware also has a very good  command of the Holy Scriptures, and I appreciate the opportunity that  he and I and others have, on a weekly basis, to participate in that  study and would encourage other Members to join us. It is truly an  inspirational time and is something that, I think, we all need with the  busyness that we have on a weekly basis here in the Senate.

Mr. President, along with my livestock producer protection  bill, I am also introducing legislation today to eliminate the November  1 haying and grazing date for cover crops.   Cover crops provide a lot of environmental benefits. They improve  soil health, reduce erosion and nutrient runoff, improve water quality,  and sequester carbon. They also benefit farmers, since their animals  can graze these crops, or the cover crops can be harvested to provide  forage for livestock. Currently, the haying and grazing date--the date  on which farmers can start harvesting or grazing cover groups on  prevent plant acres--is set for November 1, which is too late in the  year for farmers in more northern States like South Dakota. Early  winter weather in these States can cause cover crops to freeze before  they can be used for hay and grazing.   The legislation I am introducing today with my colleague Senator  Stabenow would fix this problem by letting farmers harvest and graze  cover crops outside of the primary nesting season, which ends August 1  in South Dakota, allowing for both farmers and our environment to  benefit from these crops.   Protecting our planet is imperative, and government certainly has a  role to play in promoting clean energy and sound environmental policy,  but putting the government in charge of our economy--in fact, putting  the government in charge of pretty much every aspect of American life,  as the Green New Deal would do--is not the answer. Innovation, not  government, is the key to addressing environmental challenges.   Unfortunately, President Biden is embracing a whole host of Green New  Deal-like policies. Take his so-called 30-by-30 directive directing the  U.S. Department of Agriculture and other Agencies to provide  recommendations to conserve 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by  2030.   I have already heard from ranchers and landowners in South Dakota who  are concerned about the measures the administration could pursue to  meet this goal, including Federal land acquisitions and burdensome  regulations on private landowners, many of whom are already doing  everything they can to promote the health of their land.   There is also serious reason to doubt the government's ability to  manage a vast new amount of land. The Federal Government already  frequently fails to properly manage the land it already has. Yet some  believe that we can give the Federal Government huge new swaths of  land, and somehow the government will manage it properly.   Yet that is the problem with a lot of these socialist fantasies. They  assume that the government will achieve levels of efficiency and  productiveness that the government has simply never demonstrated. It is  the triumph of fantasy over experience. Surely, the people espousing  socialist fantasies have sat in long lines at the DMV or remember how  the Obama administration had more than 3 years to prepare for the  opening of the ObamaCare exchange yet couldn't even come up with a  working website in that time period. Yet the Green New Deal's  proponents are advocating that we put the government in charge of  pretty much every aspect of American life.   Socialists and the Democrats parroting their ideology don't want to  believe it, but the truth is that private individuals are often a lot  more efficient, effective, and innovative than government, and we  should be focusing our energies on supporting that efficiency and  effectiveness and innovation instead of attempting to solve our  environmental problems by giving the government more than it can  handle.   I will continue working here in Congress to advance policies that  promote clean energy and improve our environment without placing heavy  burdens on American workers or American families. I will continue to  advocate for policies that encourage and harness the ingenuity of the  American people in facing our environmental challenges, and I will  continue to oppose legislation that prioritizes supposed environmental  gains over the well-being of the American people                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Portman, and Ms. Baldwin):   S. 1469.

Mr. President, last week, the junior Senator from  Massachusetts and the Congresswoman from the 14th District of New York  reintroduced their Green New Deal resolution. I think most Americans  remember this socialist fantasy from when these Members introduced it 2  years ago. It would be hard to forget a proposal with that pricetag.  There was one think tank that analyzed the initial proposal and  released a first estimate that found that the Green New Deal would cost  between $51 trillion and $93 trillion over 10 years. Let me just repeat  that--between $51 trillion and $93 trillion over 10 years.   To put that number in perspective, our entire Federal budget in  2019--our entire Federal budget--was well under $5 trillion. It would  be interesting to learn where we are going to get that kind of money. A  massive tax hike on the rich wouldn't get us close to paying for this,  but I don't think I am the only one who isn't sure where we would get  the money for this. I don't think the plan's authors have a very clear  idea of that either. In fact, the entire Green New Deal resolution is  notable for its complete lack of specificity.   It proposes outlandish, impossible goals, like upgrading every single  building in the United States--every single building--in the next 10  years for maximum energy and water efficiency, as well as comfort, but  it offers zero--zero--specifics for how we might actually accomplish  them. I am not surprised, because there is no way to come close to  accomplishing everything the Green New Deal's authors want to  accomplish over the next decade without enormous economic pain.   So often, when hearing the policies of the far left, environmental  and otherwise, I am struck by how they leave people out of the  equation. Now, of course, the individuals proposing these plans don't  think they are leaving people out of the equation. The Green New Deal's  authors are clearly under the impression that they are creating a  paradise for American families--if paradise includes the government  supervision and administration of just about every aspect of American  life. Yet the reality is that, like so many utopian plans, most of the  environmental left's sweeping ideas for remaking our society would have  nightmarish effects in practice: higher energy costs, reduced economic  growth, sharp increases in the cost of essential commodities like  groceries, huge tax hikes, and job losses.   Today, I want to talk about just one example of the damaging  potential of environmental extremism, which has relevance for a bill I  am introducing today.   There has been an increasing tendency on the part of the  environmental left to demonize the consumption of beef, and this  tendency is creeping into the mainstream. Earlier this week, food  website Epicurious--a site a lot of Americans turn to when they are  wondering what to cook for dinner--announced that it will no longer add  new recipes featuring beef. The website said its move is not anti-beef  but pro-planet. It is pretty much wrong on both counts.   First of all, the move to demonize beef could have real consequences  for a lot of ranchers, like those I represent in South Dakota. If the  demand for beef drops, some of these ranchers may be out of a job. Of  course, the Green New Deal's authors would probably suggest a  government program to help  [[Page S2362]]  them out, but I can't think of many ranchers I know who would like to  abandon their way of life for their dependence on a government program,  and there is no reason they should have to.   Contrary to the story being pushed by the environmental left, beef  production is directly responsible for only a tiny fraction of U.S.  emissions, and beef cattle actually plays an important role in managing  pasturelands that sequester vast amounts of carbon. On top of that, it  has become clear that, with certain feed additives, it is possible to  significantly reduce cattle emissions, making the demonization of beef  even more wrong-headed.   Today, I am introducing the Livestock Regulatory Protection Act with  my colleague Senator Sinema. I actually introduced this bill years ago  with the Democratic leader, before it became dangerous for Members of  the Democratic leadership to support anything that might anger the  environmental left. The Livestock Regulatory Protection Act is simple.  It would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from imposing  emissions regulations relating to the biological processes of  livestock.   We really shouldn't need this bill, but it is becoming increasingly  clear that we do. This legislation was included in annual funding bills  on a bipartisan basis for a number of years after the Democratic leader  and I first introduced it, but the House has omitted it from its recent  bills, and the Senate has had to secure its inclusion in the final  bills. Passing this legislation would give livestock producers long- term certainty that their livelihoods will not be compromised by  overzealous environmental crusaders.   I believe very strongly in protecting our environment. I have been an  outdoorsman all my life. In many ways, outdoors men and women are the  original environmentalists. If you value spending time in the  outdoors--whether you are hunting or hiking, fishing or swimming--it is  likely you are going to care a lot about keeping our air and water  clean, preserving native species, and safeguarding our natural  resources.   I have been interested in clean energy issues for a long time and  have been introducing legislation to support clean energy development  for more than a decade. In February, I introduced two bipartisan bills  to support the increased use of biofuels and to emphasize their clean  energy potential. Currently, the EPA's modeling does not fully  recognize the tremendous emissions-reducing potential of ethanol and  other biofuels.   The Adopt GREET Act, which I introduced with Senator Klobuchar, would  fix this problem and pave the way for increased biofuel use both here  and abroad by requiring the Environmental Protection Agency to update  its greenhouse gas modeling for ethanol and biodiesel using the U.S.  Department of Energy's GREET model.   I also introduced a bill to advance long-stalled biofuel  registrations at the EPA. Regulatory inaction has stifled the  advancement of promising technologies, like ethanol derived from corn  kernel fiber, even though some of these fuels are already being safely  used in States like California.   My bill would speed up the approval process for these innovative  biofuels. This would allow biofuel producers to capitalize on the  research and facility investments they have made and improve their  operating margins while further lowering emissions and helping our  Nation's corn and soybean producers by reinforcing this essential  market.   Just last week, I joined colleagues from both parties to cosponsor  the Growing Climate Solutions Act, which is legislation to make it  easier for agriculture producers and foresters to participate in carbon  markets. This bill is a great example of the kind of bipartisan process  we should be following when it comes to climate legislation.   So, as I said, I strongly believe in protecting our environment, but  I believe that we need to protect our environment in a way that takes  account of people, too. That means promoting legislation that is good  for our environment and for our economy, that is good for our  environment and good for agriculture producers, and that is good for  our environment and good for American families.   That is why I have introduced proposals like the Soil Health and  Income Protection Program, or SHIPP. This program, a short-term version  of the Conservation Reserve Program, is a win for both our environment  and for farmers and ranchers. SHIPP, which became law as part of the  2018 farm bill, provides an incentive for farmers to take their lowest  performing cropland out of production for 3 to 5 years. Like the  Conservation Reserve Program, it protects our environment by improving  soil health and water quality while improving the bottom line for  farmers.

(b) Research and Development.--Section 522(c) of the       Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1522(c)) is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(20) Cover crops.--        ``(A) In general.--The Corporation shall carry out research       and development, or offer to enter into 1 or more contracts       with 1 or more qualified persons to carry out research and       development, regarding a policy to insure crops on fields       that regularly utilize cover crops.        ``(B) Requirements.--Research and development under       subparagraph (A) shall include--        ``(i) a review of prevented planting coverage factors       described in section 508A(f) and an evaluation of whether to       include cover crop seed costs and costs related to grazing in       the calculation of a factor;        ``(ii) the extent to which cover crops reduce the risk of       subsequent prevented planting;        ``(iii) the extent to which cover crops make crops more       resilient to or otherwise reduce the risk of loss resulting       from natural disasters such as drought;        ``(iv) the extent to which increased regularity of using       cover crops or interactions with other practices such as       tillage or rotation affects risk reduction;        ``(v) whether rotational, adaptive, or other prescribed       grazing of cover crops can maintain or improve risk       reduction; and        ``(vi) how best to account for any reduced risk and provide       a benefit to producers using  [[Page S2360]]       cover crops through a separate plan or policy of insurance.        ``(C) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of       enactment of this paragraph, the Corporation shall make       available on the website of the Corporation, and submit to       the Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives       and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of       the Senate, a report that--        ``(i) describes the results of the research and development       carried out under subparagraph (A); and        ``(ii) includes any recommendations with respect to those       results.''.    Mr. President, along with my livestock producer protection  bill, I am also introducing legislation today to eliminate the November  1 haying and grazing date for cover crops.   Cover crops provide a lot of environmental benefits. They improve  soil health, reduce erosion and nutrient runoff, improve water quality,  and sequester carbon. They also benefit farmers, since their animals  can graze these crops, or the cover crops can be harvested to provide  forage for livestock. Currently, the haying and grazing date--the date  on which farmers can start harvesting or grazing cover groups on  prevent plant acres--is set for November 1, which is too late in the  year for farmers in more northern States like South Dakota. Early  winter weather in these States can cause cover crops to freeze before  they can be used for hay and grazing.   The legislation I am introducing today with my colleague Senator  Stabenow would fix this problem by letting farmers harvest and graze  cover crops outside of the primary nesting season, which ends August 1  in South Dakota, allowing for both farmers and our environment to  benefit from these crops.   Protecting our planet is imperative, and government certainly has a  role to play in promoting clean energy and sound environmental policy,  but putting the government in charge of our economy--in fact, putting  the government in charge of pretty much every aspect of American life,  as the Green New Deal would do--is not the answer. Innovation, not  government, is the key to addressing environmental challenges.   Unfortunately, President Biden is embracing a whole host of Green New  Deal-like policies. Take his so-called 30-by-30 directive directing the  U.S. Department of Agriculture and other Agencies to provide  recommendations to conserve 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by  2030.   I have already heard from ranchers and landowners in South Dakota who  are concerned about the measures the administration could pursue to  meet this goal, including Federal land acquisitions and burdensome  regulations on private landowners, many of whom are already doing  everything they can to promote the health of their land.   There is also serious reason to doubt the government's ability to  manage a vast new amount of land. The Federal Government already  frequently fails to properly manage the land it already has. Yet some  believe that we can give the Federal Government huge new swaths of  land, and somehow the government will manage it properly.   Yet that is the problem with a lot of these socialist fantasies. They  assume that the government will achieve levels of efficiency and  productiveness that the government has simply never demonstrated. It is  the triumph of fantasy over experience. Surely, the people espousing  socialist fantasies have sat in long lines at the DMV or remember how  the Obama administration had more than 3 years to prepare for the  opening of the ObamaCare exchange yet couldn't even come up with a  working website in that time period. Yet the Green New Deal's  proponents are advocating that we put the government in charge of  pretty much every aspect of American life.   Socialists and the Democrats parroting their ideology don't want to  believe it, but the truth is that private individuals are often a lot  more efficient, effective, and innovative than government, and we  should be focusing our energies on supporting that efficiency and  effectiveness and innovation instead of attempting to solve our  environmental problems by giving the government more than it can  handle.   I will continue working here in Congress to advance policies that  promote clean energy and improve our environment without placing heavy  burdens on American workers or American families. I will continue to  advocate for policies that encourage and harness the ingenuity of the  American people in facing our environmental challenges, and I will  continue to oppose legislation that prioritizes supposed environmental  gains over the well-being of the American people                                  ______    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1475         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Livestock Regulatory       Protection Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON PERMITTING CERTAIN EMISSIONS FROM                     AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION.         Section 502(f) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7661a(f)) is       amended--        (1) by redesignating paragraphs (1) through (3) as clauses       (i) through (iii), respectively, and indenting appropriately;        (2) in the undesignated matter following clause (iii) (as       so redesignated), by striking ``Approval of'' and inserting       the following:        ``(B) No relief of obligation.--Approval of'';        (3) by striking the subsection designation and heading and       all that follows through ``No partial'' in the matter       preceding clause (i) (as so redesignated) and inserting the       following:        ``(f) Prohibitions.--        ``(1) Partial permit programs.--        ``(A) In general.--No partial''; and        (4) by adding at the end the following:        ``(2) Certain emissions from agricultural production.--No       permit shall be issued under a permit program under this       title for any carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, water vapor, or       methane emissions resulting from biological processes       associated with livestock production.''.    Mr. President, last week, the junior Senator from  Massachusetts and the Congresswoman from the 14th District of New York  reintroduced their Green New Deal resolution. I think most Americans  remember this socialist fantasy from when these Members introduced it 2  years ago. It would be hard to forget a proposal with that pricetag.  There was one think tank that analyzed the initial proposal and  released a first estimate that found that the Green New Deal would cost  between $51 trillion and $93 trillion over 10 years. Let me just repeat  that--between $51 trillion and $93 trillion over 10 years.   To put that number in perspective, our entire Federal budget in  2019--our entire Federal budget--was well under $5 trillion. It would  be interesting to learn where we are going to get that kind of money. A  massive tax hike on the rich wouldn't get us close to paying for this,  but I don't think I am the only one who isn't sure where we would get  the money for this. I don't think the plan's authors have a very clear  idea of that either. In fact, the entire Green New Deal resolution is  notable for its complete lack of specificity.   It proposes outlandish, impossible goals, like upgrading every single  building in the United States--every single building--in the next 10  years for maximum energy and water efficiency, as well as comfort, but  it offers zero--zero--specifics for how we might actually accomplish  them. I am not surprised, because there is no way to come close to  accomplishing everything the Green New Deal's authors want to  accomplish over the next decade without enormous economic pain.   So often, when hearing the policies of the far left, environmental  and otherwise, I am struck by how they leave people out of the  equation. Now, of course, the individuals proposing these plans don't  think they are leaving people out of the equation. The Green New Deal's  authors are clearly under the impression that they are creating a  paradise for American families--if paradise includes the government  supervision and administration of just about every aspect of American  life. Yet the reality is that, like so many utopian plans, most of the  environmental left's sweeping ideas for remaking our society would have  nightmarish effects in practice: higher energy costs, reduced economic  growth, sharp increases in the cost of essential commodities like  groceries, huge tax hikes, and job losses.   Today, I want to talk about just one example of the damaging  potential of environmental extremism, which has relevance for a bill I  am introducing today.   There has been an increasing tendency on the part of the  environmental left to demonize the consumption of beef, and this  tendency is creeping into the mainstream. Earlier this week, food  website Epicurious--a site a lot of Americans turn to when they are  wondering what to cook for dinner--announced that it will no longer add  new recipes featuring beef. The website said its move is not anti-beef  but pro-planet. It is pretty much wrong on both counts.   First of all, the move to demonize beef could have real consequences  for a lot of ranchers, like those I represent in South Dakota. If the  demand for beef drops, some of these ranchers may be out of a job. Of  course, the Green New Deal's authors would probably suggest a  government program to help  [[Page S2362]]  them out, but I can't think of many ranchers I know who would like to  abandon their way of life for their dependence on a government program,  and there is no reason they should have to.   Contrary to the story being pushed by the environmental left, beef  production is directly responsible for only a tiny fraction of U.S.  emissions, and beef cattle actually plays an important role in managing  pasturelands that sequester vast amounts of carbon. On top of that, it  has become clear that, with certain feed additives, it is possible to  significantly reduce cattle emissions, making the demonization of beef  even more wrong-headed.   Today, I am introducing the Livestock Regulatory Protection Act with  my colleague Senator Sinema. I actually introduced this bill years ago  with the Democratic leader, before it became dangerous for Members of  the Democratic leadership to support anything that might anger the  environmental left. The Livestock Regulatory Protection Act is simple.  It would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from imposing  emissions regulations relating to the biological processes of  livestock.   We really shouldn't need this bill, but it is becoming increasingly  clear that we do. This legislation was included in annual funding bills  on a bipartisan basis for a number of years after the Democratic leader  and I first introduced it, but the House has omitted it from its recent  bills, and the Senate has had to secure its inclusion in the final  bills. Passing this legislation would give livestock producers long- term certainty that their livelihoods will not be compromised by  overzealous environmental crusaders.   I believe very strongly in protecting our environment. I have been an  outdoorsman all my life. In many ways, outdoors men and women are the  original environmentalists. If you value spending time in the  outdoors--whether you are hunting or hiking, fishing or swimming--it is  likely you are going to care a lot about keeping our air and water  clean, preserving native species, and safeguarding our natural  resources.   I have been interested in clean energy issues for a long time and  have been introducing legislation to support clean energy development  for more than a decade. In February, I introduced two bipartisan bills  to support the increased use of biofuels and to emphasize their clean  energy potential. Currently, the EPA's modeling does not fully  recognize the tremendous emissions-reducing potential of ethanol and  other biofuels.   The Adopt GREET Act, which I introduced with Senator Klobuchar, would  fix this problem and pave the way for increased biofuel use both here  and abroad by requiring the Environmental Protection Agency to update  its greenhouse gas modeling for ethanol and biodiesel using the U.S.  Department of Energy's GREET model.   I also introduced a bill to advance long-stalled biofuel  registrations at the EPA. Regulatory inaction has stifled the  advancement of promising technologies, like ethanol derived from corn  kernel fiber, even though some of these fuels are already being safely  used in States like California.   My bill would speed up the approval process for these innovative  biofuels. This would allow biofuel producers to capitalize on the  research and facility investments they have made and improve their  operating margins while further lowering emissions and helping our  Nation's corn and soybean producers by reinforcing this essential  market.   Just last week, I joined colleagues from both parties to cosponsor  the Growing Climate Solutions Act, which is legislation to make it  easier for agriculture producers and foresters to participate in carbon  markets. This bill is a great example of the kind of bipartisan process  we should be following when it comes to climate legislation.   So, as I said, I strongly believe in protecting our environment, but  I believe that we need to protect our environment in a way that takes  account of people, too. That means promoting legislation that is good  for our environment and for our economy, that is good for our  environment and good for agriculture producers, and that is good for  our environment and good for American families.   That is why I have introduced proposals like the Soil Health and  Income Protection Program, or SHIPP. This program, a short-term version  of the Conservation Reserve Program, is a win for both our environment  and for farmers and ranchers. SHIPP, which became law as part of the  2018 farm bill, provides an incentive for farmers to take their lowest  performing cropland out of production for 3 to 5 years. Like the  Conservation Reserve Program, it protects our environment by improving  soil health and water quality while improving the bottom line for  farmers.
