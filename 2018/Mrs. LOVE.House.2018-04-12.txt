 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Salt Lake Community  College, also known as SLCC, for its leadership in making it more  affordable to residents in Utah to earn a degree or certificate.   Early this month opened Open Education Week, and I would like to  highlight ``Open SLCC,'' an initiative that started in 2014 and has  grown to more than 600 open sections across a wide range of  foundational courses online.   To date, Open SLCC has saved $5.8 million for over 40,000 students by  using Open Educational Resources, or OER, as an alternative to costly  textbooks. This is truly remarkable.   Combined with SLCC's promise, where the community college covers the  tuition and fees for students with significant financial needs, SLCC is  effectively addressing issues of access and affordability to help  students complete college and compete in our workforce. I salute SLCC  for this winning combination.   I also want to congratulate Mr. Jason Pickavance at SLCC for hosting  the first ``State of the OER Conference'' in February. This is a great  example of collaboration among education leaders in Utah and nationally  to address college affordability and completion issues.                            ____________________
