 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 5671, the Merchant Mariners of World War II  Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2020.   Madam Speaker, it is fair to say that, when we look back on the many  victories of World War II, unfortunately, too often, our Merchant  Marine, our merchant mariners are overlooked. It is this exact reason  why this Congress has come together to pass this bill to honor these  brave sailors and their legacy.   During wartime, merchant mariners became an auxiliary to the Navy;  and, as such, civilian volunteers traded intercoastal bulk cargo routes  for dangerous near-coastal and transatlantic shipping, hauling vital  war cargo for our Allies.   It is in this exact scenario that 250,000 merchant mariners found  themselves when World War II broke out. Many of these brave men  perished at sea. In fact, Madam Speaker, 1 in 26 never made it home.   Madam Speaker, the merchant mariners who survived World War II were  finally awarded veteran status in 1988. And if you walk down The Mall  here in the Nation's Capital, you will find the World War II Memorial,  and you will find the seal of the merchant mariners--which reads, ``In  Peace and War''--honoring those lost during World War II.   The importance of the merchant mariners was not lost on our former  Chief Executives. President Eisenhower, when he was the General of the  Army, stated:         When final victory is ours, there is no organization that       shared its credit more deservedly than the Merchant Marine.    President Franklin Roosevelt similarly stated:         The men of our American Merchant Marine have pushed through       despite the perils of the submarine, the dive bomber, the       surface raider. They have returned voluntarily to their jobs       at sea again and again, because they know, they realized       their lifeline to the battlefront would be broken if they did       not carry out their mission, that vital, vital part of the       global war.    Indeed, America as ally, as arsenal of democracy, as manufacturer of  the critical war material necessary to win in Europe and win across the  Atlantic would be lost were it not for the merchant mariners.   These men deserve the recognition of this gold medal. Of the 250,000  World War II merchant mariners who were part of that global struggle,  fewer than 2,000 merchant mariner veterans are believed to still be  alive today. It is imperative that we commemorate their service, their  sacrifice, their leadership, their integral role in the victory of the  Atlantic and the Pacific.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and let  me say in closing what a pleasure it is to work with my friend from  Guam on this bill to recognize our merchant mariners.   I thank my friend from New York (Mr. Suozzi) who has the privilege  every day of representing the Merchant Marine Academy on Long Island.   Let's come together as a Congress and support this important effort  to recognize those who gave so much to save the world and make the  world safe for democracy. We couldn't have done it without our merchant  marines and their bravery across the seas.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize NASA Day  in my home State of Arkansas, which was recently proclaimed by Governor  Hutchinson to be January 27, 2020.   In my district, Harding University, a member of the Arkansas Space  Grant Consortium, has played an integral role in advancing aerospace  priorities for 50 years. Between 1967 and 1979, Harding University's  faculty and students supported NASA's Skylab and space efforts,  including the 1969 landing of Neil Armstrong on the Moon. They  conducted experiments examining the long-term effects of space on the  human body.   As a part of the Arkansas Space Grant Consortium, a group of 17  colleges and universities that support NASA's research activities,  Harding continues its contribution and maintains strong ties to our  Nation's space program.   I thank Harding University for its commitment to our aerospace  priorities, and I appreciate Governor Hutchinson for recognizing the  importance of NASA in Arkansas.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I commend our bipartisan group of Members on this floor  tonight to rise on Holocaust Remembrance Day to pay tribute to all  those who were affected by the enormity, the calamity, and the horrors  of the Holocaust.   Today marks the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the camp at  Auschwitz on January 27, 1945.   ``For ever let this place be a cry of despair and a warning to  humanity, where the Nazis murdered about one and a half million men,  women, and children, mainly Jews from various countries of Europe.  Auschwitz-Birkenau 1940-1945.''   Two years ago, I will never forget reading those words as I paid my  respects on a visit to this enormous Nazi death machine. This side of  humanity's greatest failure amongst millennia of human failure was a  manufacturing facility. The Nazi's product: murder.   Laying a wreath at the death wall, kneeling in prayer before the  memorial all failed to comfort the visitor from the nightmares imposed  by the pile of shoes, a tiny sample of 43,000 pairs of shoes, or the  fantasy of encouraged belongings from stacks of suitcases, or the  physical horror of hair cut from the heads of those to be gassed.                                time  2015    Mr. Speaker, millions of Jews, Roma, Poles, and Serbs stepped off the  trains there at Auschwitz, only days later to have their souls severed  from their earthly forms.   Mr. Speaker, I share the concern and the voice of my colleagues  today. I stand with friends on both sides of the Atlantic, urging  rejection of anti-Semitism, rejecting the rising boycott and  divestiture movement against Israel, and speaking the truth.   All of us on this House floor tonight are united in speaking that  truth and voting today overwhelmingly to teach our children the truth  of the Holocaust.   Never again, Mr. Speaker. Never again.
