 Mr. Speaker, I also am from the Northeast, from New  Jersey, and I rise in support of this bill today.   Five years ago, Superstorm Sandy devastated my district. Ocean  County, my home, was the epicenter of that storm. You might remember  the photographs of the iconic Jet Star roller coaster sitting in the  ocean. That was my district.   Even today, I have thousands of constituents who are still out of  their homes. Now, thousands more are experiencing the same thing  because of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.   140 million Americans live in coastal counties, and the NFIP has done  a lot to help with zoning standards, building standards, flood plain  management standards. It hasn't been run perfectly, but this program is  desperately needed by people in areas like mine.   The NFIP has fiscal issues, and this bill seeks to address them. It  is the only Federal disaster program that actually collects money in  advance of a disaster.   When I got on this committee a year ago, I set out on this issue to  do four things: a long-term reauthorization, improve affordability,  increase accountability, and enhance mitigation efforts.   This is a 5-year reauthorization. It reduces the mandatory annual cap  on premium increases; it brings more accountability, including my  language to forbid NFIP from hiring disbarred lawyers; and it doubles  the mitigation coverage from $30,000 to $60,000.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
