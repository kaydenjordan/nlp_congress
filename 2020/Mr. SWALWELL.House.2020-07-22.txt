 Mr.  Speaker, God blessed America and this Chamber when we were sent  John Lewis. We will miss his character, his conviction, and his  kindness; and this place feels a lot emptier without him.      The online version has been corrected to read: (Mr. SWALWELL of  California asked and was given permission to address the House for  1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. SWALWELL of  California. Mr. Speaker, God blessed America and this Chamber when  we were sent John Lewis. We will miss his character, his  conviction, and his kindness; and this place feels a lot emptier  without him.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      There is so much that will be said about our colleague, but I will  never forget, just right before us in this well, after the country had  gone through mass shooting after mass shooting after mass shooting, and  we were so troubled about what to do next, our colleague told us, if we  were willing to cause a little bit of good, necessary trouble, we could  make a difference.   We will miss John. He brought his experience from movements to a  moment where his country needed him. His work continues and, because of  that, the next generation will march on.   God bless our colleague.                            ____________________
