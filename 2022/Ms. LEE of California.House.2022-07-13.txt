 Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Lee-Pocan amendment No. 13 to  cut $100 billion from the fiscal 2023 Defense Authorization Act. The  amendment is structured so that this cut would not reduce pay or  benefits for uniformed and civilian personnel or their families.   I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan), my cosponsor and  co-chair of the Defense Spending Reduction Caucus. I also thank  Chairman Smith and Chairman McGovern for their support to permit us to  bring this amendment to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, this House again stands poised to pour over $800 billion  into a defense establishment that is unauditable, unaccountable, and  does little to answer the biggest threats to the safety and the welfare  of our people.   The Pentagon is the only--mind you, the only--Federal department that  has never passed an audit. And, yes, I worked to get a requirement that  DOD pass an audit written into permanent law a couple of years ago with  the help of my friend and colleague, Chairman Smith, and also our  colleague, Dr. Burgess. And yet, still, the Pentagon says it won't be  able to pass an audit for almost another decade.   What is this about? It is really a shame and disgrace. It is not hard  to find places to cut at the Pentagon. In fact, last year, Senator  Sanders commissioned a Congressional Budget Office study that detailed  various scenarios for how we could save $100 billion per year without  compromising American security.   That $100 billion is sorely needed for other key national priorities.  If we reinvested that $100 billion, it could pay to hire 1 million  elementary schoolteachers to relieve the current teacher shortage. It  could pay to power every home in America with solar energy or it could  provide every family in America with a $700 stimulus payment.   We face an array of threats in America today, including the  continuing COVID health emergency and the impacts of climate crisis. It  is our duty to look for savings at the Pentagon and meet the urgent  needs of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support our amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time for closing.   Mr. Speaker, it is really past time for Congress to start demanding  that the Pentagon exercise some fiscal discipline that we impose  against and across all of the Federal Government. Also, we individually  have fiscal discipline that we must exert. We have budgets we have to  live within.   The Pentagon budget is running amok. This is taxpayers' dollars which  should be at least audited, and the Pentagon should be held  accountable.   Again, this amendment would hold harmless the people who serve in the  military or who work at the Pentagon and their families. The CBO has  demonstrated that we can trim the Pentagon budget without compromising  security. In doing so, we free up resources to invest in our country  and in our people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, our amendment, the Lee-Pocan No. 14, reverses egregious  Pentagon budget increases added during the committee markup. This is  mind-boggling. Our amendment trims back the total level of the fiscal  year 2023 NDAA to no more than the amount requested by President Biden.   We have numerous, glaring examples of waste, fraud, and abuse within  our defense establishment. Yet, some of our colleagues insist on piling  more money into the Pentagon than our military leaders--our President  even--asks for, despite the DOD routinely returning unspent balances to  the Treasury.   Enough is enough. Americans are demanding that Congress rebalance our  priorities and invest in the biggest challenges which we face. This $37  billion could be better spent--that is how much over the President  requested--to extend the child and earned income tax credit, improve  healthcare access, and pay for Medicare hearing benefits for seniors.   Mr. Speaker, $37 billion could hire 300,000 nurses to alleviate the  nursing shortage or fund free, quality childcare for more than 800,000  children to help caregivers get back to work.   While I personally support much larger cuts, we need to draw the line  somewhere.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Washington (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Armed Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Jacobs).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   First of all, I would hope Republicans would join Democrats in a  bipartisan fashion like you did just now on this outrageous amendment  in supporting the efforts to reduce the cost of living for people who  are living on the edge, but I don't see any bipartisanship there when  it comes to supporting the American people and what they need in terms  of their wages, in terms of housing, in terms of healthcare, in terms  of all the efforts that Democrats have mounted over the years. It is  too bad that you won't join us in that, but you join them in raising  the defense budget to an excessive level over what the military and the  President requested. It is outrageous.   I note that the House has voted overwhelmingly to support Ukraine,  and we certainly should support better pay and benefits for our  uniformed and civilian personnel and their families, which the base  bill does. Ukraine and military pay are in the base bill. If the  President thinks that more should be done and more is needed, then he  should, as has always been done, come to the Congress for a  supplemental.   The President came to Congress for a supplemental for Ukraine. If he  believes more is needed, that is the proper process and the proper way  to do this, not by increasing the NDAA top line.   It is time to shift our spending to meet America's urgent human  security priorities, and I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment. I am really so concerned that whatever people want on that  side of the aisle especially, and some on this side of the aisle, as it  relates to the Pentagon, people get, Members get, and that is not a  good place for this country to be.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
