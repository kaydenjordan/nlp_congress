 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  accomplishments of Ottumwa's Collins Clingman.   Collins recently won gold in the men's 100-meter walk and the bronze  in the 50-meter run while representing  [[Page H5834]]  Team Iowa at this year's Special Olympics USA Games.   Collins is used to the competition after participating in Special  Olympics for the past 25 years, competing in multiple track and field  events and bowling.   As a fellow Hawkeye and Indian Hills fan, I applaud Collins'  accomplishments in Orlando and representing Ottumwa and Iowa in the  Special Olympics. I cannot wait to cheer him on in future USA Games.   Recognizing the Accomplishments of Maxwell Rantilla of Bettendorf, Iowa     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  accomplishments of Maxwell Rantilla of Bettendorf, Iowa.   Maxwell is currently a junior at Bettendorf High School. This past  year, Maxwell joined millions of students across the country in taking  the ACT test. This test is used by colleges to help with admissions  decisions and tests students on their knowledge of English, reading,  math, and science.   Maxwell's commitment to studying paid off when he got a perfect score  on the ACT. Out of the millions of high schoolers who take the  standardized test, only 0.5 percent receive a perfect score.   Maxwell is very involved at Bettendorf High School, qualifying for  the national tournament the past 3 years in the speech and debate club.  He is a member of the school band and the president of Bettendorf High  School's National Honor Society.   I congratulate Maxwell on this outstanding accomplishment. I know  that this is just the beginning of his journey, and I cannot wait to  hear about his future accomplishments and endeavors.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  6493, the Campus Prevention and Recovery Services for Students Act. As  we are coming out of a two-year pandemic, taking care of individuals  with mental health and substance use disorders, especially college  students, is crucial.   H.R. 6493, requires schools to develop evidence-based prevention and  intervention strategies for college students and employees. H.R. 6493  requires both the Department of Education and the Department of Health  and Human Services to identify and promote successful programs.   As a physician and former Iowa Director of Public Health, I know just  how critical evidence-based practices are for prevention of alcohol and  substance use disorders and how life saving these practices can be for  any student. It is equally important for college campuses and the  medical community to come together to do what is best for our nation's  students.   I look forward to voting in support of H.R. 6493 and urge my  colleagues to do the same.
