 Mr. Speaker, I am here to urge this House to defeat the  previous question so that we can hear H.R. 5476, a bipartisan bill to  protect the Special Counsel, Mr. Mueller.   It is important for democracy and for the rule of law for which we  are respected around the globe that Mr. Mueller's investigation goes on  and not be impeded by the firing of Mr. Rosenstein and the imposition  of somebody who is inimical to Mr. Mueller's investigation.   I want to quote Bill Frist, former Republican majority leader in the  Senate. ``Congress must never abandon its role as an equal branch of  government. In this moment, that means protecting Mueller's  investigation. We're at our best as Senators and Republicans when we  defend our institutions. But more than that, it's our best face as  Americans.   ``People around the world admire not just the material well-being of  the United States but our values, too. The rule of law is something  many die trying to secure for their countries. We can't afford to  squander it at home.''   Defeat the previous question. Protect Robert Mueller.
