 Mr. Speaker, as a point of personal privilege, I would  like to recognize my grandparents, John and Eileen Lawler, who are here  with us tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I just returned from a bipartisan delegation trip to  Israel, where we met with Prime Minister Netanyahu, Defense Minister  Gallant, and U.S. Ambassador Jack Lew. We also met with the family  members of some of the 240 hostages currently being held by Hamas and  viewed raw footage of the barbaric terrorist attack of October 7.   Mr. Speaker, let's be clear: Hamas is a terrorist organization that  not only wants to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth, they want to  eliminate the Jewish people. They must not only be defeated, they must  be destroyed.   I support Israel's right to defend itself and denounce the ludicrous  calls for a cease-fire. No one in this room would have called for a  cease-fire after September 11, and no one should hold Israel to a  standard we would not hold ourselves.   The United States must stand resolute in our support for Israel. This  is a battle of good versus evil.   As Edmund Burke said: The only thing necessary for the triumph of  evil is for good men to do nothing. Let us not be Neville Chamberlains;  let us be  [[Page H5715]]  Winston Churchills: ``Victory at all costs . . . for without victory,  there is no survival.''                            ____________________
