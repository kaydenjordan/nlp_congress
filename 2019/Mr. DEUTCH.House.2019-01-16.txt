 Madam Speaker, let's be clear. The longest shutdown in  our history is not about border security. Both Democrats and  Republicans agree we need strong border security; we need new  technology; we need stronger ports of entry; and we need more  personnel.   But the President is tossing aside what we agree upon so that he can  hit taxpayers for $5 billion for his wall, and he is making 800,000  hardworking Federal employees and contractors, and their loved ones,  pay an even higher price right now.   I have heard from constituents who should be working as aviation  safety inspectors to keep our skies safe. Instead, one is waiting in  the unemployment office. One cabin safety inspector is struggling to  pay for cancer medication. Another is negotiating a payment plan for  his mother's care, and his mother is an 88-year-old veteran living with  dementia.   Let's end the pain of this shutdown, reopen the government, get  Federal workers back on the job and being paid. We can work together to  strengthen our borders, and we can treat asylum seekers with respect.                            ____________________
