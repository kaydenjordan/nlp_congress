 Madam Speaker, the Biden administration and Democrat  House leadership want to cap off their first 6 months with an  additional $3.5 trillion in massive bills which will be the largest  expansion of government ever.   Let's review the past 6 months. Prior to the Biden administration, on  a bipartisan basis we here in this Congress allocated $3.7 trillion for  COVID relief and recovery on a bipartisan basis.   President Biden and the Democrats through a completely partisan  spending bill spent $1.9 trillion, three times more than many thought  was necessary, and many Democrat economists also felt that way,  especially since GDP growth was hitting record levels, clearly  indicating American recovery.                                time  1615    Now we are experiencing inflation at really historic levels. Milk,  bread, fruit, gasoline, among other items, have seen price increases,  taxing all Americans. Unemployment remains very high in States that  continue to extend and enhanced unemployment insurance. Meanwhile,  virtually all employers have a shortfall in their workforce and are  looking for employees.   Additionally, illegal immigration is at an all-time high. We see the  mess at the border with no real corrections being made by the Biden  administration or the Democrat-led House. Crime is hitting record  levels in urban and suburban American. Oil imports from Russia are at  an all-time high while we restrict energy production here at home, and  China's economy is roaring.   We receive no cooperation from the CCP or the WHO, regarding  investigations into the origins of COVID-19. Additionally, cyberattacks  originating from China and Russia have presented a huge threat to  American businesses large and small, yet, we have little to no response  from the Biden administration or from our Democratic leadership here in  the House.   Now the Democrats are putting a bipartisan transportation  infrastructure bill in jeopardy that was agreed upon because they  insist on spending $3.5 trillion-plus for all kinds of government  expansion initiatives, including expansions in Medicaid, ObamaCare,  EPA, IRS, and I could go on.   This reckless expansion of government after $5 trillion in spending  will rock our economy, destroy career opportunities, create permanent  dependency on government, and saddle our future American generations  with debt well beyond what the eye can see or what the mind can  contemplate.   Say ``no'' to reconciliation. Say ``yes'' to a bipartisan  transportation infrastructure bill.
