 I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Brown), the Senator from New York (Mrs.  Gillibrand), the Senator from Hawaii (Ms. Hirono), and the Senator from  Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1437         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Drug-price Transparency in       Communications (DTC) Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription       pharmaceuticals is legally permitted in only 2 developed       countries, the United States and New Zealand.        (2) In 2018, pharmaceutical ad spending exceeded       $6,046,000,000, a 4.8-percent increase over 2017, resulting       in the average American seeing 9 drug advertisements per day.        (3) In 2015, pharmaceutical companies spent more than       $100,000,000 on advertising with respect to each of the 16       most advertised brand-name drugs and biological products,       primarily new and relatively high-cost medications.        (4) The 10 most commonly advertised drugs have list prices       ranging from $535 to $11,000 per 30-day supply or usual       course of therapy.        (5) According to a 2011 Congressional Budget Office report,       direct-to-consumer advertising is used to promote only a       small set of specific drugs, typically the expensive, brand-      name medications. And the top-selling drugs in any given year       are frequently among the drugs with the largest expenditures       for direct-to-consumer advertising.        (6) According to a 2011 Congressional Budget Office report,       pharmaceutical manufacturers advertise their products       directly to consumers in an attempt to boost demand for their       products and thereby raise the price that consumers are       willing to pay, increase the quantity of drugs sold, or       achieve some combination of the two.        (7) Studies show that patients are more likely to ask their       doctor for a specific medication and for the doctor to write       a prescription for it, if a patient has seen an advertisement       for such medication, regardless of whether the medication is       clinically appropriate for the patient or whether a lower-      cost generic may be available.        (8) According to a 2011 Congressional Budget Office report,       the average number of prescriptions written for newly       approved brand-name drugs with direct-to-consumer advertising       was 9 times greater than the average number of prescriptions       written for newly approved brand-name drugs without direct-      to-consumer advertising.        (9) Approximately half of Americans have high-deductible       health plans, under which they often pay the list price of a       drug until their insurance deductible is met. All of the top       Medicare prescription drug plans use coinsurance rather than       fixed-dollar copayments for medications on nonpreferred drug       tiers.        (10) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is the       single largest drug payer in the Nation. Drug price inflation       accounts for a significant portion of the 22-percent, 32-      percent, and 42-percent growth in Medicare parts D and B and       Medicaid expenditures, respectively, on a per beneficiary       basis between 2013 and 2016.        (11) The 20 most advertised drugs on television cost       Medicare and Medicaid a combined $24,000,000,000 in 2017.        (12) Price shopping is the mark of rational economic       behavior, and markets operate more efficiently when consumers       have relevant information about a product, including its       price, before making an informed decision about whether to       buy that product.        (13) The American Medical Association has passed       resolutions supporting the requirement for price transparency       in any direct-to-consumer advertising.        (14) The Kaiser Family Foundation found that 88 percent of       the public favors the Federal Government requiring       prescription drug advertisements to include a statement on       how much the drug costs.        (15) Pursuant to its existing authority under sections 1102       and 1871 of the Social Security Act, on May 10, 2019, the       Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services published       regulations (subpart L of part 403 of title 42, Code of       Federal Regulations) to require direct-to-consumer television       advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products       for which payment is available through or under Medicare or       Medicaid to include the wholesale acquisition cost of that       drug or biological product.        (16) To support the permanence and clarity of this policy,       and to facilitate future planning, Congress finds a benefit       to codifying such regulation.       SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT THAT DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER ADVERTISEMENTS                     FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS                     INCLUDE TRUTHFUL AND NON-MISLEADING PRICING                     INFORMATION.         Part A of title XI of the Social Security Act is amended by       adding at the end the following new section:    ``requirement that direct-to-consumer advertisements for prescription     drugs and biological products include truthful and non-misleading                            pricing information         ``Sec. 1150C.  (a) In General..--The Secretary shall       require that each direct-to-consumer advertisement for a       prescription drug or biological product for which payment is       available under title XVIII or XIX includes an appropriate       disclosure of truthful and non-misleading pricing information       with respect to the drug or product.        ``(b) Determination by CMS.--The Secretary, acting through       the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid       Services, shall determine the components of the requirement       under subsection (a), such as the forms of advertising, the       manner of disclosure, the price point listing, and the price       information for disclosure.''.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
