 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  1619, the Catawba Indian Nation Lands Act. I was proud to partner with  the majority whip, Mr. Clyburn, and several other of my colleagues from  North and South Carolina in introducing this legislation.   This bill is straightforward. It would simply codify action taken by  President Trump's Department of the Interior last year, granting 17  acres of the Catawba Indian Nation's ancestral lands into trust for the  Tribe.   This action by the Interior Department has been held up needlessly in  the Federal court system, although the only decisions so far have been  held in favor of the Catawbas. This bill would cut short that process  and confirm the ability for the Catawba Indian Nation to move forward  with their plans for this piece of land which, I would note again, is  most certainly within the borders of their ancestral homelands.   This piece of land will be critical in providing economic opportunity  for a community that suffers from above-average unemployment and  poverty rates. This will enable self-sufficiency and reduce the need  for members of the Catawba population to rely on Federal and State  governments for basic social services.   This step has been many years in the making, and I am glad to have  played a small part in getting it done. I would also like to thank our  partners in the Senate, Senators Graham, Tillis, and Burr for  spearheading this effort in their body. Hopefully, we can get this  important piece of legislation to the President's desk in short order.   Madam Speaker, in closing, I would like to ask my colleagues to join  me in support of this bill. It is bipartisan, it is common sense, and  it will very much help the 3,400 members of the Catawba Nation in North  and South Carolina live more prosperous lives.
