 Mr. Speaker, Puerto Rico is facing a humanitarian  crisis. Puerto Rico is in desperate need for us to assist them.  Hurricane Maria, soon after Hurricane Irma, has left a trail of  destruction for Puerto Rico's residents. Currently, 3.5 million  American citizens in Puerto Rico are without power, 20,000 people are  on a waiting list to leave the island, and about $85 billion is needed  in recovery funds.   The island and its towns have been completely cut off by water  flooding, broken bridges, lack of electricity, and no cell phone  service. As a result, there are displaced senior citizens and children  who cannot get basic goods and medical supplies.   The people of Puerto Rico need supplemental funding not next week,  but today. The Jones Act must be waived. Price gouging by airlines  should not be allowed. Clean water needs to be shipped to the island,  and hospitals need to be set up.   It is our responsibility as Members of Congress and U.S. citizens to  provide relief to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the small  Caribbean countries in that area. Please, let's save Puerto Rico.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to join the voices that echo  the deep, troubling concern that we shared this weekend when we saw our  President engage in a sterile fight, a childish, almost, type of fight  with the NFL players.   We all know that football, baseball, and many of our sports have been  a level playing field where many people of different races,  ethnicities, and economic backgrounds come together and cheer for a  particular team from their hometown or their region.   Instead of concentrating on bringing healthcare to millions of  Americans or retreating on failed attempts to repeal and replace  ObamaCare, the President chose to engage in another activity: tweeting  that insulted Americans across the country.   Instead of engaging in a real, substantive discussion about the Dream  Act and DACA recipients, looking at the provisions of the bipartisan  legislation that has been put forward and cosponsored by close to 200  Members of  [[Page H7523]]  this House, led by Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican from  Florida, and Lucille Roybal-Allard, a Democrat from California, instead  of going through the provisions of that bill that could bring relief  for 800,000 young people who otherwise would be potentially deported-- they are larger than any of the congressional districts that any one of  us may represent in this House. Instead of looking at the provisions of  that, rolling up our sleeves and coming here this week to discuss how  we bring relief to 800,000 young people who are working, going to  school, and are members of our Armed Forces, he chose to engage in  distraction.   Instead of looking at a real humanitarian crisis about to ensue in  Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and some of our neighboring countries  of Barbuda, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, and the Caribbean, as  well as the challenges of Florida and Houston, instead of taking a look  at a potential humanitarian crisis that may ensue in Puerto Rico and  bringing about relief for those 3.5 million Americans, he chose to look  the other way.   We remember how a President hovered in his airplane over New Orleans  and Louisiana as people drowned and died without getting the help they  needed. This could be our modern-day Katrina, and yet our President  chose to look the other way.                                time  1645    He could have engaged in bringing about results. Today, I join  Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez and Congressman Adam Smith in signing on  to a letter asking the Department of Defense to step it up in Puerto  Rico.   We ask for a senior general to be appointed to work with FEMA to  manage the crisis in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands the same  way it was done for Katrina. We ask for Department of Defense engineers  and aviation assets to be deployed to Puerto Rico, as many of the  municipalities up in the mountains are still cut off from the general  population and have not been heard of for nearly a week.   We ask for technicians and experts to bring restoration of power and  to work with telecommunications on the island because people are still  disconnected from government, from hospitals, from the police  department. There is no cell service; there is no energy on the island;  and we ask for that as well.   We ask, in this letter, for the USNS Comfort, an offshore medical  treatment facility, to be deployed to the island of Puerto Rico. Puerto  Rico only has two hospitals that have been able to restore power, yet  the President looked this weekend the other way.   For three major pieces and issues that confront the American people:  healthcare, as it pertains to close to maybe 30 million people that may  lose their services if this failed attempt to repeal and replace  ObamaCare goes through; DACA, impacting over close to a million young  people who go to school, who work, who are part of our future economic  recovery, who are members of the Armed Forces; and the humanitarian  crisis, a new-day Katrina that is about to ensue in Puerto Rico--for  those three issues of great importance to America, our President looked  the other way.   He chose to engage in tweets; he chose to insult our local athletes  in an un-Presidential manner; he chose to turn his back on the American  people.
