 Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous question.  If we defeat the previous question, Republicans will amend the rule to  include H.R. 5586, the Prohibiting IRS Financial Surveillance Act,  legislation to prevent the IRS from snooping into Americans' personal  financial accounts.   Under President Biden and Congressional Democrats' policies, American  families continue to be squeezed by inflation at the gas pump, at the  grocery store, and in their monthly energy bills. But this inflation  squeeze isn't enough for them. Now, they want to monitor the average  American's bank account. As part of Democrats' misguided tax-and- spending spree, they  [[Page H5746]]  have proposed new reporting requirements, from financial institutions  to the IRS, regarding private account information.   This vast government overreach would turn financial institutions in  my district into local outposts of the IRS, all with the sole purpose  of reporting Hoosiers' personal financial account information back to  the Government. Make no mistake, this will capture virtually every  American, who will be subject to increased levels of IRS intrusion in  their daily lives.   The IRS already has been challenged by the leak of thousands of  documents, including sensitive taxpayer information. The collection of  additional data would only exacerbate this problem and subject many  Americans to the potential exposure of their personal information.  Let's not forget, under the Obama administration, the IRS  systematically targeted certain groups applying for tax-exempt status  simply because of their political affiliation.   I hope that we can defeat the previous question to protect the  privacy of all Americans and to ensure that the IRS won't be  surveilling every financial transaction.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question.
