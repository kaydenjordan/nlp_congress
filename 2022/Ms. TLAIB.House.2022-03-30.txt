 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  work of Jim Tuman and the volunteers behind Jimmy's Kids, an  organization that serves the families of Wayne County, including the  community and neighborhood I grew up in, southwest Detroit.   In 1988, Jim Tuman, a youth advocate and motivational speaker, was  simply trying to make the Christmas holiday special for 22 special- needs children. He coordinated an ad hoc program to provide the  children with holiday gifts.   The Jimmy's Kids organization now serves thousands of children all  across metro Detroit. Jimmy's Kids proudly partners with local groups  and churches to set up gift-giving, not just during the holiday, but  year-round, for children in need.   Countless families can count on their Christmas Day gift distribution  program, an event I happily volunteer for during the holidays.   Please join me in recognizing Jim Tuman and the volunteers at Jimmy's  Kids for their outstanding work on behalf of the families of metro  Detroit and Michigan's 13th District Strong.                    Honoring the Memory of Patricia Harris     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of  community advocate Patricia Harris, a resident of Westland in  Michigan's 13th District Strong who suddenly passed away earlier this  year, shocking our close community.   Pat was engaged on a number of issues but was mostly known for her  big heart and infectious smile. She was a loving daughter, sister,  aunt, and friend.   Pat stood up for the values she believed in and always met challenges  with positivity and a can-do attitude. She cared deeply for our  community and fought relentlessly for justice and a better quality of  life for all.   The loss of our Pat left an impact on all who knew her. Please join  me in remembering Patricia Harris for the love of her community as we  mourn her loss.               Launching the Bipartisan Get the Lead Out Caucus     Madam Speaker, I rise today to officially announce the  launch of the bipartisan Get the Lead Out Caucus, which I started along  with my colleagues Congressman Meijer, Congresswoman Dingell, and  Congresswoman Blunt Rochester.   Water contaminated by lead service lines can be found in every single  congressional district around the Nation. From rural areas to densely  populated cities, lead service lines are widespread and pose serious  health risks to us all, but particularly our children.   Lead in water is a public health crisis, and the only solution is to  fully eliminate lead service lines altogether. Clean, affordable  drinking water is a human right.   While communities in Michigan like Flint, Wayne, Hamtramck, and  Benton Harbor have made headlines for their lead-related crises, lead- contaminated drinking water affects every part of our Nation.   I commend the Biden administration for taking steps to get the lead  out of our water, but we must continue to fight until lead is fully  removed from water systems across the United States.                       Time to Decriminalize Marijuana     Madam Speaker, as someone who grew up in a community on  the front line of the racist so-called war on drugs, I am proud to  stand here today in support of the MORE Act to finally decriminalize  marijuana and expunge marijuana-related convictions.   The war on drugs was designed as a racist project to target our Black  and Brown communities. The obvious racial disparities in enforcement  show us that it still is, at its core, an effort targeting communities  of color through overpolicing, criminalization, and mass incarceration.   The MORE Act will increase access to Federal benefits and establish a  fund to redirect resources into communities harmed by the war on drugs.  This is a good start on the road to repairing the damage, but we still  have work to do.   We must be bold. Our goal must be to end this country's militarized  ``jail  [[Page H3974]]  first, ask questions later'' approach to addiction and to stop trying  to solve social problems with more criminalization.   I strongly encourage my colleagues to support the MORE Act. This is a  commonsense bill.                          Funding Community Projects     Madam Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the recent  passage of the omnibus bill, which included over $15 million in funding  for local community projects in 13 District Strong.   From funding for work-based learning programs in Wayne-Westland  Community Schools to a senior wellness center in Inkster, Michigan, I  know that these direct dollars will have an enormous impact on the  lives of my residents.    The 13th Congressional District, Madam Speaker, is the third-poorest  congressional district in the Nation, and these are important efforts  to help the most vulnerable among us.   The Boys and Girls Club of Southeastern Michigan, which is the oldest  in the Nation, will be funded for improvements to the Fauver-Martin  Club in Highland Park. It will empower so many of our young people.   The Urban Neighborhood Initiative for the Southwest Detroit Creative  Connections Collaborative will also be able to employ high-speed  broadband and build community space for our young people.   Enterprise Community Partners will also fund the Detroit Energy  Efficiency and Home Improvement Program to provide energy-efficient  home repairs and so much more.                            ____________________
