 Mr. President, today I am pleased to recognize  Michelle Coolican, the Flagler County Teacher of the Year from Buddy  Taylor Middle School in Palm Coast, FL.   Michelle believes the Teacher of the Year award goes beyond her  personal achievement; she considers it an honor for the entire teaching  profession. She credits her colleagues, the school's administration for  its learning environment, and the students she works with every day for  this recognition.   Superintendent Jim Tager noted Michelle's ability to connect with her  students by promoting learning through community projects and classroom  experiments. She enjoys making her students excited to study science,  and they have learned to expect a new project each time they enter her  classroom.   Michelle has taught science for 13 years at Buddy Taylor Middle  School. She also serves as an adviser for the school's after-school  STEM club.   I extend my best wishes to Michelle for receiving this award and look  forward to hearing of her continued good work in the years to  come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am pleased to honor Leena  Hall-Young, the Duval County Teacher of the Year at Raines High School  in Jacksonville, FL.

Samantha is the Visual Arts Teacher at Mariner High School and has  worked for 7 years in the Lee County School District. Under Samantha's  leadership, the school's STEM Academy has become the STEAM Academy,  with an art curriculum added to science, technology, engineering, and  math. She also began the school's first National Art Honor Society and  supports nearby elementary and middle school art programs.   Samantha holds that an education is able to transform a child's  entire life. She urges her students to ask the question why: Why do  they like something, and why do they do what they do? She does this  until they begin to ask these questions themselves. When this happens,  Samantha knows they have found comfort in taking risks.  [[Page S4467]]    While Samantha always wants her students to do their best and earn  good grades, she strives for them to walk out of her classroom knowing  how to think and respond to circumstances with prudence. Since opening  her advanced placement classes to all students 2 years ago, her  students have produced the highest AP 2D studio art scores in the  school district. Her goal is to prepare her students for college and  careers through gaining experience and developing skills above and  beyond their peers.   I am pleased to recognize Samantha for her hard work. I extend to her  my warmest regards, and I look forward to hearing of her continued  success in the years ahead.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I recognize Ryan Mitchell, the  Hamilton County Teacher of the Year from Hamilton County High School in  Jasper, FL.

He is grateful for the countless  relationships he has developed in Hamilton County and throughout  Florida. It is these relationships that have made him the teacher he is  today.   Ryan is also very thankful for his students and considers it an honor  to be their teacher. Each day, he looks forward to teaching his  students, knowing they are the next generation of future leaders. Ryan  makes sure he is available to answer all of his student's questions,  and he hopes they learn half as much from him as he learns from them.
