 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from  Louisiana, Garret Graves, for yielding. I thank him for taking this  Special Order for a special person.   Now, I must say I am not going to have any funny stories about Don,  although funny stories there are. Nor can I say that I ever fished with  Don, because I didn't. Nor did I ever hunt with Don. I didn't. But I  served 41 years with Don Young, and I got to know him very well: As a  friend, as a Member of this House, as a fellow American; and, yes,  incidentally as a Republican and a Democrat because neither Don nor I  proceeded in our relationship on the basis of our party affiliation but  on the basis of common ideals, common objectives, and common love for  this country.                                time  1915    I am honored to join my colleagues in paying tribute to my friend Don  Young, who represented the State of Alaska in this House for 49 years.   Don was one of three people who were senior to me in this House.  There are two Republicans, Mr. Smith and Mr. Rogers, who I think both  have the same seniority, so maybe they are co-deans of the House. But I  am the senior Democrat in the House, and therefore, I had a long time  to work with, to know, and to grow in respect for a crusty curmudgeon  who could be as tough as nails but could also be as nice as you would  hope a fellow colleague to be.   As a matter of fact, I was here working as--I wasn't an intern  because I was getting paid. I was at Georgetown Law School working when  Alaska became a State. When Alaska and Hawaii became States, they  became States together. The theory was that Alaska would be a Democrat  State and Hawaii would be a Republican State. I use that analogy  because who knows what we are going to be 10 years from now or 20 years  from now, so making decisions on a partisan basis probably is not what  we ought to be doing.   But Don loved Alaska, and as the junior Senator from Alaska said  today at the memorial service held for Don as he lay in state, an honor  few Americans get--less than 50 Americans. Don Young got that honor.   Many, of course, have commented on the sudden and unexpected nature  of his passing. Surely, however, death had to take him by surprise  because if he had seen death coming, death would not have stood a  chance.   Don Young was ferocious. He was ferocious for his constituents, for  whom he felt a sacred responsibility and delivered so much over his 25  terms in office. He said, ``I will defend my State to the dying  breath,'' and that he did.   When he was taken from us, Don was on his way home from legislative  session, headed back to meet with his constituents and make sure they  knew how he was fighting for them in Washington.   Don was ferocious, but he also was gentle. Those who got to know him  saw that behind that often-prickly facade was a tender and warm-hearted  man who cared about his country and cared about his colleagues. He  cared most of all about his family.   The love he felt for his family, for his constituents, and for the  institution was as enormous as the State he represented.   I particularly was close to Don and fond of Don because he loved this  institution. I love this institution. It is one  [[Page H3959]]  of the unique institutions of the world where the only way you can get  here is for your neighbors to choose you. Nobody can appoint you. No  Governor can appoint you. No President can appoint you. No majority  here can appoint you. You come here because your neighbors respect you.  And Don's neighbors 25 times over almost 50 years got the opportunity  to say: Don Young, we trust you, and we want you to go to Washington to  represent us.   There is only one Member of Congress from Alaska. They have two  Senators but only one Representative. What an honor for all of us to be  selected by our neighbors to represent and articulate their voice in  the Halls of this Congress.   I respected Don, and he respected me. On many occasions, we stood and  worked together on behalf of this institution and on behalf of the  Members of this institution.   Don had a passion, as we all know, for decorum, known for tapping his  cane and urging whoever sat in the chair to call the vote. ``Regular  order'' would come from the seat at the back of the Chamber because he  felt that the Chair was not bringing the vote to a close soon enough.  And he was right. It didn't mean that the Chair closed the vote because  we were waiting for other people to come because they were late--but  never Don Young. When the bell rang, Don Young answered the call. He  never sat in the corner. He was always ready for the fight. He was  always ready for the challenge.   When votes were called, we weren't always on the same side. That is  what is written here. We were very rarely on the same side, but we were  always on the same side when it came to Members, this institution, and  the American people.   In fact, just because we were on opposite sides, it did not mean that  we were on opposite sides from a personal standpoint. I hope all of us  could learn that lesson. We are all chosen by our neighbors, as I said,  to be here. For that reason alone, we ought to respect one another.   I don't mean that everybody does things that ought to be respected  all the time; they don't. But it is important to understand,  particularly now as Putin is testing whether democracies can work. Xi,  the leader of China, and Putin wrote a 5,000-page paper just about 6  weeks ago. Their premise was democracies cannot succeed because they  cannot come together, and they cannot make decisions in a timely  fashion.   Don Young was somebody you could go to in a very collegial fashion,  and if you disagreed, you disagreed with honor on each side. But if you  agreed, you joined hands to accomplish the objectives of that  agreement.   I always knew that Don believed he was doing the best he could for  those he served, and he spoke and voted with his convictions. Whenever,  as I have just said, we found common ground and common cause, it was a  pleasure working with him and knowing that I had alongside me someone  so fiercely devoted to getting a job done on behalf of his people and  on behalf of our country.   It says here that now Don is at rest. The good Lord is saying, if  that is rest, I am in real trouble because that guy is not stopping. He  is still punching. He is still fighting. He is still yelling out  ``regular order.''   We are better for having known him and served with him.   I join in offering his wife, Anne--who I hugged and gave a kiss to  earlier today. I said how much I grieved his loss and shared her love  for this extraordinary man. His daughters will miss him. Their families  will miss him. We will miss him. And this institution will miss him.
