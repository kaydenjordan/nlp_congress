 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership and  for his love of this institution.   Mr. Speaker, the Build Back Better Act is about future opportunity  for our districts and for our democracy.   As an immigrant-fueled, frontier nation, we value individual mobility  and reward hard work. That is the foundation of why we are the richest  and most successful nation ever. However, we are at an inflection point  in which the past failure to invest in our working families has led to  the degradation of our common life. That is why now more than ever we  must provide more for the people who have plied through the pandemic,  who propel our economic prosperity and promote our national unity.    This legislation does that by focusing on children, education,  healthcare, and affordable housing; by furthering our fight for clean  energy and climate resiliency with e-buses, e-bikes, and microgrids;  and by financing it in a way that protects our family farms and  promotes our farm workers.   For those of you who vote against this legislation today, you will  probably take credit for it tomorrow because this investment will  benefit not just my constituents but yours, too, because this bill  provides every working family, not just with the resources to succeed  in our country but with the dignity they deserve by playing a part in  our democracy.
