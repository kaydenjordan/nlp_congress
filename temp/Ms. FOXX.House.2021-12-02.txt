 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so  we can bring up H.R. 6056, the Parents Bill of Rights Act.   There has been a push to silence parents around the country. Powerful  teachers unions, several school boards, Democrat politicians, and the  Biden Justice Department have all voiced opposition to the rights of  parents to have a say in their child's education.   We will not stand for this kind of intimidation, and we will not  tolerate the left's attempt to push parents out of the decisionmaking  process when it comes to their child's education.   That is why we have introduced the Parents Bill of Rights. This  legislation will protect rights parents already have but that are now  under attack.   I can't imagine why anyone would oppose the Parents Bill of Rights  Act. Making school spending and curriculum transparent should already  be the norm. After all, what do schools have to hide?   This bill will also ensure that schools do not share or sell private  student data or attempt to administer health examinations without  parental consent. These are extremely important decisions that belong  to parents, not bureaucrats or school administrators.   The left's assault on parental rights is outrageous. To claim that  parents are akin to domestic terrorists just because they don't agree  with the left's agenda is beyond the pale. Yet, it is these very  attacks that have shown Americans all around the country just how  important it is to stand up to the left. We cannot let our fundamental  rights be stripped from us, especially the right to raise our children.   This bill is ushering in a new era of education, one where parents  won't take a back seat to the system. One thing is certain, our  children and the country will be better off for having the Parents Bill  of Rights.
