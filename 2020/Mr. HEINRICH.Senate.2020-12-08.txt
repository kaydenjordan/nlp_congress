 Madam President, it is my honor today to commend the  senior Senator from New Mexico, my longtime partner in this Chamber, my  good friend Tom Udall, for his years of service to our great State of  New Mexico and to our Nation.   Before I speak about Tom, I would like to quickly take a moment, too,  to recognize the service of Congresswoman Xochitl Torres Small over  these last 2 years.   Congresswoman Torres Small actually served for a time in Senator  Udall's office in Las Cruces, and for these last 2 years in the House  of Representatives, she has dedicated herself to delivering resources  for the people of southern New Mexico. And I am so very grateful to  have served alongside Xochitl in our congressional delegation, and I am  greatly looking forward to seeing how she will contribute her heart and  her talents to New Mexico next. She certainly learned a great deal from  our senior Senator.
