 Madam President, I am proud to recognize BG Erik H.  Torring III, who is retiring after 30 years in the U.S. Army. General  Torring has been a leader in not only our soldiers' health, but the  health of all the service animals that support our soldiers, sailors,  airmen, and marines on the battlefield.   General Torring's career culminated in his current post as both  Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations in the Army's Office of the  Surgeon General and Chief of the U.S. Army Veterinary Corps, where he  oversees the recruitment, training, and equipment of almost 3,000  veterinary personnel in the U.S. Army. He spearheaded the development  of the Army's electronic veterinary records program and maintained  standards for food safety across the Armed Forces.   For his service to the United States of America, I am proud to  recognize Brigadier General Torring and welcome him home to  Texas.                            ____________________
