 While Ambassador Sondland's mandate as the       accredited Ambassador to the European Union did not cover       individual member states, let alone nonmember countries like       Ukraine, he made clear that he had direct and frequent access       to President Trump and Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and       portrayed himself as the conduit to the President and Mr.       Mulvaney for this group.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. After the U.S. delegation returned from the  inauguration of the new Ukrainian President in April, they were able to  secure an Oval Office meeting with President Trump to brief him on  their trip, in part because of Ambassador Sondland's connections to  Mick Mulvaney.   Then, during a June 18, 2019, meeting, Ambassador Sondland informed  National Security Council Senior Director Dr. Fiona Hill that he was in  charge of Ukraine and that he had been briefing senior White House  officials, including Mr. Mulvaney, about his efforts to undertake, as  Dr. Hill put it, a domestic political errand in Ukraine.   Here is Dr. Hill explaining this herself.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Dr. HILL. So I was upset with him that he wasn't fully       telling us about all of the meetings that he was having. And       he said to me, But I'm briefing the President, I'm briefing       Chief of Staff Mulvaney, I'm briefing Secretary Pompeo, and I       talked to Ambassador Bolton. Who else do I have to deal with?       And the point is, we have a robust interagency process that       deals with Ukraine. It includes Mr. Holmes. It includes       Ambassador Taylor as the charge in Ukraine. It includes a       whole load of other people. But it struck me when yesterday,       when you put up on the screen Ambassador Sondland's emails       and who was on these emails, and he said, These are the       people who need to know, that he was absolutely right.       Because he was being involved in a domestic political errand,       and we were being involved in national security foreign       policy, and those two things had just diverged.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. And there is more--much more. A month later,  President Trump's National Security Advisor at the time, John Bolton,  told Dr. Fiona Hill to tell the National Security Council's lawyers  that he was not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney were  cooking up. He made that statement after Ambassador Sondland  specifically said that he had a deal with Mr. Mulvaney to schedule a  White House visit for President Zelensky if Ukraine announced the two  phony investigations involving the Bidens and 2016 election  interference--investigations that were sought by President Donald John  Trump.   Here is Dr. Hill's testimony about Sondland describing this drug deal  he had with Mulvaney.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Dr. HILL. And so when I came in, Gordon Sondland was       basically saying, well, look, we have a deal here that there       will be a meeting. I have a deal here with Chief of Staff       Mulvaney that there will be a meeting if the Ukrainians open       up or announce these investigations into 2016 and Burisma.       And I cut it off immediately there. Because by this point,       having heard Mr. Giuliani over and over again on the       television and all of the issues that he was asserting, by       this point it was clear that Burisma was code for the Bidens,       because Giuliani was laying it out there. I could see why       Colonel Vindman was alarmed, and he said, this is       inappropriate, we're the National Security Council, we can't       be involved in this.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. The referenced agreement between Ambassador  Sondland and Mick Mulvaney was so upsetting that Dr. Hill reported it  to National Security Council legal advisers. Here is the testimony of  Dr. Hill explaining these particular concerns.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Dr. HILL. Yes, but he was--he was making a very strong       point that he wanted to know exactly what was being said. And       when I came back and related it to him, he had some very       specific instructions for me. And I'm presuming that that's       the question that you're asking.
