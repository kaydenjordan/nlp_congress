 Madam Speaker, for years I have said that the 1965  Voting Rights Act was written between Selma and Montgomery. The Voting  Rights Act leveled the playing field and transformed southern electoral  politics.   Since the Shelby decision, the right to vote and access to the ballot  box are being compromised. The Subcommittee on Elections, which I  chair, held five hearings, we called over 35 witnesses, produced a  report detailing clear evidence of ongoing voter discrimination all  across the country.   I thank Chairman Nadler, Chairman Cohen, and Ms. Sewell for a good  bill. The Voting Rights Act is as important today as ever. Passage of  H.R. 4 will protect the right to vote and fully enforce the 15th  Amendment.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
