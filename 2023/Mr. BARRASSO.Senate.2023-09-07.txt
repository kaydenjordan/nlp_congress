 Mr. President, I come to support Senator Vance's  Freedom to Breathe Act. I believe this bill is a vital step to protect  the individual's rights as well as preserving State's rights. And in  the interest of time, I would just point out, too, that we have a  number of Republican Senators on the floor standing with Senator Vance  in support of this legislation. I see Senator Cruz here from Texas,  Senator Mike Braun from Indiana, Ted Budd from North Carolina, Katie  Britt from Alabama, and Eric Schmitt of Missouri. I appreciate all of  them being here to support and stand with Senator Vance on this  important piece of legislation.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S4256]]
