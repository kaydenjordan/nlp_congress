 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman for  helping organize this evening.   Mr. Speaker, today, as we commemorate International Holocaust  Remembrance Day and the 75 years since the liberation of Auschwitz, it  is important that we honor the 6 million Jewish victims of the  Holocaust and the millions of other victims of the evil Nazi regime--we  honor their memory, we honor their bravery, and we honor their spirit.   It is also important that we pay tribute to the survivors who  continue to share their stories to ensure that all of us, especially  the younger generations, never forget the grave tragedy that took  place. As Elie Wiesel said: ``For the dead and the living, we must bear  witness.''   Sadly, the frequency and the scale of anti-Semitic incidents in our  Nation and across the globe have increased, causing deep alarm. We must  continue to speak up, and we must continue to play a role in shining a  spotlight on the ugly resurgence of this hate.   Today, on the annual day of commemoration, my colleagues and I came  together and we passed legislation, the Never Again Education Act,  which will ensure our children, tomorrow's leaders, are taught about  the horrors of the Holocaust.   I appreciate my colleagues for joining me in being united in our  mission to combat the rise of anti-Semitism around the world, as well  as taking this time to honor the victims of the Holocaust.   We must take this opportunity to reflect on the past in hopes of  preventing this type of evil from reoccurring. Let us remember those  who perished in the Holocaust and pray that this never happens again.
