 Madam Speaker, the contributions of women run deep  throughout the history of America and the fabric of our entire Nation.   One such woman was Harriet Tubman, who escaped slavery and dedicated  her life's mission to ensuring freedom for others.   Building a network of abolitionists, Harriet Tubman organized safe  houses throughout the Underground Railroad, including in my district,  while making rescues and freeing others who were previously enslaved.   As she put it, there are one of two things that she had a right to-- liberty or death.   Madam Speaker, on International Women's Day and 2 days before Harriet  Tubman Day, we remember her. When we look at young girls in Afghanistan  and we look at young girls in other parts of the world like Iran  seeking to have education, we remember Harriet Tubman. When we fight  for equal pay for equal work, we remember Harriet Tubman. When we fight  and advocate for a woman's right to choose, we remember Harriet Tubman.  When we help those mothers that try to seek asylum at the border with  their children, Madam Speaker, we remember Harriet Tubman.   Let's remember Harriet Tubman today as we celebrate International  Women's Day.                            ____________________
