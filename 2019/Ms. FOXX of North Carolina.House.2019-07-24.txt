 Mr. Speaker, we all have been privileged  to know people in our communities who have led remarkable lives but are  unsung heroes. Today, I want to highlight one such couple whom I have  come to know and admire.   I rise to recognize Ralph and Christine Brown, a remarkable couple  and role models for all the rest of us.   They grew up in families of very modest means. While working full  time, Ralph began a one-man security business in 1963. What started as  Lake Norman Security Patrol, Inc., expanded into two of the most  successful businesses in North Carolina and the country: Security  Central and AlarmSouth.   Ralph learned the importance of security while serving as a U.S. Army  policeman and turned his knowledge into security and patrol services  for homes and commercial entities.   At his side was Christine, his brilliant helpmate. They have a  wonderful and philanthropic family that is carrying on the family  tradition and business into the third generation.   Ralph and Christine's success has not only become a family legacy but  has benefited numerous good causes in the community through their  generosity, including the American Heart Association, the United Way,  and Grandfather Home for Children.   Having inspiration and determination combined with hard work was  their recipe for remarkable success. The Browns are proof that the  American Dream is alive and well.                Recognizing DKG in Region IX of North Carolina     Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate  Region IX of the North Carolina State Organization of the Delta Kappa  Gamma Society on their achievements at the State convention in Hickory,  North Carolina.   Region IX makes up eight chapters across North Carolina's Fifth  District and took home five achievement awards, three communications  excellence awards, and two newsletter and website awards.   These recognitions speak to the chapter's success in its mission to  promote the professional and personal growth of women educators and  excellence in education.   As an educator myself, I know the incredible difference it makes to  have opportunities for mentorship, professional development, and  scholarships.   The society invites members who are dedicated to education in  different fields, both active and retired, to build up future leaders  at the local level. As we all know, the local level is where the best  practices and policies in education come from.   Knowing that young educators in the Fifth District have such talented  and locally engaged women behind them makes me very proud. These women  are shining examples of the powerful impact that organizing within our  communities has on future generations.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, my colleague on the other side of the aisle said that  we have a house on fire and we must do something about it. What this  bill does is it gives more gasoline to the arsonist who started the  fire.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 397, a risky, fiscally  irresponsible, politically motivated scheme that will negatively impact  hardworking Americans and retirees.   Union multiemployer pension plans are currently underfunded by $638  billion, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, PBGC, which  ensures these pensions, has a $54 billion deficit. In other words,  workers and retirees won't see the benefits they have been promised  because of union and employer negligence.   This problem requires a serious, bipartisan response. That is why,  historically, Members on both sides of the aisle have worked together  on this issue. But last month, when the Education and Labor Committee  marked up H.R. 397, committee Republicans were shut out of the debate  and denied the opportunity to offer even a single amendment, a highly  unfortunate and inappropriate decision.   For the first time ever, taxpayers will prop u failing, mismanaged,  union-run pension plans. These plans, all 160 of them, can apply for a  government loan. There is no limit to the loan amount, and, remarkably,  the loans will be completely forgiven if they are unable to be repaid  after 29 years.    The chairman of the Education and Labor Committee said: ``If you  can't pay it back, you can't pay it back.'' So, by the chairman's own  admission, we are giving failed union pensions a blank check. What a  deal.   All the while, H.R. 397 allows plans to continue to promise new  benefits, allowing their liabilities to grow.   While I strongly oppose what H.R. 397 intends to do, I am equally  appalled by  [[Page H7324]]  what the bill fails to do. This legislation fails to include any  reforms that would ensure responsible funding of future benefit  promises or prevent a similar situation from recurring.   The bill also fails to address the chronic underfunding that plagues  the entire union multiemployer system and passively accepts that plan  trustees and actuaries may continue to underestimate pension promises-- to the detriment of workers and retirees. In fact, under H.R. 397, the  situation could become far worse.   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, CBO, now estimates that  H.R. 397 could increase the Federal budget deficit by more than $48  billion. But that estimate is based on last-minute, bogus Democrat pay- fors and covers only the bill's first 10 years. If we look at the 30- year scheme created by the bill, we will find a price tag of hundreds  of billions of dollars. And remember, it is American taxpayers who are  on the hook.   Madam Speaker, Congress was set up to be in this position years ago  because Democrats and unions and employers knew that Members and the  public would feel sorry for the union members who were not taken care  of by those they trusted to take care of them. Every Member here should  feel angry about being put in this position. H.R. 397 is a fiscally  irresponsible and careless approach that will cause far more harm than  good.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from  Michigan is correct. The union members are not at fault. The union  bosses are at fault, and hardworking, nonunion taxpayers should not be  bailing out the union bosses for their mistakes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  David P. Roe).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Wright).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder  of my time.  [[Page H7327]]    Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is that retirees and workers in  multiemployer union pension plans deserve better than a political  statement disguised as a legislative proposal.   Advancing this highly flawed bill, which has no chance of being  passed in the Senate, will only result in delays rather than solutions  for workers and retirees who are so rightfully concerned about the  state of their pensions.   Mr. Speaker, the individuals in the unions did trust those in charge.  They are not at fault for what has happened, but I urge all of my  colleagues to join me in opposing H.R. 397, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
