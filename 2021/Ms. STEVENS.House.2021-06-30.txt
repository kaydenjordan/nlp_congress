 Mr. Speaker, I thank the vice chair of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee from the State of Kansas.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the INVEST in America Act which  authorizes billions of dollars in direct infrastructure investment over  the next 5 years to address America's crumbling wastewater and local  water quality challenges--something we know all too well in Michigan,  particularly in the wake of our communities being deluged by storms and  deluged by wastewater coming up into our roads and into people's homes.   Less than 50 years ago, many U.S. rivers were little more than open  sewers with some so polluted that they literally caught fire--something  that, yet again, motivated Members of Congress from Michigan to enact  landmark legislation. But even today, communities are struggling.   For instance, for decades, to this day, residents of Centreville,  Illinois, a nearly all Black town of 5,000 in southern Illinois, just a  12-minute drive from downtown East St. Louis, had been dealing with  persistent flooding and sewage overflows.   The smell of it is in the air and all over the town after a rain, and  bits of soggy toilet paper and slicks of human waste cling to the grass  in the neighborhoods where children used to play on warm days.   This, Mr. Speaker, is why we commit to an infrastructure bill because  we are standing for the guarantee that everyone deserves to live safely  and in clean environments.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  bipartisan bill that will get us the wastewater spend and make our  country great.
