 Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today  to coanchor this CBC Special Order hour.   I would like to acknowledge the great work and the leadership of our  chair, Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, and, of course, my coanchor, Marc  Veasey of Texas, as we lead the discussion for the next 60 minutes.   In these next 60 minutes, we have a chance to speak directly to the  American people on issues of great importance to the Congressional  Black Caucus, Congress, and the constituents that we represent.   In this hour, we would like to discuss racism and discrimination in  America and, specifically, hate crimes and the radicalization and the  domestic terrorism that they present to the American people.   The conclusion of Dylann Roof's trial a few month's ago is the latest  reminder that homegrown terrorism has become part of the fabric of life  in America. This problem shows no signs of fading yet reveals a threat  that is both rare and more complex than simple explanation suggests.   Solving the issue of domestic terrorism through hate crimes involves  understanding the true nature of the problem--violent domestic  extremism--so that effective steps can be taken to protect the Nation  from it.   It is legitimate to ask whether homegrown terrorists are being  radicalized. We talk about jihadi narratives and Islamic extremism, the  Islamic State group recruiting online; but there are other groups in  this Nation which are radicalizing our youth, radicalizing young people  to be a threat against other Americans. This is a subject and a  discussion that has rarely been discussed and which we believe is very  important.   Since 2001, almost 40 percent of the nearly 150 terrorism fatalities  in the United States were related to domestic motivations, not jihadi  narratives. It is my hope that in the discussion we will have this hour  we are able to discuss in depth the effect that these hate crimes and  this domestic violence has on the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter that was written June  7, 2017, by the Congressional Black Caucus to the Honorable Jeff  Sessions, Attorney General; Andrew McCabe, Acting Director of the FBI;  and John Kelly, Secretary of Homeland Security, in which we express our  concern over the alarming number of hate crimes reported across the  country, particularly in the wake of the election of President Donald  J. Trump.                                                       Congressional                                                    Black Caucus,                                       Washington, DC, June 7, 2017.      Hon. Jeff Sessions,      Attorney General, Department of Justice, Washington, DC.      Andrew McCabe,      Acting Director, Federal Bureau of Investigations,           Washington, DC.      Hon. John Kelly,      Secretary of Homeland Security, Department of Homeland           Security, Washington, DC.        Dear Attorney General Sessions and Acting Director McCabe:       I write today to express my concern over the alarming number       of hate crimes reported across the country, particularly in       the wake of the election of President Donald J. Trump. In       addition to speaking out against this rising tide of hate,       violence, and intolerance, it is critical that your agencies       proactively investigate each and every incident of a       potential hate crime and aggressively prosecute these cases       to the fullest extent of the law.        During the presidential campaign, then-candidate Donald       Trump employed starkly divisive rhetoric to connect with a       segment of his base that relished in cultural grievance and       hatred. His tone and the arguments that he made were       incredibly offensive to minority communities, and his       campaign rallies were forums for some of the ugliest public       displays of race-based violence and animus in modern       political times. Numerous Black Americans were assaulted at       his rallies and scenes of deep racial resentment against       Blacks, Hispanics, immigrants, and Muslims were frequently       paraded and celebrated.        Since the election, it seems hate-filled individuals have       been emboldened to terrorize minority communities. In just       the first 34 days after the election, the Southern Poverty       Law Center counted a total of 1,094 bias incidents around the       nation. Disturbingly, the Center also calculated that 37       percent of these cases directly referenced either President-      elect Trump, his campaign slogans, or his infamous remarks       about sexual assault. This data is just from the immediate       aftermath of the election. The numbers have increased since       then, with national news providing coverage. These are not       isolated incidents, but rather a frightening trend forming       before our eyes.        In fact, this is occurring in Congress' own back yard, like       the horrific hate crime that took place just a few miles away       at the University of Maryland when Richard Collins III, a       promising young man, was stabbed to death on the eve of his       graduation from Bowie State University by an admitted white       supremacist. There have also been several reports of nooses       hung throughout the District of Columbia, including in the       African American Museum of History and Culture and on       American University's campus. To add insult to injury, a       Mississippi lawmaker recently called for Louisiana       politicians to be ``lynched'' for supporting the removal of       racist confederate monuments from New Orleans.        Surely there is no greater cause of a government than to       protect the lives of its citizens, particularly those       uniquely vulnerable to hate, intolerance, and violence. The       federal hate crimes statutes were designed with that mission       in mind and serve as a critically important tool in       combatting the most insidious elements of our society. That       is why I implore you to dedicate additional resources within       your respective agencies to address the increasing frequency       of these deplorable acts. you should and must investigate       each and every potential hate crime and prosecute offenders       to the fullest extent allowed under the law. You should also       ensure that community leaders, including state and local law       enforcement, understand the federal resources available to       investigate and prosecute hate crimes.        Your leadership is required to not only bring justice to       the victims of hate crimes, but also to send a clear message       that these acts of domestic terrorism will never be tolerated       in this country.            Sincerely,                                                   Cedric Richmond,                                 Chair, Congressional Black Caucus.     In addition to speaking out against the rising tide of  hate, violence, and intolerance in this country, it is critical that  those agencies--the FBI, the Department of Justice, as well as Homeland  Security--speak out and proactively investigate each and every incident  of potential hate crime and aggressively prosecute these cases to the  fullest extent of the law.   Since the election, it seems that hate-filled individuals have been  emboldened to terrorize minority communities. In just the first 34 days  after the election, the Southern Poverty Law Center counted a total of  1,094 bias incidents around the Nation. Disturbingly, the center also  calculated that 37 percent of these cases directly referenced either  President-elect Trump at the time, his campaign slogans, or infamous  remarks about sexual assault. This data is just from the immediate  aftermath of the election. The numbers have increased since then.   It is the responsibility of this Congress as well as those agencies  to stem this flow of violence that is occurring in this Nation. We know  that our President would not tolerate these sorts of matters, and we  are hopeful that he, the Justice Department, the FBI, and Homeland  Security will do whatever is necessary to protect American lives from  hate crimes that are occurring, domestic terrorism, and the  radicalization of our young people to exert hate against other  Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey), my  coanchor, to speak on this issue. Then we will have an opportunity to  hear from other members of the Congressional Black Caucus about this.    Congressman Veasey, I think it is important, one of the  things you talked about is what is going on in our homes and the fact  that our children can be radicalized outside of the home. This is an  opportunity for us as Americans to see the victimization even of those  children who become a part of the alt-right, who become a part of neo- Nazi groups; that they are, in fact, being radicalized by these very  disturbing groups, and that we, as leaders in America, have a  responsibility.   That is why I am asking unanimous consent to have the letter that was  written by Chairman Cedric Richmond put into the Record--the letter of  June 7 that went to the FBI, to Homeland Security, as well as to the  Justice Department to ask them to investigate and take proactive  stances; not just to protect those individuals who are victimized when  violence occurs, but to protect those young people and others who may  be untowardly influenced by social media to become part of these  groups.   I think that is a great point that you bring up, as well as our  President becoming someone who can lead the charge against this. We see  the rise of this activity during his campaign and after his election.  Well, then our President needs to be the one to be Presidential and to  stem this influence and this rise of hate crimes that are taking place.   Mr. Speaker, at this time I am asking that our colleague, Donald  Payne, from the great State of New Jersey, who has done an amazing  amount of work in his own community in the area of Newark in trying to  stem violence and criminal justice, the reform work that he is doing,  to speak on this matter this evening. I thank him so much for the time  that he is giving us. I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Payne).    Thank you so much, Mr. Payne, for your words, your  enlightenment, and for sharing that very personal piece of you and your  own experience. There are so many African Americans and so many people  of color in this country who have those exact same experiences.   Whether it is us, personally--I know I have mine exactly like that.  You know, I have four sons, and each one of them have had that kind of  experience here in this country.   With the rise of hate that is occurring, we have to be careful for  every American and we need to be concerned that this country is no  longer becoming a safe place for groups of individuals; that there are  people that are rising up and attempting to terrorize other Americans.  This should be of concern to Congress. This should be of concern to our  President.   I thank Mr. Payne again for that.   Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield to Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee  from Texas, who sits not only on the Budget Committee, but, very  relevant to our discussion this evening, is one of the senior members  of the Judiciary Committee, as well as Homeland Security Subcommittee,  where so many of these issues form a confluence.   Thank you so much for being with us this evening, Congresswoman  Jackson Lee. We look forward to your remarks and to the enlightenment  that you will be giving us here in this Chamber as well as the American  people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Well, first of all, it is my honor and privilege to  thank Congresswoman Plaskett for her ongoing leadership in speaking to  our colleagues and the American people. Let me take a moment of  personal privilege to say to her that, over the weekend in Texas, I was  with a number of individuals from the Virgin Islands, and it certainly  was my first task to tell them of the excellent representation that  they were getting by her leadership on so many issues.   But to you, I want to say that we were at the commissioning of the  USS Gabrielle Giffords, and proudly so. The commander of that ship is  from the Virgin Islands, so there was a contingent of individuals from  all over the country for recognizing the commander and his wife. Let me  say that I made sure that those sailors knew who was supporting them as  well. It certainly was a great honor to former Congresswoman Giffords,  and there wasn't a dry eye as we did that. So I just wanted to add that  and thank you for your indulgence of that.   If I might, let me also acknowledge my colleague on the floor,  Congresswoman Val Demings, and Floridians who are here, just to make  note of the commemoration of the tragedy at the Pulse Nightclub.                                time  1945    This is the area in which the Congresswoman policed, if you will, and  her spouse still there leads the community in law enforcement. I will  honor to those who lost their lives, but to the recognition that  terrorism and hateful acts are not to be accepted by any of us.   As a good friend of mine, a Muslim, said yesterday as we stood  against hateful acts against Muslims around the world, and particularly  around the United States, he said that the way that we deal with this  danger is to love in recognition of the human dignity of all.   To the LGBTQ community, my deepest sympathy and recognition in this  month that we honor and have Pride Month that we recognize your deep  involvement in this country and your right to human dignity. So I thank  Congresswoman Plaskett for allowing me to engage in that statement.   Let me say that I would hope that none of us would have wanted to be  on the floor tonight to talk about the changing face of America since  the election of the President of the United States but, in fact, to  recognize that there has been a surge in discrimination throughout this  Nation.   The roots of racial extremist violence against peaceful Black  communities runs deep in American history: from this country's dark  path of chattel slavery; to the southern lynch mobs that sought to  permanently disenfranchise the Black vote; to the church bombing that  killed four little Black girls in Birmingham; to the dismantling of an  entire economic district in Tulsa; and to the senseless stabbing, just  a few weeks ago, of a bright, young man by the name of Richard Collins  III.   I am sad that the election of President Trump--and I am not sure  whether this has been brought to his attention. I would like to bring  it to his attention--has created a divisive atmosphere. Trump's  political debut was centered on the racist birther movement, which  questioned the citizenship of then-President Obama.  [[Page H4841]]    He was not in office then. And to some, it was a little humorous;  some were shocked. Certainly, the Black community did not take it  humorously. This was a Senator who had been duly elected by the  citizens of Illinois. He had done nothing to bring in commentary on  himself personally. He sought the Presidency of the United States. He  offered to the American people all of the documentation that would be  required, yet Donald Trump persisted for 5 years in insisting, through  fake news, that he was not a citizen of the United States of America.   During his political campaign, he repeatedly refused to reject the  endorsement of White supremacist groups. He failed to condemn  supporters who shouted out racist slurs, and, on occasion, violently  attacked protestors who happened to be an African-American woman, in  particular.   In a nation completely comprised of immigrants, he has built a  hateful movement around building a wall. And to my friends who are  Hispanic, particularly Mexicans, he called them drug dealers and any  number of names.   This country has prided itself on the value of immigration, of  diversity, and, certainly, freed slaves who have come to make this  country the great country that it is. Overall, his anti-immigrant  incidents were the most reported, 315 incidents; followed by anti- Black, 221; anti-Muslim, 112; and anti-LGBT, 109.   So I just want to take a moment to add to my commentary, the things  that I think are grossly horrific; that we should realize that this is  not a time for the CBC to be on the floor casting blame.   Let me also, as I acknowledge Congresswoman Plaskett, thank our  chairperson, Congressman Cedric Richmond, for his really unceasing  leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus and the work that he has  done to make sure that we astutely have the information to be the  conscience of Congress.   These are the pictures of hatred. This is the individual who killed  the young man that--I don't want to show the wrong picture--but this is  a picture of an individual who was engaged in the killing of two  individuals, I believe in Portland, Oregon, because they were trying to  defend someone of a different background.   We have a noose found hanging near a school in Washington, D.C. This  is a picture of that. This has all happened since the election of  President Trump.   We have an incident, June 9, 2017, The Washington Post says, `` `Shut  up, Slave!': A spilled Starbucks drink led to a racist tirade and  sidewalk fight. . . .''   I don't know if people are under extreme tension, but this is all  happening in 2017.   We have another one: A day without racism? Not for Trump's  administration. The Department of Justice is dismantling, or lowering  the Civil Rights Division, cutting the staffing that is there.   Hate crimes in the U.S. rising. These are the kinds of things. And  tragically, here is a handsome, beautiful, young man who was taking his  commission and getting ready to graduate, Richard Collins III, and he  was killed.   Let me finish on these points about the criminal justice system that  I think is very important.   Black Americans are more likely to have their cars searched.   Black Americans are more likely to be arrested for drug use.   Black Americans are more likely to be jailed while awaiting trial.   Black Americans are more likely to be offered a plea deal that  includes prison time.   Black Americans are more likely to serve longer sentences than White  Americans for the same offense.   Black Americans are more likely to be disenfranchised.   We also know that we have statistics, that I will offer into the  Record, of Black American youth who are more likely to be included in  the juvenile detention center, police stops, police searches, use of  force during arrest, juvenile arrests, transgender arrests. Sixty  percent of the transgender arrests are Black or Latino; arrests for  marijuana.   Most Blacks are not likely to get pretrial release. More Blacks are  likely to be prosecuted. More Blacks are likely to get prison versus  community service. Length of incarceration is longer than Whites.    State judge incarceration, there are 208,000 people in State prison  for drug offenses; 32 percent are White, 68 percent are Black.   Federal drug convictions are higher among African Americans. Forty- seven percent were Hispanics, and we are higher than those.   Federal court sentencing, and, of course, incarceration of women  African Americans are higher. Sentencing to life without parole,  African Americans are higher, 65 percent.   Hiring people with criminal records, that makes it very difficult for  us to work, and eliminating the right to vote.   So, Congresswoman, I will close by simply saying, where is the  President on standing with the moral compass of asking the hatred to  stop; to really empower a Department of Justice not to be led by an  individual who has fought against voting rights, fought against the  rights of those who are seeking to be rehabilitated in the criminal  justice system; to join a bipartisan army of individuals against mass  incarceration? Where is the President in standing against the hatred  that has impacted the African-American community?   The words that he has said, where is the President in stopping this  onslaught that is generating into violence in the streets?   Where is the moral compass of this administration? If it is not you,  Mr. President, the Congressional Black Caucus will not take a back seat  to you. We will fight and bring this country back to where it should  be, and that is a country that believes in the equality of all  Americans, and the African Americans who have died and bled in wars,  and have been slaves, and, in essence, came through a reformation to be  free. We will not take a back seat to all of this hatred.   I ask you, Mr. President, where are your answers?   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues, Congressman Veasey and  Congresswoman Plaskett for anchoring this important special order on  ``Racism and Discrimination in America.''   For over 40 years the CBC has been at the forefront in the fight  against the evils of racism, discrimination, marginalization, and the  various manifestations of institutionalized racial bias.   In today's uncertain times, we must be more steadfast than ever to  continue that fight.   No matter what your party identification is, I believe we can all  agree that we must root out extremist violence everywhere, and  especially within our borders.   And while we are all committed to eliminating ISIS and all its  sympathizers, we must not underestimate the threat of domestic  terrorism and domestic violence by racial extremists.   Throughout the history of this country, African-American communities  have faced innumerable threats from those who don't comprehend that  there is value within our nation's diversity.   The roots of racial extremist violence against peaceful Black  communities runs deep in American history: From this country's dark  past of chattel slavery, to the southern lynch mobs that sought to  permanently disenfranchise the Black vote, to the church bombing that  killed four little girls in Birmingham, to the dismantling of an entire  economic district in Tulsa, to the senseless stabbing of a bright young  man by the name of Richard Collins III just a few weeks go.   As a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, or the ``Conscience of  the Congress'', I call on this body to do all it can to stem the rising  tide of racial violence.   Although progress has been made, President Trump's divisive rhetoric,  and the actions of his followers, have shown us that we still have much  work to do before all of America can feel safe.   Consistent rhetoric of intolerance coming from Trump's campaign and  now his administration has not only put a target on African-American  communities, but also on Mexican-Americans, Muslim-Americans, women,  and those within the immigrant population.   The election of Donald Trump has had a significant effect on the  nation's race relations:   Trump's political debut was centered on the racist ``birther  movement'', which questioned the citizenship of then President Obama  for months.   During his political campaign, he repeatedly refused to reject the  endorsement of white supremacist groups.   He failed to condemn supporters who shouted out racist slurs and on  more than one occasion, violently attacked protesters.   In a nation completely comprised of immigrants, he has built a  hateful movement around building a wall to keep them out.  [[Page H4842]]    This country has prided itself on being the melting pot of the world.  The bastion of freedom of equality. Violence against any person based  on their class, color, or creed is not only immoral, it's anti- American.   We must condemn, denounce, and seek to eliminate these acts of racial  terror with the same fervor that we would when dealing with religious  extremists.   I have to quote former Attorney General Eric Holder who stated,  ``Though this nation has proudly thought of itself as an ethnic melting  pot, in things racial we have always been and continue to be, in too  many ways, essentially a nation of cowards.''   Regardless of who resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., this body, the  people's chamber, has a responsibility to do all that it can to ensure  the safety of all Americans. That is why I, along with my colleagues  from the Congressional Black Caucus, have sent out a letter to the  Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the acting  director of the FBI urging them to allocate more time and resources to  curbing the recent uptick in violence.   Incidents of Racialized Violence Since the Election:   The Southern Poverty Law Center has conducted a report on incidents  of racialized violence following the Presidential election.   There were over 1000 violent attacks reported within a month of the  election.   Overall, anti-immigrant incidents were the most reported at 315  incidents, followed by anti-black (221 incidents), anti-Muslim (112  incidents), and anti-LGBT (109 incidents).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman for her  leadership on issues related to the Judiciary Committee and to others.   At this time, I would like to invite the Congressman, not just from  New York, but from, of course, what I believe is the best, most  illustrious borough in New York City--Brooklyn, of course, which is  where I was born and raised.   Thank you so much, Congressman Jeffries, for your leadership on the  Judiciary Committee, your discussions about the issues that we are  discussing here this evening, and I am waiting to hear what you are  going to not only present to us here in this Chamber but to the  American people on this issue.   I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Jeffries).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Jeffries).    I thank Congressman Jeffries and I really appreciate  his remarks. I know that this House has rules and is concerned about  decorum in here. We at the Congressional Black Caucus are also very  concerned about decorum. While we uphold the position of the President  of the United States, many individuals--particularly constituents, the  underserved within our communities--are fearful about us actually  speaking out, specifically to the personage and to the person of  President Donald Trump.   What we are trying to do in this Special Order is speak unrefutable  facts; not about the personality, not subjective discussion about the  President, not our feelings, and not our fears, but the actual facts of  what has happened in this country and what is happening in this country  because that is life for our children, that is the very essence of us  continuing, and that is what democracy is about.   If we cannot critique the actions of our President, then that is very  fearful  [[Page H4843]]  to us as Americans and very fearful to this House, which is supposed to  be a separate branch of government and which I recall maybe a year ago  it speaking very vehemently against the person who was in the White  House at that time.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson  Coleman), who is my classmate. I thank Congresswoman Watson Coleman for  her work, particularly in working with other Congressional Black Caucus  women to found the Caucus for Black Women and Girls, which is very  important right now because this is a forgotten group quite often here  in the United States, and the gentlewoman is advocating and speaking  out for those individuals.   Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman so much  for her leadership and this Special Order hour and considering this  subject matter that we are going to discuss.   I want to talk a little bit about something that has sort of been my  observation and my experiences for a very long period of time and I  think that are actually exacerbated by this Presidency that we  currently have in this House. Let me, by way of association, just  comment positively to the remarks of my colleague and the former  speaker, Hakeem Jeffries from New York.   I entitled my remarks ``From the Cradle to the Grave.''   From the cradle to the grave, Black people in America are required to  be resilient, courteous, and persistent. The rules are always  different.   From the cradle to the grave, Black people in America must be  comfortable and confident in ourselves, but only so much so that we do  not intimidate or aggravate.   From the cradle to the grave, Black people in America are told our  plight, our struggle, and our sacrifice is a mere fantasy in post- racial America while we witness the reality of institutional racism,  conscious discrimination, and our rich history erased or appropriated.    From cradle to grave, Black people in America experience this racism  and discrimination walking home from the corner store eating a pack of  Skittles, listening to music at a gas station, or simply sitting in our  neighborhood park.   We experience this racism and discrimination showing up to school in  our natural hairstyles, shopping in our favorite stores, or even just  showing up to work--including the Senate and the House of  Representatives.   Last Wednesday, it was reported that Black troops are far more likely  than their White counterparts to face court-martial or other forms of  military punishment.   National data shows us that Black girls are 5.5 times more likely to  be suspended from school than White girls. That rate actually balloons  in my State of New Jersey to 8.5 percent. More than 60 years after  Brown v. Board of Education, school systems in the United States are  still separate and unequal.   As of 2014, California had 31 open desegregation cases. In 2016, a  Presidential candidate ran a campaign on divisive rhetoric that  targeted our communities, our well-being, and our safe spaces. It only  gets worse.   From the cradle to the grave, we are told to calm down, sit down, and  be courteous and humble. From the cradle to the grave, the experiences,  the challenges, the stories, our history, and even our very being are  kept out of boardrooms, classrooms, voting booths, department stores,  history books, movie screens, television scripts, and the like.   But let me just tell you that, from the cradle to the grave, we are  built to persevere, we are strengthened to overcome, we are born to  lead, we are committed to uplift, and we are fully equipped to soar  with weights on our shoulders even in these times and even under this  Presidency. And guess what. We do.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman very much for her  inspiring words and motivation to us all.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans).  We always bring up the fact that Congressman Dwight Evans is a  freshman, but he isn't really a freshman. Everybody acknowledges his  leadership in his work in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the State  house that transcends him as a freshman. We call the gentleman a  superfreshman in that respect because he comes with a great deal of  experience and wisdom here to the House floor. I am very anxious to  hear what the gentleman has to speak about related to hate crimes and  the rise of domestic terrorism against people of color and against  minorities here in this country.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for his  remarks and continued work to discuss middle communities, middle  neighborhoods, and the importance of these communities and how they  need to be protected.   Congressman Veasey, we have had a discussion here this evening about  so much of the rise in hate crimes and the rise of racial tensions. I  know that this weekend Puerto Rico had its plebiscite in which they  talked about becoming a State.   One of the things that I often talk to people about is the Virgin  Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, and Puerto  Rico, all of us are territories now after 100 years.   It was never the intent of Congress for areas of the United States to  be a territory for 100 years except for the fact that these are now  people of color. These are communities of people of color. So based on  the insular cases 100 years ago which said that the people living in  the territories and offshore territories were people of alien races who  couldn't understand Anglo-Saxon principles of law, that is why we were  not able to have the full-fledged rights of American citizens.                                time  2015    Now we are seeing, even here on the mainland, individuals, people of  color, who are being treated as second-class citizens and who are not  afforded the full protection of this country.   When you have incidents like on May 20 with Richard Collins, on May  26 with Jeremy Joseph Christian, who began shouting racial slurs at two  women on a Portland, Oregon, train, and as the two men stepped in to  de-escalate the situation, those two great men were stabbed to death,  and a third man was wounded, much needs to be done.   We have our moments of silence when there are mass shootings. We  mourn for the families of Pulse nightclub and for what happened in  those areas. But it is not enough for us to have Special Order hours,  to have discussions, or even have moments of silence. Action must be  taken by this administration.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order  hour.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Smucker). Is there objection to the  request of the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I know that there were other issues that  the gentleman wanted to discuss with regard to some of these and  examples that he wanted to give as well, and I yield to the gentleman  from Texas.    I think he knows now.    I think he knows now.    I think he knows now.    I think he knows now.    I think he knows now.    I think he knows now.    I think he knows now.    I think he knows now.    That was in the 1970s, I believe.    Actually, they weren't men at the time. They were  teenagers.    Part of leadership is expressing your shortcomings and  using that as an opportunity to move forward and to move the Nation  forward. So many people look to our President for his leadership and  for his thoughts and his out-of-the-box thinking. This would be  tremendous not only to the people who are being oppressed, but to  others as well.   One of the things I wanted to leave us with was a quote and some work  that the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law is working on,  that has a mission to secure equal justice for all through the rule of  law, targeting, in particular, the inequities confronting African  Americans and other racial and ethnic minorities.   In December 2016, Kristen Clarke, who is the president, stated:  ``Hate  [[Page H4845]]  crimes and hate-filled incidents stand as a dark cloud over our  democracy. The recent spike in hate crimes is attributable, in part, to  racially charged rhetoric that characterized the 2016 election cycle  and the rise of `alt-right' white nationalist extremism. This is a  moment that calls for Federal, State, and local officials to use every  tool in their arsenal to fully investigate and prosecute these  incidents when they occur.''   And we from the Congressional Black Caucus say, as well, to eradicate  this from our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the 2016  presidential election was an exceptionally bitter fight between  Republicans and Democrats. The election highlighted many of the  existing divides between many Americans and the underlying frustrations  that we have been wrestling with as a people. Couple this with the  resentful partisanship that we have experienced in Congress, and it is  quite clear that there are deep rifts dividing our country. However,  one of the biggest consequences of this partisan bickering and  inability to compromise has been the increase in the frequency of hate  crimes across America.   The latest figures from the Southern Poverty Law Center estimate that  there have been nearly 1,372 bias incidents between the day after the  election and February 7, when these statistics were last reported. SPLC  is collecting self-reported data from across the country in an effort  to monitor ``bias incidents''--or acts of hostility that are motivated  by racism or other prejudices--across the United States. While it is  important to acknowledge the limitations of self-reported data, this  trend is consistent with several other incidents reported nationwide  that have challenged the notion that we are living in a post-racial  society.   For example, several nooses were found throughout our nation's  capital this month--one near an elementary school, another in the  African American Museum of History and Culture, and on American  University's campus. On June 2, a Muslim couple was allegedly harassed  in Oregon and told to go back to their country. More prominently, two  men in Portland were stabbed to death and another wounded when they  tried to intervene on behalf of two women, one of whom was wearing a  hijab, who were being verbally assaulted by a man yelling slurs.   Mr. Speaker, these are just a few of the horrendous incidents being  reported in the wake of this election and the hateful rhetoric that has  come to define the political narrative. However, I am here to join my  colleagues not only to denounce these actions and hateful words, but  also to remind ourselves that we are better than this. We are better  than this as a people and a nation, and we must all do our part to  discourage this behavior and hold these violators accountable. Until we  all take active roles within our society and democracy, we cannot  reasonably expect our society to overcome these challenges and emerge a  stronger society. I am proud to join my colleagues tonight in sending a  clear message that these acts of hatred and violence will not be  tolerated. Not today, not ever.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from  engaging in personalities toward the President.                            ____________________
