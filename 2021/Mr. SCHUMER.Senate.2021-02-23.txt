 Mr. President, today the Senate will complete the  confirmation of two key nominees: Linda Thomas-Greenfield to serve as  U.N. Ambassador and Tom Vilsack to serve as Agriculture Secretary.   As I said yesterday, the Senate will also confirm Jennifer Granholm  this week to serve as the next Energy Secretary and begin the  confirmation of Dr. Miguel Cardona to serve as the next Education  Secretary. We also hope to do Gina Raimondo, nominee for Secretary of  Commerce, early next week.   Each of these nominees has received bipartisan support in committee.  Each of these nominees is undoubtedly qualified for their positions, a  stark departure from the caliber of nominees the Senate was made to  consider during the previous administration.   Make no mistake, the Senate will move quickly to approve key  officials in the Biden administration this work period. These Cabinet  positions and Agencies have an immense influence over the policies of  the United States, impacting hundreds of millions of American lives. At  a time of acute national challenge, we need qualified leaders atop our  Federal Agencies--and fast. and that is what we intend to do.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 16.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  for the cloture motion be waived.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
