 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Roy for not only  standing in tonight to speak forthrightly to the American people, but  also including other Members of the Texas delegation to have  conversations with the American people not just about the topic of  being woke, but actually the things that are actually happening to the  United States of America.   The Congressman is exactly right, there is a crisis in America today.  There is a crisis that takes place because of such a rapid and swift  transition to the ultraleft. The transition that has taken place began  immediately upon President Biden accepting the oath of office and  walking, driving, going back to the White House after he had taken an  oath of office, where he raised his hand and he repeated, among the  other words, to ``well and faithfully execute the laws of the United  States.''   Well, there is a little bit more than just ``well and faithfully  execute the laws of the United States.'' I believe the American people  want and need a stable person who will recognize that they need someone  to work in their best interest, in the best interest of their  community, in the best interest of their job, in the best interest of  safety, in the best interest of trying to give every single person in  this country a better opportunity to have a better life. That is what I  believe is behind the ``well and faithfully execute the laws of the  United States.''   In fact, what has happened is there is a sweeping revolution that is  going on in the United States of America by the elected officials.  Elected officials who have turned a blind eye to the things in the past  that were seen as stable, as reasonable, and something that was in the  best interest to protect the people that they represent.   Day after day we have watched what happened down at the southern  border of this country. I, too, went down. I am no stranger to the  border. I previously lived in El Paso, Texas, for a number of years. My  father served as the chief judge of the Western District of Texas and  had to deal with not just the crime, but some of the circumstances that  happened along the border. They came home to roost, so to speak, within  the United States of America.   And as a Federal district judge, he tried his best to deal favorably,  fairly, with people who violated the law. But where there were people  who were criminals, who were not here to serve in the best interest of  the United States of America, those who would become enemies of the  State because what they did is they would import drugs, drugs which  would kill Americans.   We have just been through a terrible epidemic in this country of  opioid abuse. Opioid abuse that we all recognize, much of it was  inherently begun and started here in the United States, but that has  taken hold with other drugs now, fentanyl, methamphetamines, heroin,  cocaine.   And in that process, we look to where this comes from. This comes  from other countries, by and large, other countries who have people who  want to kill and make money off the demise of the American people.   Yet the President of the United States, at the time he served as Vice  President--because I know because the Drug Enforcement Administration  senior officials have repeatedly said that the intelligence that was  given to the then-Vice President, now President of the United States,  they understood firsthand the danger that came from an open border.   The dangers that came when we did not have active law enforcement and  intelligence would cause the deaths of thousands of Americans because  of the illicit drugs. Illicit drugs that not only are addicting, but  many times mixed in a way that a user never knew they were taking them.  The availability of fentanyl, as an example.   Yet the President of the United States, with this vast knowledge of  understanding from his service to the  [[Page H2994]]  country as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, as chairman of  the Foreign Affairs Committee, as Vice President of the United States,  he already knew the story.   The story that he wanted to project was that he is a kid from  Pennsylvania, who knew what real America is. But what has happened is  that he personally, and the radical left, have created a circumstance  in this country that, we, as Republicans, are talking about tonight.  That we are supposed to be woke to understanding the social  implications. The enormous implications to people that we represent.   Yet, seemingly, it is the police that are the problem. Seemingly, it  is the border that is the problem by enforcing the law. Seemingly, it  is the ability that they want for criminals to run rampant throughout  not just our neighborhoods, but across this country.   Madam Speaker, I would say to the young Congressman from Texas that  we need his voice, his voice of compassion, his voice of common sense  that says we need to move this country back to where it was simply a  few months ago. Where we respect members of law enforcement, men and  women of law enforcement who make house calls because they are asked to  come and make dispute resolution many times, and then to take care of  the law as it applies to a circumstance.   We need to get back to where we understand that the men and women of  not just the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Border Patrol  are back on their job instead of being moved over to take care of 1  million people who, in the first 6 months, have come through illegally.   We need to go back to elected officials who actually understand that  the people who elected them aren't for woke. What they are for is this  body to come together to where we understand that we have an obligation  to protect the men and women and children and seniors and disabled  people of this country. We have an obligation to stand behind our law  enforcement and to provide them with better training and the things  that they need, equipment, to properly do their job.   Instead, we are watching our country, whether it is Chicago or Los  Angles or New York City where criminals run rampant because of woke,  that says we are supposed to defund the police department. We are  supposed to defund those activities that would offer safety and  security and opportunity for the most vulnerable of our society, and  then blame others when people of color or of different races are harmed  by criminals and thugs.   I watched this morning on TV of the murder that took place in Chicago  of the young couple that came to a stoplight and were accosted and  killed by thugs, criminal thugs.   I watched about a young man walking down the street in broad daylight  in New York City and was stabbed repeatedly by a criminal this weekend.   No wonder this happens. We have already run the police out of town.  We have already run people out of town who legitimately can stand up  and have that obligation.   Madam Speaker, I come here tonight to join my two Texas colleagues to  say, woke may be a term that we are supposed to get about enlightenment  that we need to be good and better to each other, that we need to  understand that there are people who might not agree with me, and I  might not agree with them.                                time  2015    But ``woke'' has taken on a different theme. It has taken on a theme  of taking on responsibility and respect. It has taken away the ability  that we have in this body to effectively even be heard by each other.  It has taken away the ability of millions of Americans to where they no  longer feel the safety and security of their own home, of their own  city street, or even their ability to stand up to those who have a  different opinion.   Madam Speaker, I think what Congressman Roy is doing tonight is more  than just standing up and expressing an opinion. It actually is an  opinion that I believe millions of Americans support and respect by  this gentleman doing this Special Order tonight.   I would call on this House of Representatives and all of its Members  to understand that this phase we are going through will have a very  difficult, difficult conclusion for many people who cannot effectively  get through what is happening to them, to people who live in cities  where police will no longer be, to small businesses that are burned to  the ground, and to judges who are no longer judging based upon the rule  of law but rather fear.   Madam Speaker, we as the Republican Party are not standing up and  yelling and screaming. We have much resolve to us. But we ask tonight  that the American people hear us that we condemned what happened on  January the 6th. We condemn what is happening when people take  advantage of law enforcement, take advantage of people, and take  advantage of this great country.   Let us hope that tonight in our resolve of speaking forthrightly and  honestly that we want to be that great country with shining cities on  the hill where people work together, where people have a common  interest and goals for their communities, and generations of people can  work together whether you be a retired senior citizen, Madam Speaker,  or whether you be a young child who knows not except that you live in a  great country.   We need to speak plainly, but we are not yelling and screaming. We  are not blaming someone else for the problems. But we will say this:  The Republican Party of this House of Representatives stands for people  to be safe in their own homes, for women who are in their own homes  with their own children who will not be taken advantage of because they  do know they have a backup and that is the police departments, that  they know that the rule of law will effectively provide them with the  needs that they have to live in the greatest country in the world, that  our law enforcement agencies will know that they can continue to evolve  into professionalism, that they will be able to effectively heal  themselves and make the changes.   I call on law enforcement to continue to make these changes. My  Republican Party has these conversations with law enforcement every  day. But I call on the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,  Christopher Wray, just as when my father, Judge William Sessions, was  Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to stand up for law  enforcement and expect them and want them to become professional.   Madam Speaker, we must heal what has happened.   Sunday, at church, I heard no less than 50 times the word redemption,  the words that we are sinners, that we make mistakes, that we need to  look at each other with the faithfulness of a great nation. I heard  words of love and respect for those even that we disagree with.   But, Madam Speaker, we are not down pounding on tables tonight. We  are simply trying to say what we believe is true, and that is that I  believe that there are tens of millions of Americans who want and need  this country to be safe. They want and need our elected officials,  whether they be Republican or Democrat, that they need their elected  officials to understand that their life and their family are important,  and that until we get back to the standards of performance of  expectations where law enforcement is allowed to effectively and  professionally be there as the backup, where our military knows that we  are there to support them and that our elected officials will stand on  the side of righteousness, we are going to continue to wander through  this terrible time that I call chaos.   It is my hope, as we drop to our knees this evening, that we do offer  a prayer for our President, President Biden. I know him, and I know he  has been through difficult times in his life. But, Madam Speaker, I  would ask tonight that we give respect and prayer and ask that the  President please understand that the most vulnerable who are there  still need others to be of assistance, and we need to make sure that  this country heals itself with love, respect, and admiration for each  other.   I want to thank the young Congressman for tonight, for his bringing  forth this opportunity to speak about where our country is. I want him  to know that I personally admire him, respect him, and appreciate his  sound call for a voice of reason and opportunity for America's future.   May God bless our country.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for allowing me to speak.  [[Page H2995]]
