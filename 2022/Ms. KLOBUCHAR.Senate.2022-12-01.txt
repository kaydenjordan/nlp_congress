 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise in support of the nominee to be  the next U.S. district court judge for the District of Minnesota--that  would be Jerry Blackwell.   I would like to thank Senator Durbin, chair of the Judiciary  Committee, and all the members of the Judiciary Committee, including  yourself, Mr. President, for shepherding Mr. Blackwell's nomination  through the committee, and I would like to thank Leader Schumer for  making time for the Senate to consider his nomination, and my colleague  Senator Smith for her work as well in support of the nomination.   Jerry Blackwell is one of the most respected and accomplished  litigators in the State of Minnesota. He has nearly 35 years of trial  experience, has been named Minnesota Attorney of the Year five times,  has argued over 1,000 motions in State and Federal court, and served as  lead counsel in over 100 cases.   This is why he received a bipartisan vote in the Judiciary Committee,  including with the support of the ranking member, and why I hope my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support his confirmation.   Jerry has always been driven by his commitment to serve others--a  commitment that started early in his life. His dad was a truckdriver  who started working after the 10th grade, and his mom worked in a  textile mill. She struggled with health conditions and was on dialysis  from the time Jerry was 5 years old. They raised Jerry in a textile  mill town in North Carolina in a home without running water. And  although they did not have much, they raised their kids to believe that  no matter what their life circumstances were, it was their  responsibility to give back to their community. As Jerry said at his  nomination hearing, his mom taught him at a young age that ``in serving  others we find our own well-being.'' Those words inspired Jerry's  brother to serve as a police officer and led Jerry to use his skills as  an attorney to improve the lives of others.    He was the first in his family to attend college. He attended the  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill as a recipient of the  prestigious Morehead Scholarship. He went on to earn his J.D. from the  University of North Carolina School of Law and then had the wisdom to  move to Minnesota to begin his legal career at a firm in Minneapolis.   After working at several prominent Minneapolis law firms, Jerry went  on to found Blackwell Burke, one of the largest minority-owned trial  law firms in our State. The firm was, at one point, the second-largest  Black-owned law firm in the United States of America. It is highly  regarded by the Minnesota legal community and has been rated  Minnesota's top litigation firm by Benchmark Litigation for 4 years in  a row.   Jerry is also known for his humility--so much so that I did not learn  until after his nomination hearing, when his aunt told me, that Jerry  has never lost a case in the nearly 35 years he has been practicing.   I then went to Jerry and said ``Your aunt was probably kind of  exaggerating?'' And he said ``No, it's true. I've never lost a case.''   As an attorney in Minnesota, Jerry never lost touch with his  commitment to serve others. Even while he maintained a busy private  practice, he always found ways to give back. He was widely praised for  his work obtaining the first posthumous pardon in State history for Max  Mason, a young Black man who was wrongfully convicted of rape in 1920.  And he captured the attention of our State and the country during his  time as Special Assistant Attorney General in one of the most high- profile criminal trials in the history of our country: the prosecution  of Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd.   Many of the pages in this room and many of the people watching today  will remember Jerry's argument at the trial and the fine lawyering that  he demonstrated. He didn't make it about himself. He didn't make it  about some hotshot litigation move. He made it about George Floyd, and  he made it about the community members and the police officers who came  to testify against Derek Chauvin at that trial. It was an extraordinary  job, along with his colleagues that also prosecuted the case and  Attorney General Ellison who supervised it.   Jerry has broad respect in Minnesota's legal community. He was  initially recommended by a judicial selection committee that I convened  with Senator Smith consisting of accomplished Minnesota judges,  attorneys, and legal scholars, headed up by Alan Page, the former  Minnesota Supreme Court justice, also known as an extraordinary  Minnesota Viking.   Jerry earned support from 25 experienced Federal prosecutors from  across the political spectrum, who wrote to the Judiciary Committee in  support of his nomination that he ``distinguished himself as a civil  practitioner and has earned a national reputation as a skilled and  persuasive advocate.''   The Judiciary Committee also directly heard from a number of current  and former police chiefs in Minnesota who wrote:         We are confident that as a federal district court judge,       Mr. Blackwell will approach each case with an open mind and       will apply the law consistently and fairly.    That is why he got the highest rating from the ABA. That is why he  got bipartisan support in the Judiciary Committee.   I am so proud to have Jerry as our nominee, and I ask my colleagues  to join me in supporting his nomination.   It is not often that you have a nominee with this breadth of  experience, this breadth of support, and also the willingness to take  on one of the hardest cases our Nation has ever known and win it.   I yield the floor.
