 Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I  would like to address what the gentlewoman just said in just a minute.   While I may have been able to support some of the amendments that  have been considered individually--and I noticed that as we listed the  Members that have offered amendments they were all Democratic  amendments; none of them were Republican amendments--the majority's  decision to package them together like this means I must oppose an en  bloc amendment.   I have concerns with multiple pieces of this en bloc amendment, but I  would like to focus on two of them; one that was just spoken about by  the gentlewoman from Florida.   First, this amendment includes language that would prohibit the Army  Corps of Engineers from issuing a section 404 permit for any project in  a specific geographical location.   Legislatively deciding individual permit outcomes is something the  Energy and Water Subcommittee, under both Republican and Democrat  leadership, have previously avoided. That restraint was not because we  were never asked to legislate the outcome of a permit. We were asked  many, many times.   Rather, it was in recognition that Congress has established a process  by which the technical experts within the Federal agencies would  evaluate projects to determine whether environmental impacts could be  avoided or minimized such that the project could move forward.   Injecting politics into the process by inserting language into an  appropriation bill sets the wrong precedent. It suggests that any  future permit decision could be decided by the whim of a majority of  Congress.   The second issue I would like to discuss is the language prohibiting  the Department of Energy from finalizing the rule relating to the  efficiency standards of light bulbs.   I know there are some parties who have characterized the proposed  rule as a roll back of efficiency standards. What it really does,  though, is ensure the Department is following the law.   The previous rule, a rule promulgated at the very last minute of the  Obama administration, revised certain definitions contrary to statutory  language. That rule was challenged legally, and the settlement  acknowledged the mistake.   The current proposed rule reduces the regulatory uncertainty by  making clear that several types of light bulbs will continue to be  sold. It also shows DOE's commitment to following the law, a novel  concept. We should all support following the laws that Congress passes.   For these reasons, I must oppose this en bloc amendment, and I urge  my colleagues to do the same.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.     Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of the en bloc amendment. I thank  Chairwoman Lowey and Chairwoman Kaptur for working with our side to  include many provisions important to our Members. I appreciate the  decision to offer this bipartisan en bloc amendment, and I urge my  colleagues to support it.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Weber).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer), my good friend.  [[Page H4745]]         Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Weber).    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, let me just say, first of all, that  everything you have heard from the former attorney for the NRDC is just  nonsense, and the reason it is nonsense is because he doesn't know.  Nobody knows. That is why we have a review of these procedures. That is  why we have NEPA.   That is why the National Environmental Policy Act is in place, which  many of my friends across the aisle view as the foundational  environmental law. It requires Federal agencies to evaluate the  environmental impacts of projects before the project can be approved.  The Corps is in the process of doing that.   Now, I don't know if he is worried that the outcome might not be like  he likes, but if everything he said is true, then they certainly won't  permit it.   To be clear, I am not advocating for or against this particular  project; I don't know enough about it. But what I am saying is Congress  should stay out of the process of individual reviews. Setting the  precedent of injecting political opinions into the NEPA process simply  means that any project in the future will be subject to the whims of  the majority party at the time.   Such a scenario should be a concern for all Members, Republicans and  Democrats alike. Perhaps next time the interest will be in  legislatively approving a specific project. This amendment would serve  as a precedent.   What I am saying is let the process work. We have put in place the  process. So all of the scenarios that he claims are going to be true,  we don't know if that is true or not because nobody knows yet. They are  just opinions.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, if those are flaws in the process, then I  am sure that a court challenge by the NRDC will actually bring those  out.   Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alaska (Mr.  Young), my friend.    Madam Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).    I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I  appreciate my friend from Louisiana's passion on this issue.   Saying that the Corps has $100 billion backlog, it is not really the  Corps' fault for that. It is our fault in that we haven't appropriated  money. And if you look back through the years, the Bush administration,  the Obama administration, and, currently, the Trump administration,  always propose a budget that slashes and burns the Corps' budget. And  it is the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies  Subcommittee that won't let them do that and keeps putting money back  into it.   Last year, the Office of Management and Budget issued a plan for  reorganization of the Federal agencies that included moving the Civil  Works program from the Army Corps of Engineers to multiple other  agencies. Yet, very few details were provided to Congress. Congress was  not consulted, and no statutory changes were enacted. Yet, some in the  administration took steps to try to begin implementing the  reorganization proposal.   In response, that is why the language was put in last year's act, and  that is why it is in this year's act. I will tell the gentleman that we  have had this discussion many times with General Semonite, and he is a  go-get-'em guy. When he is given a mission, he will do whatever it  takes to get that mission accomplished. I like what he is doing.   I wouldn't want to go with OMB in saying we are going to reorganize  the Corps and not know exactly what they are going to do and have  Congress have no input. But I appreciate the passion that the gentleman  has for this, and I understand his frustration. And I think that it is  better placed on the Transportation Committee in seeing if there are  some reorganizations that can be done within the Corps and done  legislatively that make sense.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
