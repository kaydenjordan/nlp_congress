 Mr. Speaker, the COVID pandemic has brought so much  grief and desperation to so many people, and we have seen how millions  of Americans have rightfully stayed home to stay safe.   Our healthcare personnel, our police, our firefighters, our teachers,  and other vital workers, they have been in full force, many risking  their own lives to save ours. Today, we make sure that these heroes on  the front line get the pay that they need and deserve to do their jobs.  I urge passage of the HEROES Act.
