 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize three Montana  athletes who will join Team USA and compete in the 2018 Winter  Olympics. Darian Stevens of Missoula, Maggie Voisin of Whitefish, and  Brad Wilson of Butte will represent not only Montana, but our great  Nation.   This is the second Olympics where Maggie has qualified, and she will  compete in the women's slopestyle skiing. Darian, who began skiing when  she was 4 years old, will also compete in the women's slopestyle  skiing. Brad, who also started skiing when he was just 4 years old and  who competed in the Sochi Games four years ago, will compete in the  men's mogul skiing.   I look forward to cheering on these outstanding Montanans. I ask my  colleagues to join me in wishing Maggie, Darian, and Brad success in  the 2018 Winter Olympics.                            ____________________
