 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the productive  life of the Honorable Congressman Edward Ford Weber of Toledo, Ohio, a  gifted lawyer and a man for others.   Throughout his life and during his congressional service, beginning  in 1981, he worked hard to serve the people of northwest Ohio during  those tumultuous economic times.   He was a gentleman and a veteran, dedicated to his family, to our  community of Toledo, and to our country. He earned a Phi Beta Kappa  from Denison University, was president of his fraternity, and captain  of the men's tennis team. He was married to the love of his life, Alice  Hammerstrom, for 66 years. They reared three wonderful children, six  grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.   Ed was committed to education and to music, as well. He tutored  children in reading within the Toledo public school system, some of our  most challenged neighborhoods, in addition to the teaching he did at  the University of Toledo Law School.   Ed practiced law in Toledo for nearly half a century at Marshall  Melhorn first, and then eventually founded his own firm and generously  kept giving of himself to numerous endeavors to improve Toledo: Our  zoo; the Toledo Museum of History, which is world class; the Boy  Scouts; the YMCA; the Toledo Museum of Art, also world class; the Red  Cross; and numerous charitable foundations. He kept giving back,  through his deep commitment to the people of Toledo and surrounding  communities, and we needed him. He understood the impact and importance  of civic duty.   Today, America salutes Edward Ford Weber for his lifelong, noble,  honorable service. We honor and remember his constructive life and the  ethic that imbued his spirit.   The last time I had the pleasure of seeing him was at the Toledo  Club. He  [[Page H1119]]  had a Wednesday group, and all these guys would meet. They basically  had formally retired from their professions, but they really didn't  retire from life, and they were having one great time.   Our prayers are extended to his loved ones. May they be comforted by  the love and memories they hold in their hearts, and may the angels  carry their beloved husband, father, and grandfather to a place of  peace and joy.                            ____________________
