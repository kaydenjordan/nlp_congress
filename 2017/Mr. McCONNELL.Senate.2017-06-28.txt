 Mr. President, yesterday, Senate Republicans gathered  down at the White House for another discussion on the way forward on  healthcare. We had a productive conversation. I appreciate the  administration's engagement, and I look forward to more discussions in  the days that lie ahead.   We will continue working so that we can bring legislation to the  floor for debate and, ultimately, a vote. We know that we cannot afford  to delay on this issue. We have to get this done for the American  people. That is a sentiment that is widely shared in our conference,  and I think I speak for everyone in acknowledging, once again, that the  ObamaCare status quo is unacceptable and that it simply cannot  continue.   ObamaCare has caused premiums to increase by an average of 105  percent in the vast majority of States on the Federal exchange. Next  year, premiums will again increase across the country--by as much as 43  percent in Iowa, 59 percent in Maryland, and 80 percent in New Mexico.   ObamaCare has led to 70 percent of our counties having little or no  choice of insurance on the exchange this year. Next year, dozens of  counties are projected to have no choice at all, which could leave  thousands trapped, forced by law to purchase ObamaCare insurance but  left without the means to do so. Seven years after Democrats forced  ObamaCare on our country, these are the painful realities for countless  families across our country.   It is unfortunate that our Democratic colleagues have refused to work  with us in a serious way to comprehensively address ObamaCare's  failures in the 7 years since they passed it. I regret that they  continue to demonstrate an unserious attitude about all of this today,  but it is increasingly clear that ObamaCare's negative trends will only  get worse, hurting even more Americans all along the way, unless we  act. This should not be acceptable to anyone.   Sitting on the sidelines and accepting the status quo will not bring  help to anyone's constituents. We have the opportunity to provide  relief to those struggling families, and we should take it. Senators  will have more opportunities to offer their thoughts as we work toward  an agreement, and every Member will have the ability to engage in a  robust debate out here on the Senate floor.   But, if one thing is clear, it is this: ObamaCare is a direct assault  on the middle class. It is getting worse, and we have to act to finally  move beyond its failures.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider the nomination of Executive Calendar No. 116, David Nye to  be United States district judge for the District of Idaho.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call with respect to the cloture motion be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, as we prepare to celebrate our  Independence Day, one of the most pivotal moments in the history of our  Nation, I rise today to remember one group of Revolutionary War  patriots who are too often overlooked. I am speaking of the African- American soldiers who served in the American Revolution. In particular,  I would like to recognize the service of men who fought for our  independence and who would later become Kentuckians.   In the 1770s and 1780s, African Americans throughout the young Nation  joined the Revolutionary War effort. Like so many other patriots, they  volunteered to fight for American independence. Many fought under the  command of some of the most notable Revolutionary War heroes, including  General George Washington.   I would like to focus on 11 soldiers who, after enduring the pains of  war and traveling across much of the new Nation, decided to make a new  home for themselves in the area that would later join the Union as the  Commonwealth of Kentucky.   I would like to tell the stories of a few of these Kentuckians. I  believe it is important to remember their service in the war.   Daniel Goff joined the Army in Chesterfield County, VA, in 1777.  During his service, Goff marched from Virginia to New Jersey, where he  fought in the Battle of Monmouth. He camped at Valley Forge under the  command of General Washington and earned his discharge after 3 years in  the Army.   In the years after the war, Goff chose to make a home in Boone  County, KY. He worked for General James Taylor V, an American banker  who was a quartermaster general during the Revolution. Taylor was a  founder of Newport, KY, and he took a special interest in Goff. The two  men knew each other for over 40 years and developed a close bond.   John Sidebottom, of Prince William County, VA, served for 1 year. In  the course of his service, Sidebottom fought in the Battle of Trenton  in December 1776, an historic battle in which General Washington led  the crossing of the Delaware River on Christmas night to launch a  surprise attack against a Hessian garrison.   Sidebottom settled in Clark County, KY. A man who knew him stated  that during the Trenton battle, Sidebottom was one of the men who  carried a wounded soldier from the battlefield to safety. That soldier  was James Monroe, the future President of the United States, who  survived the battle, in part, because of Sidebottom's actions.   George Burk enlisted in the Army in Shenandoah County, VA, in 1779.  He served for 2 years, traveling around the region in several  campaigns. During his time in the Army, he was tasked with guarding  British prisoners at Albemarle Barracks and repelling the British and  Native American attacks. Burk served under the command of General  George Rogers Clark, who founded the city of Louisville, KY. At the end  of his service, Burk was discharged in Louisville, and he spent the  rest of his life in the area.   I would like to recognize the service and sacrifice of these  Kentuckians in the cause of American independence. We owe a large debt  to all of our Nation's veterans, and I am glad that we can remember  these 11 patriots today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have nine requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They do not have the  approval of the Democratic leader for the seventh consecutive  legislative day, therefore, they will not be permitted to meet after 2  p.m. I ask unanimous consent that the list of committees requesting  authority to meet be printed in the Record for today's session and the  previous 2 days.

I now ask for a second reading and, in order to place  the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to  my own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  [[Page S3836]]  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 11 a.m.,  Thursday, June 29; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; finally, that following  leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Rao nomination with the time until the cloture  vote equally divided between the two leaders or their designees.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:43 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, June 29, 2017, at 11 a.m.
