 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and my friend from  Louisiana for hosting this Special Order hour and for all that he is  doing to get the conservative voice out there.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to deliver the 13th installment of my farm  bill impact series during a time when the effects of a poor wheat  harvest in Kansas are only compounded by crushing inflation.   This is insult added to injury for Kansas wheat farmers. Producers  are laboring under the burden of skyrocketing input costs while they  work hard to keep our country fed, fueled, and clothed, and they  deserve a workable solution to this inflation crisis before the  situation gets any worse.    Farming is already a risky, volatile business without the added  burden of inflation, and USDA estimates that input costs will continue  to rise at astronomical rates throughout 2022.   For an example of the risk of volatility--the wheat harvest just  ended in Kansas, and the results were a fraction of the yield that  farmers in the Wheat State hope for and bank on for normal seasons. The  farm bill, which Congress will reauthorize in 2023, exists, in part,  specifically for situations like this past wheat season--to provide  emergency assistance to the people who feed, fuel, and clothe the world  even when Mother Nature doesn't cooperate.   The weather in Kansas can be extreme and unpredictable, which means  that growing wheat in the Wheat State can be a difficult prospect at  times.   I had an intern in my office this summer named Parker Vulgamore who  is a rising senior at Kansas State University where he serves as the  student body president. He is also a member of the sixth generation of  his family's farm in Scott City, which lies in my district.   Vulgamore Family Farms is a wheat, corn, and sorghum operation, with  wheat being a staple. This year, due to an exceptional drought and  extreme conditions throughout the growing season, much of the wheat  never grew past 3 inches tall.   You don't have to farm to know that that is not good. What is  typically a highly anticipated 3- to 4-week wheat harvest only lasted a  day and a half. Many wheat farmers in Kansas barely even ran their  combines this year--they harvested what they could, cut their losses,  and moved on.                                time  1600    This is where farm bill emergency assistance programs like crop  insurance come in. Crop insurance serves producers and consumers alike  because it helps prevent producers from going out of business and  grocery store aisles from sitting empty.   Farm bill programs like crop insurance have secured our national food  supply and helped generation after generation of producers avoid  bankruptcy when times get tough. We are in those times right now.   Inflation is skyrocketing in America. President Biden is trying to  impose his farm killer tax, and at the same time, producers are going  out of business. The chance to reauthorize the farm bill for 2023 has  come at a critical moment in time.   The farm crisis isn't just about money. It is about morale and  spirit. It is about joy. Missing wheat harvest time in Kansas doesn't  just mean missing out on the yield of a cash crop. It means missing out  on the special Kansas tradition of celebrating the culmination of all  your family's hard work. It means missing out on grandma's casserole in  the harvest field and missing out on seeing your mom in the semi, your  dad on the combine, and your little brother getting to drive the grain  cart for the first time.   A bad wheat harvest in Kansas doesn't just create financial  insecurity. It also leaves a void where a renewal of family camaraderie  should be.   American agricultural producers are hurting not only from the  skyrocketing input costs that come with inflation but also from the  lowered morale that come with drought, thin margins, and a broken  supply chain.   In 2023, Congress must reauthorize the farm bill with American farm  families at the front of our minds because they are in crisis.   I will be back on the floor soon to deliver another installment of my  farm bill impact series and highlight more programs and titles within  the bill that I believe Congress must understand and support to ensure  that agriculture thrives in America.   The people who feed, fuel, and clothe us all deserve our unwavering  support. They also deserve a robust safety net in the farm bill and  workable solutions to the inflation crisis before it is too late.
