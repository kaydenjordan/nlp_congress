 Mr. Speaker, Congress is leaving for Easter break with  work undone. For 7 years, we have told the American people that we  would repeal ObamaCare and replace it with something better, and we  have legislation that provides that opportunity. It is not a perfect  bill--no bill is. But President Trump has said this is our best and  only chance to get this done.   The bill cuts taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars and reduces  government by hundreds of billions, too. It keeps preexisting condition  prohibitions and lets 26-year-olds stay on their parents' health care.  But most importantly, it unshackles American families from government- forced mandates costing them hundreds of thousands of dollars each  year. Simply put, it is an enormous improvement over the status quo.   My hope is we will be back next week before Easter. I know many of my  colleagues are ready for the holidays, but we need to do what we said  we would do: repeal ObamaCare and replace it with something better.                            ____________________
