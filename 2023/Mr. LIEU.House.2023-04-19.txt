 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, Congress is going to vote on a bill  that would ban some transgender kids from participating in sports. To  be honest, I haven't thought about this issue very much. I don't  actually know any transgender students.   I think many of you may not have thought of this issue either. You  have busy lives.   If you still have an open mind on this, I would like to read to you  part of a letter that the Republican Governor of Utah wrote. This  letter is the veto message of Governor Spencer Cox of Utah where he  vetoed a similar State bill regarding transgender kids.   He writes: ``I must admit I am not an expert on transgenderism. I  struggle to understand so much of it, and the science is conflicting.  When in doubt, however, I always try to err on the side of kindness,  mercy and compassion.''   It goes on to say: ``Here are the numbers that have most impacted my  decision: 75,000, 4, 1, 86, and 56.''   What does he mean by those numbers? Well, this is what he writes:   ``75,000 high school kids participating in high school sports in  Utah.   ``Four transgender kids playing high school sports in Utah.   ``One transgender student playing girls' sports.   ``86 percent of trans youth reporting suicidality.   ``56 percent of trans youth having attempted suicide.''   He goes on to write: ``Four kids and only one of them playing girls'  sports. That's what all of this is about. Four kids who aren't  dominating or winning trophies or taking scholarships. Four kids who  are just trying to find some friends and feel like they are a part of  something. Four kids trying to get through each day. Rarely has so much  fear and anger been directed at so few. I don't understand what they  are going through or why they feel the way they do. But I want them to  live. And all the research shows that even a little acceptance and  connection can reduce suicidality significantly.''   Like the Republican Governor of Utah, I also am not an expert on  transgenderism, but I do know this: We are all Americans, and these are  kids. Most of them wake up every morning living in fear that they are  going to have a bad day, that they are going to be shunned, made fun  of, discriminated against and bullied.   Mr. Speaker, we are the United States House of Representatives. We  should not be bullying kids.   In Solemn Remembrance of the 108th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solemn remembrance of the  Armenian genocide. April 24 marks the 108th anniversary of the Armenian  genocide, one of the most horrific losses of life in modern history.   The Ottoman Empire's brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing led to the  deaths of roughly 1.5 million Armenians in the period between 1915 to  1923.   Despite this tragedy, the Armenian-American community today is strong  and vibrant. Remembering the atrocities like the Armenian genocide is  crucial to ensuring that this never happens again. A key part of this  process is education.   I am proud to co-lead this year's Armenian Genocide Education Act  with Representatives Anna Eshoo, Gus Bilirakis, and  David Valadao,  which we will introduce on April 24.   This legislation will authorize $10 million in funding to the Library  of Congress over 5 years to develop Armenian genocide education  programs and resources which can be used by educators across the  country. Those resources will ensure that future generations learn  about and never forget about these atrocities.   Mr. Speaker, I stand with the Armenian-American community in my  district and across the U.S. as they honor and remember those who  perished during the genocide.                            ____________________
