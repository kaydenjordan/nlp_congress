 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act.   This is an important step forward in the fight against the Nation's  opioid epidemic. However, this Congress must acknowledge that this is  not the end.   Healthcare is a right, not a privilege. There is much more work to do  to ensure that families get the help that they deserve.    I am pleased that this package includes language that I have  championed to address gaps in prevention and gaps in access to  treatment. In addition, this bill will create pathways to behavioral  healthcare jobs in communities like New Mexico.   Still, Congress must do more. As we have heard from Representative  Cummings, this is going to take much more money, investment, and  comprehensive legislation.
