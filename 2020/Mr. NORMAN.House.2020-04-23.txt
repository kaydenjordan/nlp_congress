 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support a lifeline for our  small businesses, for our first responders, for our hospitals, but I  also rise today to say now is the time to stop writing checks on money  we don't have that is mortgaging the future of this great country. I  was not sent here to bankrupt this country.   Secondly, we need to get our businesses to open the doors and do what  Americans have always been allowed to do, which is go to work. Now is  the time. There is one person who can do that, and that is the Speaker  of the House. I urge her to get us back to work.   We are getting paid; many Americans are not.
