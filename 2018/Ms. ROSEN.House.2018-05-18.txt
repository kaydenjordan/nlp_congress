 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of two  Nevada police officers who made the ultimate sacrifice in 2017:  Detective Chad William Parque of the North Las Vegas Police Department,  and Officer Charleston Vernon Hartfield of the Las Vegas Metropolitan  Police Department.   Detective Parque was a 10-year veteran of the force. He was a loving  husband and father, a selfless member of our community, and a dedicated  investigator. His warmth and his passion left a mark on all who had the  privilege of knowing him.   Officer Hartfield was a victim of the horrific 1 October tragedy. He  was a husband and a father, an Army veteran, a first sergeant in the  Nevada Army National Guard, the author of a memoir, and a youth  football coach. Officer Hartfield had an unwavering dedication to his  community. I attended the candlelight vigil in his memory shortly after  his death, and I saw firsthand how many lives he touched.   Detective Parque and Officer Hartfield were taken from us far too  soon. Their profound sense of duty and service will live on as an  example for all of us. May their memories be a blessing.                            ____________________
