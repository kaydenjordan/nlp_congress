 Madam President, I rise today to recognize LTC Sarah D.  Eccleston for her exemplary dedication to duty and service to the U.S.  Army and to the United States of America.   Over the past year, she has served as the congressional analyst and  congressional liaison in the Office of the Army Surgeon General.   LTC Sarah Eccleston was born and raised in Dillon, MT, and began her  Army service in 2001 as a cadet in the Reserve Officer Training Corps,  ROTC.  [[Page S190]]  In 2004, she was commissioned as a distinguished military graduate from  the University of Utah ROTC Program and received her bachelors of  science degree in nursing from Westminster College, Salt Lake City, UT.   On her initial assignment as a lieutenant, she served as a staff  nurse on a 32-bed multidisciplinary medical-surgical unit at the Carl  R. Darnall Army Medical Center at Fort Hood, TX. She then attended the  Critical Care Nurse Course at Brooke Army Medical Center, BAMC, in Fort  Sam Houston, TX, where she began working as a clinical staff nurse in  the surgical trauma intensive care unit at BAMC.   In 2009, she deployed with the 10th Combat Support Hospital out of  Fort Carson, CO, to Baghdad, Iraq, where she worked as a critical care  nurse. Shortly thereafter, she began working as the 2nd Brigade ROTC  nurse counselor at Fort Dix, NJ. She completed her time with ROTC in  May of 2012 and was selected for long-term health education and  training through Widener University, where she received a master's in  nursing. After graduating as a critical care clinical nurse specialist,  Lieutenant Colonel Eccleston was assigned to Madigan Army Medical  Center in Fort Lewis, WA, where she oversaw policy and quality of  practice in three intensive care units.   Prior to her current assignment, in the summer of 2018, Lieutenant  Colonel Eccleston was selected to serve as the executive nurse fellow  to the Chief and Deputy Chief of the Army Nurse Corps.   After graduating as a critical care clinical nurse specialist,  Lieutenant Colonel Eccleston was assigned to Madigan Army Medical  Center at Joint Base Fort Lewis-McChord, WA, where she oversaw policy  and quality of practice in three intensive care units.   Montanans and all Americans owe LTC Sarah Eccleston the deepest  gratitude for her decade of active service to this Nation. I wish Sarah  and her family all the best as they continue their journey of service.   (At the request of Mr. Rounds, the following statement was ordered to  be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
