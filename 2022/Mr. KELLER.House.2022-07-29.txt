 Madam Speaker, the economy shrank for the second quarter  in a row. Americans are now facing a recession that was totally  avoidable but brought on by President Biden and  [[Page H7410]]  Washington Democrats' Big Government spending and war on American  energy.   Proving just how out of touch President Biden is, he shrugged off  talk of a recession and said Americans are just facing an economic  transition.   This administration has spent more time trying to convince Americans  we are not in a recession than actually working on the problem.   Americans are hurting right now, and as the price of gas and  groceries continues to rise, Washington Democrats are preparing  legislation in Congress that will raise taxes on farmers, businesses,  and working families.   The Democrat elite don't live in the real world, and they continue to  put the priorities of their radical agenda over working American  families--the same people they profess to help.   Our economy is shrinking, and Big Government spending is growing.   Americans cannot afford Washington Democrats' far-left agenda.                            ____________________
