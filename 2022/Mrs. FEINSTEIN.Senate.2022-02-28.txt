 Madam President, I am proud to be an original  cosponsor of the Women's Health Protection Act and pleased to submit my  remarks regarding this critical legislation. I regret that I am unable  to attend the full Senate vote on this bill today due to a death in the  family.   The Women's Health Protection Act would guarantee the right to an  abortion. The bill would allow a patient to access an abortion and  ensure providers are able to deliver those services  [[Page S832]]  without the burden of medically unnecessary restrictions.   Now more than ever, we need to protect this fundamental right. Nearly  50 years after the Supreme Court guaranteed the right to safe and legal  abortion in Roe v. Wade, reproductive rights are under direct attack.   States are introducing laws at an alarming rate that seek to  dramatically limit or outright ban abortion access. Some of these  restrictive laws ban abortion after the 6th week of pregnancy, before  many people know they are pregnant.   Even more concerning, we may no longer be able to rely on the Supreme  Court to protect reproductive rights. The Supreme Court recently  finished hearing oral arguments in a case about Mississippi's  restrictive abortion law. Many Americans, including myself, are worried  that the Supreme Court could significantly diminish or altogether  overturn Roe v. Wade.   The repercussions of such a decision would be devastating. According  to the Guttmacher Institute, more than half of U.S. States are poised  to ban or severely restrict abortion access if this landmark decision  is overturned. I remember what it was like prior to Roe v. Wade. I  understand the heartbreaking and often unsafe situations that pregnant  individuals face.   We must respond by passing the Women's Health Protection Act.  Congress must do everything it can to ensure that individuals are able  to access critical medical care and make the best decisions possible  for their health. I am proud to cosponsor this important bill, and I  won't stop fighting to protect fundamental reproductive rights.                            ____________________
