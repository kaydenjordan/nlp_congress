 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Veasey for yielding, but  also for his remarkable leadership here in Congress and for hosting  this very important Special Order this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I rise, along with my colleagues in the Congressional  Black Caucus, with a message for the American people: Wake up.  COINTELPRO 2.0 is on the rise.   Mr. Speaker, now, in a report that was never supposed to see the  light of day, the FBI's Counterterrorism Division branded African  Americans in the fight for equality and justice as Black identity  extremists that pose a domestic threat to police officers.   Now, I have witnessed many covert tactics designed to suppress  African-American activism in my life, but the revelation of this report  is one of the most troubling details I have ever learned about our  government.   I remember very clearly the days of COINTELPRO under J. Edgar Hoover.  As a community worker who worked closely with the Black Panther Party  in their Ten-Point Platform, which made programs like Free Breakfast  for Children possible and paved the way for our government's free  breakfast program for low-income children, I witnessed firsthand how  the lives of good people doing good work were destroyed by COINTELPRO.   Seeing the emergence of what is effectively COINTELPRO 2.0 is not  only alarming, it is frightening. Just listen to how the FBI describes  young women who take a stand for justice.   According to the FBI: ``Black identity extremist, BIE, perceptions of  police brutality against African Americans'' has been responsible for  ``an increase in premeditated, retaliatory lethal violence against law  enforcement and will very likely serve as justification for such  violence in the future.''   My God.                                time  2030    Mr. Speaker, we know that all police officers aren't bad actors.  Actually, thousands of officers, the majority of officers, go to work  every morning to protect our communities and to provide public safety  for everyone, but I want to be very clear about two things, Mr.  Speaker.   Police brutality is not, as they said in this FBI report, a  perception. Police brutality is a reality African Americans grapple  with every day.   African Americans are three times more likely to be killed by police  than White people. That is a reality. That is not a perception. The  facts speak for themselves.   Despite being only 13 percent of our population, nearly 25 percent of  those killed by police in the United States each year are African  Americans. That is a reality. That is not a perception.   Nearly 99 percent of police-involved shootings have not resulted in  any officers involved being convicted of a crime. Now, that is a  reality, not a perception.   I also want to be very clear that Black identity extremism does not  exist. It is simply not real. No academics or journalists have  uncovered such a movement. No one has identified as a leader of such a  movement. No act of hate or violence has been committed in the name of  Black identity extremism.   So what is it, then? It is a twisted attempt by arbiters of the alt- right, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and this  administration, to deflect attention from the realities of police  misconduct and the alt-right and White supremacy.   First let me thank Congressman Veasey for his remarkable leadership  in Congress and for hosting this vitally important Special Order hour.   Mr. Speaker I rise today along with my colleagues in the  Congressional Black Caucus with a message for the American people.   Wake up! COINTELPRO 2.0 is on the rise.   Mr. Speaker, in a report that was never supposed to see the light of  day, the FBI's Counterterrorism Division branded African Americans that  fight for equality and justice as ``Black Identity Extremists'' that  pose a domestic threat to police officers.

So seeing the emergence of what is effectively COINTELPRO 2.0 is not  only alarming it is frightening.   Just listen to how the FBI describes young men and women who take a  stand for justice.   According to the FBI:   ``Black Identity Extremist (BIE) perceptions of police brutality  against African Americans'' has been responsible for ``an increase in  premeditated, retaliatory lethal violence against law enforcement and  will very likely serve as justification for such violence'' in the  future.

Black Identity Extremism is a twisted attempt by arbiters of the alt- right, including President Trump and Jeff Sessions to deflect attention  from the realities of Police brutality and white supremacy.   That is why members of the Congressional Black Caucus are here this  evening. To sound the alarm.   This is not just another revelation or press report that should be  dismissed.   This kind of hateful stigmatization presents a serious threat to the  African American community. This is not mere speculation, Mr. Speaker.   If we're honest about the history of our nation, we must admit that  the FBI has a disturbing history of surveillance and intimidation of  African Americans for political expediency.   I remember all too clearly the lives that were cut short during the  civil rights movement through the highly coordinated  counterintelligence program known as COINTELPRO.   For 15 years under the direction of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, the  federal government spied on civil rights leaders and sowed division  among African Americans with one express goal.   To ``expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize''  any individual or group deemed to be subversive or a threat to the  established power structure.   Members of the Black Panther Party were the greatest victims of this  vitriolic pursuit.   Under the guise of COINTELPRO FBI agents harassed, intimidated and  committed acts of violence against Black Panthers and their supporters.   Men and women were killed as a result of this program. We simply  cannot allow government sanctioned violence to develop against innocent  African Americans fighting for the perfection of our union.   As the conscience of Congress, members of the Congressional Black  Caucus are determined to stop COINTELPRO 2.0 dead in its tracks.   That is why we are demanding that the FBI give a full account to  Congress on the development of this report and the sources used to  inform it.   It has been said that those who do not know their history are doomed  to repeat.   Well Mr. Speaker, we are here to give the American people and the  Trump Administration a history lesson.   Clearly the FBI has not learned from its mistakes. But I want to be  clear about one thing, under no circumstances will we allow another  generation of African Americans to be subjected to unwarranted  surveillance and harassment.   It will not happen, not on our watch.   Istand with our Chairman Congressman Richmond, Congressman Conyers,  Congressman Thompson and Congressman Cummings in demanding that the FBI  come clean about this report.   Enough is enough.
