 Mr. President, it has been a long time coming, but it is  with enormous pride that I stand to celebrate the passage of the REINS  Act in the House of Representatives today.   This landmark legislation represents a significant step forward  toward reining in the ever-expanding Federal Government. I am immensely  grateful to House Republicans, to the House Freedom Caucus, and to  Representative Kat Cammack, for their unwavering persistence in  championing this desperately needed reform legislation.   The journey of the REINS Act began years ago with profound  recognition that something was fundamentally wrong with our Federal  regulatory system.   We realized the power wielded by these faceless Agencies was  unfolding unchecked, eroding the very foundations of our Republic,  rendering it unaccountable.   The notion that a small group of unelected individuals could impose  far-reaching regulations that affected every aspect of our lives was  itself an affront to the principles upon which this great Nation was  built--certainly, contrary to the rules established and embodied in the  Constitution, which govern the way our government operates.   Year after year, the proponents of regulatory reform within the  Federal system have fought against the odds, facing resistance from  those who have defended the status quo. We knew that the American  people deserved better, that their voices should be heard, and that  their elected representatives should have the final say.   Throughout its evolution, the REINS Act has undergone refinements,  fine-tuning its provisions to maintain the cutting edge, while ensuring  democratic accountability. It is about reining in unchecked power,  bringing spending under the watchful eye of our elected  representatives, and restoring the principles of transparency and  accountability.   The tenets of the REINS Act are rooted in common sense in a way that  every American can grasp. If you understand the concept of no taxation  without representation, then it should be easy to understand the REINS  Act. But what exactly does the REINS Act mean for hard-working  families?   Well, the entrepreneurial spirit runs deep within our country--the  entire country--and certainly within my home State of Utah, driving  economic growth and fostering innovation across various industries.  From tech startups to local artisans, Utahns have a strong inclination  to pursue their passions, start their own businesses, and create  opportunities for themselves, their families, and their communities.   However, this entrepreneurial spirit often faces significant hurdles,  sometimes insurmountable hurdles, due to overregulation by this or that  Federal Agency. It is like the feeling you get when you try to assemble  a new piece of furniture from a certain Swedish retail store, and you  are not quite sure if you have purchased the kejserlig or the plogfara.  Yet you are bombarded with a thousand-page jargon-filled instruction  manual. Federal regulations often feel like those convoluted  instruction manuals, but with much higher stakes, though the titles are  a little easier to pronounce.   The REINS Act seeks to change that. The term ``REINS'' is an acronym  that stands for Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny, and  its purpose is simple: to ensure that unelected bureaucrats cannot  impose major regulations on us without the consent of our elected  representatives.   It is about putting power back into the hands of the people and their  elected representatives, where it rightfully belongs. You see, this  isn't just a good idea. It is a good idea that has been embedded within  the Constitution. The very first operative provision of that document-- article I, section 1, clause 1--makes this clear:         All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a       Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a       Senate and House of Representatives.    The meaning of that is clear and simple: to make law, you have to go  through the Congress. There is no other way to make law. Legislative  powers are powers to make law, and all legislative powers granted in  the Constitution are Federal laws. Therefore, to make a Federal law,  you have to follow the formula prescribed in article I, section 1.   Article I, section 7 explains exactly how that has to happen. You  have the same legislative proposal that has to  [[Page S2104]]  pass the House and the Senate, in identical text, before it can then be  presented to the President for signature, veto, or acquiescence.   The point of this is simple: The power to make law is inherently  dangerous and volatile. It can harm people, just as it can protect  others. For that reason, it is not to be entrusted to any branch of  government other than the branch of government most accountable to the  people at the most regular intervals.   You see, regulatory reform is more than just some esoteric concept  that exists solely within Capitol Hill or in Washington, DC. Its impact  reverberates across our daily lives, affecting everything from the cost  of goods and services to the livelihoods of hard-working individuals  and families.   That is why it is about a whole lot more than just what the  Constitution says and what it should be interpreted and understood to  mean. It is about how this affects individuals and families. By  requiring congressional approval for major regulations, for enactment  of a new major rule or regulation, as if it were a legislative  proposal, rather than just allowing executive branch Agencies to  make new laws themselves, the REINS Act brings accountability and  transparency to the rulemaking process, injecting a much needed and  constitutionally prescribed dose of common sense into our bureaucratic  system.    The REINS Act articulates and imagines a world where small businesses  are free from the weight of onerous regulations, detached from any  common sense, where parents can provide for their children without  being bogged down by unnecessary redtape, and where innovation and  entrepreneurship thrive without the suffocating grip of excessive  government control. That is the world we strive to create with the  passage of the REINS Act.   Now, to be clear, even with the REINS Act, from time to time some  Federal regulations would end up being approved and enacted in the law  by Congress. Congress, after all, can and does make mistakes, but there  is a big difference when Congress makes that mistake. Members of  Congress who vote for that mistake can be held accountable.   Currently, they cannot. In fact, by design, they are insulated from  the process, left only in a position where the best they can do is  write a harshly worded letter, beating their chest, and calling the  people who wrote this or that regulation at this or that Federal Agency  barbarians.   But, after all, our job is not about writing letters. It is about  making law. Insofar as we have got other entities that are not us, run  by people who are not elected by voters in our State or in any State,  that is a problem, and it is a problem that we have to fix.   Today, we celebrate this victory--this victory for freedom, for  common sense, and for the hard-working families who deserve a  government that serves, not stifles them. We owe an immense debt of  gratitude to the House of Representatives and, in particular, to the  House Republicans who voted for this, specifically, most notably, the  Members of the House Freedom Caucus for their tireless efforts in  pushing this legislation forward, reminding us all that persistence and  unwavering dedication can yield remarkable results.   I stand before you humbled and honored to witness this historic  moment. Together, we can continue to fight for this needed reform, not  just as an abstract concept, not just as something that the  Constitution already requires, but also as a tangible path toward a  brighter, more prosperous future for all Americans.   All Americans benefit from this, but it is especially those Americans  who struggle who will benefit the most from this. You have to remember  that these regulations, when they are put in place, come at a cost.  They are not free.   It has been a few years since anyone has undertaken a comprehensive  effort to estimate the total cost of complying with Federal  regulations. But according to one study that I saw--it has been several  years ago now since this study was produced--they estimated that the  cost, while impossible to calculate in its entirety, was at least $2  trillion. When adding a whole lot of Federal regulations, including  some very costly Federal regulations since that study was done, one can  surmise from that that the cost is now somewhere between $2 trillion  and $3 trillion. This is an enormous sum of money.   Now, let's not deceive ourselves. Let's not minimize this by assuming  that those costs are borne simply by wealthy Americans, by big blue- chip corporations, by someone whom we can imagine in our mind's eye as  a Monopoly game piece wearing a monocle, dressed up like Mr. Peanut.  No, that is not who pays for this. Who pays for this are hard-working  Americans, disproportionately America's poor and middle class, who pay  dearly for this. That 2 or 3 trillion-dollar figure is supported by you  and me and, disproportionately, by those who are near the bottom of the  socioeconomic scale. Those people who are working hard, living paycheck  to paycheck, find that, as a result of these regulations, everything  they buy--from cornflakes to cars, from groceries to gasoline, and  everything in between--becomes more expensive. They also pay for it  through diminished wages and unemployment.   Those are real people who are being harmed by these things. The least  we can do is, before subjecting them to even more regulations that are  going to cost America's poor and middle class even more money, we owe  it to them to have the decency to at least vote on these regulations  before they have to comply, before they have to pay through the nose,  yet again, for more and more products.   Inflation has many causes, but one of the significant ones is  excessive Federal regulation. Those regulations won't go away with the  REINS Act, but when the REINS Act becomes law, we will at least be  doing the American people the basic courtesy of voting on regulations  before they have to comply. It is not too much to ask.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
