 Mr. President, I rise on behalf of the New  Hampshire congressional delegation--Senator Maggie Hassan,  Congresswoman Ann McLane Kuster, and Congressman Chris Pappas--to pay  tribute to Dr. William ``Ed'' Kois, a passionate and caring provider at  the Manchester Veterans Affairs Medical Center, whose life was  tragically cut short in July of this year. Dr. Kois was relentless in  making sure that each patient coming through the hospital doors  received the best medical care possible. He was often described,  especially by the many veterans he served, as the quintessential  ``patient's doctor.''   Dr. Kois began his work at the Manchester VAMC in 2012 after two-and- half decades of private practice in Nashua, NH. He specialized in  physiatry, a branch of medicine devoted to the treatment of medical  conditions affecting the brain, spinal cord, nerves, and joints. His  expertise made him a natural fit for the Manchester VAMC's Spinal Cord  Clinic, and he began to treat many veterans whose mobility and well- being were impacted by spinal cord injury or dysfunction. Dr. Kois  sought to provide a standard of care consistent with the core values of  the Veteran's Administration--integrity, commitment, advocacy, respect,  and excellence--and his own strong moral compass.   This fierce devotion to his principles compelled Dr. Kois to lead a  team of 11 whistleblowers alleging inadequate care at the Manchester  VAMC. Although soft-spoken among friends and colleagues, he became a  powerful voice and a public face in the effort to expose substandard  treatment and demand better care for America's veterans. The advocacy  of Dr. Kois and his colleagues caught the attention of the Boston Globe  Spotlight investigative team, which published a story in July 2017 that  directed public attention to the shortcomings at the Manchester VAMC.  It prompted a top-to-bottom review that delivered needed changes and  improvements at the site.   As with any whistleblower complaint, Dr. Kois undertook significant  risk in bringing these subjects to light. Yet, with an uncompromising  spirit that many attribute to his amateur boxer father, he was willing  to sacrifice his livelihood if it meant that veterans would receive the  care they need and deserve. And he was eager to sit down with hospital  administration and work with them to develop policies that fulfill that  promise. His efforts benefited countless men and women in the Granite  State and across the country.   Dr. Kois is survived by his wife of 29 years, Pamela Greenley, as  well as many loving family members, treasured colleagues, and cherished  friends. Ms. Greenley will be on hand next week to accept the First  Amendment Award on her husband's behalf from the Nackey S. Loeb School  of Communications. This distinction honors Granite Staters who go  above-and-beyond in their use of the freedoms guaranteed by the First  Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. We join the Loeb School, as well as  the Boston Globe Spotlight team, in saluting the work and the life of a  deserving recipient, Dr. William ``Ed'' Kois.                            ____________________
