 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1200, and I ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, the appropriations bills that we are now  considering appropriate a total of $280 billion--$280 billion--in  taxpayer money--money that will be used by Agencies ranging from the  Department of Veterans Affairs to Transportation and Agriculture.   This amendment does something very simple. Whatever other  disagreements we may have about the spending in these bills, surely we  can agree that this money ought to go to Americans and American  companies and our allies. So all this amendment does is it  [[Page S5245]]  says that none of the money we are appropriating can go to China. It  can't go to Chinese companies or companies that are owned and  controlled by China. That is it. It is simple: no American taxpayer  dollars to the People's Republic of China.   This should be an easy vote. I urge a ``yes'' vote.    Mr. President, how much time is remaining?    I would just say, Mr. President, do we want to be buying  school lunches from China? Do we want to be buying pharmaceuticals from  China and be dependent on them? I think not. Let's bring these  resources to the United States of America. Let's fund Americans and  American companies.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1200    I ask for the yeas and nays.
