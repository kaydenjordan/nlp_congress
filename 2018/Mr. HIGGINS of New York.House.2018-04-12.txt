 Mr. Speaker, House Republicans recently  voted to add $2.5 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.  That is more debt in the shortest period of time by any one political  party, the  [[Page H3159]]  Republican Party, in American history. Their debt will exceed the  entire American economy in 10 years.   The moral horror of passing this debt on to your kids and grandkids  now belongs to you. You own it and they owe it.   To now offer a balanced budget amendment is transparently cowardly  and egregious. Congress does not need a constitutional amendment to do  its job honorably. The Constitution already gives Congress that  authority. What is missing is the intestinal fortitude to do that which  the Constitution calls on you to do honorably.                            ____________________
