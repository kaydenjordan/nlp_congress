 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  H.R. 2382, the USPS Fairness Act, which passed today with large  bipartisan and union support. I was proud to lead this bill with my  friends and colleagues, Chairman Peter DeFazio and Representatives  Brian Fitzpatrick and   Tom Reed.   The USPS Fairness Act will repeal the mandate for the United States  Postal Service to prefund future retiree health benefits. No other  government agency or private business is plagued with a mandate like  this. Since 2006, the prefunding mandate has wreaked havoc on USPS's  finances, costing the agency $5.4 billion each year.   I represent one of the most rural districts in the Nation, and in  southern New Mexico, post offices and postal workers are an integral  part of our communities, connecting businesses to customers, pharmacies  to patients, and families to friends spread across our vast country.   Congress created this prefunding crisis, so I am pleased the House of  Representatives took the first step to solve it. I ask that the Senate  take the next step with us.                            ____________________
