 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 2018  Idaho Hometown Hero Medalists.   Idahoans who are extraordinarily dedicated to hard work, self- improvement, and community service are honored each year since 2011  with the Idaho Hometown Hero Medal. Drs. Fahim and Naeem Rahim  established this award to recognize outstanding Idahoans working for  the betterment of our communities.   Ten Idahoans were selected to receive the award this year. They were  honored at a celebration themed Lighting the Future, for those who are  inspiring and leading the way for a better tomorrow.
