 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak to  three amendments that I have either submitted or plan to submit on the  matter before the Senate here today, the repeal and hopefully complete  replacement of ObamaCare.   There are two issues that concern me the most and that I have fought  for and debated.   In this process, how can we bring down gross premium levels that have  skyrocketed under ObamaCare? According to HHS, on a national average,  premiums have increased 105 percent. They have more than doubled. And  of course it is far worse than that in many places.   Janice Fenniman was a 62-year-old woman when I met her a couple of  years ago. Prior to ObamaCare, she was paying $276 per month. In 2016,  just 2 years into the implementation of ObamaCare, she was paying $786  per month. Last time I talked to her, she would be paying over $900 a  month, but the problem is, she can't afford it, so she is just taking a  risk and going uninsured until she reaches the age of 65 and is  qualified for Medicare.   The other issue I want to speak about is literally the unsustainable  nature of Medicaid. The other thing I fought for is reducing the  disparity between States that have expanded Medicaid and those that  haven't, like Wisconsin, that have done a great job managing Medicaid.  My concern is that Medicaid expansion, which is directed toward able- bodied, working-age, childless adults, is funded by the Federal  Government 90 to 100 percent, depending on which year you are looking  at, versus traditional Medicaid targeted toward--40 percent of Medicaid  spending is targeted toward children, the disabled, and the elderly.  Medicaid expansion is putting at risk the sustainability of traditional  Medicaid. So my three amendments deal with those issues, and let me  first take up the first two amendments dealing with premiums.    I have a few charts. Unfortunately, in Washington, DC, there is not a  whole lot of people who understand the problem-solving process. Let me  describe it briefly.   It starts with information. It starts with defining the problem,  doing a root cause analysis, having the courage to recognize and  acknowledge the truth in reality. Based on that reality, you try to set  achievable goals. From my standpoint, the achievable goals should be to  bring down gross premium levels back to a reasonable level where they  were prior to the implementation of this completely faulty architecture  of ObamaCare and preserving and sustaining traditional Medicaid.   This chart, I realize, is a little busy, but let me walk you through  it. This shows the trend line of ObamaCare, in terms of what we have  experienced from 2010 to 2017, plus the estimates of the Congressional  Budget Office as it relates to the Senate bill we voted on yesterday.   Let's take a look at this. Back in 2010 to 2013, you see the trend  line here. In 2013, on the national average, an individual is paying  about $232 per month for healthcare. Now had that trend line just  continued, had we not passed this faulty architecture of ObamaCare, we  could reasonably expect that in about 10 years, premiums for an  individual being about $303 per month.   What has happened--again, according to HHS--those premiums have gone  [[Page S4249]]  from $232 per month to this year $476 per month on a nationwide  average. That is a 105-percent increase.   One of the problems with CBO scoring is it is difficult to interpret.  What I tried to do for my colleagues is put in chart form exactly what  CBO is saying. In their scoring of the Senate bill, they said next year  premiums would be 20 percent above the current baseline. Of course,  they don't give you the baseline, and they don't really give you the  premiums so I had to try to cobble those together. This is pretty  accurate. That would put premiums next year at about $546 versus $232  about 4 years ago. The following year it would be 10 percent above the  baseline. So it would start decreasing with the Senate bill, and the  third year would be 30 percent below baseline. You would see a dramatic  drop. You would be at $441 per month. Then the trend over the next 7 or  8 years would be 20 percent below the baseline, $574.   Take a look at this. Had we never passed ObamaCare, premiums should  be in the $300-a-month level versus $574. This is the damage done by  ObamaCare, and this, I am very sad to report, is not what we are  adequately addressing because we do not have the courage to do the root  cause analysis and be honest with the American public about what is  happening.   Let me read you a dictation from the family I just heard from  yesterday. Sheri and Vern Kolby, whom we heard about from one of our  State legislators who contacted one of my regional directors. He sent  me an email telling me their story.   I called Sheri last night. She didn't have time. She was just off her  shift. Her husband is working way more than 40 hours a week--basically,  that is 60 hours a week. The people whom President Clinton was talking  about, people busting it, working 60 hours a week, their premiums have  doubled and their coverage has been cut in half. So my staff reached  out, and we basically dictated her story, her and her husband Vern's  story.   This is not her letter to me but her voice based on what was told to  me by my staff. This is Sheri Kolby from River Falls, WI.         My husband and I have preexisting conditions. We need       affordable healthcare through ObamaCare or whatever works.       Vern is a milkman now, driving a tank to farms to pick up       milk, and there are only seven employees at his company which       doesn't provide coverage. I am a florist. Now, I am the only       full-time employee so they don't have health coverage at my       work either. We signed up for ObamaCare in 2014 for the       entire 12-month period.        We went on healthcare.gov, but the site crashed, so we had       to call a phone number which was jammed. Finally, I got hold       of someone and got through an hour and a half of       questionnaires. Then you get information in the mail about       what your premium will be and your subsidy, and you make your       monthly payment.        We were getting monthly letters telling us we had to fax in       our pay stubs to make sure we were still qualifying for the       subsidized premiums. We did that every month, but then next       March, when we filed our taxes, that is when my tax preparer       said, ``You better sit down. Not only did you pay your       premium, but they want your subsidy back.'' That was about       $15,000.        We were earning too much to qualify for the subsidies, even       though we held blue-collar jobs. If we stayed on ObamaCare,       we would have to pay the entire premium unsubsidized. In       2015, we made $59,000 and ended paying almost $30,000 for       premiums and deductibles. That was 51 percent of our income.        In covering our deductibles and our out-of-pocket costs, we       used up almost all of our 401(k)s. It just multiplied and       multiplied. When a huge amount of money was due the IRS, we       decided we had to sell our house.    Sheri and Vern Kolby had to sell their house so it wouldn't be taken  away in foreclosure because of Obama's skyrocketing premiums.         Now we can only get a 3-month plan. That is all that is       available. Private catastrophic plans are few and far       between.    And I will add, parenthetically, also way overpriced because of the  faulty architecture of ObamaCare.         There aren't a lot of companies that offer plans in Pierce       County. We are kind of in a funnel and that funnel keeps       narrowing. In May, I went back to healthcare.gov, but       coverage would have cost $1,200 per month, about $14,400 per       year in premiums for a policy with a $14,000 deductible. If       you made $200,000, you could pay that, but we are not even       close to that. We usually fluctuate between $50,000 and       $60,000. We are blue collar. We pay our bills on time, we       respect people, and we want to live a good life, and we       have just been dumped on. It has got to stop.        It may come to a point where we might not have insurance,       but we will just end up owing the hospital if something else       happens. My husband works 60 to 70 hours a week, and I work       30. We drive a `98 Wrangler. We are not running around in a       Ferrari. We don't spend money beyond our means. We don't take       trips to Tahiti, and we are not trying to swindle the system,       but it has been a very stressful experience.        We have been married 28 years, and we have stayed together       through so much, but we are not old enough to even think       about retirement for a long time so I don't know what we will       do.    These are the forgotten men and women of this healthcare debate--the  people who are busting it, who don't get subsidized, who can't afford  insurance coverage because of the faulty architecture of ObamaCare, and  we are not courageous or honest enough to really address it.   We did get from HHS a study that they commissioned and they had the  results in May.   I would like to put up my next chart here.   Basically, what they did is they studied the cause, and I have the  study right here. Basically this is the question they are asking: What  portion of the increase in premiums is attributable to the effects of  guaranteed issue and community rating?   Now I realize those are very popular elements of ObamaCare. The  problem is, they cause premiums to skyrocket. That last graph--way  above what they would have been without that architecture--pricing  people out of the market, forcing American taxpayers to pay far more in  subsidies than we otherwise would have to do or would be necessary had  we never passed ObamaCare.   Well, here is the result of their study. They studied four States:  Georgia, Ohio, Tennessee, and I can't remember the last one, but I am  going to focus on Tennessee.   What this graph shows--I realize it is kind of hard to see--but in  Tennessee, between 2013 and 2017, premiums increased $327 per month,  from $104 per month to $431 a month for a 41-year-old male. That is a  threefold increase, 314 percent. What caused it, 73 to 76 percent was  increased risk. Again, increased risk is basically defined as the  guaranteed issue covering preexisting conditions and community rating-- things that are popular but again that cause premiums to double and in  Janice Fenniman's case, more than tripled.   One thing I want to point out about that, when you hear that talking  point, premiums that double and triple, look at the inverse of that. If  we could roll back the clock, go back 4 years, premiums would be one- half to one-third of what they are today. People would be able to  afford coverage, and the American taxpayer would be supporting those  whom we want to support with a whole lot less dollars.   Now, the good news, if we were honest, if we were courageous, and if  we actually addressed the root cause analysis, which has been done,  which we have largely ignored, the good news is, you can actually cover  people with high costs and preexisting conditions without collapsing  insurance markets. They are called high-risk pools or, in the case of  Maine, invisible high-risk pools. The people in it don't even realize  they are in it, but it has worked phenomenally well.   Maine passed guaranteed issues, and just like they did under  ObamaCare, guaranteed issues caused premiums to skyrocket. You can see  the premium rate from their old Anthem HealthChoice plan back in 2011.  Once they supplanted--they didn't even repeal the guaranteed issue, but  they just supplanted this with an invisible high-risk pool--their  premiums were cut in half. This is doable. It is possible, but it is  only possible if we take a look at best practice, if we are willing to  have the courage to admit exactly what is causing the problem.   I have two amendments designed to address the increase in premiums.  First--and I realize this will probably not even be voted on--would be  a simple one-sentence amendment that would repeal all of ObamaCare, not  partial repeal, not just two-thirds repeal but repeal that would  concentrate on removing all of those market reforms. I would call them  market distortions that cause premiums to skyrocket, that cause people  like Sheri and Vern Kolby to lose their house. That is my first  amendment.  [[Page S4250]]    The second amendment really relates to exactly what ObamaCare was  originally designed to do, which was put Members of Congress in the  exact same position of people like Sheri and Vern Kolby.   Back in July of 2009, November 18, as this was being debated in the  HELP and the Finance Committee, Senators Coburn and Grassley introduced  language to those bills that would make Members of Congress have to  purchase their health insurance plans on any kind of program or the  State-based exchanges, whatever was passed under the Democrats'  healthcare plan.   On December 24, 2009, the Senate passed the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act, an Orwellian-named bill that did neither, that had  Senator Coburn's basic language from the HELP Committee that was going  to require Members of Congress to purchase their coverage through the  exchanges. What was interesting is, it did not include an employer  contribution. Those were barred.   On March 24, after the House had passed their version of the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Healthcare Education  Reconciliation Act, Senator Grassley again offered an amendment to  allow an employer contribution to Members of Congress and their staffs'  healthcare plans. That amendment was defeated with 56 Democratic  Senators defeating it. Three Democratic Senators voted for it, and  every Republican Senator voted for it, allowing the Federal  contribution. So Congress specifically said in the Patient Protection  and Affordable Care Act, Members of Congress and their staffs must  purchase their healthcare through the State exchanges, and they cannot  obtain an employer contribution for those plans.   Let's fast forward to October 2, 2013. Members of Congress and their  staff panicked. They went running to the Obama White House and said:  You have to fix this. We know what we passed. We know what the law  says, but we have to weasel our way around this--and they did. So the  Office of Personnel Management issued a rule, first of all, that  Congress was a small business that could purchase their insurance on a  shop exchange which required a small business, which is defined in the  law as less than 100 employees--I just want you to know that Congress  has about 11,000 employees. There is no way this Congress is a small  employer, but that was the technique that they were able to work their  way around this law. So right now Members of Congress and staffs are  the only Americans who get the special treatment of being able to  purchase insurance on ObamaCare exchanges and get an employer  contribution.   Millions of Americans did lose their insurance because of ObamaCare.  They had to purchase the overpriced insurance policies out of the  exchanges, but they have no access to employer contributions. So my  second amendment would put only Members of Congress--I don't think we  should penalize our staff--but I want to put Members of Congress in the  exact same position as Sheri and Vern and thousands and maybe tens of  thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of Americans who  are making too much, busting it, working 60 hours a week. Their  premiums have doubled, sometimes tripled. Coverage is cut in half, and  they can't afford it. They are taking a risk. Congress is still  advantaged because we are making more than $59,000. We are making  $174,000.   The reason I am offering this amendment--I know it will not be  popular--is that the only way Congress will have the courage to act is  if they are affected every bit as much as the American public. I urge  all of my colleagues to be honest, to be courageous, and to make sure  they do not exempt themselves from the pain, from the harm, from the  damage of ObamaCare, so that they will commit themselves to actually  fixing this problem.   Those are my first two amendments that have to do with premiums. I  urge my colleagues to support them. I think that they are good  amendments and are worthy of support.   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 minutes remaining.    Mr. President, let me move on to my second point.   Again, I come from a State whose Governor showed real courage in  recognizing that traditional Medicaid was unsustainable and was in  trouble. The last thing we really should be doing to an unsustainable  entitlement program is to throw more promises on top of that and make  it even more unsustainable. I think it is extremely important that we  recognize that Medicaid expansion is directed toward able-bodied,  childless, working-age adults. That is, again, funded at a much higher  level by the Federal Government, at 90 to 100 percent, versus  traditional Medicaid, which is really targeted to those we want to  help--children. Forty percent of traditional Medicaid goes toward  children, the disabled, and the elderly.   My next amendment is designed to try and make traditional Medicaid  more sustainable, not by pulling the rug out from anyone but simply by  limiting further enrollment and allowing Medicaid expansion to phase  out based on attrition. Let me show you a couple of facts, because we  hear an awful lot of demagoguery. We hear an awful lot of  scaremongering. I hear it in Wisconsin, as people who are on  traditional Medicaid and who are largely unaffected by this bill other  than in the out years are scared that their traditional Medicaid is  going to be taken away from them.   Here are the facts. Back in 2008, the Federal Government spent about  $200 billion on traditional Medicaid. With the implementation of  ObamaCare, we began increasing that pretty dramatically with Medicaid  expansion. Over the next decade or so, we will spend close to $90  billion per year, on average, on Medicaid expansion--again, targeted  toward able-bodied, working-age, childless adults. This was the former  trend line, and this is the current trend line for traditional  Medicaid.   Now, you hear about all of this slashing of Medicaid. Here is the  current baseline. This is what the Senate bill would have done to  traditional Medicaid and to Medicaid expansion. Yes, you can see some  relatively significant cuts to Medicaid expansion, but to traditional  Medicaid, you see, really, not all that much--about $164 billion over  10 years.   My amendment would say, without pulling the rug out from anyone:  Let's end further enrollment in Medicaid expansion, and as that program  phases out through attrition, let's devote the money that we save to  traditional Medicaid--supporting and sustaining the elderly, children,  and the disabled.   This is what happens to traditional Medicaid under my amendment.  First of all, this is what happens under the Senate bill. You do not  see any year in which Medicaid is actually cut. It is always rising. We  boost it a little bit further and do not increase the deficit by any  more, under the Senate bill, by doing that.   My last point is this, and then I will move on and yield the floor.  This is what I am talking about in terms of dollars. Under current law,  traditional Medicaid will spend $4 trillion over the next decade and  Medicaid expansion almost $1 trillion, for a total of $5 trillion  spending. Under the Senate bill that was originally proposed, original  Medicaid would have been cut by about $164 billion, which is still  close to $4 trillion, and Medicaid expansion, obviously, would have  been reduced by a fair amount.   Under what I call my sustainability amendment, traditional Medicaid  would actually increase in spending slightly and not harm anybody--not  children, not the disabled, not the elderly. Obviously, with Medicaid  expansion, just by allowing it to phase out through attrition--not  pulling the rug out from anyone--in the end, you would be spending the  same amount on the Senate bill. From my standpoint, I think that we  preserve and sustain Medicaid.   Again, I urge my colleagues to support all three of my amendments. I  hope to get a vote. If not a vote, I hope that they are considered if  this thing goes to a House-Senate conference.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.
