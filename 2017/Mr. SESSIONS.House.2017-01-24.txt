 Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from  Wyoming not only for being on the Committee on Rules, but also today  for handling her first rule. Welcome to Congress and welcome to the  Committee on Rules.   Madam Speaker, the bill that we have before us today is an extension  of, really, a bipartisan agreement that we have had for 30-plus years:  that we should not have abortions that are paid for by the taxpayer.  The bottom line is  [[Page H627]]  that this is a very difficult issue, no matter which side you might be  on; but I believe that the right thing to do is to say that, based upon  the morality and, really, the right thing, that the Federal Government,  the taxpayers, should not be engaged in paying for abortions, killing  of babies in this country.   We believe it is morally wrong, and all we are simply doing today is  standing up and saying we are going to extend the same privileges that  we have had on a bipartisan basis for 30-plus years not only with the  Hyde amendment, but placing that across all pieces, parts of  appropriations and bills and things that we do here in Congress. This  has absolutely nothing to do with taking away a woman's right to  choose. It has nothing to do with dealing with the Supreme Court. It  has everything to do with using taxpayer dollars.   Yesterday we had a very appropriate and a very timely conversation at  the Committee on Rules, and I think both sides handled their arguments  and their agreements and disagreements well. It is my hope that we do  this here today.   But let me say this, that the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith)  came up as an advocate for women, as an advocate for women who are  engaged in the scurrilous trading of women and misconduct with women. I  think he was seen for what he is. He is a strong advocate for life and  for women who need to feel safe in this country. He stood up yesterday  as an advocate for saying we should not use taxpayer money to pay for  abortions, and that is really what this bill is.   I thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming for allowing me to be here.    Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise in support of describing to  each of my colleagues some important attributes of a big issue that we  are all working on, and that is about health care. I rise today to talk  about not just the current state of health care, but also a direction  about where this body has an opportunity and a chance to go to make  America's healthcare system even better so that it is the greatest  healthcare system in the world.   President Obama signed what is known as ObamaCare, the Affordable  Care Act, into law on March 23, 2010. This was an attempt then by the  President and his party, receiving no votes from the Republicans in the  House or the Senate, to offer a brand-new vision to the American people  of their idea of health care.   It took several years for the American people really to comprehend  and understand this undertaking, but we are now in the sixth year of  ObamaCare, and it has turned out that it not only is not sustainable,  but it has provided millions of people who have lost coverage, higher  premiums. It is not uncommon to see where some healthcare providers are  raising their rates by 60 percent, and in 2013 alone, 4.7 million  Americans had their preferred healthcare system canceled.   So the plan began with the high accolades of President Obama and  Democrats, only to see, in its sixth year, it has become a concrete  life preserver to many who are not only on the plan, but those who  would wish to have their own healthcare coverage and cannot because of  this law.   Tonight what I would like to describe to my colleagues is a chance  for them to begin understanding that the American people have elected  Donald J. Trump, Republicans, back into the majority, and Republicans  back again into the majority in the United States Senate. This was done  because there were a number of ideas that were made well aware to the  voting public that Republicans would have an answer not only to repeal,  but to replace the Affordable Care Act.   Republicans, in fact, now that we are in our second or third week of  being in the majority, with President Trump taking office last Friday,  Republicans have begun working not only with themselves, but with this  administration on ideas that will make the replacement of ObamaCare  even better for each and every person in this country.   The ability to make this transition, I believe, will require a  deliberate and disciplined approach by Members of Congress and the  American people for us to listen to each other, for, you see,  Republicans do have better ideas to fix health care for all Americans.  The basis of the understanding about where Republicans will come from,  I believe, is embodied in the law as it exists today.   In 1943, employer-sponsored insurance exemption was given. It was  during World War II. It was at a time when there were wages that were  frozen but opportunities for benefits to be given to employees that  would not be taxed. And so back in 1942, this benefits system arose.  Sure, it became an opportunity as a result of being employed. It became  an employer benefit. And that is what has taken place today with about  150 million Americans who receive the benefits of pretax contributions  not only by their employer, but also by the employee to their  healthcare system.   Well, just last December, under the 21st Century Cures Act, Congress  made a new change, updating, allowing more  [[Page H676]]  people in the system, this time small business, allowing small business  the opportunity to deduct up to $4,500 per employee, a chance for them  to receive their health care on a pretax basis.   What this has established now is a different, unfair system that Mr.  Trump was speaking about when he was on the campaign trail. He referred  to it as a rigged system. Now, he was not just speaking about the  healthcare system. He actually was speaking about much of the way  America operates, systems that are not fair for the average American  not only to have a shot at making their life better, but in this case,  a healthcare system where about 150 million Americans get their health  care on a pretax basis and others do not. This is the basis of where I  believe Republicans have an opportunity to help make the tax advantage  for all Americans available.   So the question is: Who is insured and who is uninsured? Well, we can  go to the chart that we see here. About 49 percent of all the people in  this country who are insured, health care would be provided by an  employer, meaning that an employer most likely is able to offer, as a  benefit, a healthcare package on a pretax basis, and the employee is  able to receive that, allowing them to make their own contributions on  a pretax basis.   As an example, as a Member of Congress, I have this opportunity. My  employer, being in the House of Representatives, provides about 70  percent, which is standard for the operations of almost any business in  this country, 70 percent, and the employee would provide 30 percent. In  this case, I provide the premiums of about $13,000 for my health care.   Then I have a $3,600 deduction under my ObamaCare health insurance  that I receive. I am required by law, as a result of being a Member of  Congress, to receive, to buy into health care that would be ObamaCare,  and then I have a $3,600 deductible that is a pretax contribution. So I  make about a $17,000 contribution to my health care every year. Not  unusual for employer-provided contributions on a pretax basis.   Medicaid is about 20 percent of all the people who are insured, and  then, as you see here, Medicare is about 14 percent.   As you look at Medicaid, Medicaid is what is commonly known as  insurance for those people who are at or below the poverty level to  gain coverage. But it comes with strict requirements. Many of those  requirements work against the opportunity to go and get a job for fear  that they will lose their contribution that comes from the government  because they might not have an opportunity to receive other help.    Then, as you see, we have got exchanges, and those that just buy  their own insurance. And then about 9 percent, or about 30 million  Americans, are uninsured.   This is the current status of where we are in America today.   When I say these things to people back in Dallas, Texas, I receive a  lot of feedback, and one of them that I have selected comes from a man  who is self-employed. He falls under the what might be off exchange,  meaning he pays for his own health care without it being on a pretax  basis. He said: I am being penalized for being an entrepreneur-- penalized.   This is true of the 20 percent who are on Medicaid. They are in a  system that essentially keeps them there and keeps them from going to  gain the opportunity to receive full-time employment because it might  not be an employment that provides health care.   So Republicans have a daunting challenge. We have a challenge to  understand that there are about 12 to 20 million people who presently  are on ObamaCare, including Members of Congress, and it is a very  expensive--not only to the country, but also to individuals--insurance  plan.   The biggest problem with ObamaCare is not its expense. The problem is  that people are not on the system, as we were told would happen. We  were told there would be upwards of 40 million people, providing an  opportunity for more people to pay into the system, to sustain the  system, and for it to be, what I would say, structured in such a way to  where it had young people, middle-aged people, and perhaps older people  up to Medicare age who would be paying in or be a part of a system--and  it didn't work that way.   Younger people are not in ObamaCare because it is tremendously  expensive, and they have found that to meet their deductible, it takes  thousands and thousands of dollars. It does not meet their needs. It  does not meet my needs with my family. It would not be a preferred  healthcare choice that I or my family would make.   So we now have a choice, a chance as a result of the American people  saying: Okay, Republicans, let's see what you can do. Bring us your  ideas to make health care better.   Here is one of the facts that we know. We know that of the family  working status of uninsured, 74 percent of people who are uninsured go  to work. Now, this is a staggering fact because we were told by  President Obama and Democrats that they were going to make sure that  people got health care, the working poor, as we were told, people who  needed coverage. But, in fact, 74 percent of 30 million people get up  and go to work.   What we find is that they have lost, many times, their full-time  status because of ObamaCare rules and regulations, mandates on  employers to where employers cut their full-time status to part-time  workers. Because we have so many part-time workers, they cannot afford  to get the payments that are necessary, even though they were above the  Medicaid line.   So Republicans now have a choice to be able to say, if we are going  to outthink ObamaCare, if we are going to make sure that we believe--as  President Trump has said just in the last few weeks and on the trail as  he was running, he believes we should have a system that is not rigged.  We should have a system that helps cover every single American and  creates an opportunity that is sustainable and does not mean that we  have 60 percent or even double-digit increases every year in health  care because of the inequities that exist in the system.                                time  1900    This is the system that exists today.   So what might be one of those options or alternatives?   One of those options or alternatives might be a bill that I have  worked on for 2 years, with over 500 physicians from across this  country, known as the National Physicians' Council for Healthcare  Policy. The National Physicians' Council for Healthcare Policy has  formally met with hundreds of doctors nine times. They are co-chaired  by Dr. Marcy S. Zwelling from Los Angeles, California, and Dr. John T.  Gill from Dallas, Texas.   We have worked diligently with economists also to put together a plan  that matches what President Trump is speaking about, but probably has  not had time to fill in all of the rest of the activities.   This is what I would like to tell you. We believe that we should  first allow every single American to be a part of a pre-tax credit, an  advanceable credit that can be given to every single American to allow  them to buy into a nongovernment healthcare system. That means, yes,  people who are on Medicaid today can receive their health care and go  out and get a job without fear of losing their healthcare coverage. It  means that you no longer would have to go to the Federal Government and  the IRS and to tell them how much work or how much money you think you  will do this next year, and if you guess wrong, to pay differently. It  creates a well-understood system, and can be done for the same amount  of money that is presently in the system today.   It means that a person, a family, would be able to, effective this  next November, go online and go to a database and fill it in. I am from  Dallas, Texas. I would put my name in, I would put my wife's name, our  social security numbers, and our children, and it would allow this pre- tax credit that is advanceable, assignable, and refundable, not coming  to me, but going to a healthcare plan that I could then purchase. I  could co-purchase, I could put my own money in on a pre-tax basis.   But what it would mean to me, Pete Sessions, is that I would be out  of ObamaCare. I would choose to be in what is called a health savings  account, an HSA. A health savings account requires that you have a  major medical component with any coverage that you get.   What is major medical?   Major medical is hospitalization, the chance, the risk that you would  have of  [[Page H677]]  needing hospitalization. It could be a car wreck, it could be cancer,  it could be something really unexpected. But I would then purchase this  major medical policy that is well known in the marketplace today, and  then have a choice of deciding the type of coverage where I would pay  the first $5,000 that is required. And then after that, based upon the  risk that I would choose.   If I were younger, I would choose probably a plan that would be 90/ 10. That means that I would pay 10 percent beyond what happened after I  paid my $5,000. Perhaps I couldn't afford that and would want to move  to a 70/30 where I accept more of the risk.   The other component that I would then choose is a health savings  account. That is I would take the $17,000 that I contribute to my  health care every year, cash, and I would take that to a pre-tax cash  account that would be available for me to go to the doctor. Instead of  showing up with a card, I would shop the doctor that I choose, only  buying the things that I and my family needed, choosing my doctor, and  asking my doctor and the marketplace what services would be available  for a cash price.   Generally speaking, cash prices are about 18 percent less. Because a  doctor would receive that money directly in, rather than having to file  a claim, or wait time to get back their money. It would allow my family  a chance to receive virtually an 18 percent opportunity upfront  savings. It would allow me to manage the things which I needed to and  not worry about paying for the things I didn't use. It would save my  local doctor, who would then look at me as a preferred customer as  opposed to me shopping around, perhaps with others in the marketplace,  based upon a model of ObamaCare, which today you can't always count on  who your doctor would be. A far better idea. Every single American that  would qualify would receive this opportunity, but not required.   Now, how do we make it better, because there is more?   We would, under every single one of these circumstances, take away  the mandate on an individual and the mandate on the business. We would  do away with the Cadillac tax, because I don't think health care should  be taxed. I think everybody should have an opportunity, and the world's  greatest healthcare plan would allow that. Every single person would  have a chance to have their health care provided, just as I have mine,  too.   So what I want to say to the Members today is Republicans are going  to be sharing ideas. We are going to be presenting our ideas at the  Energy and Commerce Committee, at the Ways and Means Committee, and we  believe we have an opportunity under three scenarios to make sure that  health care is available and ready for every single American.   First, we need to establish a Republican alternative that can be  implemented this year. Not waiting. Our better idea is ready in a bill  ready to go.   Would we do hearings? Yes.   Would we want to scrub that and maybe add some things? Yes.   We should be ready to do it and make the transition this year. We  should use reconciliation to repeal the most onerous parts of mandates.  Yes, we should. And I believe we are doing that.   Should we make sure that we replace before we repeal? Absolutely.   And we should allow HHS, under what is today becoming Dr. Tom Price,  a proud Member of this body, a chairman of the Budget Committee, who is  in hearings over in the Senate to be the secretary of Health and Human  Services, he should use everything that is available in law today to  manage a system and to make it better. But my bet is that he will count  on real people, not government, to make these decisions. And in doing  so, he will empower a better opportunity.    So what Republicans want to do is to establish a tax benefit system  while allowing a continuation of an employer-sponsored system. Those  people that are on a system today that is provided by your employer,  that would continue. But we would do away with the mandates on the  individual and the business and the Cadillac tax. And we would  encourage each of these companies to continue that system and work with  their employees on a benefit system to make it better.   We would make HSAs available to every single person, not just Members  of Congress, to where they would have an opportunity to have a system  that would help their health care and their families and not be use it  or lose it. It would make no sense that I would have to spend $43,000 a  year simply to start over next year when I could actually benefit from  saving and being efficient with my money. Maybe I am 30 years old and  want to save for the future. Maybe I am 50 and cannot save, but I would  roll over the system and make it work for me.   It will allow private physicians to endure. And what this does is  empowers the private physician.   But there is more. And that is we will also keep--I believe we  should, and the world's greatest healthcare system would, keep what are  known as consumer protections that today exist in law: dependent  coverage through age 26, no lifetime or annual limits, modified  guaranteed availability and renewability, prohibition on preexisting  condition exclusions, prohibition on discrimination based on your  health status, and nondiscrimination in healthcare coverage.   I would like to tell the Members that back in Dallas, Texas, I am  proud to also represent the disability community. I believe I can look  at every single person back in Dallas, Texas, in the 32nd Congressional  District of Texas, and say this: If you like your health care, you can  keep it. If you like your own doctor, you can keep your own doctor.   But, more importantly, I believe that we will give equal to or better  than opportunities for every single American. We will end the  discriminatory services that ObamaCare is today. Because virtually  every single doctor and virtually every single hospital will begin  taking coverage, where today only about 24 percent of doctors take  ObamaCare because it does not reimburse properly. And hospitals all  over Dallas that do not take ObamaCare, leading edge hospitals in  Dallas, Texas, and across this country, will begin taking this new  health care because it reimburses based upon actual cost and  marketplace availability.   So to my colleagues who want to go back home and talk to their  constituents about Republican ideas, I don't know which one we will end  up with. What I do know is that Senator Bill Cassidy and I have worked  with hundreds of physicians for 2 years, and we have a bill, the  world's greatest healthcare plan. The world's greatest healthcare plan  is a bill that you can understand that is guaranteed to provide people  a better opportunity without guessing about their healthcare coverage,  and it is not use it or lose it.   So it is my hope that my colleagues that saw this this evening and  took part in this will understand that there is an opportunity to go  back home and sell the world's greatest healthcare plan for their  people back home, too.   I thank my colleagues for being here tonight.   I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(2) of rule XI, the  Committee on Rules' rules of procedure for the 115th Congress are  transmitted herewith.
