 Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the people on this floor  and the people watching on television a very simple question. Do you  know if I am carrying the COVID virus?   In fact, do you know if the next person you meet is going to be  carrying the COVID virus?   And the answer is, you don't know, because we cannot see this virus  with our naked eyes. And you don't know how this virus is going to  interact with your body if it comes in contact with you. Don't act like  you do know.   Over 680,000 Americans have died. Millions more have been  hospitalized, and many more are still suffering the effects of long  COVID.   In Matthew 4:7, Jesus said: Do not put the Lord your God to the test.   God created the laws of chemistry and biology. God is not going to  make an exception just for you for this biological virus.   So please be humble, not arrogant, and talk to your doctor about the  best way to protect yourself against this virus.                            ____________________
