 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute before the vote.    Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to give  families across the country the peace of mind and give the hard-working  staff at the FDA the experienced, Senate-confirmed leadership it needs  by joining me in confirming Dr. Califf today and working with him and  FDA to continue protecting families across our country, upholding the  gold standard of safety and effectiveness, and putting science and data  first.   We previously confirmed Dr. Califf in this role in a bipartisan way,  and we recently advanced his nomination out of the HELP Committee with  bipartisan support. So I hope today, once again, this qualified  nomination passes with the bipartisan support it deserves.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     I ask for the yeas and nays.
