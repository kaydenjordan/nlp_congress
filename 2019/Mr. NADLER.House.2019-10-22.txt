 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2426, the Copyright  Alternative in Small-Claims Enforcement Act of 2019, or the CASE Act.   This important bipartisan legislation would establish a voluntary  small claims court within the Copyright Office to hear copyright suits  seeking $30,000 or less in total damages.   Today, many small creators, especially visual artists, are unable to  protect their rights because the cost of pursuing an infringement claim  in Federal court is far greater, as much as 10 times or more than the  damages they could ever hope to receive. Few attorneys would take a  case when such limited damages are at stake because they would not  likely recoup their costs.  [[Page H8353]]    It is a fundamental principle of the American legal system that a  right must have a remedy. But if it costs $250,000 to recover a few  thousand dollars from someone who has infringed your copyright, then  what remedy do you really have?   The CASE Act would provide important protections for the many  independent creators who are currently unable to protect their work in  Federal court. It would establish a small claims board within the  Copyright Office to resolve infringement claims seeking $30,000 or less  in total damages, with claims officers appointed by the Librarian of  Congress.   The proceedings are designed to be less expensive and much easier to  navigate, even without an attorney, than Federal court. And they would  enable parties to represent themselves or to seek pro bono assistance  from law students.   The board would conduct its proceedings entirely by telephone and the  internet, and no one would need to travel to a hearing or a courthouse.   The bill caps damages at no more than $15,000 per work infringed, and  no more than $30,000 total. The board would work with the parties to  settle their claims.   Importantly, the proceedings would be voluntary. Plaintiffs can  decide whether this is the proper forum to file their claim, and  defendants may opt out of the process if they prefer to have their case  heard by a Federal judge.                                time  1615    The sponsor of this legislation, the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Jeffries), has worked tirelessly to ensure that this legislation  includes revisions and suggestions from many Members and stakeholders.  The revisions include various heightened due process protections and  provisions intended to reduce potential abuse of the system, all of  which has made a good bill even better.   For far too long, it has been virtually impossible for small creators  to vindicate their right to a just measure of damages from infringers.  Today we have an opportunity to take an important step in helping  independent photographers, filmmakers, graphic designers, and other  creators to protect their work.   I would like to thank Mr. Jeffries and Ranking Member Collins for  their outstanding leadership on the CASE Act.   I would also like to thank the Copyright Office, which conducted an  exhaustive study on the issue and whose recommendations form the basis  for the bill.   In addition, I appreciate the support of colleagues on both sides of  the aisle, including the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu),  who has introduced similar legislation in previous Congresses and who  has been tireless in her work to protect creators' rights.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
