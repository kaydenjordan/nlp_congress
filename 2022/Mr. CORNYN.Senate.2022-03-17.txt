 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my  remarks before the next vote.    Mr. President, since Vladimir Putin's invasion of  Ukraine, we have all been inspired by the courage and leadership of  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.   As Russian troops invaded and brutally attacked his country,  President  [[Page S1236]]  Zelenskyy did not do as others have done in the past. He didn't run; he  didn't hide; and he didn't give in. President Zelenskyy did what every  leader hopes to have the courage to do in times of crisis: He stood his  ground, spoke out, and rallied the rest of the world to get behind him.   Yesterday, as we all know, Members of Congress had a chance to hear  directly from President Zelenskyy.   First, he expressed his gratitude to the United States for the  support we have provided so far to his country, but he also issued an  urgent plea for more defense articles. He showed us a videotape of  devastating photos and videos coming out of Ukraine, demonstrating what  the Ukrainian people are being subjected to every day by Putin's cruel  and unprovoked war against innocent civilians.   Ukrainian troops need more arms. They need anti-tank capabilities,  and they need additional aircraft. As President Zelenskyy put it, the  destiny of Ukraine is being decided now, as we speak.   I believe we have a moral obligation--not necessarily a treaty  obligation since Ukraine isn't part of NATO, but we have a moral  obligation as the leader of the free world--and I am talking about the  United States as a whole--to support Ukraine and help them defend their  sovereignty and their people.   For example, Poland, a member of NATO, offered to transfer an entire  fleet of MiG-29 fighters to the United States for delivery to Ukraine.  Ukrainian forces already know how to fly those Russian aircraft, and  President Zelenskyy assured us that they are desperately needed, but  the Biden administration rejected the offer out of fear that it might  provoke Mr. Putin or, in terms of war, might escalate the conflict.   Winston Churchill, another great wartime leader, aptly said:         An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will       eat him last.    This cannot be the policy of the United States. We cannot appease  Vladimir Putin, and we can't afford to be timid in the face of the  greatest threat to world peace since World War II.   Here on the Senate floor, several weeks ago, I shared a maxim of  another Russian leader, Vladimir Lenin, the leader of the Soviet Union,  of course, at the time. This is something I would suspect that Mr.  Putin agrees with.   Lenin said:         You probe with bayonets. If you find mush, you push. If you       find steel, you withdraw.    In short, if people like Vladimir Lenin and Vladimir Putin are met  with weakness, they are going to keep coming; if they are met with  strength, they may withdraw.   President Putin clearly subscribes to this world view. He doesn't  respect weakness. In fact, weakness is a provocation; it encourages  him. A weak opponent is Putin's greatest desire. President Biden,  unfortunately, in not acting more forcefully and taking the initiative  as only leaders can do, is playing into his hand.   The Biden administration has time and time again eventually come  around to doing the right thing when it comes to arming the Ukrainians.  Unfortunately, it has only been after there has been a public outcry or  more pressure from Congress or President Zelenskyy.   Last year, President Biden waived sanctions on the Nord Stream 2  Pipeline. This, of course, is a natural gas pipeline that goes from  Russia to Germany. One of the things, even now, the Germans have  recognized is their vulnerability to the monopoly that Russia has when  it comes to providing oil and gas to Europe.   As Russia built up troops on Ukraine's border, President Biden  suggested that some attacks on Ukrainian sovereignty would be ``minor  intrusions'' and perhaps disregarded by the United States, he implied.   President Biden ignored the advice of virtually all of his advisers  and missed the window to impose paralyzing sanctions on Russia before  the invasion, and now the administration continues to refuse to  facilitate the transfer of these Polish fighter jets.   In standard fashion, the administration seems to be a little confused  by this crisis--afraid to say yes and too afraid to say no.   I am reminded of President Obama's statement of ``leading from  behind,'' which appears to be an approach embraced now by President  Biden.   Strong words are important, but they don't defend against rockets or  cruise missiles. Sanctions are important, but they won't take out a  Russian tank. Humanitarian aid is important, but only if it is  delivered on a timely basis and when it is needed. And waiting and  seeing what will develop next and then responding after the fact rather  than anticipating the need is not particularly effective.   As I said, I believe we have a moral obligation to stand with Ukraine  and help its people defend their way of life. We should not be in a  position of telling President Zelenskyy: Yes, you have asked us for  these defensive arms. You have asked us for these airplanes. We are  going to give you just what we think you need.   I don't think that should be our position. We ought to ask President  Zelenskyy what he needs and provide it forthwith.   We want to help Ukraine defeat Russian forces and repel them from  their territory entirely, not just extend the length of this terrible  war. The most effective way to do that is to supply Ukraine with the  assets they need as quickly as possible.   To start with, the Biden administration should reevaluate its  decision to reject Poland's aircraft offer. These airplanes are needed  for Ukraine to maintain air superiority over Russian forces, and they  need them now and not at some distant date in the future. And we need  to continue to find ways to put American weaponry into the hands of  Ukrainian soldiers.   Back in World War II, the United States was known as the arsenal of  democracy. Again, in a bill that I have introduced called the Ukraine  Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act, we can do that again. I am proud to  have worked with a group of bipartisan Senators, including Senators  Cardin, Wicker, and Shaheen, to produce this legislation.   This legislation authorizes the President to enter into lend-lease  agreements like we did in World War II, which probably saved Britain  from domination by Nazi Germany. We can do this again by providing  Ukrainian forces with the weapons they need to defend their country.   This legislation was included in various packages designed to support  Ukraine, but, unfortunately, those packages never made their way to the  Senate floor.   There is broad bipartisan support for this lend-lease provision, and  it will give the United States the ability to send the exact type of  military support Ukraine needs without a lot of redtape or unnecessary  delays.   Our support for Ukraine is not a provocation for Putin. It is a  necessary show of strength, and it is a deterrence.   As we search for additional ways to support Ukraine, it was great to  hear from President Zelenskyy. As I said earlier, his bravery and  leadership have galvanized the world and have inspired all of us to  take action. And I hope his plea for additional aid will persuade  President Biden to act with even greater dispatch.   This weekend, I will be traveling with a number of our colleagues to  Poland to visit our friends and allies on the ground and to see for  ourselves the sort of humanitarian crisis that Putin's invasion of  Ukraine has created.   Poland, to its credit, has welcomed thousands of refugees--hundreds  of thousands--and continues to deal with the Russian aggression along  its borders.   I look forward to this opportunity to visit both Poland and Germany  and learning more from our partners in Europe and eager to bring back  their input to the Senate for further urgent action.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
